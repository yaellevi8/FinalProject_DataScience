1,A Question for Moderate Republicans,politics," I have been voting for a very long time. Sometimes democrats won and sometimes republicans won. The issues that we voted on then were simple. Republicans voted for fiscal responsibility and lower taxes and democrats voted to improve social conditions for their own families and for the families of all Americans at risk.  Both parties were sincere in their opinions about what was best for the country. America’s strength was about working on compromises to find the best solution that both parties could agree on. Recently the Republican Party has changed. It is now about gaining power and putting into effect their own values and their own opinions on all issues by any means that they can, even when a majority of the voters may not agree with them. Many long-time republicans and also recent moderate republicans are becoming concerned about the direction their party is taking.  Moderate republicans love our democracy just as democrats and independents do, and don’t want to lose the rights we have all fought so hard to win for all of our citizens. They don't really want to vote for the authoritarian leaders their party is backing. They don’t like the campaign of hate and disinformation that their party is using to win at any cost. The question now for more moderate republicans in our country is what will they do with their vote in the coming elections? Moderate republicans are now faced with a difficult decision. If they don’t feel that they can vote either republican or democratic then their only option would be not to vote at all in the next few elections until their party again becomes the strong and valued party that they have always loved and remembered from the past. Will moderate Republicans choose to do the right thing that they feel will save our democracy or will they do the expedient thing and vote with a party that they know is on a wrong and dangerous path? That is the challenging question that many moderate republicans are asking themselves now? The answer to that difficult question has yet to be determined."
2,Fake News,politics," Fake News We hear a great deal these days about misinformation, disinformation, and fake news.  It is leading some people to question the first amendment guarantee on freedom of expression.  This is understandable; after all, it’s only a small step from hate crimes to hate speech.  The above mentioned terms are difficult to define, however, I can think of some concrete historical examples which may give us some insight into understanding the larger concepts.  Let’s start with Ukraine in the 1930’s. Upton Sinclair, a famous progressive writer in the early part of the 20th Century, visited Russia in the 1920’s.  Upon his return to the United States, he stated, “I have seen the future, and it works.”  Sinclair may have been honestly duped, but Walter Duranty knew better.  Duranty was a writer for the famed New York Times who was sent to Russia in 1922 and stayed until 1936.  What we knew about what was happening in Russia during those years, we got from Duranty.  First, let’s take a look at a few facts.  There was a massive famine in the early 1930’s, mainly in Ukraine but also in Russia itself.  There is general agreement that the horrors were brought on by the policies of communist dictator Joseph Stalin.  Three to four million died of starvation in Ukraine and two to three million in Russia.  It was so bad in Ukraine that cannibalism was a common occurrence.  According to the reporting of Duranty, everything was fine.  He absolutely denied there was any problem whatsoever.  His articles, more or less, maintained that there is nothing to see here.  To make matter worse, he heaped scorn on another reporter who had directly witnessed what was taking place.  To add insult to injury, Duranty received a Pulitzer Prize in 1932 during the height of the famine. Herbert Matthews, another Times reporter, did a Duranty imitation of his own in 1957 when he interviewed guerilla leader Fidel Castro of Cuba.  In his article Matthews portrayed Castro in the best possible light.  He said Castro had a massive army, the majority of the people were on his side, and he was not a communist.  He went so far as to say that Castro was actually an anti-Communist.  After Castro took over Cuba in 1959, Matthews continued to proclaim the noncommunist nature of the new government.  He was still holding to this position into 1960 when Castro himself put an end to the nonsense by coming out of the closet and declaring himself a proud communist. Many people alive today remember the energy crisis of the 1970’s.  It was a time of gas shortages, long lines at the pump, and surging prices.  To conserve energy President Nixon instituted day light savings time the year around (it only lasted one year) and set the speed limit at 55.  President Carter told Americans to shiver in the winter and sweat profusely in the summer.  Looking back, it seems fairly obvious that the problem was instability in the Middle East and government control over the price of oil.  However, we were told by the government, the media, and academia that the world was running out of oil.  I personally bought in to this line of reasoning; it seemed entirely logical.  Demand for oil across the board was through the roof, and there is a limited amount of fossil fuel.  I remember a conversation I had with a friend during the 70’s in which I stated that oil was running out.  She said, “There’s plenty of oil!”  I thought she sounded ignorant, but I was the one who was uninformed.  It’s been almost 50 since that conversation, and we still have plenty of oil.  Regardless of how one feels about climate change and other related issues regarding fossil fuels, we were not running out of oil in the 1970’s. George W. Bush, for whatever reason, was determined to get rid of Saddam Hussein in 2003.  At first the government through Vice President Dick Cheney tried to tie Hussein to Al Qaeda.  That didn’t work; there was simply no evidence.  Then, they fell back on weapons of mass destruction.  Bush and the CIA claimed that Iraq had chemical weapons and was pursuing a nuclear capability.  The intellectual community was convinced, and the rest is history.  There was no investigative reporting on the part of the media as they bought the argument hook, line, and sinker.  Of course, it was all a lie.  The only thing relating to weapons of mass destruction the U. S. Army found when it invaded Iraq was a mobile lab which contained a few high school type solutions and materials. There is and always has been an abundance of fake news.  It’s the public’s job to sort things out, and it usually can.  We most always say, “Hey that sounds silly.”  The problem comes in when the fake news is supported by the media and the government.  When that happens, it can have catastrophic consequences."
3,Politics at Trinity High School,politics," Politics at Trinity High School Those who know me realize I am a very conservative person politically.  When I attended a teacher In-Service after being hired by Trinity High School in 1985 at age 39, I realized I was entering a liberal environment.  A couple of my new colleagues were talking about how horrible the South African government was.  Shortly afterwards in teacher conferences, the principal (Sr. Stephanie Warren) subjected us to some women’s liberation theories.  Some revolved around spouse abuse and how it was caused by a patriarchal society.  Others concerned language and its sexist nature.  I talked to my dad about these developments, and he advised me to go about my job and keep my mouth shut.  Since I needed the job, I decided to take his advice. In looking back, Sr. Stephanie was in many ways ahead of her time.  In 1985, most of her beliefs were considered off the rails; now, they are the norm.  She was also very much an advocate of the nuclear freeze movement.  The year before, when she was just a teacher, she went to the Trinity Board and asked it to take a stand on this issue.  Tom Isbill, one of the Board members, told her to come back when the Soviet Union no longer posed a threat. Anthony Scola was the assistant principal at Trinity.  Anthony was what one might call an old hippie with an effeminate personality and a keen sense of humor.  He was also an intellectual type who could be very aggressive.  You didn’t want to disagree with Anthony; he could cut you down to size in no time flat.  He was a former priest who in his younger years had opposed the war in Vietnam.  Eventually he left the priesthood and the Catholic Church altogether.  He married a former nun (Margaret) who also left the church, and they both became Quakers.  The simple and pacifist lifestyle of the Brotherhood appealed to their sense of right and wrong. Margaret taught at St. Mary’s, one of the grade schools connected to Trinity.  She was also an old hippie who supposedly went so far as refusing to shave her legs or under her arms.  Originally the Scolas were from Milwaukee, but they wanted to get away from the fast paced urban life.  When they were hired to teach at Trinity and St. Mary’s in Whitesville, Kentucky; the town was too big for them so they settled in Deanefield, a smaller community to the southeast.  Whitesville contains about 600 people while Deanefield has less than 100. I discovered there was a divide between the administrators and clergy of Trinity on the one hand and the parents and students on the others.  In 1988 the Evansville Bosse basketball team, mostly Black, traveled to face a mostly White Heritage Hills team.  There had been a history of bad blood between the two schools.  On their journey, the Bosse team noticed burning crosses along the side of the highway.  Sr. Stephanie and some of her fellow sisters who taught at Trinity expressed horror over the situation.  Later I overheard some Trinity parents laughing and hee-hawing about the same incident. Sr. Stephanie left Trinity after four years as principal.  Despite my disagreement with her ideology, I had no problem with her as a person or a superior.  She gave me a job when I needed one, promoted me to athletic director after just one year, and always treated me with respect.  Several times she went to bat for me in disciplinary and personality clash situations.  Her replacement was Dan Fuller, a well traveled school administrator who came to Trinity from Florida.  At first glance he appeared to be more of the same.  In a document he submitted to the Board explaining his philosophy, he used feminine pronouns to refer to non-gender antecedents. Dan was a unique individual.  The students loved him and he commanded their respect.  They called him ‘Dan the Man.’  From an academic standpoint, he and W. A. Franklin (an Ohio County assistant principal) were the most scholarly and well read administrators with whom I have ever been associated.  However, he gave the students an inordinate amount of freedom, and after one year the teachers were a bit upset.  On her principal evaluation form, one teacher included the statement, “Less ‘Dan the Man’ and more Mr. Fuller.”  Some concerned teachers led by Anthony Scola and Sr. Lorraine Lauter (a religion instructor) tried to have Dan fired.  When the attempt failed, Anthony took a one year sabbatical at the University of Kentucky in order to work on a degree in Spanish. During Dan’s first year, Sr. Dianna Ortiz (a friend of Sr. Lorraine) claimed she was kidnapped, tortured, and raped by America’s allies in Guatemala.  Sr. Lorraine arranged for the school to have a special assembly to address the issue.  She turned the assembly into an America bashing session in which United States foreign policy was depicted as evil and sinister.  I sat in the back, and as the negativity toward the United States became intense, I shook my head in disbelief and disgust.  At one point I looked over at Dan who was sitting across from me, and he was cracking up with laughter at my response.  I interpreted this as meaning I had a friend and ally.  It turned out that I was correct because next year he promoted me to dean of students. Margaret Scola, Anthony’s wife, got involved in a running debate with a grade school colleague over the Gulf War of 1991.  She said we needed to give sanctions more time before going to war.  Jamie Clark, her colleague, challenged her by saying, “I can’t think of a worse way to die than starving.”  When Anthony returned from his sabbatical, Dan saddled him with the worst possible classes; they were chock full of troublemakers.  Anthony challenged the scheduling, but the Board upheld Dan.  A few years later, Anthony and Margaret resigned to become African missionaries.  They were stationed in Sudan, and I feared for their safety.  Nothing bad happened; however, as they both attended a Trinity graduation in the mid-90’s.  Also leaving were Sr. Lorraine and Sr. Theresa Henry (another liberation theology advocate).  With these departures, liberalism at Trinity pretty much ceased to exist. Shortly after his third year began, Dan himself resigned to take a principal’s position in Maine.  As chief disciplinarian I basically had the run of the school for the remainder of the year.  Another teacher (Katie Williams) was appointed interim principal, but she gave me the freedom to operate as I saw fit.  In 1992 John Calhoun was hired as principal.  He was a Ross Perot type of conservative, and we were off to the races. There was a bit of backsliding in 2000 when Mike Clark became principal.  Even though Mike was liberal, he did not make a point of advancing a political agenda.  However, one of his hires as a religion teacher did.  One day I noticed a document in my mailbox which was full of propaganda about how military spending was ruining America.  When I complained to the secretary about such items being placed in our personal spaces, she told me it was done by Bob Nicodemus, the religion instructor.  I then confronted Bob, and we became involved in a ferocious argument.  He defended the propaganda and his actions by comparing it to sending a Christmas card.  The argument went on and on, and we ended up yelling at each other.  Anyway, Bob left after one year, and Mike was gone as principal after two.  Afterwards, we returned to normal. It is appropriate in light of current tendencies that I end with a story about the national anthem.  In 1992 Trinity’s girls’ basketball team was playing in a Christmas Tournament at Brescia University.  As athletic director I was always looking to schedule our teams in such tournaments.  Barry McArdle, a public relations and recruitment specialist at Brescia, organized the event; and we played in it for a couple of years.  Shortly before our first game in the 1992 tournament, Barry came to me and said they would not be playing the national anthem.  Instead, a Brescia student would sing “God Bless America.”  He said, “After all, Larry, the national anthem glorifies violence.”  He then asked if what they were doing was okay with me.  I simply responded, “It’s your tournament!”  A short time later, a young Brescia student came to the scorers’ table visibly upset.  She said Mr. McArdle had just ordered her to sing both “God Bless America” and the national anthem even though she had not practiced the “Star Spangled Banner.”  This was probably my most satisfying point in the political wars at Trinity High School."
4,How Zelensky left Mariupol Ukraine open for Russia to come in?,politics," Ukrainian President Zelensky did not protect the citizens of Mariupol from an attack by Russia. The small city has been utterly destroyed, there is nothing left, the footage coming in from the city is absolutely horrific, it is hard to imagine how quickly it was ruined. Why was the city not protected, why were the citizens and local officials in Mariupol so unprepared for Russia to take swift control of the city in Ukraine? The answer is clear, the Ukrainians have a weak leader. Russia made it clear that Mariupol was a crown jewel to them as it is the link of 80% of the trade from Crimea, yet Zelensky was asleep. Zelensky media star The Western media has made President Zelensky a star, he is a social media hero in the United States, who help spread his fame. Zelensky gave the Americans what they love, Hollywood one-liners that spread quick popularity. One of the more memorable lines from the Ukrainian president was with the Russians at his door, when asked by Americans if he needed a plane to flee the country Zelensky answered “I don’t need a ride I need weapons”. With that one-liner Americans decided to turn Zelensky into a star, yet his military skills are less than zero. The Ukrainian president is a former actor who is perfect for the role he is playing for America, yet his act did nothing for the poor citizens of Mariupol. In the defense of Russia, they asked many times for the Ukrainians to lay down weapons so no one would get hurt, yet their pleas fell on deaf ears. Canadian Broadcast Communications visited Mariupol just one week before the Russians entered the country, what they were surprised to find was a city well at ease with no preparations for any attack by Russia. As the citizens were interviewed, it was clear that there was absolutely no urgency. The local hospitals were not preparing for any causalities, the shops were open, and most residents did not believe any Russians were coming into the area. Despite a massive buildup of Russian troops at the entrance to Mariupol the thinking was that nothing was going to happen.  Why were the citizens so at ease? It is because local officials made no preparations for an invasion, Zelensky completely ignored the city, while waiting for Americans to recuse Ukrainians if things got very bad. What made matters worse was the Ukrainian present taunting the Russians with statements of bravery, at one-point Zelensky dared the Russians to come take Mariupol, saying “you will see our faces not our backs”. Zelensky has one plan, and that was to beg America and NATO for money and weapons, the Russians have absolutely destroyed the city, just this week the mayor of Mariupol estimated the loss of citizen life at an extremely large number. The mayor said Monday that the siege has left more than 10,000 civilians dead, their corpses “carpeted through the streets.” Mayor Vadym Boychenko said the death toll in Mariupol alone could surpass 20,000 and gave new details of allegations by Ukrainian officials that Russian forces have brought mobile cremation equipment to dispose of the corpses. Why didn’t Zelensky prepare the good citizens of Mariupol for Russian troops entering the city? He was confident that America would bail him out, yet he failed the citizens of that small city."
5,Explaining Civil Litigation,politics," Lawyers can build their careers across various fields, from family lawyers to corporate attornies. One common field of practice is civil litigation. Civil litigation attorneys work with cases with no criminal charges or penalties. Instead, civil litigation attorneys work with various kinds of non-criminal legal disputes in which plaintiffs are looking for some sort of compensation or damages. Read on to learn more about what it means to work as a civil litigator! What Kinds of Cases Do Litigators Handle? As mentioned above, civil litigators handle non-criminal legal disputes. This encompasses many different kinds of cases, so most lawyers working in civil litigation have just a couple of areas of expertise. Civil litigation cases might include landlord and tenant disputes, personal injury claims, intellectual property disputes, medical malpractice claims, education law disputes, and more. Unlike in criminal cases, where the prosecution has to present evidence that proves their case beyond a reasonable doubt, civil litigation trials only require convincing evidence. What Skills Do Litigators Need? Civil litigation requires similar skills as other areas of law. Litigators need to have extensive knowledge of local and federal laws related to their area of practice, strong communication skills, negotiation skills, and more. Negotiation can be critical in litigation cases. Many litigation cases never go to trial, so negotiating terms to resolve the issue outside of the courtroom is a crucial skill. What Are the Steps to a Litigation Case? When a client hires a litigator for their case, the case goes through a particular process, just as in any legal procedure. When a potential client wants to pursue civil litigation against another party, their first step is to meet with a litigation attorney to discuss the case. The attorney will help explain the process and evaluate whether or not the client has a strong case. From there, if the client decides to proceed with the case, the attorney will do extensive research to build evidence. This will be followed by both involved parties filing pleadings, essentially explaining their sides of the issue. Once the court has received both pleadings, the case will enter the discovery stage. This is essentially an extension of the research phase, including witness interviews and fact gathering for each side to build their case. The discovery stage usually takes the most time. Once discovery is complete, the case enters pre-trial, which is the last step for many cases. In pre-trial, the attorneys for both the plaintiff and defendant begin negotiations, trying to reach an acceptable settlement outside of court. If an agreement cannot be reached, the trial will go to court, and a judge will decide the matter."
6,There is a problem with Ukraine,politics," There is a problem with Ukraine There is something going on in Ukraine which is just not as it appears.  Sophistication, complexity, and intrigue are the three best words to describe this beleaguered country.  To begin, there are essentially four main forces that are driving events in the nation.  They all compete with one another and have different agendas but have been drawn together to present a united front. First and foremost are foreign NGO’s and American foreign policy operatives.  Their goal is to make Ukraine a liberal democracy that will eventually achieve integration into NATO and the European Union.  These people are extremely efficient, and they have outflanked their opponents both in Ukraine and the outside world.  They effectively brought about two Revolutions, the Orange (2005) and the Maidan (2014).  At this point in time, they have established the narrative which a vast majority of the American public accept as fact. A few examples are worth noting.  Victoria Nuland was the State Department employee tasked with the overall implementation of American’s Ukraine policy.  During the Maidan Revolution, she was caught on tape organizing a new government and arranging who would be placed in key positions.  Most on the ideological spectrum agree that corruption in Ukraine has been a persistent problem.  Marie Yovanovitch, U. S. Ambassador to Ukraine from 2016-19, told Ukrainian officials who they could and could not investigate for corruption.  Vice President Joe Biden was the point man for Ukraine in the Obama Administration.  He threatened to withhold one billion dollars in aid if Ukraine did not fire a prosecutor who was investigating certain entities.  One important target under investigation was Burisma, a company that employed Biden’s son.  Alexander Vindman was a U. S. military and intelligence figure active in Ukraine.  He was so involved in security arrangements in the country that he was offered a leadership position in its armed forces. Since 2015 the government of Ukraine has been controlled by those who believe in liberal democracy.  They make up force number two and are totally dependent on the first force in order to win support from the outside world.  They’re not much different from the political elites in the United States which is to say they believe in democracy and Capitalism.  They maintain the absolute sovereignty of the people to decide their own fate irrespective of their big and powerful neighbor (Russia), and they make no concessions on territorial integrity.  All this would be fine if the country were in Western Europe, had a historically unified populous and culture, or a border that had a centuries old definition. Force number three is the oligarchs.  This group is made up of wealthy businessmen who, of course, have close ties to the first two.  Their economic power gives them leverage over the political process.  In the United States we call them billionaires.  Like Donald Trump before he was President, they have to hedge their bets by supporting those in positions of political power or those likely to be at some point.  Much of the corruption that is prevalent in Ukraine revolves around the oligarchs.  Because of their intricate connections in the government and among foreign operatives, it is difficult for the legal system to do much about their power, influence, and corruption. The fourth force is made up of fascists or Nazis.  It makes up the shock troops for the other groups.  During the Maidan Revolution, they carried the day by organizing protests, demonstrations, and violence.  They have a military force called the Azov battalion.  The battalion began as a private militia but was later incorporated into the Ukrainian army.  They are the ones who have been on the front lines in fierce fighting against Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine.  It has been reported, I might add, that they have received military training from the United States.  A political party was organized by their leaders after 2015, but it received little to no support from the electorate. One might ask why the fascists would support liberal democracy.  Don’t they have more in common with Moscow than Kiev?  The answer is they can only exist in a democracy.  While democratic leaders deplore their ideology, they allow them to continue for three reasons:  they are beholden to them for support given during the Maidan Revolution, they depend on them to do the heavy fighting in Eastern Ukraine, and the ideal of democracy that all beliefs, however toxic, have the right to be expressed.  This third reason goes back to Voltaire, the great French philosopher, who stated that tolerance extends to those who believe in intolerance.  Putin, on the other hand, would have no tolerance for the Azov adherents.  He would purge them to the last man, and they know it. So what does all this have to do with American politics?  Well, actually, quite a lot!  In 2016 Donald Trump ran for President and began voicing skepticism about America fighting needless and endless wars abroad.  For Ukraine this did not look good.  To make matters worse, he hired Paul Manafort as his campaign director.  Manafort had previously worked in Ukraine as a campaign advisor for the President who was deposed in the Maidan Revolution.  At this point, Alexandra Chalupa enters the story.  Chalupa is the daughter of Ukrainian-American immigrants.  She is referred to by Wikipedia as a pro-Ukrainian activist and has worked at various times for the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign.  She made it her goal to expose Manafort and thus paint the Trump campaign as a tool of Putin and Russia.  In her effort to do this, she worked with the Ukrainian government, the American Embassy in Ukraine, and allies in the United States Congress.  The project achieved some success as Manafort was fired from the Trump campaign when his Ukrainian contacts were publicly revealed. During the 2016 Presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee’s computer and the emails of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign director, were hacked.  The contents were posted on various news sites including Wikileaks where it gained a widespread audience.  Needless to say, the material was very embarrassing to party leaders, the mainstream media, and Hillary.  Contrary to popular belief, the Committee’s computer server was not turned over to the FBI to determine the origin of the hack.  It was instead analyzed by CrowdStrike, a private cyber security firm.  Crowdstrike, not the intelligence agencies of the U. S. government, concluded that Russia was responsible for the hack. A co-founder and chief officer of CrowdStrike was Dmitri Alperovitch.  Alperovitch is a Russian who came to the United States in 1994 and later became an American citizen.  He has an intense dislike of Vladimir Putin and is a member of the Atlantic Council, a foreign policy think tank and one of the NGO’s referred to in an earlier paragraph.  The Council makes no secret of its intent to promote liberal democracy in Ukraine and make the country a full fledged member of NATO.  One of the Ukrainian oligarchs is a significant donor to the Atlantic Council as is CrowdStrike. As is common knowledge, President Trump’s first impeachment revolved around Ukraine.  Alexander Vindman, Marie Yavonavitch and many career state department employees became star witnesses for the prosecution.  They thought Trump was blackmailing Ukraine into investigating Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son who was heavily invested in Burisma (a Ukrainian energy company), and also CrowdStrike.  Trump had apparently bought into the idea promoted by many conservatives that the Democratic server had been relocated to Ukraine.  Putin may have lent credence to this idea as he supposedly told Trump that Ukraine was behind the theories advanced in the Steele Dossier that Russia was actively involved in helping Trump in the campaign of 2016. It is worth noting that Ukraine did start an investigation of Hunter Biden and Burisma after Trump was acquitted of the impeachment charges by the Senate.  After Joe Biden was elected President, however, the inquiry was dropped.  I guess this could all be justified as hedging your bets. Ukraine is now involved in a vicious war with Russia.  Ukraine may be the underdog in this fight, but it has many forces at its disposal.  The Ukrainian army is roughly equal in size to the invading Russian force, it has received drones from the West, the Trump and Biden Administrations have provided it with javelins (anti-tank weapons) and stinger missiles (anti-aircraft weapons), and its forces have received advanced military training from the West.  Whatever one may think about the two countries and its leaders, it is clear that Ukraine has important friends in high places and has decisively won the propaganda battle in the United States.  Public opinion more or less paints Ukraine as saintly and Russia as demonic.  The only other times I have seen such unanimity of opinion were after the Kennedy assassination, during the Watergate scandal, and following the events of 9/11.  And yet, I maintain based on the information presented in this article that there is a problem with Ukraine!"
7,Cyberwar History and Ukraine,politics," People are much more drawn to images of blown-up building, fires, mushroom clouds, refugees in dire circumstances, color pictures of pain that are better in black and white than they are to explanations of code or even fallout from code if it’s not resulting in something blown-up, fiery, or pictures of people in pain that are better in black and white. That is to say, while we see plenty of stories of ransomware, temporary business disruptions, and credit card & ID fraud, it’s not visceral. It goes by quickly on the page and in our minds. So, whatever happened to the stories we saw before the cyberattack age? When the US Cybercommand was  just a twinkle in some geeky eyes? What happened to the discussion that cyberattacks would engender kinetic responses? Bombs not electrons. Perhaps it was a sense of proportion. Perhaps it was a recognition that we consider that an increasing cyberwar, if responded to with bullets, might just result in use seeing those images of things that would be better in black and white on our own doorstep? Did we back off, or did sanity take hold in the minds of the planners? Let’s look at a little history. Back in 2003, a cyberattack originating from China - and christened, “Titan Rain,” by the US - managed to get access to loads of sensitive government information by compromising the systems of US government contractors and of government systems themselves. Only unclassified information was stolen, but the world woke up to this kind of attack. In 2004, the Joint Chiefs of Staff declared cyberspace an important domain of conflict alongside the air, land, sea, and space domains. No doubt, this was prompted by the reality of Titan Rain. As a culture, we were just starting to think about these things on a national level. In 2007, Estonia experienced a broad cyberattack that included their parliament, banks, and media. It was believed to have originated from Russia, or from Russian actors. NATO’s response was to create the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) in 2007. Now, continents were beginning to wake to the threat and the need to do something about it. The Tailinn Manual The CCDCOE began to develop an extensive study and code about what how international law applies to cyber conflicts and cyberwarfare; these previous acts were beginning to be recognized as acts of war. Calling on legal scholars and legal practitioners that were experienced in cyber issues, the CCDCOE produced Tailinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare in 2012. The Tailinn Manual declared that killing hackers in response to certain cyberattacks was justifiable. Killing hackers?! Meanwhile, other state-sponsored cyberattacks marched their way into the public consciousness. The Stuxnet Worm was developed to sabotage Iran’s nuclear development efforts – in particular, the centrifuges used to enrich uranium gas. It is believed to be the first malware designed to and succeeding in visiting physical destruction on physical equipment. Wired Magazine called it the first digital weapon. It's widely considered that the US and Israel collaborated over a period of 5 years to develop this malware. In 2009, Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, recognizing how important AND vulnerable important computers and networks were (are), directed the creation of USCYBERCOM. It is the unified command for the cyberspace domain in the US and the world. In 2016, the organization described the 2016 espionage ops against the Democratic National Committee while in the midst of a national election “serious business . . . [that] may destroy democracy.” Administration officials at the time considered that cyber weapons were so potentially destructive that they should be unleashed only on the direct orders of the Commander in Chief, like nuclear weapons. I do not know if there is an equivalent “Cyber Football.” Article 51 of the UN Charter allows individual countries to defend themselves and to band together to defend each other. It also allows the same if an armed attack is anticipated and recognizes the right to use force in such a situation. It allows cyberattacks to be considered an armed attack. In 2019, Israel did just this, by conducing airstrikes on a building that they said had Hamas members inside that were planning to launch a cyberattack on Israel. In 2021 the topic was up for noticeable public discussion again. NATO heads of state and government met at NATO’s North Atlantic Council meeting in Brussels and issued a communiqué that ultimately equates cyberattacks with kinetic attacks and leaves the possibility of military action against hackers on the table. Still, what we generally see is that cyberattacks - or anticipated cyberattacks - by states are dealt with by preemptive and after-the-fact punishing cyberattacks. Tit for tat, as it were, and even before the tat. Cyberwar in Action What we have seen in practice in Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014 and in Ukraine in 2021 is the “softening up” cyberattack. The attack used to diminish and disable defensive and living systems before a kinetic attack, rather than a kinetic attack in response to a cyberattack. Many said that the 2014-2015 cyberattacks were on a an entirely different – and grander – level than had been seen previously. Several Ukrainian banks and government agencies became inaccessible and malware – using a tool called “HermeticWiper” - was wiping data from hundreds of PCs and servers. But we’ve gotten used to common DDOS attacks, data-wiping and ransomware in recent years on the civilian level. It’s kind of taken for granted that these things are ongoing and all over. The use of cyberwar and kinetic war together has been labeled “hybrid warfare.” And yet, the world seems surprised that Russian cyberattacks on Ukraine in 2021 and 2022have been substantially less severe than anticipated. To be sure, they were and are ongoingly widespread. Hackers caused the Viasat satellites to become inoperative. But that may have affected Russian soldiers and commanders to lose connectivity as well. And said attack has been mitigated somewhat by the Musk’s activation of Starlink Internet satellites over Ukraine. Additionally, Ukrainian modems were zombie-fied by Russian malware, being used as nodes for targeted DDOD attacks within Ukraine. But the ruination from malware that was expected has not really seemed to occur. We haven't seen a cyber-Armageddon. Were they more pr? Were the US and/or the EU pumping up Ukraine’s cyber defenses or attacking the offensive cyber capabilities of Russia? The newspapers wonder about this and government sources overtly express surprise and confusion that there isn’t more cyber damage. I would be willing to wager that they know more about this than they are letting on. But then, isn’t that almost always the case? The coming days and weeks will tell us more about cyberwar in Ukraine. It’s possible that all-out disruption of Ukraine’s Internet will come to pass. We hope not. But one thing about this history stands out. We have not seen the kinetic response to cyberattacks on a wide scale that was being discussed a decade ago. Luck? Cooler heads? Invisible cyber counterattacks? Thoughts of a Cyber version the Mutually Assured Destruction doctrine that has, in theory, kept the world from launching nuclear war? Or is physical destruction on a massive scale enough to satisfy those bent on domination? These times we’re living in will surely shape the times we will be living in. Let us hope and work for that cyberwar doesn’t exceed the malign effects we have seen to date and that going forward we see fewer dire images because of fewer dire circumstances"
8,We Have Met the Enemy and He Is Us,politics," Cartoonist Walt Kelly modified and changed Commodore Perry’s famous quote to, “We have met the enemy and he is us” in a cartoon he created in 1970 celebrating the first Earth Day in 1970. The message being that man from his treatment of the earth is the planet’s enemy. It may also be true that the greatest enemy of democracy is not our corrupt leaders, but that a large part of our country’s citizens do not love or understand what democracy really means. If they do not love or want a free press that allows opposition and differences of opinion to flourish, then they do not love or want democracy. If legislators take away the rights of any minority and hamper free elections and the ability for every eligible citizen to easily cast a vote, then they do not love democracy. If school boards take books out of libraries as Texas is doing, because they consider the books too disturbing or controversial, then they are going down the path of the book burnings that happened in Nazi Germany and they do not love or want democracy.  Instead of democracy they want only their own opinions and their own laws to prevail and flourish and are willing to vote for leaders who will give them what they want. But leaders who willingly lie and bend the laws to obtain power eventually take away not only the rights of the minorities they oppose, but also ultimately take away all their citizens rights as we have seen in other countries that have become authoritarian and have lost their democracy. In the United States we are  on a dangerous road toward losing our freedom. If in the next few elections the people vote for leaders with selfish and corrupt motives and authoritarian tendencies, then the voters will ultimately be responsible for giving away their precious freedom and once you give away your freedom, it is very difficult and perhaps impossible to ever get it back. In a Democracy everyone has a voice and is worthy of respect. Poor people, rich people, minorities and majorities and people of different religions and different ethnicities. If a voter does not believe in that, then they do not love democracy. That is the dilemma that the voters in America will soon be facing in the coming elections in 2022 and 2024. How many voters still love democracy and are willing to vote for and support leaders who will protect it? The future of our country and the future and well-being of our children and all future generations are now in the hands of all of us who are voters—an awesome and frightening responsibility. We must now all work and fight to protect our ability to vote. We must fight for the ""For the People act of 2021"" that will help to protect every citizen’s right to vote. We must all make an effort to get the information we need from many different reliable sources so we can become wise and informed voters and ultimately cast our vote for leaders who will always protect our democracy and the rule of law and keep it forever strong and safe. Democracy needs every voter now as it has never before needed all of us to work and fight for its very survival."
9,Cowardice of Culture for Collusive Consensus - 1,politics," Cowardice in a culture of sameness, contrived by the lameness of intellectual regression, portends the recession that harkens the end by collusive and contrived consensus. For a viewpoint arguing contrary to the herded powers of mainstream dominion, the pretended collective for the greater good intends the folly of the American Dream. As the fading echo of poetic expressions once claimed, to rebel against much and be subservient to little as possible, wiser fragments of time gather dust and lose their shine. In cowardly times, the poorly disciplined attributes of historical references, psyche portals erupted from quiet intentions to disrupt the mainstream for onslaught of heroic adventures. Yet, the more powerful elites, the oligarchies and their minions among the political aristocracies, in shadowy realms foment the collusions of herded submission. Where militant tyrannies and terroristic theologies are less cumbersome, ideologies pervade the senses with more subtle seductions. Cowardly, a culture falters to the arrogance of ignorance. In a 21st century post-modern context, ripe with the incestuous urgings of global electronics, and associated techno-wizardry, a more profound delineation of cowardice is found. Subtle, behind the scenes, cunning linguistics, and sleight of hand memes, foolhardy notions absent credibility argue the sad defect of a mainstream gone increasingly more stupid. Well-groomed, laced to the hilt, bound to the silk, the smoothed skin arrogance of self perpetrates treacheries with purposeful stealth. For the cowards of modern times, the laptop, the cell-phone, the swipe of masked digital selfiness ejaculates the egregious fallacies of fraudulent spew. As to a coward, there are diverse representations. From an attempt at etymology, the unfolding human ecology represents admonition of centuries long past. On a simplistic spectrum, perhaps even a basic primordial range, cowardly ways are that which shuns the courage to meet a threat, a danger or a delicate probing adventure. Modernistic perspectives find cowardice more broadly applied. Using the bully as one possible example, the weakling has changed. Bullies are cowards, but their disguises are more cunning and deceptive. Of tormenters, intimidators and oppressors, their intimidation tactics and techniques are diverse. Here, reference is not the generic movie making blather of backing away from an actually physical fist fight. Instead, it is of a deeper moral sense of individuality versus maladaptive status quo consensus. The standard issue usual template of the bully versus the victim in physical confrontation devolves to a more sinister reality. Cowardice has become more covert and deceptive, so much so, the average person will miss it. While it does not take extraordinary effort to be smarter than the average, beyond thinking and acting at an 8th grade middle school level, most will fear the sacrifice of intellectual betterment. Regardless, cowards come in all sizes, dimensions and expressions of selfishness. From academia to government, from corporate intrigues to mass marketing consumptive gluttony, pontificating gurus of “celebrity worship” conspire to spoof their adherents. with the shortcomings of their wadded superficiality, the haughtiness of infantile narcissism respects no boundaries. For a moment pause, that suggests the origins of such dissonance as to the characterizations. From an Anglo-French to an Italian derivation, the word dissects toward a derogatory reference of a “tail” of something. In a metaphoric sense, as may be associated with the alimentary canal and the expulsion of excremental wastes, verbiage likely refers to “tucking the tail between the legs”. Or, could apply to the expressiveness of suggesting “turning tail and running”. Regardless, such descriptors take on divergent perspectives in contemporary application. With more fascinating reference, an Old-English manifestation is that of the “cow-herd”. Or, also a “pulpit”, by which an appeal to authority castigates or otherwise discourages dissent, controversy, challenge, debate and argumentation. Other historic and philosophical distinctions suggest fearfulness related to a spiritual, physical and psychic sense of individuality. But, suffice it to say more fun can be postulated by the playfulness offered in use of “cow-herd”, or maybe a cow in a herd. In no way does the mention here reflect negatively upon hard working agriculture interests in any way. Rather, the suggestion is toward those of a fraudulent and deceitful nature. Wonderful metaphorical ascriptions can unfold in a jesting manner. This could be particularly satirical in application to politicians and political processes where hypocrisy and untruthfulness roam freely. As to that point, the modern coward resents truthfulness, facts and rationality over the expanse of logical analyses. One writer calls it the fear of honesty. In one article from a blog about politics and society, the author lists a number of malevolent characteristics of the modern coward. Distressed that others might disagree with him or her, and that some will argue with authentic credibility, the scaredy-cat is terrified his or her “world of fiction” will be exposed for the fraud that it is. The psycho-physical weakling elevates his or her fantasies to pretentious and unrealistic expectations for self-gratification. Intentionally insulating the selfiness against the harsh realities of the real world, social media along with mainstream media ignorance reinforce nebulous notions in emotional reactivity. While lying is not particularly creative, as savvy inquisitors easily observe, the coward relies on herded collusions. The cowardly come through loud and clear for the astute observer. In a mass-marketing culture, where everything is for sale and everything can be justified, the insidious and incessant promotion for gluttonous consumption is everywhere. In an expression of contemporary philosophical inclination, reflecting what one researcher lamented, that a lifetime of ease invites softness and weakness for the senses to please. From that, words come to mind. Soft, weak, timid, emotional and cowed. There is that reflection to the “cow-herd”, which infers intimidation, browbeaten, scared, and bullied. As such, from a vast profit-making corporate monstrosity of infotainment industry, the proliferation of scare mongering is good for business. Superficial, shallow, dishonest and deleterious to social ascendancy, the poisonous spew of bloated conjecture admonishes the independence and individuality of courageous creativity. So easily, the fear mongering colluded to the success of promoting weakness and perpetual subservience. For the dark ages of modern times, the culture of cowardice reaches to every aspect of socio-economic interactivity. As a “herd animal”, a variety of historic philosophers accused western cultures as becoming intellectually malnourished, lazy, eager to please pretentious authorities, socially enslaved and uncreative. In rebellion to the malaise of fat and foolish complacency, a few valiant ones assert their liberation toward creative individuation. Heroic and passionate as to craft and vocation, their genius is found in their exceptionality to herded conformity. Again, as to the exhibition of their uninhibited personification, the brave ones reside in a niche of smaller contrast to the overwhelming tyranny of the massive mainstream. Quiet, courteous, humble and innovatively diligent, they are in stark contrast to the ostentatious selfiness of the crowd. There is singular and potent expression in their aloof anonymity. Building a “higher self”, theirs is not one of constantly reinforced of communal validation. Transformation is essential. For a brevity of life chances, the cost of being human, the vast majority mirror the sentiments of past historians who assert the selfishness of the majority. Shunned conceptually and physically, many reject the nobility of individuality, separation from “cow-herd”, and solitude of ingenuity. Among the human chattel of grazing idleness, the adventurous spirited sensuality of the mature ones is frightening. As children in adult bodies cower in confrontation with such noble individuality, social media flows with deception, hypocrisy and deadly animosity. As such, the proliferation of malevolent recriminations unfolds with divisive context. Among the sluggish and contemptable, the incompetent and the impotent, societal degradation prefers the cowardice of immaturity in collective consensus. Timidity finds refuge in greater numbers. Run, hide, and cringe, fear the mysteries lurking on the fringe. As a person enslaves himself or herself, or whatever self, around him or her others enslave themselves. In the surrounding collective, and attention is paid to that word, the status quo consensus is typically contrived by those more influential and manipulated for selfish interests. Astute investigators pay attention to key words. For the aggregated many, the group, the crowd, etc., the collusion is in the collectivism of the motivational factors. In the activism of power and control, the centrality of interaction aims to ensure a lesser role for individuality and identity and dominance of the collective. The hive, the group, and all the associated consensus building, diminishes the role of the individual and stifle imaginative creativity. Freedom, liberation of the senses, visionary creativity flourishes when the nature of individuation roams willfully free. Yet, constraints manifest in diverse ways through interaction within a multiplicity of institutional frameworks. Unfortunately, and to the detriment of social processes, including free expression of ideas in various artistic forms, the social mainstream fears singular differentiation. Instead, for most one size fits all, one template for everything and one equation explains the simplicity of complexity. Among the worst offenders for the “free expression thereof…” comes from the corporate monstrosities of infotainment. Politicians are easy, they fall in line quickly given the ease by which they salacious gratify their egoistic ambitions. Pundits, politicians, proselytes of collective contrivances enjoy the smug piety of their immaturity. Habituated to the collective conformity of pretentious normality, the vast majority of the populace relishes in the complacency of dulled expectations. In reference to one writer’s admonishment of contemporary society, the majority sips the bitter venom of servitude in small doses over time. Cowardice is easily embraced. One researcher, writing about the “pussification of America”, cites with fascination the characteristics of becoming sissified. Taking liberties with the book references, and keeping an association with classical criminology, such is the intentional process of purposefully acquiescing to the lower realms of infantile narcissism. It is the many-faced purposes of clinging to the immaturity of child-like selfishness, and forsaking the viability of individual growth and maturation. Added to that, is the resistance to self-evolve into a more profound and wisely ascended individual. As to that admonition, gender is irrelevant, courage of convictions and pursuit of heroic quests become the vibrant and energetic impetus for transformation. For the stupidity of simplistic and magical thinking, the warrior pursues his or her journey of intense authentic realization. He or she fights back against the idiocy of cowardly cultural oppressions. Added to this debasing mix of cowardly oppressions comes the rise of the “techno oligarchs”. Self-righteous smugly pious, presumed pontiffs of cyber culture, divine right of tech-aristocracy for cultural normalcy, adult children claim societal rulership. Self-centered infantile narcissism among the vast reaches of the infotainment ministries of thought control assert their domination. For the “gulags” of social media ostracizing, or the “corrective labor camps” of thought control, the power elite have new faces and old intentions. By what is really the limp and impotent immaturity of adults with privilege throwing temper tantrums like spoiled children, wealthy technocrats strive to dictate the status quo. No deviations are allowed, free speech becomes a threat, individuality is dangerous, and alternate ideas are seen as contrary to the collective. Power, control and domination over the population manifests in sinister instigations.  Everyone must be the same and relish in the safe mediocrity of gluttonous consumer subservience. For the new “robber barons”, the high-tech gurus of pretentious silicone enclaves, tech is good, tech is for everyone, tech fits all and tech is god. Those who control the nexus of the cyber networks dictate the dogmas of behavioral consistency. To deviate, to question and to resist is dangerous to the slick corporate cyber con artists. For the few and the rebellious, the true social warrior, not the fake foolish ignorant ones, differentiation to a higher state of personal being is the mission of private individuation. Speaking out and expressing conflicting and confrontational perspectives threatens the adult-child to actually consider the freedom of ideas. Tyranny is cowardice, like cultural complicity to enforce collective consistency, the cowardly invoke all manner of condescension and derision to those who resist. The force of individuality is in danger, as communal complicity reinvents the simplistic templates of sameness. And yet, thinking outside the box, or the incestuous relationship with techno gadgetry, is challenging to the independent free thinker. Cowardice of culture for collusive consensus spans a spectrum of multiplicity in a complexity of cyber interactivity. To recall the reflection of one literary luminary of 19th century America, the antidote to social media and government abuses of liberty is the individual who demonstrates the potency of his or her character and growth. In the past, the brutality of dictatorships devalued the vitality and importance of individual creativity. As to the modern context, in an alleged democratic republic, tyrannical instigations transcend freedom of expression by diverse means. Politicians, pundits, and self-appointed proselytes of “rules for behavior”, as from techno-empires of mainstream media, subtly decry and oppress the important nature of individuality. Cowardice in culture is found in herded ideologies. For the false bravado of hiding behind techno gadgetry, the cowards among us fear the damning terminal nature of their terrestrial existence. Villainy of all manner unfolds. As one cultural anthropologist asserted, most people are terrified by the dark terrors that life and death invite. On the one hand, extraordinary heroism, the creativity of the ascending mindfulness of individuality. Fingers of the other clap the admonition to higher enlightenment. Yet, at the same time, the hand that shakes the first one loathes the necessity of its nobility. Instead, for many, the efficacy of truth devolves to the selfish reflections of infantile self-worship. By contrast, the other dimension, or multiple psychic frameworks, demand an overcoming of mundane rudimentary subsistence. To the carnal desires of one’s eye, peering through the maze of darker intentions, resisting the heartfelt passions of ingenuity beyond self, purposes collude to perpetrate deadly inflictions. As to the presupposition of personal divinity, the creator of loftier possibilities retreats into the malevolence of disingenuous motivations. For nothing of this is new, except for the egregious ignorance of all that has been done before. Demon or demigod, evil or potentiality of good, the duplicity struggles to know what it would. For the sake of the enslavement to the ease of status quo abatement, in the sheep filled crowds of subservient weakness, many adhere to the dominance of a lashed whipping for self-punishment of gutless weeping. As opposed to claiming the godly qualities of profound creativity, the demonic insistence to primordial collectivist absurdity profanes the essential vitality of exceptional differentiation. In the cowardice of culture for collusive consensus, negating the fearful horror of final termination, bargains and even begs illicit conspiracies for salacious personal enrichment. No limit as to the evils of timidity. In earlier times, eras lost and gone and seldom re-discovered, the brutal disdain for cowardice expressed astonishing disgust. Shunned, avoided, cast out, and excommunicated from the realm, cowardly behaviors received severe retribution. To lose shield, sword or spear, metaphorically speaking of course, to fail to stand up for oneself exuded the sweated stench of faint-hearted childishness. Nakedly brave, unclothed by virtue of self-evolving uninhibited bravery claims the divinity of individual distinction. From a diverse more dynamic metaphysical perspective, heroism in the unique madness to claim courage, to overrule fearfulness, the valiant warrior asserts his or her liberation in personal transformation. By prosocial activity in selfless service, imaginative ascendancy in genre of artful invention, he or she labors strongly to go beyond the commonplace. By an assortment of settings in modern times, personal warfare has many fronts. As to that, courage of convictions frightens the cowardice of culture for collusive consensus."
10,American Roads,politics," “Racist” Roads Recently an infrastructure bill was voted on with the promise to fix American roads. Not because they are run down, broken, or old but because they are racist. Racist. Apparently, American roads are racist. How could roads be racist? Well for one, because it is the new liberal, millennial mentality to believe that basically everything is racist. The real definition of racism has been twisted by the left. Real racism is the discrimination of a race or ethnic group that usually refers to one group as superior and the other as inferior. Racism does exist in the United States but not to the exaggerated extent that the media and democrats suggest. One of the main reasons that the roads are described as racist is because cities and construction groups would build highways on poorer neighborhoods, which usually were “black neighborhoods.” These roads were built either built to separate poor and richer neighborhoods or to build a needed highway. This is initially confused with segregation, which in some cases the roads actually had segregated Americans in the past. However, very few are actually presently segregated by these roads. It was not morally right to evict poor residents from their houses in order to build roads. However, it makes sense financially. It is just like America using other 2nd and 3rd world countries to produce and manufacture products because it is cheaper, even though isn’t always morally right. The separation of the neighborhoods also makes sense in some perspectives. Richer neighborhoods have nicer houses and being separated from poorer communities reduces the crime and gang activity in that neighborhood. Making it safer. New housing is also usually separated from other communities. Crime mainly exists in poorer neighborhoods because they are more prone to gang activities. The main reason people join gangs is that they want to make a better living for themselves by cheating the system: stealing, selling drugs, doing, drugs, and etc. If people in these poorer communities found more motivation or support to graduate high school with good grades or even decent grades and aimed for college, they can leave these neighborhoods. If they put education first then they can make a better life for themselves by pursuing the American dream. Although, poorer communities tend to have poor schools that give students a poor education. The government should work on fixing the education system and these schools. Maybe if we focused more on math and science than victimizing black kids with CRT then they would get a better education. Technology and social media are also a distraction in schools. Another reason kids are struggling in schools is that some school boards have a no homework policy. Which is honestly the dumbest fucking thing I have ever heard. Homework may cause some stress but it is so helpful and proven to help kids. America and American roads are not racist. Even if few roads were used to segregate neighborhoods a long time ago, it would be stupid to assume that all American roads are racist. Even if Pete Buttigieg didn’t mean exactly that. It is easy for someone to assume that all American roads are racist and that is clearly an incorrect statement. As a country, we should aim to build and expand the middle, working class. The new infrastructure bill gives a small percentage to the '“racist,” roads. The rest goes to more of the left’s agenda. The left should start prioritizing the American people and stop abusing their power."
11,A Society in Transition,politics," We all are aware that change in our personal lives is difficult, constant, and inevitable. We notice it when we look in the mirror or see our children grow. What is not so noticeable, however, but is also constant is the change that happens in our country and our world. That change happens so gradually that we don’t always notice it until those changes have made the world that we always knew unrecognizable. I was born before television and computers were in every household and our world then was different and slower-paced. That world, however, is gone now. We can’t get it back and we probably would not want it back. How would we live without our televisions and our computers? There is a segment of our society today that is nostalgic about the past and wants to return to the “good old days”,  but much of the “good old days” was not so admirable. When I was a child we simply accepted discrimination against minorities as normal. We accepted the career limits of women and the limitations on the role of minorities in society as normal. More of our young people today are going to college because of the availability of student loans and they expect their country to give equal opportunity and equality to all of its citizens without exceptions. This more inclusive attitude of a large part of our society is now a threat to those who have held power for a very long time and have denied equal rights to so many people for their own personal gain. When a part of our society denies that climate change is happening, it is because they don’t want to give up the oil and other benefits which make them rich. They are only aware of their self-interest and really don't care that they are damaging the environment or our country.  If they do not want equality for minorities, it is because it serves their self-interest to keep wages and benefits low. These people, who put self-interest before the interests of society, cannot hold back progress indefinitely. They are on the wrong side of history. People in every age have been striving to make their lives better and although it often takes a long time to change prevailing thought and achieve their goals, they inevitably do win. Black people after a very long time of being exploited were eventually freed from slavery. Women, after a long and dangerous struggle, eventually won the right to vote. More and more people are signing on to do the right thing rather than the expedient thing. We must all be prepared to go into the future and embrace the inevitable changes ahead which will ultimately change and also enrich our lives.. Our cities will eventually look different and be more diverse and we will all need to become more tolerant of different religions and ideas and different ways of thinking and living. Tolerance and acceptance for the benefit of all–that is the ultimate goal and the ultimate meaning of democracy and freedom."
12,The Assault on Science,politics," When I was a young girl, there was a great respect for people of science (doctors, scientists etc.). We trusted them and felt that the contributions of all of our world scientists had made our lives healthier and better. Therefore I was very surprised and disappointed when in 2021 after 50 years of warnings from 97% of our most prestigious scientists that we are still living in a dangerous time of climate change our legislators have as yet not taken the actions they need to take to protect us from this life-threatening calamity. The Worlds most Prestigious Scientific Organizations believe that the Climate is Warming The following is a partial list of scientific organizations along with links to their published statements and a selection of related resources. Statement on Climate Change from 18 Scientific Associations “Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver.” (2009) Climate deniers are often funded by corporations, companies and individuals who for their own economic interests do not want environmental protection laws that will limit their profits. American Association for the Advancement of Science “The scientific evidence is clear: global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society.” (2006) American Chemical Society “Comprehensive scientific assessments of our current and potential future climates clearly indicate that climate change is real, largely attributable to emissions from human activities, and potentially a very serious problem.” (2004) American Geophysical Union “Human‐induced climate change requires urgent action. Humanity is the major influence on the global climate change observed over the past 50 years. Rapid societal responses can significantly lessen negative outcomes.” (Adopted 2003, revised and reaffirmed 2007, 2012, 2013) American Medical Association “Our AMA … supports the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fourth assessment report and concurs with the scientific consensus that the Earth is undergoing adverse global climate change and that anthropogenic contributions are significant.” (2013) American Meteorological Society “It is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half century is human-induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and nitrous oxide.” (2012) American Physical Society “The evidence is incontrovertible: Global warming is occurring. If no mitigating actions are taken, significant disruptions in the Earth’s physical and ecological systems, social systems, security and human health are likely to occur. We must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now.” (2007) The Geological Society of America “The Geological Society of America (GSA) concurs with assessments by the National Academies of Science (2005), the National Research Council (2006), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) that global climate has warmed and that human activities (mainly greenhouse‐gas emissions) account for most of the warming since the middle 1900s.” (2006; revised 2010) There is only a small window of time left for us to act on this life-threatening problem for our planet before we will no longer be able to protect ourselves from this dangerous calamity. International Academies: Joint Statement “Climate change is real. There will always be uncertainty in understanding a system as complex as the world’s climate. However there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring. The evidence comes from direct measurements of rising surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures and from phenomena such as increases in average global sea levels, retreating glaciers, and changes to many physical and biological systems. It is likely that most of the warming in recent decades can be attributed to human activities (IPCC 2001).” (2005, 11 international science academies) National Academy of Sciences “The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify taking steps to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.” (2005) U.S. Global Change Research Program “The global warming of the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced increases in heat-trapping gases. Human ‘fingerprints’ also have been identified in many other aspects of the climate system, including changes in ocean heat content, precipitation, atmospheric moisture, and Arctic sea ice.” (2009, 13 U.S. government departments and agencies) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “Warming of the climate system is unequivocal and since the 1950s many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed. The amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen.” “Human influence on the climate system is clear and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems.” List of Worldwide Scientific Organizations This page lists the nearly 200 worldwide scientific organizations that hold the position that climate change has been caused by human action. Source information: NASA –Global climate change Climate Deniers “Unfortunately there is also a long list of climate deniers who have made a living out of denying the science of climate change. These so-called ‘experts’ often start out their statements with ‘I’m not a climate scientist, but…’ before launching into a series of carefully rehearsed talking points meant to confuse the public on the climate change issue. A great many of them are well-paid operatives of organizations like The Heartland Institute, CFACT, and Americans for Prosperity, which take contributions from fossil fuel corporations — including ExxonMobil, the Koch Brothers and their company Koch Industries — who seek to delay or block any substantial government policy initiatives meant to curb fossil fuel emissions or hasten the rapid growth of cheaper, cleaner sources of energy like wind and solar.” – Source information: Before the flood In  2019, 1.1 million students skipped school for a climate strike protest. These are young people and young voters who care about their future and  took action to show our politicians that they are concerned about what is happening to our environment and to their future. They are also aware that the Republicans in Congress because of their own self-interest and economic greed have been fighting to prevent any constructive action on addressing climate change and making our country and world safer. In 2021 and 2022  we all will have the opportunity to make our voices heard again on this important life and death issue. If we make the wrong choice at the ballot box, this country and this earth that we love so much, and our children and all future generations will ultimately pay the price of living on a more dangerous and life-threatening planet. Now is the time that we must all commit ourselves to protect this fragile earth from that unthinkable fate."
13,The Evolution and Effects of Quebec Independence Movement,politics," The independence movement in Quebec is not really a recent phenomenon, in fact, nationalistic feelings in French Canadians in forming a nation of their own has its root in pre-industrial Quebec or New France, when the inhabitants there adhered on becoming ‘Canadienne’ – a single, unique group of people living separately with their own identity from mother country France. The fall of New France to the British in 1759 only amplified nationalistic feelings inside the inhabitants of New France who were being dominated politically, economically, and culturally by the British. Indeed, the modern history of the independence movement in Quebec began in the 1960s when “the people of the province began to question the assumptions on which their apparent placid, unchanging society was founded.”  The movement slowly gained prominence in the following three decades until the sovereignty referendum of 1980. The eventual rise of the movement between the 1960s through the 1980s could be traced back through events in the following chronological order: the demise of Duplessis government and emergence of a liberal government under Jean Lesage ushering in the renewal of Quebec’s economic and social institutions, the emergence of Quiet Revolution in the early 1960s, the language movement, the surfacing of Parti Quebecoise as a political force in Quebec and finally the referendum on Quebec sovereignty in 1980. The movement and the referendum that followed have made us Canadians question the very basis of our Canadian society; it shook the foundation of the Canadian state with the very existence of the country being in question. Amongst the most profound effects of the independence movement of Quebec is the redefining of Canada as a federal state sponsoring the notion of being a truly bilingual yet a multicultural society and the transformation of French Canadian nationalism into Quebec nationalism. The death of Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis in September 1959 marked the end of Grande noirceur – the dark age that had absorbed Quebec. “Down to 1959 or 1960 Quebec was governed through a deeply conservative political system that produced regular majorities for a premier, Maurice Duplessis, who proclaimed the superiority and the desirability of doing things the old way, preserving the old values of Quebec’s Catholic society.“   He ruled Quebec like a quasi-dictator in promoting and preserving the status-quo in Quebec. “No less than other societies Quebec was challenged by urbanization, industrialization, secularism and other facets of modernization. But to a greater degree than other societies, Quebec resisted thrust of modernization, fearing that accommodation with them would have grave social consequences, undermining its values and threatening the survival of its people.”  The premier who succeeded Duplessis was Jean Lesage, who was a liberal and a top minister under Louis St-Laurent. Lasage is credited with moving Quebec forward after the ‘dark era.’ Under Lesage’s leadership, the Liberals had ended the sixteen-year rule of the Union National Party in Quebec promising sweeping reforms in government institutions such as education, healthcare, and social welfare etc. In fact, education, healthcare, and social welfare were controlled by the Catholic clergy largely prior to the revolution. The working class, as it became increasingly urban dwellers, felt that these public institutions under the Church were unable to react to and meet their needs.  With the on slot of higher fertility rate in the general population after the Second World War and baby-boomers increasingly coming into the workforce, the Catholic Church was in lack of the resources and personnel in properly conducting these social intuitions with the altered demographic conditions. So they were forced to employ more laymen. Moreover, the change of values espoused by Quebecers which were increasingly liberal and secular, together with the decrease of religiosity in the mindset of ordinary people in Quebec resulted in reducing the role and authority of the Church in society. The reforms undertaken by the state resulted in liberalizing and transforming Quebec society and ultimately ushered in the Quiet Revolution.  According to William D. Coleman: “The independence movement was not the instigator of the Quiet Revolution or even part of that revolution, Rather it was a consequence, a product of the series of changes that began to be realized in Quebec late in the 1950s.“  The Quiet Revolution, heralded as the root of the independence movement, according to Herbert Guindon, lay in the modernization of Quebec which began with the large-scale involvement of the provincial government in Quebec society, in the early 1960s.  But this does not tell the whole story, the Quiet Revolution was not just a change in government policy, instead, it was a change in spirit or atmosphere and a change in attitude in traditional Quebec society.  “In ten years there was a radical change that affected ways of thinking, ideologies, culture… It was like a pot whose lid was kept in place by the Duplessis system; when someone dared to open it, it exploded.” Through the Quiet Revolution, French Canada had united in a new re-invigorated form and the future of the nation seemed to be of enormous promise. It was short-lived though and when it disappeared some felt loss of self-worth and their disappointment fuelled the independence movement.  The effect of the revolution became visible as the independent movement formed with the creation of the Mouvement Souverainte-Association (MSA), the predecessor of Parti Quebecoise in 1967.  “In 1967, Quebec was catapulted onto the international scene by the Montreal World’s Fair (Expo’67) that drew hordes of visitor…and was a major milestone in rising Quebec nationalism…Sovereignists were ignited by [French President] General de Gaulles’ shout from the balcony of Montreal City Hall: ‘Vive le Quebec…libre!’ That Fall, the Parti Quebecoise coalesced under Rene Levesque.” The commencement of the independence movement can be traced back to the labor dispute in Radio-Canada in 1959. The producers in the institution tried to start a labour union with the management strongly opposing such a move. The producers went on strike which lasted two months. In the end, the people blamed the Canadian Parliament and the Confederation itself for the wrong-doing, not the management of Radio-Canada or the Minister responsible. This highly symbolic event signifies the external political and economic pressure that is inflicted upon the development of Quebec society.  Some fifteen years later, the Radio-Canada incident resulted in the election of Parti Quebecoise. The Radio-Canada incident influenced the people’s opinion in Quebec, made them feel alienated, and made them question the degree of participation of francophones in federal institutions. Georges-Emile Lapalme, who was the leader of the Quebec Liberal Party from 1950 to 1958, is considered one of the fathers of the Quiet Revolution. In 1958 he wrote a manifesto in which he specified all the reforms necessary for the development of Quebec, which became the basis for the Quiet Revolution. He expressed a new role for the Quebec state which would lead the way for Quebec’s economic emancipation. To fight Duplessis’s policies, he put forward a notion of progressive nationalism. His ideas were taken up by Lesage in his election campaign. Through Lapalme’s ideas, Quebec nationalism became linked with social reform, a step forward from Duplessis’s nationalism that was based on conservative ideology. This new form of nationalism had its downturn as well as “this independence movement among French-speaking Quebecois is producing a new form of nationalism, one that often embodies a hostile and isolationist approach in pursuit of political, social and economic recognition. This new nationalism, along with multiculturalism, is affecting Canada's national identity as more people are unsure about their roots. These unexpected changes that have taken place in Canada have raised many questions about the country's future.”  Lapalm intended to have the Quebec state play a much important role in the economic development of Quebec instead of waiting for Ottawa to take the initiative, but this had a negative consequence as this neo-nationalism made Quebec going in the direction of isolationism – Quebec government doing what is necessary for its socio-political and economic development paying no heed to Ottawa and the rest of Canada, for example, the inaction of the Bill 101 which exemplifies the whole question of the Language Movement in Quebec to which we turn next. The Language Question in Quebec emerged as the next wave of political force behind the independence movement in Quebec.  The French Canadians were the majority in the province of Quebec with their French language, but in the Canadian federation, they were the minority. The language question – the status of French in Canada was exemplified first by the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. “It examined income, occupation, and ethnicity, and revealed that in Quebec, the province where they were a majority, French Canadians were firmly at the bottom of the income and occupation heap. In federal institutions, French Canadians were simply not proportionately represented, and when they were, it was in low-status and low-paying jobs.”  So the Quebec government enacted legislation to protect their language and culture and in the years that followed, Quebec increasingly demanded for control of its cultural institutions. Looking back at Jean Lesag’s slogan: ‘maitres chez nous’ (‘masters in our own home’), of Daniel Johnson’s ‘L’egalite ou l’independance’ (equality or independence) or the enactment of Bill 101, Bill 178 and the language police”- all these events point to the fact that Quebec’s survival as a nation are directly linked to French language regulations. In 1974 the government under Robert Bourassa, a federalist Liberal, proposed to enact Bill 22, la loi sur la langue officielle that replaced a 1969 bill. Bill 22 established French as the language of workplace and government institutions. It also limited English education to only those Anglophone students who had prior education in the English medium.   They had to take an entry test to attend English schools. Bourassa was unable to win the battle he had started; only Rene Levesque was trusted enough by the Quebecers to settle the language issue, as history demonstrated.  “ Parti Quebecoise had become the only political force radical enough to make drastic changes without  concessions to the English minority and credible enough to be trusted by a population who believed the traditional parties to be linked to the still-powerful English minority.”  Rene Levesque acknowledged that it was deplorable that a nation had to legislate to validate the use of its own language in work and business, but he believed it had to be done, as a matter of survival for French Canadians who had been an enslaved race for so long. The emergence of Parti Quebecoise (PQ) was the next major event that flourished the independence movement in Quebec. “Quebec was burning and by the end of turbulent 1960s, separatism had quickly gone from being a fringe ideology to become a feasible option.”  It was a tumultuous time as a militant terrorist organization named The Front de Libération du Québec (FLQ) emerged prior to the emergence of the PQ and bombed federal mailboxes, assassinated labour and manpower minister Pierre Laporte and kidnapped British diplomat James Cross. Events in the next two decades would rock the whole of Canada to its core. Bill 101, a brainchild of PQ government was “a deliberate attempt by Parti Quebecoise to create a symbol, to show the people of ‘the country of Quebec’ that the clock had been turned back, the battle of the Plains of Abraham had been won, after all, their struggle for survival was over, and that a new life – the one the fathers and mothers of New France would have wanted - was starting.” The Parti Quebecoise defeated the Liberal government of Bourassa and came to power in 1976 which marked the renewal of the Quiet Revolution and its completion.  It was a historic moment for the people of Quebec because the Quiet Revolution was brought to the front again with its nationalist dimension. But it was not a triumph for the sovereignists yet, as in 1976 the PQ did not run on the issue of separatism rather its campaign was on the issue of good governance.  The Liberal Bourassa’s campaign was plagued by accusations of widespread corruption during its rule. PQ promised to bring the issue of independence only after a Quebec-wide referendum within five years of winning the election. In the 1980 referendum, Quebecers were asked to decide on whether to allow the government to negotiate sovereignty-association with Ottawa. “ This agreement would enable Quebec to acquire the exclusive power to make its laws, levy its taxes and establish relations abroad – in other words, sovereignty – and at the same time, to maintain with Canada an economic association including a common currency.”  Finally, the province-wide referendum took place on May 20, 1980, and the proposal to pursue secession was defeated by a 59.56 percent to 40.44 percent margin. The yes side primarily lost because of the lack of support from the Quebec businessmen. Prior to the referendum, Levesque tried to woo the business community by reassuring that sovereignty would ultimately benefit everybody including businessmen, but the business community was not moved by the assurances.  Maurice Seguin, a controversial and renowned Quebec historian doubts whether Quebec’s independence is even possible – “So on the one hand, he saw the tragedy of this conquered nation, in a minority position, for which independence was a desirable end. But on the other hand, he said: ‘It is so well kept, maybe the best-kept nation in the world, and these golden chains make its liberation difficult to achieve.”  Since Quebec was so well kept by others in current federal Canada, he doubted whether Quebec could ever achieve independence. The effects that the independence movement on Quebec and Canada between the 1960s and 1980s are: the redefining of Canada as a federal nation espousing a truly multicultural society- it is bilingual in orientation but multiethnic in composition. Another effect would be the evolution of nationalism in Quebec from French Canadian nationalism to Quebecoise nationalism. First, Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau was a powerful force on the ‘no’ side of the referendum. To contain the rising tide of Quebec nationalism, he implemented a number of strategies like promoting bilingualism with the Official Language Act of 1969, increasing francophone representation in federal government services, and increasing French language services of Radio-Canada throughout Canada.   He termed ’Quebec Nationalism’ as being ‘dead’ and proposed a renewed and revitalized form of federalism in Canada. He also proposed more economic presence of the federal government’s in the province of Quebec only if the yes side was defeated.   “Trudeau’s concept of Canada, while completely rejecting what he called Quebec nationalism, had this important aspect to it that is minority language rights across the country.“   Promoting bilingual services with minority French language established as one of Canada’s both official languages. The second effect of the independence movement was the emergence of Quebec nationalism in place of the French Canadian nationalism – to have a clearer and precise identity – a Quebec identity. This new identity defined being a Quebecoise in territorial terms; it included people living in Quebec including non-francophone people who live here. Quebec has to become more multi-ethnic to keep pace with the globalized world with increased migration. “The idea of Quebec is not and cannot be an ethnic idea; it has to be a cultural idea, encompassing people of diverse origins.” In conclusion, the rise of the independence movement is characterized by events such as the fall of the Duplessis regime and emergence of a liberal government under Jean Lesage, renewal of Quebec’s economic and social institutions, the emergence of the Quiet Revolution in the early 1960s, the language movement, the emergence of Parti Quebecoise as a political force in Quebec and finally the sovereignty referendum in 1980. Some might think that the Quebec independence movement lasted only a few decades, they are quite mistaken in understanding the history of Quebec nationalism. The roots of the movement went back to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It may have increased in certain eras and abated in other times, but it came back again and again. The only constant in the history of Quebec is the rise in self-assertion and questioning its link with Canada and finding its place in the federal system.  It may become a time when the Quebecers will completely assimilate themselves in Canada so that there would be no necessity for Quebec nationalism. Quebec nationalism may not be eternal but as long as there are people in Canada who speak French it will always come back to remind us of the struggle that has happened in Quebec through its independence movement.  The contending fact is that without the rest of Canada acting as an increasingly bilingual buffer promoting bilingualism and biculturalism, Quebec would become more and more isolated from the North American mainstream.

14,"Covid Conspiracies and the Animal Rights community in Victoria, Australia",politics," Let us think rationally if that is possible. Why would any government, left, right, or in the middle, proceed with the up-popular choice of a lockdown if they did not believe it was the only choice available at the time? Seriously think about that. I grew up with politics being something that one should always take notice of. As a child, there was always political talk happening around the house. My parents were both politically engaged and encouraged their children to be the same. Mum didn't just watch a little April cry, absolutely devastated at the sight of the Dolphin slaughter in Japan, instead Mum offered actions I could take for positive change (an animal rights activist was born). I was not taught to blindly accept what our governments or other authorities put forward, but rather to question and fight for change if I felt it was needed. I have lived my life like that and have taught my children the same. For those in the movement of animal rights who are on the side of covid deniers, anti-vaxxers or so-called freedom fighters; do you realise what calling for the sacking of Dan Andrews would mean? Who do you propose an alternative - Michael O'Brien? The re-hashed Matthew Guy? Seriously, anyone from the right side of politics? As an example of where the loyalties of the Liberal/coalition lie, the previous Agriculture Minister in the Dennis Napthine Coalition Government, Peter Walsh, (who still sits in parliament), told me he felt sorry for me not having dairy in my diet, and no, he would not change the legal stance of baby calves allowed to go 30 hours without food and water before these babies are slaughtered. No, this also has not changed under our current state government of the Labor party, but a whole lot has in the positive direction for animals. I seriously encourage you to look through the voting history of the right and see that animals have ZERO HOPE under a Liberal/coalition government. The Liberal/coalition's stance on anything is making a dollar, especially off someone they can exploit and enslave as easily as animals. Yes, I am firmly rusted on the left side of politics. I come from a working-class family and stand with workers and the unions that support them. I also stand with anyone, no matter their species, who is disadvantaged or discriminated against. I was not always like this, although, always left. I didn't see my learned racism. I didn't see my learnt sexism. My family are not horrible people, but there is subtle and not so subtle racism and sexism. I met a beautiful man when I was 19, and he was patient with me. No, he was/is not perfect – like all of us – far from it, but he has always been one to fight against most 'isms', particularly racism (like me, he is learning to un-learn our subtle sexism). At the risk of sounding like a complete tosser, we are all on a journey of learning. We all want someone to blame or rail against, but sometimes there is no one to blame. Humans are not immune to disease. It is arrogant to suggest this. Coming up with a conspiracy theory and claiming that Covid 19 is not real suggests that arrogance. We are susceptible to disease, and we have had pandemics reign upon our species before. We are a smart species in some ways (yet so so stupid in others – think climate change). We are smart enough to keep beating Mother Nature as she tries to curb our species on this planet – and quite rightly so when you look at the damage our species causes. We can fight disease with the invention of many medicines. I'm sure even the anti-vaxxers have all had a dose or two of penicillin in their lives. We also have vaccines that have almost irradicated certain diseases that attack our species – like measles and polio. I believe in science. Science and the scientists that study and research our planet and all who inhabit it are incredible. That is why I trust the science that these scientists have come up with to battle this pandemic, and I urge all to do the same so we can all move forward and overcome this Covid 19 virus. I also urge all to adopt a vegan diet to prevent more zoonotic diseases from attacking our species. This change also makes a massive positive contribution to stopping climate change, and the best thing about living vegan - you are no longer a contributor to animal suffering."
15,Democracy in the Crosshairs,politics," I have been a witness to the democratic process for many, many years. I have participated in numerous elections that have brought to office Democrats and Republicans of various philosophies and styles, but I have never before been worried through all of these various changes that our democracy was in danger of not surviving. A democracy is based on the rule of law and when there is an assault on our laws, that is an assault on our democracy. Because I am so concerned, I have been paying more attention to the political changes that are occurring not only in our country but also in the world. I have begun to realize that what is happening in our country is not an isolated event, but is also happening all over Europe. Right wing parties and leaders are running on the same hate agenda as our former president and the current Republican party and getting elected. That agenda is immigration issues and stoking long simmering hatreds and using these issues to gain power and install systematic corruption. The rise of right-wing nationalism in Europe is widespread, and it is making gains in the following countries: Italy–17.4% Germany– 12.6% Spain–10% Austria–26% France –13% Sweden—17.6% Estonia—17.8% Hungary–49%–19% Anti-immigrant laws are being passed in-- Denmark–21% The Netherlands–13% The Czech Republic–11% Right-wing nationalists across Europe and also here in America are now sensing an opportunity. The immigration issue is the catalyst that is causing this world fear and intolerance and is a world problem which must be confronted and solved by all freedom loving people in all the countries of Europe and America working together. Because of climate change, natural disasters, wars, gangs and dictatorships around the world, and the ending of the war in Afghanistan, large numbers of refugees are fleeing their countries to try to survive. This will only continue to increase if the world does not become more stable. What will happen to these millions of refugees? Will the world close their eyes to the fate of all of these vulnerable people and this overwhelming human crisis and pretend it is not happening or should the compassionate countries of the world get together to solve this enormous problem by taking action? World leaders working together must now begin to stabilize those countries at risk and address the problems that are causing this flight of refugees. Leaders need to decide on a fair number of refugees that each country can absorb. if they don’t begin to address these unsolved problems, their inaction will ultimately destabilize the whole world. We need to be very concerned about what is happening. If we are not aware of this assault on world democracy, then we are all in danger of eventually losing our freedom both in America and elsewhere in the world. When hate becomes the norm, not only refugees and minorities are at risk, but it endangers the freedom of all of us. We must become more aware of this imminent danger to democracy and do all that we can to ensure that this catastrophe will never happen here."
16,The Continuing Fight for Equality,politics," “We hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men are created equal. That they are endowed, by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""-- Thomas Jefferson 1801-1809 The congress will be voting soon on the voting rights Bill HR1—the For the People Act. Why are we still fighting for equality and the right to free access to voting for all of our citizens in 2021.The Republicans in state legislatures in many states are passing bills to limit access to voting. They have already passed over 200 bills to do that. In a democracy that is unacceptable and limits all of our rights and ultimately will destroy our democracy. We, the people, cannot allow them to do this. That is why voting rights bill HR1 must pass and be a protection for us all. The United States and the world have been fighting discrimination for as long as people have walked on this earth. It has been the Catholics against the Protestants, discrimination against the Jews, Jews in conflict with Palestinians, crimes against Chinese workers and other Asians, The Crusades--Christians against the Muslims. Arab tribes against each other. intolerance between whites and blacks. The truth is that people do not like or trust others who are different than they are. It takes understanding and wisdom to learn to get along even in loving families. We have come to a point in our world that we must learn to live together in peace and harmony or we will all ultimately die together because unless we learn to come together and solve our difficult problems together this civilization will ultimately disintegrate through nuclear destruction or unaddressed natural disasters like climate change. Most of our religions have all tried to teach us to love and respect each other, but unfortunately some have also caused us to distrust anyone who is different.. Our moral and ethical leaders have worked hard to bring us closer to becoming more tolerant of differences. We cannot and should not force other people, whether it is our families or our fellow citizens, to think and feel as we do, but we must learn to respect the opinions and the choices of others as long as they also respect our opinions and our choices. We must all learn to make the effort to live together with respect and in peace. I don't know what the religions or political opinions or races of my neighbors on my street are, but we have all lived side by side for many years—each living the life that suits them and we are a good community. Each of us must now look into our own hearts and root out the distrust that we might feel for those who are different from us and begin to live with more respect and tolerance for every human being in the US and in the world. We must reject words and deeds of intolerance and hate whether they come from our families, our religions, our communities, our TV's or our social media. Respect and tolerance for all human beings is the only option that will ultimately save our democracy and our planet."
17,A Question of Survival,politics," Recently I was watching the movie Conquest of Paradise with Gerard Depardieu, a movie about Columbus and his discovery of the new world. As I was watching the cruelty that occurred in those days (1492)– the Spanish Inquisition and the brutality of what was done to the native populations when soldiers from a foreign country came in and killed them at will and took everything they possessed, I realized that although more than 500 years have passed and our world has changed in so many ways, we are still killing each other at the same pace and for the same reasons as we did so many hundreds of years ago. Why, when the world has become so modern with the invention of cars, planes, new medical techniques our enhanced communication through the internet and so much new knowledge about psychology and the better understanding of the subconscious motivations and drives of human beings, why then are we still functioning in this primitive, brutal way. With vast numbers of smart, educated people able to achieve so many modern inventions and innovations to make our lives safer and better and our astronauts exploring the vastness of outer space, why is it that these same smart, educated people still cannot figure out how we can learn to get along with each other better both in our families or in our world. I think perhaps the answer is that no one is really willing to make the effort and spend the required money to try to solve these most important and crucial world issues on which our very survival is ultimately dependent. Our scientists have already warned us that we have now come to the tipping point in our civilization. We will either begin to collectively work with our world partners to face the real problems of our world or we will all continue to go on as we have with blinders on and go to our destruction together in the not too distant future. Why are we not facing our world problems with wisdom and determination to find solutions? I think that our leaders and our citizens are just so ill-equipped and frightened to look at the reality and the challenges of the future that we all just want pretend that everything is fine and there are no problems. It is called denial! To solve climate change will mean changing our society in many new ways. It will mean changing from fossil fuels to renewable energy, with the loss of old ways and old jobs and the beginning of new technologies and new jobs. “Humanity will have given up on planet Earth if world leaders cannot reach an agreement this year to stop the mass extinction of wildlife and destruction of life-supporting ecosystems.” Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, the acting executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, has implored governments to ensure 2021 is not just another “year of conferences” on the ongoing ecological destruction of the planet, urging countries to take definitive action on deforestation, pollution and the climate crisis. “Humanity will have given up on planet Earth if world leaders cannot reach an agreement this year to stop the mass extinction of wildlife and destruction of life-supporting ecosystems,” the United Nation’s new biodiversity chief has warned. Change is always hard and is resisted by many, but when survival is at stake we don’t have any more options. It must be done and as Elizazbeth Maruma Mrema warns it must be done now–this year– 2021. Another challenge that is destabilizing the world is the intermingling of people of different backgrounds, religions and race. Many populations are being displaced because of internal conflicts, climate change and natural disasters. All religions teach us to be tolerant and respect our fellow man. It is time that we followed our oldest values of love and respect. It is often difficult to tolerate others who look and think differently than we do, but if we respect each other and strive to learn to understand each other better and to live together in peace, than although our world will look different and be different than it is now, it will be one of stability and harmony. If every citizen and every leader dedicates himself to working toward these goals now, addressing climate change and dealing wisely and humanely with displaced populations than perhaps we can still avoid the imminent disaster that is awaiting our world in our lifetime."
18,HESTON RUSSELL OP-ED - BUREAUCRATIC BOX-TICKING,politics," Sunday, 11 July 2021, saw the anticlimactic announcement that the last of Australia’s military personnel have been withdrawn from Afghanistan, a conflict that saw over 39,000 veterans deployed over the 20 years our country committed to the coalition against terrorism. During the conflict, 41 Australian Veterans lost their lives, with over 700 more lost to suicide during the same period, as the true cost of our deployment continues to be realised. For the majority of Australians back home, our country’s commitment to this far away land was an initial focal point post the September 11 attacks on the United States. However, since then, much like our political strategy in the conflict, we have heard silence except for commemorating those who paid the ultimate sacrifice, or those who won the highest awards our country can offer. What we have not heard is of the true commitment and success of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and women who, for two decades, represented our country to the finest of our national values. Australian Defence personnel who earned the reputation of being feared by our enemies, loved by the locals, and first-pick partners and allies within the coalition of the willing. Instead, the Australian public is now seeing images and reports of the Taliban re-claiming the land we fought to free. We are left to watch as bureaucrats try to explain the red tape and paper stacks that are preventing those who fought and worked alongside us, and their families, from being protected from assured death. Payment for their loyalty to our democratic ways. It is during these times as the question of “was it worth it?” grows louder, that we’re seeing some of the greatest injuries and wounds appear. Was it worth those we lost? Was it worth those who still suffer today? What about those who are left behind? What about the billions it has cost the Australian taxpayers? How is it that our veterans, who went at the call of our country to take action as the final means of diplomacy, are the ones now being asked these questions? As we stand at the start of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, we already know how damaging and deadly this path of doubt and uncertainty is. After the Prime Minister held a media conference to announce the commencement of the Royal Commission, we again failed to hear or see any proactive support or real understanding of how difficult this emotionally charged and triggering period is likely to be for thousands of veterans and their families. It is those Veterans and Family members who must now come forward and give their accounts of the systemic failings in our veteran affairs and support systems that have driven so many to contemplate suicide, or to have a loved one take their own life. Prepared lines like, “Call this number if you need help”, and “we have dedicated additional resources”, merely tick the boxes required to meet mediocrity. They are continuing to miss the mark where it counts. Our withdrawal from Afghanistan should have been a time to celebrate and commemorate those who went forward to represent our country and everything our ANZAC spirit represents. Instead, during this time of pandemic and when our nation is in crisis, the withdrawal from Afghanistan has become a footnote, lost under the piles of red tape and paperwork that otherwise consume our political powers. Our political leaders need to understand that those who proudly and patriotically served are simply left wondering why."
19,American Aristocracy and Societal Devolution,politics," Aristocracy, the brevity for a metaphorical assertion of upper-class dominance, rule and hereditary perpetuity. By indirect inference, the special interests of the wealthy elite, the up and coming elite, generational replication, that furthers the materiality of the privileged few. Of this landed gentry, the upper crust “nobility” of fortunate inheritance, is diverse and multifaceted. Within the “tribal” spectrum, again a symbolic reference, the in-group is a layered or dynamic framework of materialistic distinctions. To say wealthy, describes a range of material worth and the inherent complicity to ensure the sanctity of a privileged status in American society. Continuity of wealth remains essential to the perpetuation of America’s “dynastic” enclaves. A dynasty in this regard pertains to the perpetuation of socio-economic and political influence beyond that of the average middle class American citizen. It is a matter of power and control over whatever enhances the dominance of affluent self-interests. Particularly in relation to political processes, lines of succession perpetuate a family’s, or group’s, influence over particular “reigns” of “imperial” benefits. Fascinating is the idea that for a democratic republic that opposed the tyranny of foreign aristocracies, American society appears to embrace its own version. In article appearing in an online news publication in 2018, the perspective discusses issues pertaining to what characterizes the “America’s New Aristocracy”. As a tentative descriptor, the author applies the phrase, “ruling class”, to the status of the wealthy few. In furthering the discussion, the article delves into the efforts of the societal elite to ensure the expansion of honored or noble status. Particularly, the use of while the lower economic realms are held to “laws and regulations” of one sort or another, the upper classes become except. Instead, or as opposed to equal justice for all, some are more equal than others are. The divide is worsening.[1] The fraud, the deception, the blatant con-artistry baffles the average imagination, which may or may not perceive the sinister underground expansionism of materialistic disparity. From politicians and pundits who spew fallacious rhetoric, to the rich handlers that back their cover story stupidity, the hidden agenda remains all too human. That is, the power, control, manipulation and domination of the many by a few. Of course, none of this as a story-telling exercise is new. Empires rise and fall, replaced by other empires that rise and fall. For humans, not much changes. From the perspective of a human devolution theory, whereby humankind purposefully pursues regressive antics to bring about a final extinction. Under that expansive matrix of maladaptive behaviors, one viewpoint alludes to the critical issues relative to an American aristocracy. As power and wealth increasingly consolidates among an “elite” few, the prospects of social collapse loom closer. Dangerously divisive and deconstructive to a democratic republic, an American societal nightmare unfolds. Historically, empires rise and fall throughout history. Typically, the eventual demise traces the fault lines to an expansive divide between rich and poor. As a broad generalization, exceptions acknowledged, more than a few investigative resources allege the growing power of oligarchic enterprises. From a research project at two major universities, reported in a long-standing magazine publication, investigators concluded public policymaking dominated by the increasing influence of powerful business interests. In the future, the trend could result in the decline of democracy in favor of the “corporate state”. If so, would there be another American revolution? No probably not. A weak, submissive and subservient culture, pampered, coddled and “dumbed down”, will not rise up in rebellion.[2] Briefly stated, an oligarchy is a structural form of governance whereby a small group of powerful individual control the vast majority of the population, as well as the political processes. In so doing, those in power, regarded in terms of their rank within the structure, involve levels of authoritative influence. These distinctions include nobility or aristocratic heritage, wealth, family connections, educational, corporate or religious alliances. Power, control and domination exercise significant manipulation often for corrupt or selfish purposes. In contemporary mainstream reactivity, many might think an “oligarchy” pertains to the former Soviet Union. However, and increasing number of investigators are applying similar description to post-modern America society. In order to proclaim societal dominance, and stage-manage monetary and political resources, financial power translates into electoral interference. For the astute observer, a developing perspective suggests that American society has devolved a “supper class” of wealthy people intent on developing an “American Aristocracy”. To that end, the deceptions are many and the sleight of hand tactics are clever. While many politicians have achieved financial success in public office, they remain primarily the means by which richer elite ensure power continuity. Donors, benefactors, and contributors marshal their collective financial resources to protect their self-interests. A financial culture becomes a political culture for the few. As a form of power structure, an immense and diverse social class system or multiple systems, the degree and extent of influence is challenging to measure. For many, it is even more difficult to understand. While some might argue the necessity of such powerful interests, or the inevitability, others would counter with fears of eventual socio-political disintegration. Meanwhile, still others will expound upon a variety of conspiracy theories, from a small group, to wealthy families, or the so called “money men” who run everything. With that, “conspiracy theories” tell stories and storytelling reveals how people interact and respond to their environment. According to one university film production, examining the role of “power elites” in the U.S., discourse follows similar commentary from the 1950’s. Conspiracies come is different forms. Some are mythological based on “magical thinking”, while others involve collusions that are very real. The challenge for the investigator is figuring out the real from the unreal. Regardless, in the documentary portrayal serious inquiry focuses on the perspective of a “superclass”, beyond the earlier assessment of the “power elites”. As economic and political interaction grows in a global context, the desire to centralize control of wealth and limited resources increases.[3] In furtherance of dominance in the hands of a few, a few argue the rise of a “superclass”, which influence institutions, politics, and the law. Of this select “community” of upper class privileged persons, a driving impetus points to the relentless pursuit of globalization. As though a kind of “corporate state”, the transition from elected leadership decision-making transitions to the powerful and influential dominance of the private sector. In one assertion regarding the powerfulness of commerce and industry in modern times, relates to the fact the largest corporations in the world that have monetary resources larger than most countries. Some would argue that the development of such powerful interests, due to the interconnectedness of various linkages, business and politics for instance, gets smaller and smaller over time. Increasingly, the dominion and control falls to a limited number of key players, including individuals and large multinational corporate structures. More and more frequently, potency of such economic sovereignty uses its weight to manipulate domestic and foreign political systems. For most people, swiping a credit card for a latte, or punching a pin number for gas, masks the reality from the massive financial nature of the entity providing the service. Behind the scenes, who really knows, other than skillful investigators, where the paper trail leads? In a broadcast production in 2014, a major British broadcasting service alleged a “rich and powerful elite” dominates the U.S. On first reaction, for the serious social analyst and astute observer, the inference should come as no surprise. Actually, no big surprise at all. To factor in the potency of consumerism, capitalizing on gluttonous consumption, the perpetuation of materialistic enrichment animates incessant mass marketing. In particular, the so-called “American Dream” illusion represents a never-ending push to build wealth and prosperity.[4] Citing a related 2014 study from a prominent U.S. Ivy League college, nearly ironic in a sense, attempts to confirm the suspicion that American society is dominated by an elite few. The irony here summons the average person’s conception of an Ivy League school. That is, very prestigious, expensive, upper class achievement, exclusivity, and wealthy families send their kids. Not to forget of course, rich donors give healthy contributions to all aspects of such colleges. Then again, perhaps a good place from which to study the “power elite” is where the rich go to school. Alleging “data driven analysis”, researchers claimed to conduct extensive inquiry to back up notions of “aristocratic rule” in the U.S. By way of family influence and connections, groups representing certain business interests, and well-placed political associations, a few wield extraordinary impact on public policy. Meanwhile, across the American continent, average persons, within the ranks of the middle and lower classes, exercise limited power. With little independence of influential potency, most people lack serious political power. In light of such viewpoints, some question the future viability, if not already lost, of the American democratic republic. A few historians would argue for a devolution from attempted democratic processes to a regression into oligarchic power and control. With an intricacy of narrowly defined social, governmental and economic interactivity, utilizing extensive political connections and patronage, domination by the few overrides the general welfare of the many. The manipulation is so well stage managed most do not comprehend the sleight of hand. During an election season, maybe that explains why politicians get away with saying so many stupid things. While a handful of big corporations own news outlets, spurts of reporting here and there, interrupted by lengthy commercial messages, are egregiously superficial at best. Sound bites contribute very little to social utility. At the same time, reporting commentary from political candidates is even more limited. Instead of substantive problem-solving discussions, politicians blather shallow nonsense to pander whimsical notions of status quo mediocrity. By animated gestures, the waving of the arms, the pointing of the fingers, and the sweeping exaggerations of rhetoric, the clownish antics of political pontification ought to annoy the viewing public. Modern politicians in most cases, as there are always exceptions to every conjuring provoke rather than problem-solve. Spewing the superficiality of inappropriate fallacies of inference, and deploying sleight of hand tactics to distract from serious problems, shallow commentary achieves very little. In an era of anti-intellectualism, in which IQ scores are slipping and scientific validation ignored, puppets are easy targets for puppet masters. In a grossly materialistic society, where “wealth building” takes on divine personification, an aspect, or typology, of modern day slavery emerges. Gluttonous consumption avoid the reality of future repercussions. While enslavement diverges into different oppressions, the mythology of the “American Dream” masks a more sinister contrivance. Some would ascribe to this a private realm of upper class elites, relishing in their control of limited resources, as “pathology of the rich”. As an oligarchic reference to the upper echelons of society, a number of researchers express concern as to the regressive and destructive actuality leading to the collapse of social structures.[5] Meanwhile on the political front, the mantra of “study hard and work hard”, and one succeeds in whatever one wants, tends to perpetrate an illusion that hastens a devolution. In what a few voices characterizes as “welfare for the rich”, a handful of closed oligarchic circles control and manipulate institutional processes. In the safe mediocrity of less than stellar competence in communal problem solving for the greater good, the oligarchic influences maintain status quo for the few. Complicity in these machinations are a handful of giant corporate enterprises that dominate so-called news media. Of course, that is the tip of the societal “iceberg”, of which what is seen is not observable. A vast depth of colossal social behemoth lives below the surface. Among the rich, the celebrity super star, the wealthy sports person, and the corporate magnate, and all the characters among the landed gentry, how do they understand the rest of the people? Where they assert their dominion of influence, such as the public political arena, how do they appreciate the problems of the many? Where 1% dominate two thirds of the resources what is the societal connection with those of lesser means? For many in the oligarchic class, their interactions with those at lower levels in the “food chain” is somewhat limited. If a connection exists, in all likelihood, such interactivity relegates to a “superior-subordinate” relationship. More or less, this is a serious class distinction of upper to lower domination rife with condescension. According to one article on the issue of a “new American” aristocracy, or plutocratic sovereignty of an elite few, within the top 1% is an even smaller percentage. Of this tiny group of powerfully wealthy, the potency of material worth has the potential to influence elections. Much like the exalted conjecture of the “social studies realm” in academia, many researchers insist hope spring eternal. That is to say, somehow things will change and by some mystical transition, social progress with transform society into utopia. For others, a little more prone to appreciate the sinister or dark side of human nature, not much changes and things will get worse.[6] Humanity faces the tipping point, as inequality elongates or expands the divide between the elite upper realms and the over-burdened lower ranks. A few perceive a gloomy societal environment in which an entrenched aristocratic minority prefer two opposing American classes. One is the elitists who are in control, and the other is those subject to them. By way of connections, linkages, heritages, affiliations, and so forth, domination perseveres in diverse ways. Under the “rulership” of the aristocracy, those subjected to the status of vassals are supposed to submit willingly. Submission has a price and many acquiesce depending on the enticements. For some at the top of the “food chain”, a sense of entitlement pervades the thinking processes, along with various notions that include birthright, wealth, inheritance, and educational credentials. Aloof, insulated and remote from connectivity in the realms of the commoner, the elitists find safe mediocrity in status quo stagnation. With contrived consensus, by the vast reaches of “infotainment” networks, the perpetuation of illusions of the “American Dream” continues unquestioned in general. Reinforced by constant sales bombardment, the smoke and mirrors of social mythology cloak the hidden consequence to befall an entire society. In disparaging fashion, what might be called the “cult of self-interests”, upper realms of society reside in a mind-set seemingly determined to maintain their status quo. While many boast of noble accomplishments and unmatched philanthropy, there is an uncanny hint of callousness, selfishness and hedonistic self-promotion. As to that, the subterfuge of what is seen, as opposed to what is not seen, infers a deeper darkness to the sinister realms of the American aristocracy. For the oligarchic elite, the necessity of deception is crucial to ensure their dominance. Maintaining control for the wealthy “requires extraordinary behind the scenes influence over economic and political systems. To ensure the satiation of dominion, manipulation of commercial interests, swaying political processes, and controlling politicians is crucial to an “entitled” ruling class. An escalating complexity of diverse societal structures, given the power and control of an upper elitist dominance, does not offer a positive picture for future democratic processes. For some observers, the sense of a democracy presumes an illusion to satiate the herded masses. On the more dismal track of perception, an “entitled” landed gentry, or aristocracy, is no guarantee of intellectual transformation to heightened levels of enlightenment. On the contrary, an argument is probable that a dumber class of oligarchs runs a dumbed down society. Similarly, in the critique of modern American culture, the early founders in post 1776 lamented related concerns. Whereas it was possible to rebel, resist and otherwise defeat aristocratic oppression, as well as oppose titles of nobility, there was no certainty that some other form of oligarchy would rise up. For some notable representatives of the American Revolution, restraining potential of the monstrous creature of aristocracy required serious vigilance. To this endeavor, limitations on the ability of individuals and groups to have too much power was essential.[7] To oppose a monarchy, to keep watch over the republic, and ensure freedom from oppression, demands an enlightened and well-educated electorate. Yet, a healthy sense of skepticism, tempered by seasoned cynicism, would immediately object to that notion.  The last part of the assertion raises scary prospects, that is, the hope of enlightenment. With that, comes the concern regarding education, intellectual ascendency and maturity in productive thinking. With an extensive interactivity of special interests, corporate intrigue, patronage, linkages of preferentialism, privileged materialism, and hereditary entitlement, resistance is nearly futile. With the rise of a subculture, or perhaps, several subsets of an American aristocracy, over time, society devolves. Historical references point to the eventual collapses of “empires”. When movie stars and other celebrities are viewed as “philosopher”, in a celebrity worship society, it is a warning signal of eventual social regression. As “educators” insist that one size fits all, and the public educational systems operate like a factory assembly line, creativity, inventiveness and imagination fade. While politicians spew nonsensical irrelevant rhetoric, and pundits ignorant of history foment disingenuous and divisive “political correctness”, mainstream society fragments. In the process, the politically powerful ensure their “hereditary” entrenchment in the continuity of dominance that favors the “entitled” few. In the meantime, waiting under their protective wings are the offspring. Progenies of the American aristocracy inherent the political domains of the elites to the eventual detriment of the republic. Social devolution ensues at a rapid pace.

20,"Tragedy, Fear and Terrorism Arrogantly Near",politics," Terrorism is crime and crime are terrorism. Add the externality of effects, from community to country, and criminogenic factors are elevated to a more adventurous status. Fear factors are influential, likewise, so is human weakness in confrontation with criminality. Whether local or foreign, the intrigue become exponential. While some run, cower, and beg for rescue, others fight back. To be fearful is demeaning, especially detached, removed and remotely unaffected, yet still afraid. For that, short-term memory fails to inform adequately. Cowards are many, while warriors are few. Criminals know this and plan accordingly. Criminality is premeditated, willful with purposes, freely chosen and with the sufficiency of malice aforethought. As long as humans prevail to exist, crime will never cease. Human nature attends so well to that. In 200,000 thousand years of assumed evolving status, not much has transcended to higher planes of multidimensional ascendency. Instead, malevolence lives on in the thoughts of the human species. No doubt among some, little more will achieve the noble realms of enlightenment for the many. Mature growth in wisdom’s advancement degrades to regressive inclinations. Although noteworthy exceptions apply, as a few strive to change, the vast majority will not. Exceptions are nearly always present in the diverse mix of the population in general. But it is too late and too little to avert the devolving intentions of the many who foment human extinction. Stupidity knows no limitations, and often, it is a ploy to commune with others, more cowardly by group consensus. Status quo relativism condones less honorable acts of barbarity so that criminal acts attain simplistic nonsensical explanations. One assessment of contemporary America addresses concern over widespread presumptions of human stupidity. The suggestion of “moronitude” seems an apt contemplation for further discussion. If stupidity or moronitude were a virus, the malady of modern foolishness appears to spread rapidly. In the foolhardy antics of modern society, outright expressions of being a fool are seemingly accepted. In some cases, particularly in politics, it is as though many applaud the idiocy of ignorance-laden commentary. From tragedy to fear, and terrorism far and near, the cowardly among us rush to every possible inconsistency of hasty generalization. Fools are everywhere. An observation, which nearly always invites bias on the part of the observer, searches for meaningful exchange in cycles of so-called news reporting. Actually, it is not news reporting one might perceive in 24/7 broadcasts by the vast network of infotainment. Instead, it is a morass of myriad opinions, typically from the younger ones aspiring to be famous celebrities. Opinionated beyond any pretense to intellectual ascendency, mostly based on someone else’s opinion, such failure of factuality does not aid the advancement of mature lifeforms. Aside from the debasing rhetoric, opinions are never evidence of the real and the factual. Nonetheless, smug piety prevails in the arrogance of ignorance, assuming tragedy and fear foment safe environmental adaptations. A widespread anti-intellectual malaise persists in the perpetuation of selfish motivations. Such intentions usually mean material and or psycho-dysfunctional reinforcement of some value. For instance, after a horrific tragic event, like a mass shooting, a rush to claim the surrender flag of “mental illness” hurriedly makes an appearance. Frightened, timid and cowardly responses blur the reality of human nature. Generally avoiding placing blame on the perpetrator, a chorus of disingenuous rhetoric ensues. Many assuming the pretense of their alleged “expertise” want in on the action. After all, there is infotainment to spin, rumors and conspiracies to concoct, and egregious fallacies to foment. While aiding and abetting the perpetrator, allowing a variety of excuses, there is profit to be made as well as political gain. Hedonism kicks into high gear to profiteer from the fear. Politicians manufacture instant cure-alls, reporters clamor for simplistic explanations and pontificators of one orthodoxy or another rant about curses and demonic manifestations. Entire academic and commercial enterprises abound in fabricating some “psycho-malady”, or socio-economic depravity. As terroristic behaviors justify grant funding and “research” papers, fees for “professional” consultations are likely to increase. Meanwhile, as competitive diagnoses confound the limits of scientific validation, insurances companies receive the billings and more drugs hit the marketplace. In the many schemes of the devolving nature of human existence, anything falls temptation to simpleminded rationalization. In a collapsing culture, with a penchant for jellyfish-like infatuation with mutating psychobabble, the human species lifespan diminishes toward extinction. Floating with no sense of evolving enlightenment, or progressive assurance of perpetual maturity, the spineless flaccid bloated self-centeredness consumes its own enslavement. Societal advancement decays in the viral contagion of stupidity, becoming more commonplace in a declining era. Unfortunately, in post-modern American society an element of stupidity runs rampant to the highest levels of commerce and government. In collusion, purported news services are highly commercialized ventures claiming the pretext of “unbiased” reporting. Yet, at the same time, the exaggeration of commentary, along with the choreographed and scripted pundit portrayals, often overlook the serious complexities of human behavior. Nonetheless, in typical melodramatic fashion, whether hurricane or shooting incident, the constant regurgitation of “concern” spews disingenuous hype that aggravates the tragedy. Stupidity enjoy absurdity. Stupid antics at every level of societal interaction hastens the final demise of a devolving species. A diverse group of experts from scientific fields asserts the view that the human species will eventually become extinct. Meanwhile, as “human devolution” continues a downward trend, various infotainment venues promote divisiveness frequently. Glorified by media exploitation, marketing manipulation expands into the realm of “fear mongering” at every possible opportunity. At least of course, that is the seasoned observation of some key analysts. A number of human behavior practitioners observing the social mainstream, practitioners and theorists alike, considered a reality of social regression. Folly chases idiocy in stalking every opportunity for commercial or political exploitation. With every intent to suborn common sense, the hedonistic calculus goes into hyper-drive. In recent reporting on the issue of “moronitude”, one social commentary argues that dumbness is arrogantly accepted. Not only approved but also embraced as though a compliment to current social interaction. Feeling good about being stupid is more important than in-depth analysis and ensuring competent validation of information. The trite, the trivial and the temperamental self-indulgence of post-modern society relishes in the satiation of hedonistically shallow emotionalism. For the carnality of non-evolving pleasure seeking, the selfish promotion for instant gratification does little to promote the advancement of the human species. Here, a distinction between productive pleasures and non-productive pleasuring offers a competing contrast. Such a divergence points to the pro-social as opposed to antisocial consequences between the mature framework of individual and social utility. That postures in contention versus counterproductive and socially malevolent antics that foster regressive tendencies. Concerns for the unity of a pluralistic society, and general welfare of the common good, appear readily compromised for the sake of self-serving political correctness. Selfishness abounds. In the grotesque extremes of condescending memes, the dissension in social discourse grows increasingly disharmonious.  Of tragedy, fear and terrorism, the provocations of malevolence come in many forms. Malice of any sort is the meanness, the hatefulness and the self-serving nastiness of a gluttonously arrogant bloated consumer culture. From narcissistic politicians on the national scene, to self-absorbed “social warriors” wearing masks, prosocial transformed into the antisocial. Similarly, whether by word or act, the wickedness is extraordinarily stressful. From a particular study, a writer points to a rise in selfishness. In an attempt to measure collective cohesion and cooperation, it appears people in general are decreasingly interdependent in relation to team building with prosocial implications. Additionally, working cooperatively and trying to see the world from other’s perspective, in order to problem solve, appears more challenging. However, sometimes, in the aftermath of a tragedy, a number of people will pull together for a limited duration. Likewise, following a horrific infliction of a terroristic act, exceptional examples of heroism occur. However, there are acts of debasing exploitation. Where some rise to the occasion, others inflict harm, spread fear and promote terroristic horrors. Solicitous or complicitous, the degradations torment and stifle productive transformations. Aiding and abetting the stagnation of human ascension is the vast reaches of infotainment. From one source to another, this realm of information flow spans the linkages between various media. News media, social media and mainstream media contribute divergent interactions that attempt to discern the deadly expressions of human behavior. Of such, nothing is well defined. For those prone to vicarious self-inflicted suffering, presumed victimization, or pretentious forms of social entitlement, tragedy and fear conspire to foment contentious social interaction. Hunting a conspiracy, conjuring up corruptive influences, or accusing the demons of misadventure, those promoting their own agenda find comfort in tragic misadventures. A disaster, catastrophe, or crisis of some sort become ripe for exploitative reactivity. Regarding the admonition, paraphrased as “never waste a good crisis”, politically speaking, post-modern cyber/cable extremism takes such advocacy to the lower depths of depravity. Politicians ramp up the idiocy with stupid commentary and foolish folktales, while network commentators make celebrities of terrorists. Smugly pious and self-righteous in their obliviousness to the real world, movie celebrities spin the utter nonsense of their juvenile conjecture. As a result, terroristic antics change into the manifestations of diverse illicit implications. All too often, for the astute observer, the commonality of logical analysis seems to disappear across the broad spectrum of social interaction. Common sense often lacks the allies necessary to succeed in triumph. Yet, if common sense were common, then everyone would have some. Since various forms of anti-thinking prevails in the mainstream, much evidence suggests the non-commonality of rational thinking. Critical analysis for uncovering serious evidentiary sufficiency appears to slumber in the slothful rejection of factual validity. While science takes a holiday in the memes of the mainstream infotainment, intellectualism erodes to debasing levels. In the culture of cowardly pontifications, the truth, evidence and proof vanish from the safeguards of free speech. Censorship grips social media to an unusual extent, as creativity slowly vanishes from any meaningful context. Woefully deficient across the entertainment arena are the meaningful acts of insightful and imaginative provocations of thoughtful energies. Instead, cowardice, arrogantly portrayed, spites the very notion of wiser pursuits. In bizarre echoes of maladaptive behavior, the human herds of emotional gutlessness revile reality. With a grotesque sense of materiality, as in the illusion of the so-called “American Dream”, there appears to be a commonality of anxiety in the face of presumed dangers. Fear arises in the nebulous supposition that something looms darkly that threatens possessiveness of the status quo. In a culture that values wealth, as well as gluttonous consumption, coupled with bloated egos for self-validation, specters of evil lurk everywhere. From the darkness, the fear of losing the materiality of comfort and ease encourages submission to enslavement. From some viewpoints, there is concern that many would commit treason than risk losing the so-called good life of consumptive pleasures. Self-preservation is more conducive to treachery in times of hardships than altruistic acts of sacrifice. An analysis of most natural disasters, or pandemic event, reveals instances of courage as well as acts of depravity. Not everyone will behave in rational, productive or self-sacrificing ways. Yet, one can study most organizational structures and assess the personality within the framework. It does not take a natural disaster to question the ultimate virtue of the participants of any institutional configuration. For large segments of society, consensus builds voluntary acquiescence to “herd thinking”. Group animosity has little appreciation for the one who does not fit the standard template of “normal”. Opposition easily reacts in negative ways to those prone toward independence, confident individuality and personal competence. Fearful of differences, the communal consensus wants conformity, as simplistic thinking wants one size to fit all. As some writers may lament the declining state of mental and physical fitness in the U.S., calling the culture a “nation of sissies”, darker prospects loom on the horizon. From a recent military study, the U.S. Army’s growing concern about fitness levels reflects a tragedy, fear and terrorism anxiety ridden society. Mentally unprepared and physically unfit to serve their country, over two-thirds of recruits do not meet minimum standards for service. This represent a serious national security concern. That is from a military perspective. From an associated standpoint, the public service area, first responder recruitment faces similar challenges. As to such critical issues, among the shortcomings are obesity, poor fitness, prior offenses, mental health, and substance abuse and so on. Increasingly, the responsibility for national defense, as well as public service, falls upon a smaller group of persons. That represents an unhealthy burden upon the few, while many escape responsibilities for their own betterment. The same speaks loudly in the law enforcement realm. Police agencies across the U.S. experience similar recruiting issues as the military. In spite of an expanding job market in public safety, cities, towns and villages struggle to find qualified recruits. Unfit for duty is a common theme. As fearfulness strikes back against logic and reason, a whining culture devolves into that which cowers from distance with news reports of tragedy, disaster and terroristic activities. Driven by incessant “news” coverage, coupled with over-rated and ill-informed opinions, pundits foment an atmosphere of fear. In the wake of homicidal event, for instance, all manner of exploitation comes to bear on the calamity at hand. Coverage is quickly overly dramatic and alleged “experts”, typically from academia and no field experience, a variety of disinformation. Misleading, misguiding and mistaken, the infotainment world kicks into high gear. For a culture of wimps, the vicarious affinity for being afraid becomes an arrogant assertion for herded thinking. Likewise, political agendas enjoy capitalizing on the marketing value of one disaster after another. From sales marketing to political campaigning, as well as social media promotion, “pandemic” sells the next “epidemic”. Nearly every aspect of the vast media networks expresses some form of human misfortune. The negativity is constant and extreme. In the non-reality of the “fake world”, large segments of society are fearful for unnecessary reasons. Promotion of the negative side of things is more common that the opposite perspective. Attempting to address the positive aspects of an issue or situation that considers the proportionality of the evidence, confronts the desire for immediate gratification in adversity. Danger, hardship and misfortune, are the natural antagonist of humankind. Self-evolving individuals struggle with the daily entanglements of myriad troubles.  Suffering, in one way or another, psycho-physically, is essential to the nature of human existence. Pain requires great courage to confront it, to live it, to embrace it, and yet most waste tremendous energy to avoid the fiery annoyance of such occurrences.  Where one philosophy would argue the aversion to pain and suffering, tragedy and fear, another would admonish living through the reality with great valor. To war against oneself, in the anguish of birth to the pretense of adulthood, carries the strain of breathing each moment of breath. Inconvenient toil goes with every heartbeat. However, in a cowardly culture, where ignorance blossoms the bliss of intense selfishness, the reality of the struggle balances precariously in fainthearted regression. At the fundamental basis of every wake-up call is the annoyance of trouble effort. In that, the frustration contrives by many inner splinter voices to confound the paradoxical opposite. For the hedonistic principles of pains versus pleasures, or by contrast the convulsion of such imaginings, one needs the other, in order for all the senses to prevail. All experiences are vital. No psychic heroism is without the striving against the incessant manifestations of human dysfunction in all its perverse diversity. Community and culture contrive to intervene in the maturation for such valiant efforts. To be scared is what the herd reinforces. Fear of everything, from commodity consumption to pandemic eruption, the infantile gluttony of self-immolation abounds. The sound waves of discord reverberate through incessant repetition by massive infotainment to ensure manipulative sanctions. Only the brave can resist the mainstream game of the emotional gambit that fosters an illicit consensus. Purposely naïve, deceptively captivated, a cast of many join the stage play of self-satiation for the thrill of the tragedy and the fear they relish. Across the planetary expanse, terrorism, as well as other threatening possibilities, become exploitable “movie scripts” for fame and profit. Politicians and pundits enjoy the promotion of a “good crisis.” For the individuation of selfless differentiation, the valor of the few focuses on the acute nature of context within calamity. Whether tears are joyous, or torturous, the reality summons the intensity of the focal point. Yet, the herd, the flock, and the pack, murmur the alliances of collective calamity, to assert the illicit commonality of the group’s dreadful unanimity.  Of tragedy, fear and terrorism, for the viral spread of pretentious anxiety desires the communal collusion of sameness. In brief, without prolonged digression, the unimaginative processes degrade to noncreative immobility of juvenile narcissism. Two dimensional at best the thinking goes dull."

1,Leadership in an Era of Leaderless Pretension - 1,politics," In numerous corporate, governmental and collegiate forums, seminars and workshops across the U.S. nation, hope springs eternal in the elusive hunt for leadership. Who represents it in a realistic portrayal or ideal role model? What does such a term mean? Where in the real world is it applied? When does such a manifestation arise? How does such a characterization evolve? Lastly, why is such a personification necessary? At the onset of a typical collective of contrived consensuses on the topic of “leadership”, definitional criteria confound and confuses the efficacy of specificity. Defining and accepting the status quo of believability, usually depends on the context of the intention behind a particular forum. A training instigation may dictate the parameters by which such leader-oriented specifications are to eventually serve as application. Simultaneously, reality haunts the shadowy realms of psychodynamic considerations and subsequent explanations. In regard to the aforementioned onset of attempts of communal collectivism to specify a delineation, an argument ensues. This is the basis for speculative assertions as to whether or not a consensus context taints the reality of the very idea of leadership. A basic point of dictionary reference says “leadership” is the office or position of a leader. This of course, to the insightful inquisitor says essentially nothing of substantive value. It’s a red herring so to speak. Now, the inquirer with hopefully an open mind, and some well-grounded educational background, plus actual life experience, must go deeper. On a primordial amative human level, large numbers of seemingly sentient beings occupy various offices or positions that might be inferred as places of “leadership”. Yet, reality haunts such superficiality. As such, previously, several investigative questions offered further prospects for additional inquiry, which means delving to the depths of profound meaning. Such a quest is left up to the investigator for him or her to draw final conclusions. Meanwhile, at the local collegiate forum, attempting to motivate and inspire younglings, defining the scope of “leadership” calls upon numerous assumptions. Basic definitive claims, coming close to the supernatural realm of unexplained phenomenon, visits the mysterious notion that leadership infers the capacity to lead. That in turn cloaks the mythological notion of presupposed potentiality to make things happen. Add to that, the further claim, again of dictionary notoriety, asserting the act or instance of leading. From this, seemingly there flows the persistence of something akin to guiding or directing or motivating people in an assortment of directions. Consistent confusion prevails. Of that, consideration delves into the mystical realms of pretentious speculations to egregious misconceptions. All of which, depending on the locale, culture, environment and context, potentially fosters a diversity of opinion. In addition, contingent upon experiential capacity, adherents of one view point or another may significantly differ in interpretation. For instance, in the reality of ongoing societal interaction, probability of conflict and contention, interactivity expresses competing interests. As each inhabitant of the discourse brings different levels of experience, education, training, background, maturity as well as immaturity, conceptualizing what leadership means becomes complicated. An example includes the typical interaction between public services personnel, like first responders, and non-practitioner academics. In this writing, the perspective on leadership in an era of leaderless pretensions refers to leading in a realm of intense interpersonal contact. Within these frameworks, leaders emerge from the “school of hard knocks”, where maturity, learning and wisdom come from years of serious interaction with others. This includes primarily those environments that concern the safety and security of the public and properties of others. These are the theaters of first responders, the military and private security practitioners who ensure others are protected to every extent possible. From these ranks, arise an authenticity of well-differentiated individuals who are remarkably different from managers and supervisors. In contrast to those realms of profit continuity, consumptive oriented marketing, professional athletics, Hollywood celebrities, or political ascendency, the world of public service expresses a different conception of leadership. Perhaps, in this regard, there are at least potentially five types of alleged leadership. These might tentatively include: academia, corporate, political, celebrity and public safety services. All of which is debatable and philosophical at best. Nonetheless, the focus here is on those who put themselves in harm’s way for others in selfless sacrifice. Among these a few rises to the noble ascensions of what might be characterized as leadership. At its basic core, reflecting those who defend community and country, took an oath of office to do so, and put “skin in the game”, leadership is a courageous activity of influencing others in positive ways. Of that special positivity for transforming creativity, the leader expresses purpose, direction and motivational means to accomplish the mission of the organizational structure. The process is neither by antagonism nor patronizing condescension. Instead, a leader is one who leads from the front by exhibiting the ethics and professionalism of competence and capability. She or he shows the way, rather than points the way. In the post-modern era, leaders are scarce breed of “warrior”. In post-modern times of purposed wussification, escapist cowardly regressions and incessant infantile emotional reactivity, people cower at the mention of warriorhood. At the very core of psychodynamic personification of leadership is the essence of a warrior. Fear fosters the folly of retrenchment in the primal forsaking of ascending to higher realms of mature transformation. Leaders, by contrast, find their calling in the warriorhood of their quest. For this, rites of passage are essential in the foundation building of an individual adventure. To deny child-like selfishness and pursue self-evolution in differentiation for ascended transformation, requires exceptional courage. A common-sense focus on the necessity of trials and troubles in the maturation, pain and pleasure, losing and winning, are vital to the progression of the leadership process. Election, appointment or drafting to a particular office of life is not a designation of leadership. For a transitioning from infantile narcissism to mature sage, profound choices are made. Meanwhile, as fortification of the “mind” against the contrived consensus of the many, willful assertion of independence challenges the foolishness of conventionality. In leadership, one years for the next challenge in order to learn another elemental component of differentiation. While responsibility haunts every willful thought into motion, accountability demands personal redress. Personal analysis by intensely rigorous introspection denounces the foolishness of immature whining, moaning, complaining and sniveling about predicament, situation or environment. Leaders learn to shun the trifling self-absorption of silly egoistic preoccupations. Among the wiser prospects of an evolving leadership capacity, is the eventual understanding of delving into the depths of the darkness within. To embrace the darkness is what a warrior does. Lesser personalities, from the cowardice of easy hypocrisy and lazy superficiality, prefer the safe and secure mediocrity of status quo stasis. On the contrary, leaders are not satisfied with the motionless and redundant inertia of uncreative repetitiveness. For most, the stale dogmas of ideological oppression satiate the mundane familiarity of collective enslavement. Relying heavily on the intellectually impoverished contrived moral standards, many crave their acquiescence to rules that have no lawful viability. By neither rational consistency, social utility nor psychological efficacy, the vast reaches of infotainment manufacture contrived consensus to assert tyranny of dishonest moralities. From an admonition in the woods near a pond over a century ago, a determined sage pondered the relevance of obeying little and rebelling against much. Outside the parameters of duly constituted lawful constraints, no deviance exists and no rules apply, but for those by force of will does one subscribe. Leaders understand individual liberation. Yet, the crowded confines of mainstream complicity stifle the very necessity rightful responsibility expressed in authentic accountability. As the audience relishes in the simplicity and superficiality of the momentary showmanship, the price of admission is the subservience to a cast of condescending normalcy. A contrived consensus of primal carnality to the detriment of a productively evolving amative creativity, the social script conspires communal sameness. For those who dwell in that sanctuary of wiser realms of maturation and personal liberation, the solemn solitude of authentic mindful innovation is an echo not often heard. The roar and chaos of the crowded assemblage deafens the divine spark of self-evolution beyond commonality. To strive to walk in blameless persistence of determined differentiation is to risk adversity. In an era of leaderless the pretensions, the spew of hollow rhetoric reflects the cowardice of the times. Arguing the tireless climb out of the primordial ooze of devolving social disintegration, in spite of lofty arrogance in political masquerades, authentic leaders relentlessly pursue righteous endeavors. As such, cosmic complicity of human nature and nature’s universal unknowns, defy the woeful ignorance at feeble attempts to understand galactic mysteries. Foolishness often speaks with the subtle sleight of hand misdirection of pseudo-intellectual complicities. By contrast, leaders learn that many things cannot be answered, clearly understood, or easily solved in the vast puzzle of intricate planetary possibilities. On the other hand, many will believe anything, regardless of the facts, and most will resist any form of personal change. Comprehension of individual “divinely inspired creative evolution” is of a highly personal nature. For its nature and nurture, reflecting upon earlier writings of overcoming humanness, “super-heroic necessity”, or as one writer called it the “superman”, must rise above basic humanistic tendencies. Overcoming the selfishness of the original person is a dangerous and daunting mission. Meanwhile, the trials and tribulations necessary to the leader learning process is overwhelmed by deceptive mass marketing. Transitioning by willful choices to higher states of individuality means, to become a more profoundly evolved personality requires self-sacrifice beyond what many can imagine. Most will not endure the harsh experiences of energetic expenditures in self-evolving transformation. Leadership stems from such experiential character construction learned in the real world of severe realities. However, for the weak, timid, and fainthearted, arrogantly ignorant “all knowing gurus” proselytize the simplicity of easy and comfortable answers. For such, there is nothing in the human timeline. As “snake oil salesman” have always been around, their disguises fool the foolish who fancy themselves pretentiously aware of such con artistry. On the contrary, foolishness abounds in myriad forms in an era of leaderless pretensions. For the bravery of the few, those particularly outside public view, or mainstream info-edutainment, the “super-heroic” ideal appears as advertised on stage in cardboard templates of an assortment of celebrities. Typically, actors and entertainers of one sort or another, shallow personalities congregating in the assemblage of mass illusions, exact their magic upon an ill-informed audience. By masks of selfish promotion, for the fame and fortunate of personal dysfunction, the gurus of luminary adoration perpetuate the commercialized enslavement of the public. With few exceptions, and that means extremely few, there is little or no leadership expressed in these spheres. To look here for role models is to search for something not found. In the cult of celebrity worship, whether entertainment, politics or sports, leaderless pretensions abound. Ancient wisdom, long forgotten, seldom passed on to the younglings, forbids the acquaintance with those whose motives are cowardly inclined. Yet, of the post-modern zeal for “selfie” recognition and praised immediate gratification, the pablum of thumbing sucking children in adult bodies bears no reality to the true heroism of those who labor to higher realms. For leaders, who risk the wrath of tentative followers, adherents, collaborators, associates or colleagues, due to their purposed differentiation, the bravery cannot be fully appreciated. As serious responsibility lingers and demands an accounting in subsequent judgement of whatever tribunal, life or death or otherwise, the leader holds fast to his or her deliberations. Proof is the persistent courage to do what is right no matter the repercussions or the animosity of the weak and spineless. Leaders do not suck up, grovel, snivel in self-pity, or whine with scapegoating cowardice. In the tradition of the warrior, the precepts of martial principles, fearlessness to overcome fear and assert the personality of exceptional creativity resides in the freewill potency of individuality. Where it hurts, the pain must be experienced. Mind, body and essence, or spirit or energy, whatever the individual perceives in terms of personal belief system, contends with the dynamic nature of self-revelation. Harmonizing the inner strengths to face the mirrored reflection of weaknesses, embracing the darkness, and generating personal power to prevail is of valiant measure. In a more generic or basic sense, every now and then a “gunfight” is necessary. Now, for those who are frightened and the very mention of the word “gun”, the suggestion here is not literal. Although when it comes to self-defense in the real-world, such could be the reality. Nonetheless, and American wussification aside for the moment, the proverbial “gunfight” at “high noon”, or the confrontation at the “O.K. Corral”, is metaphorical in confronting fearful things. Discourse on the necessity of conflict to assist in personal self-evolution is a diverse matter of discourse. That aside, it remains fascinating when a group gets together to discuss the conceptual framework of leadership. Conversation varies depending upon individual viewpoints, experiences, education, and so forth. Generational diversity additionally plays into the context of the dialogue. A number of personal complexities, personal transformation, and maturation level come to bear. Wiser and more weighty comprehension of leadership are incumbent upon the competency of individual differentiation. Like the proverbial loosely ascribed analogy of the “gunfight”, as each is changing or devolving by their own instigation, engagement with life’s challenges is crucial to the foundation building process for leadership. In experiencing the vast diversity of social interactivity, leaders invigorate themselves through the hardships. For each different journey, quest or adventure, the perceptual configuration becomes unique. Exposure to the harsh realities of interacting with other humans, especially in moments of sheer terror, is crucial to personal learning and private introspection. Diverting for a moment to the wonderland and never-never land of academia, seminars on leadership are fascinating observations in the study of people. Of particular captivating reflections are those moments where generational younglings attempt to “teach” the veteran elders about life. What fun that can be from a sinister perspective. As one would say in the American south, bless their little hearts. How precious that is coming from a child-like perspective, absent the terroristic experiences of intense maturation. And, in post-modern western cultures, particularly in the U.S. the social devolution in terms of profound cultural “wussification” enforces condescending and divisive recriminations. With regard to the public safety arena, less than 1% of the population endanger themselves to serve others in the realm of law enforcement. Adding to that, depending on the references used, about 5% to 7% of all living Americans have ever served their country in the U.S. armed forces.  Such calling or interest in the dangers of public service become the foundational processes toward building a leadership-oriented character. To extrapolate further, provisionally this suggests less than 10% embrace the call to public safety and security services in defense of country and community. So, at this juncture, the passion for selfless service is contingent upon individually willed motivation to purse more profound rites of passage. Within this sphere, serving others in the competence of leadership dwells in these enclaves of dedicated constabulary. Exhibitions of such leader potential in a leaderless society rises among those who endeavor to protect others. And, every day, without complaint or remorse, many take on such tasks. Leadership in an era of leaderless pretensions offers the serious probability for a few to ascend to the higher possibilities of personal transformation. While cowardice, hypocrisy and incompetence pillage the social mainstream, social media, infotainment and political processes, the likelihood of societal collapse hastens human extinction. But for the few, the valiant ones who keep watch over their personal transformation, ascendency to those greater realms of individuality remains in steadfast perseverance. As con artists come and go, and gurus of every stalking leer perpetrate misdirection, the dedicated warriors of exceptional leadership capacity focus on personal liberation. For the courage to resist the temptations of commonality in status quo banality, the knight persists in his or her quest to overcome the fears, the doubts and foolish simplicity of ignorance in normalcy. Embracing the divine potentiality of profound individuation, he or she, or whatever one chooses to be, refuses to cower in the presence of conflicting darkness. Early on, leaders learn that two potent forces, contrived by others with cunning legerdemain, present experiential efficacy or denial of potency. Of these, philosophers mention the fear of death and fear of living a life worth living. Of particular contravention to productive intentions comes in the myriad and deceptive forms that threaten individual psycho dynamics. As some postulates in times past, the “psycho-death” is debility to many, and encourages the loss of identity and submission to communal conformity. For the vast majority, powerlessness is preferred by unity in the herd. Crowded fondness for the commonality of safe mediocrity in the status quo overshadows and satiates the spinelessness within. Yet, safety in numbers is not always safe. In the normalcy of sameness, significant numbers of people embrace the perpetual consistency of the status quo, even to the detriment of their individuality. To this, the leader has additional energies to expend in the inspiration of those who would shrink from their uniqueness. Cowardice, hypocrisy and the dullness of commonality continues to confront and censor efforts to self-evolve. In the process of individuation, the leader continues his or her ascension to higher levels of personal transformation. Changing oneself is of the utmost essentiality. All too frequently, so many reside in the dead zone of inarticulate and woefully deficient realms of lethargic apathy. In this willful collective, or as some call it, the hive, leadership strives to encourage exceptionality and profound unfolding differentiation. While ignorance is bliss in the “collective consciousness” of voluntary mediocre entrenchment, leaders work diligently to foster extraordinarily innovative processes. On a smaller minded and meaner level, albeit jealous and adversely projective, most salacious desire others to reflect their shortcomings and biases. Of this foolishness, the primordial carnality for unevolving regressions is debasingly rife throughout the social mainstream of American society. In a society that values “normalcy” over individuality and creativity, the expectation of social advancement is limited. Of that demeaning superficiality, abnormal in a broader spectrum of group consensus becomes the “normal”. Examples are everywhere. Mainstream “news” sources, as well as social media are widespread with the divisiveness of condescending invective. Rumor, gossip and opinion fall into a more salacious expression of fiction as fact. Viciously, the transition trumpets the inventiveness at any given moment if the collectivist sensitivity becomes threatened. Effective and bold leadership endangers such stability. For the leader, he or she recognizes the necessity of constant vigilance in order to guard against the forceful oppression of “herd thinking”. Sometimes the clues surface in the consensus building rhetoric of “celebrity training sessions”. One online lecture series poses a conjecture as to whether or not commonplace familiarity has become a sickness of sorts. Whereby, as the commentary expresses the admonitions of herded or crowded adherents in the assemblies of deception, ignorance and hypocrisy. On the other hand, maybe all of that is one in the same sense of foolish irony in a collapsing society. Whereas, in the corruption of the mainstream by devolving idiocy of less vibrant cerebral capacity, the many decry the differentiation of the few. For most people, such incursions are a complex mixture of slow indoctrination into conventional collective of behavioral centralities. For this, the meaning of “normal”, that is follower, adherent, devotee or fan, is particularly relevant in a post-modern human species on the brink of an apocalypse. While some may argue the relative nature of intentional conformity, dependent on a number of factors in a given locale, a common thread is citied as to the intent to conform to the “greater good”. To be a conformist is to submit or otherwise surrender to the status quo. This means the purposeful adherence to the dominant perspectives of the surrounding human environment, and embracing the associated belief systems. From celebrity worship to guru submission, across the various institutional and social frameworks, the admonition is typically in favor of the collective, the hive, or the flock. As the mainstream infotainment networks promote alleged “leaders”, the posture of “leader” devolves to less than desirable characterizations. As such, leadership in an era of leaderless pretensions degrades to a lower descent than that historically conceived as a heroic ideal. Leadership expressed by leaders is among a smaller group of brave individuals. On the national scale, there are fewer among such personalities referred to as leaders."
2,The Irony Of Commemorating The Sharpeville Massacre Amidst Ongoing Police Brutality,politics," March 21, 1960, now commemorated as Human Rights Day every year in South Africa, was one of the key moments in the fight against Apartheid when innocent protestors were killed by Police on that fateful day. Today, Police brutality is an ongoing atrocity against humanity in South Africa - a symptom of normalised ruthlessness. In his virtual address to the nation on Human Rights Day this year, President Cyril Ramaphosa reflected briefly on the Sharpeville Massacre - an event in which dozens of innocent protestors died at the hands of Police officers. Ironically, he mentioned nothing about the revolting Police brutality that continues to terrorise many in the post-Apartheid era. ​Just two weeks ago, the nation expressed outrage over the killing of Mthokozisi Ntumba during student protests near the University of the Witwatersrand. Ntumba wasn't even participating in the protest, but a mere bystander who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The sad truth is that Ntumba's death is not an isolated case of Police brutality. This was yet another addition to a growing list of civilians killed at the hands of law enforcement officials in South Africa. Last August, 16-year-old Nathaniel Julius was fatally shot allegedly by Police officers. At the beginning of the coronavirus lockdown last year, 11 people were killed in what Ramaphosa described as 'over-enthusiasm'. Whilst Police brutality in the United States of America last year made global headlines, little do people know that the situation is at least three times worse on local shores. According to the Washington Post, Police in the US killed 990 people in 2018. According to the Investigative Police Directorate’s annual statistics, officers from the South African Police Service (SAPS) killed 538 people in the 2017-2018 reporting year, and 440 people in the 2018-2019 reporting year.  To put the comparison into perspective, South Africa’s population in 2018 was 57.78-million people and the US population in 2018 was 327.2-million people. Police Minister Bheki Cele is quick to turn such fatal events into opportunities for his own publicity. A visit to the victim's family does little to heal wounds, especially since he is the very same Police minister who at some point in his career wanted the law to be changed so that Police can to ""shoot to kill"" and ""worry later"". Former Police commissioner Riah Phiega described Police officer's handling of the Marikana Massacre - yet another brutal event in which South Africans were murdered at the hands of Police - as a representation of ""the best of responsible policing"". There seems to be a severe lack of accountability, perhaps even encouragement of brutality from top cops to some extent. The result? An ongoing massacre of innocent lives. South Africans will continue fearing the very same people who are meant to protect them as officers easily dodge accountability. Achieving justice for victims of Police brutality is a tiring, difficult, and nearly impossible, task because IPID - who is tasked with ensuring justice for victims - is acutely understaffed and underfunded. It is a shame that Ramaphosa spoke about the horror that was the Sharpeville Massacre but failed to acknowledge the very fact that Police brutality is an ongoing, harsh reality which South Africans grapple with to this date. A powerful resolution to hold guilty officers accountable and a deeper commitment from the powers that be to eradicate Police brutality is long overdue. As South Africans, we cannot allow negligent officers to wage an undeclared war against innocent civilians. We cannot accept Cele's publicity stunts and certainly cannot allow Ramaphosa to let us think that incidents of Police brutality are merely acts of 'over-enthusiasm'."
3,1. Domestic terrorism in the US.,politics," Domestic Terrorism in the United States Mustapha Kulungu, Ph.D. ILM Foundation Institute of Los Angeles ABSTRACT Domestic terrorism involves violence against the civilian population or infrastructure of a nation- often, but not always, by citizens of that nation. The main agenda behind this is to intimidate, coerce, or influence national policy. There is a need to explore and understand domestic terrorism in the United States, including various organizations and anti-government extremists. It is noted that there is increased political extremist groups in the United States.  However, in the 21st century, technological tools have affected domestic extremism recruitment. A July document from the FBI estimated that there were roughly 15,000 websites and web forums that support terrorist activities. Around 10000 of them maintained plots, and attacks by foreign-inspired homegrown violent jihadists have earned more media attention. The US government reacted significantly, enhancing its counter-terrorism efforts. My analysis of the level of extremism in the United States and future trends and threats as it relates to domestic extremist groups Extremism is primarily used in a religious and political sense to refer to an ideology that is considered to be far outside the mainstream attitudes of a society. FBI’s public formulation of extremism suggests two components. First, extremism involves having a particular ideology. Second, it also includes a criminal activity to advance these ideologies. A few issues make it hard to grasp the breadth of domestic terrorism activity in the US. First, counting the number of terrorist plots, in general, has been difficult. Second, there may be ambiguity in the investigative process regarding exactly when the criminal activity becomes domestic terrorism. Third, the federal government appears to use the terms 'terrorist' and 'extremist' interchangeably when referring to domestic terrorism (Doosje et al., 2013). Finally, and most importantly, which specific groups are and should be considered domestic terrorist organizations? The US government does not provide a public answer to this question. Instead, the federal government defines the issue in terms of ""threats,"" not groups. Recent studies, investigative reports, and intelligence products show that non-Islamic domestic terrorist groups, militias, and sovereign citizens may pose a more significant threat than the Islamic extremist groups. A January 2009 I&A report states that left-wing extremism activities, particularly cybercrimes, will increase over the next decade. Also, a report from April 2009 on domestic right-wing warns of increasing recruitment and radicalization. The second group is the Violent Domestic Islamic Extremists are a growing threat –foreign fighters train and recruit Americans to fight for their cause either overseas against fellow Americans or by returning home and continuing their terrorist activities. It is estimated that 100-200 American individuals travel to Iraq and Syria to join a dissident organization. The third group, Active shooters and lone wolf offenders, most successful and most feared as the standard method of attack is the use of firearms. Domestic terrorist strategies incline to prefer strikes that evade active countermeasures and capitalize on the weaknesses. The strategies chosen by domestic terrorists have become more deadly gradually, a drift that could linger for many years to come if nothing robust is done to counter it. Additionally, the Internet is a double-edged sword in the fight against terrorism because all terrorists have maximized its use for their advantage (Brennan et al., 2015). Consequently, social constructs and sentiment, and high-tech vicissitudes will meaningfully continue to impact the overall character of the domestic terrorist threat. The existing research on domestic terrorist occurrence categories stipulates that ideology categorically plays a significant role in an offender's kind of attack. In the United States, right-wing domestic terrorists have commonly targeted those they believe as responsible for threats related to religious, political, or racial issues (Hewitt, 2003). Right-wing domestic terrorists have used various forms of attack that are likely perpetrating damage against individuals or locations that they common, including armed assaults, bombing/explosion attacks, and so on. In essence, the danger of domestic terrorism in the United States will result in augmented counterterrorism participation for all branches of government, from local, state to federal law enforcement, and every citizen to work together in eradicating the threat of religious extremism (Pratt, 2010). In summary, the domestic terrorism situation in the United States is dynamic and encompasses far more threats and extremist groups than in the past. Combating the domestic terrorist is complex. Entities such as the federal government, Department of Justice (DOJ), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Homeland security (DHS) should focus more on prevention, detection, investigation, interdiction, and mitigation of domestic terrorism in the United States. What has contributed to the rise of political extremist groups in the United States? Why do individuals feel they are disenfranchised from their government? Political extremists also referred to as either far-right terrorism or right-wing terrorism aims to overthrow governments and replace them with nationalist or fascist regimes. Far-right attacks include using simple to acquire, easy to use, and requires little preparation. Political extremist groups often take inspiration from Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, although the groups frequently lack a rigid ideology. The number of terrorist attacks by far-right perpetrators rose over the past decade. It is growing more than quadruple from 2016. People feel disenfranchised from the government when the political voice is limited and experience economic precariousness (Doosje et al., 2013). The expression and mobilization of political views have been much facilitated by the extraordinary growth of information and communication technologies (ICTs). Estimated three-quarters of the world population, the United States included, now have access to 'right to information laws. Several factors may have contributed to the growth of Far-right attacks. First and foremost, right-wing extremists are increasingly using the Internet and social media to issue propaganda statements and organizing travels to attend and other events, raise funds, recruit members to coordinate training (including combat training), and communicate with others. The Internet and social media provide an unpatrolled opportunity to reach a broader audience (Taylor et al., 2014). One Islamic State defector noted, ""The media people are more important than the soldiers…"" The Islamic State, other Salafi-jihadist organizations like al-Qaeda, have used social media to recruit. Secondly, the proliferation of Lone wolves, like ISIS, has encouraged more supporters to carry out their US attacks. When individuals feel oppressed, and under economic pressure, they get disenfranchised. This feeling, either economically or socially disenfranchised, is the biggest recruiting tool for extremist groups (Jasko et al., 2017). When a generation spends more time alone than the previous cohort, they get eager for connection and meaning. This causes vulnerability to rhetoric that promises them a sense of belonging, purpose, and a way to contribute to a cause more significant and better than themselves. Third, right-wing extremism is increasingly traveling overseas to meet and exchange views with like-minded individuals. For example, several Rise Above Movement members (RAM) traveled to Germany, Ukraine, and Italy to celebrate Adolf Hitler's birthday and meet with other members of the European white supremacist group (Gruenewald et al., 2013). These foreign connections provide US-based groups with an opportunity to improve their tactics, develop better counter-intelligence techniques, harden their extremist views, and broaden their global networks. Why do individuals feel they are disenfranchised from their government? The feeling of being forgotten is just another means to convey Americans' entrenched suspicion about the federal government. There is growing frustration with politicians in Washington, and nearly every poll illustrates the resentment. Consequently, the federal government's doubt relates to the logic that politicians — liberals and conservatives — are incapable of working together by finding the middle ground on issues that matter to most of the working class of Americans (Horgan, 2008). To sum up, stopping right-wing extremism will require a multi-pronged solution. The Us government should emphasize increased law enforcement solutions. Remind people what the core values of democracy are and what it means to live in an inclusive democracy — school programs and educational initiatives that increase empathy and cross-cultural understanding. The radicalization process of individuals into extremist groups McCauley and Moskalenko (2008) Radicalization, from the point of descriptive view, refers to the change in beliefs, feelings, and behaviors that justify intergroup violence and the demand for sacrifice in defending the group. Religious violence is violence motivated by, or in reaction to, religious precepts, texts, or doctrines of a target or attacker. Ranstorp (1996) found the extent to which people experience deprivation as individuals and as a group member predicts the radical belief system's determinants. One of these determinants is perceived injustice, which in this model indicates perceived societal disconnectedness, defined as a perception that an individual does not belong to society's mainstream, an idea that feeds violent attitudes. Hogg and Adelman (2013) postulate that people are motivated to reduce self-uncertainty, specific feelings of uncertainty about their lives, future, and uncertainty about themselves and their identity. One way to solve this problem of self-uncertainty is group identification. Individuals use the groups that they are part of to define their self-concept. The radicalization process starts with an individual grievance that they have been personally wronged or victimized and seeks revenge for experiences (Triandis, 2008). They combine personal grievances with political grievances –an individual seeks to revenge or protect a group in response to political trends viewed as threatening that group. The slippery slope represents gradually after an individual engages in increasingly radical behavior as he/she integrates into a radical group or organization. Then joins the radical group, also known as the power of love: an individual joins a militant group due to the pull of romantic or comradely love and participates in the group's activities to sustain those relationships (Wikström et al., 2017). Islamic religion all over the world has been alleged as the gravest architect of religious violence vis-à-vis terrorism. Therefore, Senghal (2003) suggests that Muslims continue to push their communities into medieval practices, and as such, they pose a challenge to communal harmony and perpetuate the backwardness of their community. Therefore, the clash of civilizations is being provoked by Islamists in many parts of the world. In this direction, Avolos (2005) asserts that religions cause religious terrorism or that religion creates an imagery supply of sacred resources over which human being contends. Within the radical group, high-risk behavior, if successful, offers a pathway to status; this is known as the Risk and Status stage. Individuals are motivated to become radicalized based on an opportunity to increase their economic and social rank within the community. Extremist groups are offered compensatory employment, protection, and protection from local violence. The unfreezing stage, the final step: loss of social connection opens an individual to new ideas and a new identity, individuals may begin to associate with, unlike parties. The relation between the various religions of the world has often been hostile. Hard to miss the news about conflicts between Jews and Muslims, between Muslims and Hindus. Islamic faith all over the world has been alleged as the gravest architect of religious violence vis-à-vis terrorism. Muslims continue to push their communities into medieval practices, and such, they pose a challenge to communal harmony. Therefore, the clash of civilizations is being provoked by Islamists. Christianity had had a fairer share of religious tensions in human history. Hence, Christians have persecuted Jews and fought wars against Muslims. Within Christianity, there have been internecine wars, mainly between Roman Catholics and Protestants. To put it briefly, now having incriminated most of the world religions with the act of violence and terror, most people's opinion is that the contemporary facade of terror against humanity is essentially religious. However, to merely close, the matter at this point will violate the spirit of democracy in our time. Therefore, we turn our attention to the opinion of the minority or, instead, the unpopular argument. How do 21st technology tools such as social media affect and impact domestic extremism recruitment, membership, and sustained impact? Technology is the foundation of modern society, it governs its dynamics, and therefore, it is also expected that terrorism will benefit from it.  Intelligence and law enforcement agencies worldwide are warning about possible terrorist attacks in the major cities. Cyberspace is an environment without boundaries, a privileged place where terrorists find resources, make propaganda activities, and from which it is possible to launch attacks against enemies everywhere in the world. The experts explained that in 1998, the number of websites containing terrorist material was twelve. In 2003, they counted 2,650 sites, and in September 2015, the total amount reached 9,800.  The data leaves no doubts: the terrorist organizations are looking with increasing interest to the Internet. A commonly voiced public concern is the process of internet/social media radicalization, which has emerged as a finding in some research (Aly, 2014; Haider, 2015). However, they also question why there is no more radicalization; if so, many people are introduced to radical ideas online. Brennan et al. (2015) find that internet radicalization is viable in conjunction with other factors, but not alone. Some have found that observing gory propaganda films online in a group leads to radicalization (MPAC, 2014; Bartlett & Miller, 2012) The Internet offers simple access to the global stage; terrorists can reach the masses or targets specific groups of individuals. The use of the Internet is cheap –terrorists can arrange and carry out efficient propaganda campaigns without economic struggle, meaning with a very low budget (Taylor et al., 2014). The Internet, and generally speaking technology, could be exploited by terrorist organizations for several purposes, such as propaganda, recruitment, mobilization, fundraising, data mining, secure communication, cyber-attacks software distribution, buying fake documents, and training. Groups like ISIS demonstrated a great mastery of the technology and an in-depth knowledge of communication techniques.  New social platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and media services such as YouTube are manipulated to send images of high emotional impact to specific audiences. The language they use is direct. The messages are accessible even to the young generation. This aims to influence their think and choose to be new members of the groups.  On the Internet, it is possible to find any training material, including manuals to prepare chemical weapons and bombs (Lake, 2002). Experts have also discovered documents containing the instructions for kidnappings and techniques of torture. Once again, the technology assumes a crucial role for terrorists that also share manuals for optimizing the use of social media and communication platforms, avoiding monitoring operated by Intelligence agencies. Experts from the Ghost Security Group discovered a new Android App for encrypted communication that integrates other mobile applications specifically developed to share propaganda content and recruiting material (Ghosh et al., 2009). In many cases, the members of groups of terrorists also use a mobile app available on the market and implement end-to-end encryption, including simplified messaging chats like Telegram or Signal. ISIS is trying to recruit hackers and experts to involve them in their hacking campaigns. References Avalos, H. (2005) Fighting Words: The Origins of Religious Violence. New York: Prometheus.

4,Capital Punishment: How Money And Power Reshapes Societies,politics," In a capitalist system, money is inextricably linked with power – the more money you have, the greater influence you wield. In particular, purchasing power can become political power when the wealthy use their resources to assume positions in the corridors of influence through attending elite private schools, exclusive social clubs, or networking events where they can form connections with other monied interests. The wealthy can also attain political control by either bankrolling those already in power who hold opinions favourable to them, by using expensive PR and marketing campaigns to shift public opinion in ways which suit their interests, or by forming pressure groups to influence politicians directly, among any number of other methods. There are many different names given to this phenomenon – corporate lobbying, nepotism, corruption, cronyism, ‘the old boys club’, bribery, sleaze – and lots more, but all of these terms describe the same behaviour. Namely, those with substantial levels of wealth are able to leverage these resources to shape societies in ways which fit their interests. A prime example of this comes in the examples of the Koch brothers and the Mercer family. Charles and David Koch are American billionaires and the primary owners of the second largest privately held company in the United States. Since 1953, they, their family members, and several other extraordinarily wealthy donors have spent many hundreds of millions of dollars (probably even several billion dollars) on setting up think tanks and political action committees to pursue the Koch brothers’ political agenda of deregulation, low taxation, reduced environmental protections, and more. Meanwhile, the Mercer family have also been major funders of right-wing publications and think tanks in the USA such as Breitbart News, the Heritage Foundation, and the Cato Institute – among scores of others. On the other side of the political spectrum, the Hungarian billionaire George Soros founded the Open Societies Foundation and is thought to have donated over $32 billion to this organisation since its inception. Due to the Open Societies Foundation’s support and aid for refugees seeking asylum in Western nations, along with its lobbying for pathways to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the USA and other countries, George Soros has become a villainous figure for much of the European and American right-wing. ‘The Strong Will Do What They Have The Power To Do, And The Weak Will Accept What They Must Accept’ – Thucydides, The Melian Dialogue The theme of those with financial power using it politically to further their own interests is sometimes combined with military power. Consider the example of the United Fruit Company. Before WW2, the United Fruit Company was able to establish highly lucrative operations throughout Latin America due to the dictators of these nations guaranteeing them an advantageous business environment through such measures as repressing labour rights, offering tax incentives, and providing land grants. Then, in 1944 United Fruit began experiencing difficulties in Guatemala – one of their most important bases. The Guatemalan President, Jorge Ubico, a dictator closely aligned with US interests and an enthusiastic supporter of the United Fruit Company, was deposed in a popular uprising. Over the next 10 years, several of the Presidents to follow Ubico enacted land reform measures which returned vast swathes of land owned by United Fruit back to the Guatemalan people. By 1954, the United Fruit Company had seen enough, and heavily lobbied the American government to take action. Partly due to the fact that several of US President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s staff had ties to United Fruit, they were only too happy to oblige. As a result, the CIA orchestrated a successful coup in Guatemala which deposed the elected President and installed another dictator who was more amenable to American interests. What followed was four decades of brutal civil war between Guatemala’s dispossessed poor and a succession of US-backed dictators, which left 200,000 civilians dead. In March 1999, US President Bill Clinton finally apologised to the Guatemalan government for the atrocities committed by the American-backed dictatorships, saying that ‘for the United States it is important I state clearly that the support for military forces and intelligence units which engaged in violence and widespread repression was wrong.’ However, Guatemala was by no means an isolated case. The trail of destruction and bloodshed which the United Fruit Company – together with their powerful allies in government and in the military – left across a series of Latin American states is almost staggering in its scale. Not So Long Ago, Not So Far From Home Examples of corporate interests becoming political and military interests too are by no means confined to little-considered Latin American states in long-gone decades. For instance, over several years in the late-1960s to mid-1970s, individuals from the British security services, senior ranks of the military, and well-connected political circles, covertly plotted to overthrow Harold Wilson, the elected Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and install in his place a coalition government of their choosing. To most, such a conspiracy sounds extraordinary, but confirmation came from MI5 whistleblower Peter Wright, who outlined the plot in his book Spycatcher, which on its release in 1987 was banned from publication in England. Others who have verified accounts of the plot against Wilson include Hugh Cudlipp, the former editor of the Daily Mirror, and the former intelligence officer Brian Crozier. It is thought that the conspirators had a specific individual in mind to lead this unelected government – none other than Lord Mountbatten, a relative of both the Queen and Prince Phillip. As Patrick Sawer, a Senior News Reporter at the Daily Telegraph has written: Lord Mountbatten came dangerously close to leading a cabal of industrialists, generals and tycoons plotting a coup against an elected Labour government…The 1968 plot was designed to replace Prime Minister Harold Wilson with a coalition government to bring the country together, during what Mountbatten and the conspirators regarded as a time of national crisis. These events were featured in Season 3 Episode 5 of the TV series The Crown, which was appropriately titled ‘Coup’. A similar plot was hatched in the USA in 1933. After the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had pledged to abandon the gold standard and enact a raft of left-wing economic policies which became known as the ‘New Deal’, magnates behind huge corporations such as Chase Bank, Standard Oil, General Motors, Goodyear, Dupont, Heinz, and others, conspired to recruit a private army of up to half a million military veterans to overthrow Roosevelt’s government and install a fascist leadership in his place. This became known as the ‘Business Plot’, and the conspirators approached Major General Smedley Butler – a 34 year veteran of the US Marine Corps, who at the time was the most decorated marine in US history – to lead their private army. However, Butler had become disillusioned by his experience in the US military, and not only did he refuse to participate in the plot, he testified about it before the United States House of Representatives in 1934. Despite Congress concluding that they were ‘able to verify all the pertinent statements made by General Butler’, no-one was ever prosecuted, nor were any of the main figures accused of involvement in the plot called to testify before Congress. Shortly after, in 1935, Smedley Butler released a book entitled War Is A Racket – the summary of which reads: War is a racket. It always has been. It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only one international in scope. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives. A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. Only a small ‘inside’ group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many. Out of war a few people make huge fortunes. More recently, the sequence of events which saw Dick Cheney be Chairman and CEO of the American oil company Halliburton between 1995 and 2000, then become United States Vice-President in 2001, followed by Halliburton then receiving a $7 billion contract in the run-up to the Iraq war which only they were allowed to bid on, is unlikely to be coincidental. Furthermore, in his autobiography, the former Labour Home Secretary Robin Cook wrote about the overly close relationship that the British defence company BAE Systems enjoyed with the highest echelons of the UK government, and how they would benefit from this cosy connection. Cook stated that ‘The chairman of BAE appeared to have the key to the garden door to Number 10. Certainly, I never knew Number 10 to come up with any decision that would be incommoding to BAE.’ As a final note, in 2006 an arms deal between BAE Systems and the Saudi Arabian rulers was being investigated by the UK’s serious fraud office for possible corruption, but following pressure from Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, a former British Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, the investigation was dropped. Five years later, Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles was appointed International Business Development Director for BAE. COVID-19 And The Brave New World It has been well documented that during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, many billionaires have increased their wealth while most ordinary people have seen their incomes decline or their jobs disappear completely. For example, the BBC reported that ‘billionaires have seen their fortunes hit record highs during the pandemic’ while also noting that ‘a World Bank report showed extreme poverty is set to rise this year for the first time in more than two decades’. Meanwhile, USA Today stated that ‘the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an economic crisis of a magnitude not seen since the Great Depression’, before continuing to say that ‘over a roughly seven-month period starting in mid-March, America’s 614 billionaires grew their net worth by a collective $931 billion.’ In truth, income inequality across much of the world had been rising for decades before the emergence of COVID-19, and in recent years the populations of many countries had reacted to these increased inequities by supporting a range of populist politicians who portrayed themselves as ‘outsiders’ railing against a corrupt ‘establishment’. In the UK, the foremost figure to play this role was Nigel Farage, while others such as Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson depicted themselves as brave combatants fighting against an out of touch and uncaring political elite. It is also not difficult to interpret the victory of the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum as a vote against the British political establishment by those who had felt marginalised, ignored, and undervalued by mainstream politicians for a number of years. In other countries, this wave of populism found its figureheads through individuals such as Donald Trump in the USA, Marine Le Pen in France, Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, Sebastian Kurz in Austria, Narendra Modi in India, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Beppe Grillo and Matteo Salvini in Italy, Recep Erdogan in Turkey, Viktor Orban in Hungary, Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, and Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine, among others. As all these populists rose to power even before the substantial upward transfer of wealth from ordinary people to the billionaire class which occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, the question must now be asked – what will happen next, as people all over the world react to a such a rapid and significant increase in inequality, on top of what they have already experienced? Where Do We Go From Here? If public anger rises further due to the existing income and wealth inequalities being deepened still more, then it is not difficult to envisage the wealthy, elite classes becoming spooked and fearful of what may happen to their resources. As a result of this, it seems logical to suggest that elites will retreat to lavish, heavily guarded enclaves even more than they already have done – perhaps existing in some kind of ‘billionaire city’, where extreme wealth is a prerequisite for entry, and where connections to the world outside are minimal. A prototype for this kind of settlement can perhaps be seen in the example of Monaco. A Principality with a population of 38,000, one of the conditions for becoming a resident is to open a bank account in Monaco and deposit at least €500,000 in it. Taxes in Monaco are almost non-existent, and it has the largest police force in the world – both per capita, and per square metre – plus there’s a 24-hour video surveillance system in place which covers the entire surface area of the Principality. Monaco also has the second-highest GDP per capita in the world, beaten only by Liechtenstein. Interestingly, the only other two nations to have a GDP per capita in excess of $100,000 are Luxembourg and Bermuda, both of which are also regarded as refuges and tax havens for the ultra-wealthy. The vast majority (i.e. over 75%) of Monaco’s residents are foreign-born, as wealthy individuals (including celebrities such as Lewis Hamilton, Novak Djokovic, Bernie Eccleston, Shirley Bassey, and Bono) move there to enjoy the tax benefits and other lifestyle advantages. Monaco also has a poverty rate of zero, meaning that none of its population live below the poverty line, while its residents also enjoy the highest life expectancy in the world. It’s not surprising then, that for these reasons and more, Monaco is known as the “Billionaire’s Playground”. If public anger at rising levels of inequality continues to increase over time, and is bolstered by the substantial gains that the financial elites have made during a global pandemic which has severely impacted hundreds of millions of people across the world, then it is not difficult to imagine more Monacos being established in all corners of the planet, where the wealthy will flee to in return for guarantees of minimal taxation and heavy security – effectively cutting them off from the discontented world beyond the nation’s borders. Automation, Disinformation, And Militarisation In the background to all this, technological change continues at pace. The rise of the robots means that more and more jobs than ever before are being automated, and scientists predict that in the next few decades alone hundreds of millions of people around the world will have their jobs automated out of existence. As a response to the vast, incoming tidal wave of job losses and entire career pathways ceasing to exist, some seemingly utopian policies such as a four-day workweek and a Universal Basic Income (UBI) have been suggested by a range of academics, politicians, and businesspeople from a wide variety of political schools of thought. The specified goal is to ensure that the huge numbers of people who will see their job roles either diminish or disappear completely due to automation shall be given the basic resources needed to survive and craft a meaningful life for themselves. However, given what we know about the propensity for monied groups to either campaign against policies which do not fit their best interests, to flock to parts of the world which will not pursue those policies, or even to engage militarily against the ordinary working populations, why should we be so sure that the business and financial elites will not flex every bit of muscle they have to guarantee that they and they alone benefit from the enormous gains in productivity which automation will provide? What are the chances that, instead of embracing UBI and the four-day workweek, these elites use every tool in their armoury to keep as much as possible of the added value generated by automation for themselves, at the expense of the general population? Some methods the elites could use include passive measures, such as lobbying politicians, funding think tanks, or creating UBI and four-day workweek trials which are ‘set up to fail’, so they can then be used as ‘evidence’ to shape public discourse. More active measures could also be used by the elites to protect and enhance their advantages. As we have seen, using military means to accomplish this has not been beyond them before, so it should be assumed that it is something they may be willing to do again. This conflict between the interests of the general population and the interests of elites when it comes to the issues of automation and technological advancement, and of how this scientific progress could be used to benefit either group (or both), was addressed by Bill Joy, the Founder of Sun Microsystems, in an article he wrote entitled ‘Why The Future Doesn’t Need Us’. In it, he stated that: Control over large systems of machines will be in the hands of a tiny elite—just as it is today, but with two differences. Due to improved techniques the elite will have greater control over the masses; and because human work will no longer be necessary the masses will be superfluous, a useless burden on the system. If the elite is ruthless they may simply decide to exterminate the mass of humanity. If they are humane they may use propaganda or other psychological or biological techniques to reduce the birth rate until the mass of humanity becomes extinct, leaving the world to the elite. Or, if the elite consists of soft-hearted liberals, they may decide to play the role of good shepherds to the rest of the human race. They will see to it that everyone’s physical needs are satisfied, that all children are raised under psychologically hygienic conditions, that everyone has a wholesome hobby to keep him busy. ‘Power Concedes Nothing Without A Demand. It Never Did And It Never Will’ – Frederick Douglass At this point, it is more than ever worth remembering the example of the Industrial Revolution, which began in the 18th Century. As machines and mechanical tools revolutionised factories and how goods were produced, vast increases in productivity were attained, and the GDP of industrialising countries rose sharply. However, at this time working in a factory was no easy task. Workdays could be up to 16 hours long, workweeks usually involved working on 6 days out of the 7, and child labour was common. Over the following decades, as the ordinary workers better understood the enormous added value their endeavours had a part in producing, they began to demand a fairer share of this additional value, so they could work less hours in better conditions and receive higher wages for it. It took time, but their efforts were successful. For example, in the UK a series of ‘Factory Acts’ was passed, which gradually reduced working hours, improved working conditions, and limited the amount of hours children could work. Eventually, across much of the world (though by no means all of it), the 40-hour workweek became the standard schedule, while child labour was greatly reduced or banned outright, and legislation passed to ensure workers had adequate conditions and protections while doing the job. Now, as we approach the age of automation which some have described as being like another Industrial Revolution, it is likely we will again see the same debates regarding working hours, wage levels, and employment terms which dominated the original Industrial Revolution. Accompanying them this time will be discussions around other issues such as UBI, the 4-day workweek, and many more. The outcome of this coming age of automation will be uncertain for some time to come, but it is important to note that whatever your feelings on this issue, or however interested or disinterested you may be in these topics, you will almost certainly be affected by them in the not too distant future. Therefore, it is perhaps best to engage yourself in these matters, before they engage themselves with you."
5,The Secret Alien Agenda and the Stupidity Virus,politics," With all due allusion to myth, magic and metaphor, and perhaps even an attempt at allegory, the “secret alien agenda” pertains to a cosmic conspiracy. There is no intent to any references, direct or indirect, with regard to illegal human trespassing across sovereign borders of various countries. In addition, the “stupidity virus” suggests the devolving state of human interactivity as concerns the regressive tendencies to avoid evidence driven rational analysis. In post-modern societies, the allegation is that facts, the weight of evidence, and scientific validation, is often dismissed in favor of emotional reactivity in the perpetration of antisocial commentary. For the satiation of amative urges for selfish intentions, by way of dangerous subjective validation, the force of willful animosity contravenes the progress and advancement of the human species. In short, human civilization dooms its own demise. Many complex factors, intentional, purposeful and premeditated, conspire and collude to bring about the sixth great extinction upon the planet. According to one report, appearing in a well-known publication of a nationally recognized geographic institution, that question is posed to the readership. Will the human race survive the next global extinction event? Answer, most likely no, not if stupidity reaches pandemic levels, and idiocy is on the rise. In 3D comic fashion, the characterization of this willful planetary exploitation is exhibited in a fictional storyline. Along with colorful characters, the fictional short story, as well as the digital artistry, portrays the adventures of a valiant government agent. Her mission is to expose the “secret alien agenda” for the spread of the interstellar “stupidity virus”. Naturally, many enemies arise, including mad scientists, corporate elitists, robotic entities, and politicians. Of course, the intriguing aspects of it all is poking fun at inane social commentary. Silly and unintelligent conjecture permeates social media, 24/7 alleged news cycles, talk show “talking heads”, and mirrors the reflection of the narcissus pool of “two dimensional thinking”. This offering of the nebulous descriptor of “2D thinking” stems from a movie script line from a famous “star-fleet” movie. It refers to the darkness of evil in a malevolent character, as well as the inability to think creatively, with logical application of rational analysis. Further to this point, a major think tank, with a long U.S. government research history did a major study on the issue. Accordingly, the aforementioned study asserted what might be termed “truth decay”, as increasingly the erosion of reliance on facts, evidence, critical thinking, and insistence upon well-defended points of view. Instead, fiction over facts pervades the social nexus and mainstream claims of believability. Emotional reactivity in the maladaptive tendencies to safeguard subjective validation with constant appeals to fallacies of inference. This of course lends facetious credence to hasty generalizations bordering on ethnic, racial, sexual and political divisiveness. Hence, the metaphorical assertion of the “secret alien agenda”. It is satirical and meant to poke fun at stupidity, selfishness and condescending self-interests. Not only that, but also the self-centered and egoistic arrogance that strains the boundaries of believability. Nonetheless, specious conjecture and nebulous notions, absent the evidence, are widely accepted. In addition, coupled with an ignorance of historical events, idiocy raises dangerous potentialities. Simplistic trouble freethinking degrades the probability of meaningful discourse. Unfortunately, most people are not history buffs, nor do most learn from significant historical crises. As such, human nature suggests not much changes and people do not change very much over time. As to evil, this is simply the illicit, unlawful and mean-spirited inflictions some people do to other people. Again, the reflection is that of egregious selfishness by way of intentional stupid behavior. Stupid refers also to lazy thinking or a lack of critical thinking from a constructive standpoint and professes empathy for others, and promotion of the greater good. For that vileness, by neither gratitude or reverence, perseverance or progress, great numbers of people claim the entitlement of selfishness. To this, the echo, the reflection of mirrored conception, decries the very essence of self-evolving ascension. Failing to climb to higher levels or loftier peaks of neural instigation, the death of willfulness covers a grave from which the dead rise up stupider than before. Conflict with constant raging storms of ignorance flood the institutions from one ship of commerce to another port of academia. Foolishness undermines reality. Stupidity also represents other descriptors whereby people in general perpetrate the safe, comfortable and detached mediocrity of foolish behaviors. Some might claim there is a social loss of something called common sense, or a lack thereof. Used here, the term is applied to illustrate the poignancy of how such willful behaviors adversely affect social culture. Absurd, inane and foolhardy conjecture, whether by the news media or politicians, hastens human devolution. Aside from the terminology employed to describe the devolving state of the human species, “aliens” are involved to illustrate the ongoing state of irresponsibility. Blaming others, things, entities, gadgets, unknown forces, unscientific “diagnoses”, cell phones, the internet, etc., one can evade accountability. Acting stupid and finding convenient excuses for ignorance, or someone else’s fault, including criminality, avoids the liability of personal responsibility. The factional, sectarian, and “alienation” of the population continues to escalate into a myriad of mucking about with all manner of simplistic conjecture. Of course, to digress, the act of mucking applies in several ways. For example, if a person ever worked at a horse riding stable, or on a farm, the act of mucking concerns the removal of manure or other wastes from an animal’s stall. Such is a specific aspect of removing something dirty or of no use from the surroundings. To stretch the word usage a little further, if social media, political campaigning or news reporting were viewed as “muck”, then perhaps shoveling out the “verbal excrement” would be appropriate. Informal British application refers to something of no value or no use. Regardless, the illustration is toward a burgeoning state of negative and condescending behavior. Much of the interactivity devolves to a conflicting state of affairs. It is one in which nearly every act or verbal exchange is potentially viewed as offensive to someone or some group. To avoid upsetting the childish tendencies, or non-self-evolving emotionalism, pretentious claims of civility likewise encourage a dumbing down of annalistic thinking processes. The perpetration of comfortable ignorance does nothing to advance the human species, yet fosters the safe mediocrity of fiction over fact. Contemporary fallacies of inference, degenerating into hasty generalizations, hastens the decay of rational well-reasoned search for authenticity. Contemporary “fables, fictions, and fairytales” persist in spreading an array of fictional stories projecting individual and group interpersonal inadequacies. In the post-modern era, while some still blame demon possession for the bad things people do, others find a variety of scapegoats such as alien conspiracies. To sanctify and otherwise justify an assortment of mitigations, space aliens become the perpetrators behind the scenes plotting global domination. One online “alternate news” source cites a researcher’s claim that the U.S. government made a special agreement with a certain group of aliens. According to the source in question, that arrangement allowed the aliens to conduct experiments on humans. In reference to that assertion, the metaphorical insinuation resulted in the overall concept of “the secret alien agenda and the stupidity virus”. As to the necessity to rise above the primordial depravity of intellectual devolution, extraordinary efforts of psychophysical energy focus on individual enrichment. Regardless, while a few valiant enthusiasts embrace learning, as well as personal individuation, most are willing to accept a non-invasive comfortable level of status quo mundane mediocrity. In this realm, the many will find easy seduction to the submissiveness of less intelligent prospects. In the social mainstream of techno-folly and thoughtless self-gratification, emotional reactivity foments the terrors of hasty generalizations and divisive rushes to judgmental behaviors. Meanwhile in real science, not the fake kind found in academia like the “social studies” fields, some astrophysicist scoff at the notion aliens visit planet earth.  For a few scientists, humans are, in all likelihood, too stupid for alien interaction. Then again, maybe they want stupid humans for other purposes, as in natural resources, farming, and “herd” production and so on. Warnings emerge, along with an admonition to be careful for what you wish. How humans treat each is significant in some of the assertions regarding alien observations of people. Hence, the concern of some scientists that when humans colonized part of the plant, they exploited the indigenous populations of the area of exploration. Subjugation and enslavement ensued thereafter. Figuratively speaking, to jest and amuse at the egregious fallacies of inference so rife in social media, as well as mainstream alleged news reporting, the alien stupidity virus spreads quickly. Once injected, ingested or otherwise infected by body fluid contact, the idiocy level rises. To the point that serious debate, discussion or analytic discourse becomes increasingly debasing, the deterioration of interpersonal communication devolves tragically. Again, this is only an allusion to the current state of affairs relative to eroding intellectual processes. In an age of techno-innovation, many falter in formulating reasonable and rational foundations for effective psychodynamic inquiry. Critical thinking is more challenging than ever. As to advances in technology, small groups of creative people engineer those clever mechanistic inventions. These are smart people, but then again, they are susceptible to varying degrees of stupidity once they leave their particular domain. By contrast, the vast majority do not invent advances in a range of scientific endeavors. Instead, the masses of the populace are simply consumers. Moreover, consumerism is grossly obsessive and gluttonous. From a perhaps more sinister viewpoint, depending on your conjecture, an observation has repeatedly asserted the collusion between mass media and mass marketing. Sales, advertising, and consumption-oriented promotions are relentless. As alleged news media sources are owned by major corporate entities, so are the companies that sell products. Large multinational businesses, with foreign investment as well, promote and otherwise flood the means of telecommunications with incessant barking to buy, sell, ingest, consume, and “cannibalize” materials goods. While not every business, corporate, or commercial enterprise should be seen as “evil”, with sinister collusion among “galactic alien” forces, a majority may be observed as dangerously self-serving. Some of which, is not for the greater good or of significant utilitarian value. Of the networks of wealthy, elite and politically connected, a small portion of the population hierarchy control the majority of material resources. This also includes the potent influence upon individual and group decision-making. Where people refuse to self-evolve, stupidity becomes easy. Again, “galactic alien” conspiracy is a metaphorical adaption of intentional and voluntary dumbing down of the populace, whereby less honorable people can control them. It’s all illusionary to poke fun at “anti-thinking” infused with emotional reactivity. For the lazy, indecisive and those prone to magical thinking, especially the uncreative and marginal thinkers, the tyranny of power, control and domination is not difficult to achieve. A studied glance at most politicians and a broad based assumption can be made of the widespread societal idiocy. As such, the “alien stupidity” virus increasingly passes from one self-aggrandizing political ideologue to the next. In the age of the selfie, the narcissistic reflection, through the looking glass of conceit, appropriately echoes the foolish arrogance of modern politicians. A number of mythological characters could serve as appropriate archetypes. Furthermore, the not so hidden agenda contained herein is that there are no excuses for stupid, inept, incompetent and otherwise idiot behavior. The actualization of free will does away with defense and mitigations to the contrary. People are purposeful, deceitful, and intentional in their antics. Deterministic illusions, espoused by some schools of thought within the realms of the “social studies”, serve as excusatory alibis for willful mitigations. As such the alien stupidity virus is a good cover story to explain away the illicit and illegal perpetrations of selfish counter-social afflictions. In a culture where any “psycho-diagnosis” will do, anything is justifiable. Simplistic notions projecting specious conjectures easily explains mysterious complexities. In grips of the stupidity virus, after a brief incubation time following the transmittal of the pathogen, emotional reactivity and dismissive condescension replace reason and rationality. Facts are replaced by the overwhelming reliance on feelings instead of hardcore evidentiary substantiation. From a macabre perspective, perhaps cynical consideration, maladaptive thinking at a primeval level is probably good for a rapaciously out of control consumer culture. For the many who are not prone to in-depth critical analysis, prefer simplistic thinking and immediate gratification, limited perspectives are more compatible with complacency. According to some commentary on contemporary social issues, the environment in western societies depicts the illusion that hope springs eternal for utopic ascension. A diverse range of conditions demonstrates to the contrary and suggests a devolution of the human species. Accusations address issues related to the state of education, as well as political processes, in which it appears people are increasingly deficient in areas of critical thinking. Allegedly, a few researchers are inclined to infer that the population in general exhibits a kind of “mindlessness” that makes social problem solving more difficult. The stupidity virus is spreading. With a “zombified” population, socio-political and economic interactivity grows more and more difficult and contentious in terms of advancing the human species. Currently, across the broad spectrum of the mainstream, the stupidity factor reflects tense and temperamental over-reaction to the slightest hint of disagreement. Confrontations culminate in tense close encounters every kind in which violence may erupt to ensure someone’s immediate gratification. Any reference to “close encounters of the third kind”, as historically suggested in science fiction movie genre, is a passing reference to divisive condescension infecting social media. So often, the philosophical battles enter the picture that eventually fatigue good intentions to the contrary. A few get weary in the never-ending process of wondering if there is such a thing as common sense. As such, to exercise a profound sense of selflessness in devotion to mature and enlightened perspective demands the due diligence of hard work. Matureness, growing up, acting like an adult who accepts the accountability of responsibility, invokes a special kind of courage. Unfortunately, quickly gratifying the whims of juvenile narcissism, and insisting upon the superficiality of subjective validation, gets in the way of being an authentic individual. To seize daring opportunities to transform and be a better version than the original imperfection requires exceptional valor, as well as lifelong commitment. By contrast, to presumptions of maturation, in a “crybaby” culture with a “snowflake” society, speculation suggests the stupidity virus undergoes mutations. In a journal article several years ago, a social theorist wrote of the “sore loser” inclination rampant in modern American society. Instead of pulling together as loyal opposition when one side loses an election, the trend is riot and destroy property. Rather than foster cohesiveness for the promotion of the general welfare, ranting, fuming and sowing discord is preferable. In furtherance of the inane nature of the viral infectiousness, from anti-thinking to “racial victimology”, human regression continues. In the process, often is heard some use of a convenient excusatory precursor to illicit behaviors. This includes things like “snapped”, “lost it”, or “triggered”, as well as other simplistic descriptors. Several others used are broken, cracked, shattered, and sparked. While at it, might as well throw in bit, or bitten, like the zombie virus, very similar to the alien viral infection. However, do not stop there. Include demonic possession too. Use every possible inauthentic mitigation, pretense, apology or alibi. Similarly, rationalize intentional aberrations with a mental diagnosis. Forget scientific validity or evidentiary substantiation. Crybaby culture demands apologies. For the secret alien agenda, the spread of the stupidity virus, metaphorically speaking, is a parody for the anti-thinking emotionalism of a collapsing culture. To satiate selfish rationalizations, ignorance is an inner caricature of personal mockery. With all the potential for extraordinary self-actualization, or even higher in enlightened transformation, many squander their creative ascension. Refusing to grow up, to remain the perpetual child, and insist on the echo of reflective imagery of oneself, are central features of a society edging toward collapse. The advancement of the human species requires brilliant innovations in collaborative constructive problem solving. Pro-social enterprises to enhance the commonwealth of everyone, by way of equitable, selfless and mutually beneficial contributions, persevere to avert disastrous consequences. Yet, for humanity, in all probability, time is running out. Gluttonous conspicuous consumption beyond the capacity to repair and replenish succeeded in reaching a point of no return. Meanwhile, stupidity finds refuge in bigotry, inequity of every kind, exploitation of the environment, and the arrogance of ignorance. Condescending babble spews negativism throughout social media and mainstream alleged news outlets. In lieu of driven by facts, fictitious claims masquerade as “proof” in support of specious fallacies of inference. A devolving milieu increasingly shows symptoms of the secret alien agenda and spread of the stupidity virus."
6,What can we learn from the the Jan 6 Capitol Riot?,politics," As I watched the Trump supporters and rioters wave their flags and break windows and climb the walls of the Capitol building on Jan 6, I wasn’t surprised at all. I have suspected that a certain segment of Trump supporters were fully capable of such behavior for many different reasons. If you study the footage inside the Capitol you will see one person carrying a huge Confederate flag and many others carrying printed signs saying, ”Stop the Steal”. One huge homemade banner says, ”Jesus is my Savior, Trump is my President”. Smaller signs, symbols and pieces of clothing display Qanon, MAGA, and Militia symbols. Many men are in military garb with backpacks and helmets. Many are using their Trump and US flag poles as weapons against the small force of Capitol Police who are NOT in riot gear and have tiny cans of pepper spray or mace. They seem afraid to draw their weapons because they are outnumbered by at least 100 rioters for each policeman. It is clear that a man tattooed and painted from head to toe and wearing a Viking helmet with sharp bull horns and carrying a huge spear, is screaming and chanting. This man has since been arrested so we know that he claims to be a Qanon Shaman who now has a lawyer who claims that his client is mentally ill. The FBI will continue to arrest people who are easily identified by the video footage and cell phone pictures which are numerous and have date, exact time and location printed on them. Rioters tried to beat up journalists and steal cameras but many people, including the rioters, also took pictures. Some people may have looked like thugs but they were proud of what they were doing. They obviously came from many different backgrounds and places.  They were all there because of one man: Donald Trump, who had given the order to get to the Capitol and fight, just before the crowd rushed toward this very building. We may never fully understand what motivated EACH one of these people to come to Washington DC  prepared for a riot or revolution, but it is already clear that many have said that they were,” Taking their country Back” by keeping Donald Trump in power. People said that the election was fraudulent and they believe Trump won, because that was declared by him repeatedly.  Some screamed, “ Kill Mike Pence”, who at that very moment was being rushed to safety by the Secret Service and Capitol Police. Others were looking for Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders who were also evacuated moments before rioters broke into the House and Senate Chambers and several offices of key Democrats to steal things and photograph documents. Since WWII, we have never seen a riot like this on US soil. We have seen individuals (like Timothy McVeigh) bomb or attempt to bomb government buildings. We have seen criminals commit arson and kill policemen. We have seen many mass shootings at schools and public spaces. Each time we have been shocked, but at the same time somewhat relieved to discover that these people appeared to be insane and usually acting alone. KKK violence and more recently the Charlottesville events are revealing that more organized hate groups are forming more frequently.  We have failed to realize that crowds of people could be incited to not only riot, but to attempt to kill elected officials and their security personnel. There have been many more killings of US citizens carried out by white male Americans than by foreign born individuals.  How do we end this increase in domestic terror and its threat to the “unalienable…rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” for all Americans? We need to arrest these rioters, but are they the only ones that we must hold accountable? If most of them are mentally ill and delusional, we must ask ourselves why and how did they all gather at the Capitol steps on Jan 6 ? Why were police and security officials and journalists threatened and beaten by so MANY different people? What was motivating these people?  As people are arrested and interviewed, we will gather more information and we must analyze it carefully to understand the answers. Would any if this riotous and criminal behavior have happened if Trump himself and other Republican leaders had admitted that Trump lost the Election and Biden had won fairly by over seven million real votes cast by real US citizens? We need all forms of media to report the actual statements of rioters. We need to demand facts about the actions of their leaders. We  need to demand honesty and integrity from all our government officials.  Every citizen must think about how to prevent more violence, so  here are a few suggestions: First - Two recounts done by Republican officials in Georgia showed NO voter fraud and only minor differences of a few hundred votes. Also more than 55 court cases were filed by Trump and his lawyers and these cases found ONLY small numbers of voters who cast ballots fraudulently. There were NO instances of poll workers making errors in counting or reporting or shredding the votes in any states that Biden won.  We need transparency and truth in government AND in any media that is charged with reporting these facts, so we can know the truth and not be confused by misinformation. This is how democratic governments retain their legitimacy. Second -  State republican officials repeatedly refused to change  the vote count in GA after 2 recounts and officially certifying the vote for that state. Weeks later Trump tried to convince these officials in a taped phone call, to “add 11,000 votes” for him and to “change the official vote count”. We need to hold Trump accountable and anyone else who commits any attempt to commit massive election fraud accountable. This is how we establish faith in our voting system and faith in the certification of election results at all levels of government. Otherwise the media and losers who refuse to concede, can confuse the public and take power away from the citizens who vote. Democracy starts to die when this happens. Third -  Trump and Republicans used voter fraud claims in order to raise money for their future campaigns. Campaign finance laws allow Trump (and the Republican Party) to keep much of this money for personal use. We need campaign finance laws that encourage candidates who want to be public servants and discourage candidates who desire wealth, power, and fame and who listen only to their wealthiest donors. Fourth -  Trump and several other Republicans repeatedly asked their supporters to come to the Capitol and “stop the steal”. Anyone who uses their position and power to stop the peaceful transition of power over to a newly elected government official, must be held accountable for this undemocratic act. If this is allowed to happen, the will of the Majority of voters is Thwarted and democracy ends. Fifth -  So far at least one Jan 6 rioter has been arrested and his lawyer has stated that he is mentally ill. What if a large majority of the people arrested and charged with criminal trespass or more violent behaviors on Jan 6, plead not guilty due to mental disabilities? Service men and women who have suffered head trauma and other  injuries during combat must be given more effective healthcare and immediate access to ongoing and effective therapies and supervision if they exhibit violent tendencies. People who apply for security jobs or gun permits must be given thorough background checks before they are hired or trained. (In most states, substitute teachers must get background checks to make sure they are not going to do harm.) These types of security checks ought to be expanded so that jobs that require individuals to have fast and effective reactions in violent or emergency situations, are mentally fit for their jobs and able to be trained to carry out effective non-violent responses. Sixth -  Every year Innocent people are killed by gunfire and are severely injured. Anyone who thinks that carrying a gun is the best way to be safe from harm needs to be frequently reminded that a gun that you own or carry can easily be used to kill you. If we do not sensibly restrict the ownership and purchase of rapid fire weapons, we will continue to have the largest number of gun deaths per capita of any nation in the “civilized” world. We will have more violent crime, not less, because security officers and innocent bystanders will be killed more often. Gun ownership does not promote safety and the freedom to carry guns takes away the ability to have peaceful protests and other public activities. FACT: US states with the most restrictive gun laws have the least shootings. Seventh – Those rioters who go to prison for less than 25 years must receive rehabilitation so that they learn how to be workers and healers, not haters and fighters. Many of them are so confused by falsehoods and trauma that they view Democrats and people of color as enemies and evil.  They need programs that enable them to rebuild their lives.  There are many model prison programs such as the Bard College program run in New York State.  Some programs help prisoners overcome addictions and mental disabilities by meditating, growing and preparing their food and doing community service work.  We must fund these programs, carefully oversee and train prison guards, and measure recidivism and success, so we can tweak or expand programs that heal anger and hate and give purpose to prisoners so that they can return to society successfully. Eighth - The documentary film “Healing From Hate” demonstrates very well the type of help that is needed.  When I viewed this documentary, I realized that it is possible to change the hearts and minds of men and women who have been radicalized by trauma, obuse, anger, hate, and lies. View this film if you know someone who is falling prey to lies told for power and profit and you may discover ways to help that person. It is my hope that we will study and consider some of these solutions over the coming months. Sometimes we trick each other and the media into only fretting and worrying about the future, instead of becoming effective and knowledgeable citizens. Let’s spend less time debating or reading about conspiracy theories.  It is not OK to think people are inherently evil or to assume that nothing can help them change. We all can strengthen democracy, root out corruption, and focus on solving our most serious problems: climate chaos and social and economic injustice, by becoming aware and active citizens."
7,Myopia for Dystopia in the Illusion of Utopia,politics," Postmodern times offer an array of multifaceted displays for the observation of disingenuous and hypocritical behaviors at varying levels of social interaction. In this presentation, myopia suggests the stupefying yet intentional behaviors characterized by exceptional narrowmindedness. The word used here is not in reference to a physiological problem. Instead, the expression relates to the context of human stupidity. To make an accusation of stupid behaviors globally rampant among the human species, offers a reference to the intentional, purposeful and premeditated acts of irresponsibility. Across society, may escape responsibility in being held accountable. Applying a myopic depiction for the social mainstream asserts the narrow-minded, bigoted and intolerant actions of individual and groups toward others. Underlying that is the contention here that humans are not and have not changed very much over time. Using the term dystopia further assigns an additional descriptor that people will intentionally destroy civilization. Human devolution is a very real prospect at some future point. That is of course unless drastic transformations occur. There does not appear to be the reality at the present juncture of human existence. Some will differ and offer arguments to the contrary as hope springs eternal. To continue, dystopia is characterized by an environment that is hostile, counterproductive, dangerous, scary, and all around frightening. Furthermore, such a setting is that which regressively deteriorating in terms of human devolution. An atmosphere of human misery, squalor, poverty, oppression and intolerable overcrowding add to the debasing environmental conditions. Such a world also exhibits grotesque forms of burgeoning consumption.  In addition, the surrounding resources, both natural and human, become objects of detrimental exploitation. Likewise, human slavery takes on many forms that hide the true nature of oppression. In online blog by an intelligence analyst, the proclamation is made that the warning signs of future collapse are out there. Indicators are all too human in their perpetrations. Maybe partly in reflection about television where government agents chase alien conspiracies, the “truth is out there”. The admonition is that the enemy is within us. From illegal aliens, to sanctuary cities, along with insistence upon “tolerance” for everything, the devolution is upon us. The illusion of utopia represents a child-like reversion to an infancy of simplistic thinking. The disingenuous disguise of political correctness provides a smoke screen for bitter acrimony against those who might offer opposing views. In that, the illusion masquerades as so-called “social warriors” who seek to self-validation of their interests over that of others. Seemingly grown up adults act like children in their narcissistic displays of selfish infantilism as though they possess special insight or secret knowledge. As an excuse to inflict abuse, in one form or another, psychological or physically, some will bring harm to others by arrogant self-righteousness. In the post-modern realm that invites the onset of the dystopic future, the term “post-modern” has taken on a variety of interpretations. While some will argue, discourage or otherwise miss the points of emphasis, or pretend a deeper insight, the emphasis here concerns the more superficial infantile views of how cultural aspects should change. Deference contends the smug piety of shallow magical thinking, from a perspective of historical ignorance, for younger generations to feign special knowledge to change human nature. Bygone becomes reinvention. A viral infection has arisen brought on by an alien secret alien agenda. Of course this is a metaphorical allusion to subsequent generations that act in ways indicative of intellectual regression. To avoid saying many are stupid and socially inept, other means of description might be used. Hence, a sci-fi illustration, the “secret alien agenda” to spread the stupidity virus among the human population. Once infected, like a zombie apocalypse, the virus spreads among the population. As a result, idiotic assertions about anything become mainstream assumptions. In what one writer calls a threat to free speech, “political correctness” for example, encourages a profane style of discourse that foments dissentions that curtails productive discussion. Due to ignorance of global historical relevancies, lacking basic understanding of cause and effect, and failing to self-educate or self-evolve, the “viral” infection becomes ominously mentally and physically debilitating. Of snowflakes, cupcakes and cream puffs, the effects of the covert “alien invasion” results in a shallow “selfie” oriented selfishness. Cerebral alacrity falters in such a way that deep thought, creative imaginings, and exceptional criticality of thought, regress to the two dimensional framework of emotional reactivity. Logic loses in the end. Meanwhile, as history annoyingly repeats poor choices humans make, a few make strides to ascend to more ascended realms of maturity. However, other than a small group of tireless hard working self-evolving individuals, most do not change. A high school mentality permeates the mainstream. Mundane fixation of status quo consensus remains largely persistent in little or no progress to an evolved range of enlightenment. As to the greater numbers, condescension of selfish entitlement and immediate gratification are more urgent than collectively advancing human civilization. Regressive behaviors seem commonplace. An air of child-like selfishness seems to permeate the crowded spaces of the social mainstream. From online alternative magazine, a researcher cites the parallels between society today, and the fictional narrative of the 1984 novel. An Orwellian tragedy, the modern enclaves are constructed around constant gizmo distractions and mass consumption. The personal quest for higher transcendence and enlightenment, that which promotes a more advanced species, is replaced by the comfort of pharmaceutical satiation. As some would ascribe a loss of common sense and emotional reactivity, rather than rigorous insistence upon intellectual vitality, transformative innovation of a personal nature devolves. Although one might be tempted to revisit the allegation of a conspiracy upon the human race, such is fanciful notion fueled by feeble attempts at entertainment. Metaphorical assertions abound from Hollywood to the nation’s capital, along with misguided and often superficial public policy masquerading as a panacea to fix some perceived “crisis”. Yes, fix it with nebulous legislation designed to quell the fears of the public so the “epidemic” never ever happens again. However, whatever the scary notion was as in a so-called “mass shooting”, it will happen again. Typically, the more simplistic the definition a problem is, the more often the issue is not a problem at all. Allusions to the maladaptive notions of a “major problem”, “epidemic”, “out of control”, or “health crisis”, are things more properly placed in proper perspective and proportionality. This would infer common sense application of data driven investigation. However, as to the concept of proportionality with an historical backdrop, an interesting finding might turn up. That is, in all probability, there would be a difference in comparable data between that promoted in social media and alleged news reporting, and that driven by factual authenticity. A sprinkling of anecdotes here and there, subsequently translated into a hastily drawn generalization does not substantiate viable credibility. Fallacies of inference are rampant. For the most part of social engagement, the atmosphere is one of insulated, pampered and defensive against the ravishes of reason and rationality. A few, however, utilize their free will, yes, their essential freedom to resist the impositions of feel good mediocrity. Liberation in individuation struggles against many enemies of personal freedom. Of these, the valiant warriors of self-reliance, a Spartan mindset, battle the ruthless socio-politico-psycho-babble opposition. Freedom fighters persist in the diligence of self-evolution for higher states of differentiation. This comes at a heavy cost, a price of psychic labor coupled with physical energy that only a small number are willing to do. Overcoming the onslaught of divisive myths, misconceptions and myopic preconceptions, modern rebels resist imperial condescension. To turn the tide against the myopia of foolish behaviors, and stifle the descent to dystopic collapse, a few work creatively to bring about a modest degree of change. However, it may be too late and not enough. For all too frequently, the pretentious “social warriors”, and the so-called “anti-fascist” factions, inept, incompetent and ignorant in their efforts, only make things worse. As a tiny nexus of humanity insists upon their right to ascend, the vast majority descend to the primal depths of ancient tribal devolution. Animosity, as well as jealously, in the envy of a twisted hope that does not spring eternal, provokes regression instead of progression. The superficiality of the modern era in the collective collusion of contrived consensus undermines at every opportunity to elevation of intellectual ascendancy. Unfortunately, as one commentator points out in video presentation, the “American Empire” is ending. Many pretend to be knowledgeable so long as such pretense serves to satiate their self-centered gratifications. Conflict within fails or wins. To aspire, but go higher, or wherever a metaphor might suffice, demands the constant vigilance of self-development in non-egoistic persistence. Much interpersonal conflict collides over necessary issues related to willful freedom. The liberation to act as oneself, making the right choices, through logic and reason, requires courage. A struggle to persevere in spite of those who despair and condescend, out of their own weaknesses, and stupidity, is an ongoing rebellion. To become better than the original basic version of oneself, requires strenuous efforts to overcome the forces of conformity. The smugly pious and arrogantly self-serving will always find ways to bully, harass and otherwise stifle the creative genius of self-liberation within the individual. Individuation makes foolish the bullies, and mean spirited haters who would trample upon the tenets of inalienable self-determinations. Thinking differently, being deviant, avoiding stupidity whenever possible, and striving for differentiation requires an intense focus on self-evolution. Transformation of intellectual capacity, fully expanding conscious instigation and insisting upon the individuation of uniqueness, demands time and energy to psychically ascend to different realms of thoughts. While many, especially pundits, politicians and preachers of academia or religiosity pretend exceptionality, most are steeped in the reassurance of superficiality. Fakes, fools and frauds abound. To pull off the mask and reveal oneself is a dangerous act of rebellion. Some do rebel, cross the line of civility and anarchy, and delve in those tings perceived by others as abnormal. Authenticity is seldom applauded or admired. As others feel threatened by blunt raw honesty, brazen truth or straightforward unabashed reality.  What should be and what ought to be dematerialize into the degrading subterfuge of disingenuous interactivity. For the vast majority, simplistic notions serve the interests of benign commonality. The less cumbersome modes of personal existence do not demand a serious sense of creativity. In the post-modern sense of commonality, “social correctness” pretends to be fair, just and equitable, and yet insults human intelligence. Transformation into a well-rounded more perfect version than the original self, labors diligently to shun the recriminations of myopic regressions. Meanwhile, cover-ups of personal masquerades foster one illusion after another. By a primal basis of juvenile immaturity, social engagements devolve to less productive processes. In politics for instance, numerous examples in political campaigns claim the smug piety of prideful arrogance. Hypocrisy is commonplace and corruption ever-present, as party lines banter the usual shallow blather. Season after season, with nothing notable or really new, the “cult-like” parroting of hollow slogans and phony memes degrade any semblance to statesmanship. All of which is symptomatic of what might be called “myopia for dystopia”. Intolerance, narrowmindedness and divisive biases, might serve to underscore myopic uneasiness. As to the dystopic deterioration, the erosion of civility takes place as a gradual process. The illusion of utopia falls within the boundaries of that which pertains to the myth of the American Dream. Materiality over morality, or ethical precepts, with a focus on obsessive and gluttonous gain, additionally underscores the descent into regressive interactions. A burgeoning realm of anti-intellectualism, coupled with emotional reactivity, arrogantly embraces the condescension of facts in favor of fictions. Intentional imposition of status quo constraints condemns and confines public discourse to the narrow spectrum of immaturity. Myopia, or shortsightedness, whatever the descriptors, for dystopia suggests the growing prospects for eventual social collapse. Things taken for granted will no longer exist. The commonplace, the safe place, and the comfortable space will be replaced by the terrors of survival. While the theoretical spheres of the “social studies” arena bashes and banters the utopic scheme of “hope springs eternal”, human motivations devolve to malevolent darkness. For a moment, one might imagine a nightmare, a dream world, where the real and surreal collide. Sucked into a vortex of movie science fiction, the alternate reality is that of a debasing rule by the monsters of the Id. Imagine a large-scale collapse of everything people assume will always be there. No gas, no housing, no government, no resources, no cell phones and so on. Failing to be good students of history, many miss the historic warnings of advanced societies crumpling. For the world of the real scientists, not the pseudoscientists of the social studies realm, a sizeable number remain gloomy about the future of the human species. Some will lament this point in time as a crossroads, a juncture for serious decision making. In spite of the scientific assessment relative to the perpetuation of the human species, or devolution and extinction, most do not listen to the warning signs. From an internet science magazine, researchers recently provoked the idea that social collapse is common throughout human history. Investigators point out that the rise and fall of societies is likely more frequent than the exception. According to the aforementioned inquiry, the government-funded research cites the significant influence of a couple major factors. These, they say, play a key role in the ascent and eventual collapse of social “empires”. One is the exploitation of the natural environment, and the other is the unequal distribution of wealth. All of which might be summoned up by calling it stupid behavior by selfish human beings. Mistreatment and degradation of earth’s resources, not to forget the associated corruption and mismanagement, are not the most intelligent things to do. Aside from the greedy and gluttonous self-interests, the gross consumption, the imbalance of wealth versus impoverishment, further deteriorates the infrastructures of human interactivity. In connection to those regressive factors, assuming technology will miraculously save the day is considered similarly foolhardy. Historical reference points offer a counter view to any notions of techno-invincibility. Large-scale societies have come and gone throughout history. Likewise, superpowers are fragile and potentially teeter on the delicate balance of long-term viability. The arrogance of stupidity changes all that. Perhaps a third element in the equation might be the overwhelming arrogance of anti-thinking. Ongoing studies are pointing out the debasing state of intellectual capacity rapidly developing across the social mainstream. A demeaning trend of stupidity pretending to be cute and clever stifles creativity and innovation. As to the cowardice of post-modern divisiveness, positive, proactive and productive actions warrant the persistence of rigorous efforts for self-evolution. Rising above the commonality of magical thinking, foolish arrogance and regressive “adult adolescence”, demands intellectual courage. Rather than wallow in self-victimization, or pretended juvenile helplessness, the individuality of personal valor requires energetic rigors of creative action. Faltering ideations or the inability to engage in responsible and logical dialogue seems to be waning. In a nationally broadcast interview, a college professor assesses a younger generation as being not very intelligent. Actually, the word used was “dumbest”. Other comments include not bright, the “dumbest generation”, idiots, and so on. This of course can be viewed as another opinionated positon of one generation looking at another. Then again, it could be analyzed from a scary point of view. That is, the younger generation, which lacks significant scope and depth of intellectual analysis, eventually inherits the future. Complaints range from insufficient literary attentiveness, such as book reading, to an inability to understand or comprehend history. The unsettling aspects, as well as future consequences, lend credence to critical thought focus on problem-solving capacity relative to politics, economics and law. Likewise, the critical scientific fields of biology, chemistry, physics and others need real scientists. With diminishing ranks in public service occupations, the police and fire services, the military, medical and cyber fields, wonderment ponders the reality. As such, who will enlist in those career fields? Why is there a shortage in law enforcement, the armed forces, and related public services? To answer that, the reaction can be quite negative. A few commentators have cited the ongoing “pussification” of subsequent generations. Some critics of modern culture go further. They admonish younger generations as wuses, pussies, brats and crybabies. Selfish and self-absorbed people are a threat to democratic processes. Little will be accomplished when a majority shuns science and embraces anti-intellectual attitudes. Given the social preoccupation with minor issues on a simplistic superficial basis, major societal problems receive minimal debate. Myopia for dystopia may be the preemptive stages for the eventual extinction of the human population. Distracted by grotesque levels of consumerism, consumption plagues and exhausts environmental resources. In a culture of crybabies, whiny sniveling malcontents, little will be accomplished to ensure a more advanced and enlightened society for the betterment of humankind."
8,Boko Haram: Nigeria’s biggest security problem,politics," Time and time again, Nigeria’s security forces have proved that they are incapable of protecting the country’s national security from acts of terror. Over the last 11 years since Boko Haram’s founder Mohammed Yusuf was killed by the Nigerian police, the terrorist organisation has grown stronger in the Northern parts of Nigeria and other neighbouring countries. This blog looks at how Nigeria’s security forces have addressed the Boko Haram problem, if they have at all. In 2009 the Nigerian military apprehended Mohammed Yusuf, the then leader of the terrorist group called Boko Haram, which was founded in 2002. At this point they had the opportunity to collect intel on the organisation which could have led to the end of Boko Haram or at least seriously damaged their hierarchy. The Nigerian military captured Mohammed Yusuf at his parents-in-law's house. He was then transferred to the custody of the Nigerian police force before being taken to the police headquarters in Maiduguri. It was then reported by human rights campaigners that the Nigerian police executed Yusuf in public view. The Police  denied this claim and stated either that Yusuf was shot while trying to escape, or he died of wounds he sustained during a gun battle with the military. Over the last 11 years, Boko Haram have been responsible for the deaths of more than 30,000 people in Nigeria and displaced more than 3 million people. Most of these people have fled to neighbouring countries like Cameroon. They kill, kidnapped and rape women, while the Nigerian government claims to get dismantled them. The Nigerian military know that this terrorist group hides in the Sambisa forest of Borno state, yet they have done nothing. On April 2014 Boko Haram kidnapped 276 school girls from Chibok. These girls were raped and forced into marriage. Some even gave birth to their rapist‘s kids. The Nigerian government was never ever of retrieve these girls although some of the girls returned, other are still missing to date. In 2018 CNN reported that a breakaway faction of Boko Haram known as ISWAP kidnapped more than 100 girls in Dapchi. All but one was released weeks later, after negotiations. UNICEF recently stated that Boko Haram has abducted more than a 1,000 children since 2013, according to UNICEF. Most recently, 337 students are still unaccounted for after gunmen attacked a school in northern Nigeria, a government official told CNN. A man claiming to be the leader of Boko Haram claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, according to a short audio message shared with the Nigerian media and reviewed by CNN. The Nigerian president has refuted claims by Katsina Governor Bello Masari that more than 300 children are still held in captivity by bandits. The presidency said only 10 boys were still missing, according to reports monitored by a local newspaper The Punch. Boko Haram needs to be stopped before they become a problem too big to handle. The economic climate of Nigeria bodes well for them in terms of recruitment. As the saying goes, an idle mind is the devil’s workshop. With a 27% unemployment rate in Nigeria and the fact that majority of the unemployed are youths who are gullible. The Nigerian government has made itself a fertile ground for Boko Haram to recruit young, jobless, bored zealots to their cause, with a promise of monetary benefits. We recommend the Nigerian government tackles the Boko Haram problem as follows: First ensure the safety of civilians - They need to beef up military presence in Boko Haram hot zones and ensure institutions such as schools, Mosques and Churches are protected around the clock. Security forces must be proactive not reactive to the threat posed by Boko Haram. Find Boko Haram’s base of operation and shut it down- Sounds simple so what’s the delay? The Nigerian government  should constantly be searching for Boko Haram‘s locations. Public knowledge is that they hide out mostly in Sambisa forest which is located in Borno State, Nigeria. The Nigerian government should also accept help from western nations and neighbouring countries. Shut out their supply of ammunition-  If the Nigerian government truly have control of all their borders, how have Boko Haram been smuggling in guns? Nigeria is not America where they sell guns like candy. Over the last 11 years these terrorists have used weapons which were smuggled into the country or sold in black markets. The government needs to shut these avenues down. Fight the ideal not just the people- Terrorist organisations are known to thrive because of their ideals and the internet age makes it easier to spread their poison to gullible youths. History has shown that eliminating the head of terrorist organisations doesn’t stop these ideals from spreading. For example, killing Bin Laden didn’t stop Alqaeda from spreading their ideals, in short it made him a martyr that inspired other terrorists. The Nigerian government needs to invest in education campaigns to counter these ideaologies, both online and on ground. Create jobs for the Nigerian youth, especially in Northern Nigeria - Jobless youths will always be easy targets for radicalisation and an ideal mind will always be the devil’s workshop. It is confusing how the country with Africa’s largest economy are unable to create sustainable jobs. There are so much problems in Nigeria to solve and more problems means more jobs. Nigeria’s has problems with intermittent power supply, none existent water supply network, dependency on crude oil, importation of used cars which cause pollution, importation of bad fuel, poor road infrastructure, poor credit system, poor healthcare  infrastructure, hunger, poverty and to sum it up, unemployment. These are problems the government can solve if they invest into the economy, infrastructure and boost their manufacturing capability."
9,Independence remains an unattainable Lithuanian dream,politics," Lithuanian political activist Žilvinas Razminas in his article “HOPE - MOTHER OF POLITICAL FOOLS …” admits that Lithuania steps on a rake again. He and his supporters called to boycott the elections and predicted the results of this electoral farce. “Our so-called “anti-system” parties have been stepping the same rake for 30 years and will do the same in the future instead of stopping and thinking calmly about the causes of electoral failure,” he writes about the current Lithuanian opposition. He thinks that “there is no “real ""anti-systemic"" opposition in Lithuania. There are only dilapidated, divided and system-influenced party groups whose leaders, as a rule, are selfish political impotents. They are dissatisfied with immigrants and, on parades of perverts, they do not like the arbitrariness of officials and the rages of judges and prosecutors, as well as they are against deforestation, vaccinations, chips and so on. But all this is only a consequence, and they do not even dare to mention the CAUSE of all these evils - the US - NATO - EU occupation and the LIBERAL CAPITALISTIC system imposed on us by them at their rallies or in election programs. Moreover, they sacredly believe in the liberal-capitalist guarantor of tomorrow's and NATO as Lithuania's security guarantee…” He does not believe that all “the pseudo-oppositionists” who take care of the well-being of the Lithuanian nation and citizens, really worth” while “we live in an EU concentration camp, which is hosted by the USA, and the NATO overseers, where, without the permission of the hosts,” almost everything is forbidden. He is absolutely sure that only “free and independent nations can afford to plan and implement their plans and build their future. These pseudo-oppositionists are afraid to dream about the freedom of the Lithuanian nation Their biggest goal is to get a permit to repair the barracks of the EU concentration camp and secure a permanent place at the table of US - NATO - EU occupiers.” He insists that even if these parties entered the Seimas and formed a majority, the lives of Lithuanian citizens would not change in practice. It would only extend the yoke, exploitation and genocide and slow down the development of the nation’s liberation struggle. He makes a conclusion that under the conditions of occupation, participation in elections and voting for ""anti-systemists"" is not only political idiocy, but also a crime. Therefore, an election boycott under the conditions of occupation is the best means of protest until a serious and powerful organization is formed that can actually join the fight against the US - NATO - EU collaborators who have taken over Lithuania. He underlines: “As I have said many times, it is possible to participate in this election, realizing that you will not be elected, only if you use the election campaign as a platform for publicizing and Lithuania's liberation from US - NATO - EU COLONIALISM. It is a pity, but there was no party in the election that would have done so…” In Lithuania, the electoral farce has always been so cheap and so predictable that you had no longer to be a prophet to easily guess the election results in 2014, 2016 and in 2020. I said that the “anti-systemic” party had already lost the election, that there was no chance for any opposition party to enter the Seimas unless there would be: ONE CLEAR IDEA uniting the nation and all anti-systemic parties; ASSOCIATING ORGANIZATIONS; FINANCING. An adaptive, opportunistic path was chosen instead of my proposed liberation of Lithuania from the US - NATO - EU occupation and the creation of a new independent, neutral, national, socialist Lithuania and the reformist path of easing the slavery of the NATO - EU occupation regime, the “anti-systemic” parties failed to generate strategic, unifying ideas for one goal. As a result, the electoral programs of all parties (both systemic and ""anti-systemic"") have become essentially equally dim and unattractive to the average voter, and some have even been completely inadequate. The electoral programs of all parties are almost the same, and no one knows the names of the newly elected ""anti-systemic"" parties, they have no funding, no attractive and well-known leaders and no obvious political work, while the big systemic parties are bathing in money, their leaders are seen every day. The TV screens, the media are in their hands, the electoral falsification mechanism is in their favor, and the repressive apparatus cover them… Who wins the elections, I think, it was clear to the fool, but only not to our ""non-systematic"" parties. He also mentions that people who had something to say were not even admitted to the election. Those admitted were practically empty as drums or spoke only about things, which were dear to the ears of the electorate and aroused unreasonable hopes. Broken hopes are even worse than the rubber bullets of 2009 … It could be clearly seen that party leaders had taken appropriate sums from candidates during election campaigns for a place on a party's electoral list. The author of the article heard that prices have even been set (perhaps still) for the seat of a Member of the Seimas or a Minister… He writes: “The election game is over! The Lithuanian people once again saw the obvious gross violations of the system and cases of falsification of results They will continue, like nowhere else, to work as POLITICAL TRAPPERS or useful idiots playing their roles.” Žilvinas Razminas calls to create an independent, neutral, national-social (humanistic) Lithuanian state. He also underlines that Lithuania should withdraw the US - NATO colonial army from Lithuania; eliminate all foreign and criminal organizations financed by them and harmful to the Lithuanian nation and state; restore friendly diplomatic, trade and cultural relations with all neighboring countries; restore the supremacy of the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Lithuania in relation to foreign states; invalidate EU membership; achieve national, religious reconciliation and the elimination of all forms of human exploitation; restore traditional family values and the right and duty of citizens to defend their country's sovereignty; return Lithuanian natural resources to the state. This article is not only a text or somebody’s point of view. It is a cry of a citizen who is not indifferent to his country and his nation. Though Žilvinas Razminas was very emotional describing the situation in Lithuania, his political predictions were right. The political situation and the state’s future is still indefinite while dependence on such organization as NATO, EU will remain strong. Independence is still an unattainable Lithuanian dream."
10,Dr. Richard Konteh: A Courageous Transformational Leader Amid The Unknown,politics," It is asserted that leaders are made, not born. Additionally, the makings of a transformational leader are defined, in part, by the leader’s willingness to venture into the unknown. This, of course, takes great courage — lots of gut. Courage is not the absence of fear. Courage is acting consistent with your stand in the face of fear — fear of failure, fear of looking bad, fear of being ostracized, mistreated, falsely accused and hated. In his leadership journey, Dr. Richard Konteh has encountered insurmountable obstacles, trials and difficulties that will break any faint-hearted person. His vision and focus for transforming his native country Sierra Leone impressed former President Ernest Bai Koroma to appoint him as Chief of Staff in 2013. As the Chief Minister, Dr. Richard Konteh coordinated the successful implementation of the President’s Agenda for Change and the Agenda for Prosperity. A top enviable position and a row of previous successes in public service attracted the envy of some of his peers, who tried to destroy him by falsely accusing him of corruption (the allegations were later thrown out of court for lack of evidence). He was ostracized and abandoned by the APC Party. It was a moment when everyone thought he would give up, retreat and accept defeat. But for Dr. Richard Konteh, courage means moving forward in the face of such adversity and uncertainty, sticking with his faith and commitment in that moment of truth. He knows as a transformational leader that he will not have all of the answers to why people will envy and mistreat him for being a courageous visionary leader. He decided to put faith forward, never to allow these phony incidents to distract his belief and trust in people. He never abandoned his APC Party. He never abandoned the agenda for change and prosperity in Sierra Leone — a vision he personally championed. Dr. Richard Konteh is running for the APC Party’s Presidential Candidate (Flag Bearer) in 2023. Much of what motivates and compels his actions comes down to his vision for a united and prosperous nation of Sierra Leone, his love for people, and gut, — which means he bet on possibilities, not on the proof of past incidents or results. The distinguishing trait that transformational leaders exhibit is the ability to talk about that which does not yet exist and make it real through conversations. The concept or idea that compels him — this transformation that he seeks to bring about — is not an extension of the past filtered through the present in order to arrive at the future. That’s predictable, and the transformational leader in Dr. Richard Konteh is not motivated by the predictable. Dr. Richard Konteh is creating and designing a future for Sierra Leone that is often thought to be a pipedream by skeptics. But Sierra Leoneans are seeing two aspects of Dr. Richard Konteh’s transformational leadership that separates him from others. First, Dr. Richard Konteh sees a pathway to the future of a united and prosperous country (perhaps a little blurry and obscured right now), and he is willing to stand for that future. Second, knowing that others will have to be inspired to extraordinary action, Dr. Richard Konteh is able to paint the picture of that future in a way that gets others to take on this vision as their own, and this is why he is dubbed “D-UNIFIER”. Dr. Richard Konteh’s vision of a united and prosperous Sierra Leone, and the way it is communicated, is compelling — something that others want to be a part of, participate in, and contribute to building. Instead of something that he can show you, Dr. Richard Konteh is intent on taking people, results, organizations, The APC Party and Sierra Leone to a place no one can see, touch, smell, or taste. This ability marks Dr. Richard Konteh as extraordinary in a field of other leaders. A future that is seemingly out of reach for both the APC Party and Sierra Leone requires that others enroll in the vision championed by this transformational leader, Dr. Richard Konteh."
11,European defence still matters but not for Lithuania,politics," European countries have different points of view on the issue of the EU collective defence and security. These views divide the European Union and continue to weaken the organization. Some of the EU member states realize the need to turn the EU into a real global military power. European experts believe, that in order for European countries to be able to defend themselves and choose their own course independently, a consolidation of national defence industries is urgently needed. For this, the EU needs to create a real European Defence Technological and Industrial Base, which can only take shape through the incentives and projects conducted within the European Union. The EU nations must have defence industries that are capable to allow EU to reduce its dependence on American or Chinese technologies. Researchers found out that by doing so, member states would avoid losing between €25 billion and €100 billion every year due to their lack of cooperation, and could save 30% of their annual defence expenditure by pooling procurement. Defence budgets had already been severely impacted by the 2008 crisis, as well as COVID-19, making EU countries more dependent on NATO to ensure their security. As a consequence, safeguarding the investments made in the EU defence and industry sector appears to be a matter of real urgency and a vital issue in terms of the sovereignty of European nations. Other European countries such as Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia which are not ready to make their own sufficient investment in the European defence, prefer to completely rely on NATO and the U.S. The Baltic states cannot imagine their security without the United States’ involvement, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda says. “All Baltic states are very clear that the United States’ involvement in our collective defense system is a critical factor and we can hardly imagine our 100 percent security without the United States’ involvement,” the president told journalists in Rukla. In his words, Lithuania does not see the aspiration for Europe’s strategic autonomy as “some sort of competition with the US’s involvement in NATO activity”. “Lithuania sees it as NATO capability’s complementary factor, and in no way there can be any opposition or competition between these two things as, otherwise, NATO’s ability to properly do its mission would be affected,” he said. The Lithuanian leader also said he told that to French President Emmanuel Macron visiting Lithuania. Taking part in a discussion with students of Vilnius University earlier, in his turn, Macron said Europe should be more sovereign and invest more into technology, defense to reduce its dependence on the United States and China. “European defense is a phrase one could not utter five or ten years ago. We imagined that we can put our defense into the hands of NATO, but now we have already established a fund for the implementation of joint programs and we have structural cooperation on defense,” Macron said. “We cannot always rely on the power that is on the other side of the Atlantic, which is probably focusing more on China and cannot give us so much attention. Therefore, it’s very important for us to be able to protect ourselves,” the French leader said. The opposite positions could lead to a greater gap between European countries and dissatisfaction with existing frame of the organization."
12,U.S. pleased Iraq doing more to protect U.S. embassy: Pompeo | Apadana Media,politics," WASHINGTON (Reuters) – U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday the United States was pleased that the Iraqi government was doing more to protect the U.S. embassy in Baghdad from Iran-backed Shiite Muslim militias but declined to provide an update on whether Washington was still considering to shut down its embassy. “We are happy that the Iraqis are doing more to provide increased security for our team on the ground there,” Pompeo told a State Department news conference. Washington, which is slowly reducing its 5,000 troops in Iraq, threatened last month to shut its embassy unless the Iraqi government reins in Iran-aligned militias that have attacked U.S. interests with rockets and roadside bombs. A spokesman for Kataib Hezbollah, one of the most powerful Iran-backed militia groups in Iraq, on Sunday said it has suspended rocket attacks on U.S. forces on condition that Iraq’s government present a timetable for the withdrawal of American troops. Asked if the United States saw the announcement as progress and whether it would still follow through on its threat to shut down the embassy, Pompeo did not specifically answer but sounded doubtful about the militia’s ceasefire declaration. “We have a rogue set of militias who have now promised not to violate the Iraqi people’s sovereignty and to take aim at the U.S. diplomats serving there that are designed to help the Iraqi people,” he said. The U.S. warning caused alarm in Iraq, where it was seen as a step toward air strikes, potentially turning Iraq into a battleground in a proxy war between the United States and Iran. A broad array of politicians called on the militia to stop provoking the Americans.

13,Politicians Totally Ignore the Only Free Market Solution to America's Economic Crisis!,politics," Consider the following FACTS. On average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are currently limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. 90% Lack the Opportunity More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government has increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks ($1,200)” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were several months ago before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! In that light let’s recall that on average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4 trillion dollars annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual growth are those who can afford to buy stocks, bonds real estate, and new technology. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise here is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every American citizen (man, woman, and child) annually •	at 0% interest, and… •	allowed the loan to be repaid via future, pre-tax earnings/dividends (not from savings) •	along with a stipulation that these funds could only be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for their purchase and to create predictable, stabilizing, residual incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as “Capital Homesteading,” would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO GEVERNMENT DEBT! It creates NO CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, the purchase would be backed (collateralized) by real, productive, private-sector assets And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY. All money created would be instantly backed (collateralized) by the full value of private sector assets that citizens would receive insured loans in order to purchase. Citizens would actually be purchasing newly issued, full dividend payout, voting shares of companies that need new capital assets in order to grow. What Capital Homesteading Will Do Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ wealth is being generated. •	Create a residual stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not thru labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY, •	Stabilize family life, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it will help to democratize the free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. One Simple Example Here’s simple one example of how Capital Homesteading would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and be generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education along with all the benefits that would follow in its wake. Absolutely a win/win for everyone! In this moment of political division and strife Capital Homesteading literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more residual income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. social security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. More people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who still pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Yet This Free Market, Non-Socialistic Solution is Being Totally Ignored!!! If the Obama administration (or any of its predecessors) had implemented Capital Homesteading, today’s COVOD 19/Unemployment crisis would not be a crisis. We the people could afford stay at home and still have sufficient income to weather a much less severe storm. Yet we’re less than 100 days from the next Presidential election and Capital Homesteading has been totally ignored by Trump, Biden, Sanders, Warren, Booker, Harris, Klobuchar, Mayor Pete, etc. WHY? Capital Homesteading In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the CAPITAL HOMESTEADING ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Capital Homesteading Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Capital Homesteading, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Capital Homesteading creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Capital Homesteading systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Capital Homesteading requires some time (usually a number of years) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Capital Homesteading."
14,Arrogance in Ignorance – The Republic is in Danger - Censorship,politics," In the rampant rage of wide-spread devolution of humanity, particularly on the shores of the U.S., the arrogance of ignorance spews its contagion in diverse ways. By contentious condescension of intentional malevolence, the spurting of non-stop stupidity intentionally contrives to wreck the democratic processes. To save the republic, higher reaches of purposeful wisdom with extraordinary ascensions of enlightenment requires a mature intelligent population. Among this extrapolation of astonishing willful insight, knowledge insists upon the development of exceptional personal individuation. Acute inner analysis is crucial. With a list of adversarial disputations, opposing forces to the right, freedom and reason of free speech endeavor to restrict essential constitutional safeguards. In particular, aside from illicit and dimwitted admonitions from the realms of academia, supernatural ideologies attack and defame essential necessity of personal expression. Among the antithesis of human liberation comes the terroristic psychological and physical pillaging of freedom by extremist fundamental occultic obsession. Led by the weak, the cowardly and the ignorant, selfishness abounds. Politics is but one arena where “anti-thinking” foments the specious terrors of ignorance so grievous, that the viability of the American republic hangs in the balance. For some, perhaps even a majority, indulged in wonderment to consider the probably of eventual human extinction. To that apocalyptic end, the political processes are but elemental factor in an iceberg of societal selfishness. Closely aligned is the cult of celebrity worship. The contemporary idiocy, from Hollywood elitist to Washington politicians, promotes a dumber American society. Most often, actors, like so many across mainstream society, spew the superficiality of their ignorance. Undereducated in so many aspects of the real-world, their fictional fantasies blur the distinction between the real and the surreal. All to often, such actions breach the viability of free speech in such condemning ways, as to rebuke the tenants of civility.  Their divisive hate mongering tears at the basic foundations of the revolutionary spirit of freedom. Given the gluttonous satiation for selfishness, money, power, and control, prefers ignorance. A few years, a British publication asserted the lunacy of the “leftist elitist”. Building a case for the extremes of smug self-righteousness is a trail of clues related to education versus indoctrination. With controversial engagements across the mainstream of society, some analyst ponder the perceived notions regarding a decline in educational ascendency. By contrast, a few agree that the American culture is declining with consequences that indicate an eventual collapse. As opposed to an enlightened constituency of well-educated, exceptionally competent and mature people, a devolution seems more realistic. Regardless of social strata, most of the population appears and acts in very immature and child-like ways. Being ignorant became more comfortable. In accordance with the aforementioned sense of intellectual dysfunction, one psychologist recently echoed a similar theme, by what might be called “American dysfunction of anti-intellectualism”. Asserting a kind of pathology of ignorance, the writer offered an argument regarding the degradation of society by wide spread idiocy. By absurd, foolish and immature behaviors, including stupid commentary by elected officials, a deep sense of disappointment echoes among those seeking solutions to serious social issues. By neither social status nor college degree is there any guarantee of extraordinary enlightenment. Likewise, regardless of educational institution, graduation does not infer the capacity for saving the planet, profound civil discourse or insistence upon the greater good. In an earlier time, philosophical admonitions favored the necessity for higher intellectual achievement beyond in formal system or communal process. Creativity was an important element in pursuing the pioneering spirit of innovation. Today, ingenuity finds few adherents. In a post-modern context, disingenuous behaviors increasingly and negatively exhibit a host of adversarial interactions. Divisive examples are ever-present in news shows, as well as political forums. Emotional reactivity is frequently the choice of actions rather than serious analytic investigations. To insist upon a problem-solving venture by way of critical thinking and logical analysis is not typically the path chosen. A regressive tendency toward immature emotional responses animates an inclination toward promoting conflict rather than compromise. While one person criticizes another for a posting in social media that may violate “community standards”, another vicious torments others for their political leanings. Intolerance for tolerance often depends on whether or not the other person agrees with another’s opinion. In prior times, open debate on controversial issues embraced the free spirit of candid commentary. Now, the opposite seems more likely. Sensitivity to everything shuts down the free exercise of alternative perspectives. At the same time, emotional reactivity threatens factual authenticity. For the purposes herein, the issues surrounding the conceptualization of censorship relates to actions intended to suppress, restrict or otherwise prohibit the dissemination of an artistic expression. Primarily, the focus is toward social media, but not exclusively. As such, the prohibitions, or attempted prohibitions, referred to include restrictions on presentation or publication of various forms of authorship. Writings of various kinds, articles, stories, books, novels and so forth are examples. Additionally, consideration of creative works likewise pertain to movies, films, photos, drawings and other related works of art. Whether an article on a controversial topic or an explicit depiction of photographic art, the matter at hand is the intentional prohibition of the art form. As an ongoing process of social and legal debate, censorship in contemporary social media, including news media, suggests an increasing antagonism toward innovative artistic endeavors. While the First Amendment (U.S. Constitution) is the fundamental expression of free speech, censoring an imaginative arty expression conjures debatable implications in terms of legality, equity, and liberty. Aside from legal ramifications, the implications of censorship are manifold. Indirectly, one aspect entertained here is the notion that censoring an online artistic genre speaks to an era of ignorance. As intellectual capacity, along with a maturity for enlightened thinking, diminishes over time, increased infantile reactivity is more likely. In post-modern consideration, contemporary efforts by social media to curtail selected expressions represent oppression. A “tyranny” of intolerance pretending to be tolerant pervades social interactivity. Another aspect suggests a devolving process of thinking that is detrimental to human civilization. If, for instance, there is a supposition that the human species is advancing, a counter argument might infer the contrary. Contemporary sensitivity appears at an all-time low in terms of overreaction to just about anything. As controversy arises over criticism of an individual, an ideology, or a flag, or baseball cap, a posting occurs on the net to demonstrate outrage. Extraordinary simplification, excessive rationalization and contentious divisiveness degrade any semblance of a civilized society. As such, there is a sense of arrogance in the ignorance. In an article for a national newspaper, the online admonition of American society focused on the commonplace “embracing of ignorance”. Accordingly, the claim points to the current trend of glorifying ignorance and disdaining intellectualism. While believing in something without facts or evidence is one thing. It is quite another to make public policy based on belief. Someone might question which is worse, not having evidentiary substantiation, or denying the reality of factual relevance and doing something stupid. This is where a serious regard for rationality searches carefully among the volumes of psychobabble to question the nature of proof. Solvability of an issue invites the various aspects of efforts directed toward provability. For most issues, many rely on gossip, hearsay, opinion and superficial conjecture that says nothing and does nothing. Frequently, this satiates an inner desire to make idiotic notions valid. Another headline from a different informational perspective asserted a study that suggested people do not like their strongly held beliefs questioned. Based on a limited research configuration form a major private college, researchers sought to assess the knowledge base of the average voter. As related to things like climate change, for instance, overuse of information dissemination may case deeper controversies to arise. Too much information leads to confusion among diverse parties to a public debate, especially if the basis for knowing something is limited. A debasing conjecture might suggest that an entity or external mechanism causes people to do one thing or another, but that is dangerously misleading. Not only that, but also such specious notions perpetuate an atmosphere of ignorance. Such things become a vicious cycle of regressive tendencies for the sake of foolish excuses. As to that, the commentary is often heard about how the “internet makes people stupid”, or how “technology” or “social media” contributes to violence, etc. Briefly, inanimate objects cannot make people do things. Lifeless inert “entities” do not possess the power for such influence. People intentionally and willfully make their own choices and there are no excuses for their bad decisions. However, to ensure the lofty status of ignorance, many will concoct all manner of mitigation. By malice aforethought, premeditation and intention infliction, people do all kinds of perpetrations. Once the blame went to demons, ghosts and goblins. Today, it is just about anything external to the person that receives blame for maladaptive behaviors. Not much difference than demonic possession. Regardless, such human antics do not elevate the species to an advanced civilization by any stretch of the imagination. Grotesque and undignified fallacies of inference permeate talk shows, talking head news outlets, schoolrooms, legislative sessions, social media and the list goes on. Subjective validation for the sake of cognitive bias, absent facts and evidence, supplants in-depth critical analysis based on vigorous inquiry. Instead, the modern malady of social discourse tends to rely heavily on opinion in an appeal to inauthentic “authority”. Such an appeal to the pretention of some source, or someone, possessing the exceptionality of an authoritative perspective, is potentially dangerous. The guru, the shaman, the spiritualist, or the metaphysician, are likely to perpetrate grievous errors of self-centered thinking. As alluded to earlier, in a stardom-fixated culture, the incessant adoration surrenders to the opinion, gossip or rumors fomented by popularity. Using fame and fortune as a benchmark for knowledge and wisdom encourages a larger framework of social stupidity. Because someone can play a part in a movie, perform on stage, or nominated for an award, does not confer enlightenment. Yet, repeatedly, “intellectual capacity” is erroneously ascribed to a star personality, whether movie luminary or talk show host. Similarly, as 24/7 cable network news sources slant toward personal opinion, the greater the probability of shallow thinking. In reality, these could actually be some of the most notoriously uninformed people on the planet. A careful analysis of the contemporary rhetoric reveals a serious failure of fact driven analysis. Evidence seems to have lost its value and necessity in favor of personal opinion. Repeatedly, feelings are valued more. Continuing the commission of the decline of intellectual honesty, a collegiate talk show interview of one researcher expressed disappointment in politicians. Reminiscing the sage commentary of one of the founding fathers, the republic is in danger when ignorance has an expectation of freedom. To paraphrase, as stupid culture cannot hope for a free society. In a frightening reflection on modern society, a researcher points to the foolish discourse found in American politics. Politicians often say the stupidest things. One point of view on this matter of egregious ignorance in political commentary, relates to how such fallacies mirror society. Whether by partisan bias, political expediency, or contrived selfishness for power and control, the lack of intellectual curiosity and analytic reasoning undermine the principles of a democratic republic. Worrisome is the notion as to the trend toward anti-rationality, or the ability to ensure constructive reason in logical analysis. That coupled with the arrogance of embracing ignorance ought to be the warning signs of a collapsing culture. A few would argue the disastrous consequences for the human species. Others aligned with the fear of eventual human extinction would accept the idea that this is the dawn of the “zombie apocalypse”. The debasing nature of stupid thinking, or as some would prefer, “magical thinking”, portrays an era of conceited preference for being uninformed. To exploit that with emotional reactivity and cultural advancement devolves to regressive depths. Meanwhile in academia, the bastion of knowledge and wisdom, a presupposition asserts the posture that high levels of intelligence mount the precipice of human advancement. When the laughter dies down, some argue there is no guarantee of vast realms of enlightenment within the hallowed halls of ivy towers. According to some educators, just the opposite is the reality. One college professor offers an assessment of the “dumbest generation”. By way of little or no mature leadership, trendy vulgarity, simplistic thinking and a host of other intellectual maladies, younger generations insist upon a devolving mediocrity of infantile narcissism. In addition, the contentions, as to a devolving state of arrogant ignorance, falls upon lazy self-righteousness smugly neglecting the rigors of human advancement. A failure to ascend beyond adolescence and insist upon a mature grown world condemns society to eventual collapse. According to some, a small niche of serious minded mature individuals, the “dumbest generation” or generations, do possess sufficient capacity to deal with future societal problems. A fundamental deficit of critical knowledge in areas of commerce, industry, government and educational institutions hastens the regressive deterioration of a democratic republic. One may or may not want to transpose “knowledge deficit” with stupidity. Applying a stupidity factor might hurt the sensitivities of those desiring to remain adolescent into adulthood. Nonetheless, a serious shortfall in socio-economic and political astuteness traversing rampant throughout mainstream society is dangerous. Added to that burdensome responsibility of being generally smarter than average, are the woefully scarce levels of historical ignorance. As earlier writers warned, failing to learn from history is the vital lesson of history. Coupled with educational narrowmindedness, particularly in collegiate settings, along with ideological agendas, the perpetration of “dumbing down” continues to erode the higher prospects of intellectualism. Assuming an exceptionality principle from the realms of real science, there are always noteworthy exemptions from sweeping generalities. However, when it comes to humankind and the maladaptive intentions of foolish behaviors exceptions few. With the political arena for instance, there are very few exceptions of extraordinary intellect, with wise and mature exhibitions of serious leadership ability. As younger generations run for public office, let us say those under 40 years old, where most millennials reside, the prospects get scary. The arrogance in ignorance expands astronomically among the younglings attempting to manage governmental organizations. At the national level, stupidity in spite of alleged college education is frightening. In pursuit of the warn paths of least resistance, asserting the nebulous notions of pretentious offense, the ignorance of the many fixate on the “selfieness” of selfish promotion. Once the unimaginative protest proclaims self-defeat, the unlabored ignorance relishes in the satiation of less strenuous mediocrity. Criticisms rage the hallow failures of critical thinking for the amative excitement of myth, magic and metaphor. Refuge finds company in the shallow fluff of forsaking reality for immediate gratification. Blustering blather endangers the republic. For the gushing eroticism of quick release, the fatted bellows bemoaning the logic and reason of serious thought spew impotent conjecture. As to the perpetration of tired ideologies, reinvented by venal strains of limp minded arrogance, fear of evidentiary substantiation perpetrates the replacement of facts with fictions. Haughtiness of unintelligent, uninformed and uneducated self-imposed offensiveness, breed the illicit dangers that threaten cultural ascendency. Within that framework, the absence of profound creativity stifles the advance of enlightenment. Acting “anti-social”, a word used too frequently in an ill-informed society, portrays an easily chosen means to get what one wants at the expense of others. Given the options, people will always act in their self-interests, which could beneficial or not. Excuses for stupid behaviors have run the deceptive and manipulative gambits philosophies as “science”, to political commentary as fact. Fictions promulgate the deceptive intentions of ill-intentioned adherents, presupposing their ignorance remain unchallenged. As to a majority that follow the superstitions of misguided dogma, the doctrines of illicit ideologies forsake the viability of social advancement. For some, there are UFOs in every mysterious movement in the sky. Others delve into the phantoms of phantasm, where ghosts, goblins and gremlins lurk. From there, the adventure skirts the outer regions of mindful ideations to chase the mysterious manifestations of social dysfunction. In that, the instigators provoke the terror of monsters from the Id. From illusions thought real, which fail the proof of real scientific validation. As gullibility runs amuck, the believability leaps to faithful allegiance to chemical therapies for hidden demonic forces. To perpetuate an industry of “mind-body-illness-wellness” forsakes the liberation of individuality to promote the feeble excuses of the many. From invisible “addictions” to superstitious flirtations, inflictions unfold that oppress and enslave as many as possible. In part, such antics promote the anti-intellectualism rising in contemporary context. As a result, some fear the arrogance of ignorance is one of the most deadly threats to modern society."
15,Phony Appeals to Fallacies of Pretentious Squeals,politics," In the aftermath of a horrendous human tragedy, such as a murderous event, fascination and even puzzlement finds curiosity with regard to fearful emotional reactivity. The living find refuge in fearful and debasing emotional reactivity. Sad, horrific and destructive are such actions of human debauchery, and yet many of vicarious detachment run screaming to the protective enclaves of amatively sensitive satiation. Of pundits, politicians and celebrity proselytes, those least qualified in the reality of human experience, muster the dysfunctional retributions of foolish fallacies for hasty generalizations. Panicked, scared and cowardly entrenched, those who were never there seek to spread their share of sanctimonious despair. While human cruelty knows no boundaries, nor does the foolhardy invocations of stupidly contrived conjecture for the immediate satiation of cognitive bias. But for the bravery of the few, the tiny number of valiant crew, the warriors who always knew, humans do evil and some defend the many in dangerous retrieval. And so, we witness the cavalier personal promotion by incessant internet postings of “selfies”, fakes stories, unscientific theories, and constant texting of personal updates. Regressively oversimplified, cowardly reactive and emotionally dysfunctional, the simpleton of uncomplicated conjecture, exposes the shallow realms of infantile states of magical thinking. For the foolishness that hope springs eternal, the oversimplifications of a society bent on collapse relishes in the degradations of human atrocities. Carnage and mayhem go beyond the actual physical killing of a so-called “spree killer”, or alleged “mass murderer”. The juvenile antics of a self-absorbed social consensus find more subtle ways to denigrate the general populace. In time, a tragedy is forgotten. As the 24-7 infotainment venues speculate for about a week or so, and pontificate the superficiality of opinion, the “deadliest killing in U.S. history” is replaced by some other “news” story. At the same time, most politicians do what politicians do best, pander to the emotional vulnerabilities of the moment. The phony conjecture becomes more pervasive by the myriad “con-artists” jumping on board the contrivances of faulty conclusions to promote personal agendas. Quick to capitalize on the horrors of a heartrending event, from academia to celebrity stardom, everyone suddenly expounds upon their “exceptional expertise”. Unfortunately, most of it is the squeal of phony pretentiousness. In an age of excess, appeals to pretended authority, celebrity status, mythical dogma, and so on, regresses to the satiations of primordial realms. Not much changes as the devolution continues in a downward spiral. For the supernatural, the mystical and the magical, thinking devolves to the safe mediocrity of simplistic reassurances. Many will prefer the lowest standard of conduct, or the common practice of so-called minimum standards of performance. The mundane is called exciting while the superficial is hailed as politically correct, as symbolism of substance prevails. Hypocrisy reigns across the social networks as inexperience devolves into allegations of “expertise”. For the most part, the handful of corporate giants that own 90% of the alleged news media spend the bulk of their air time selling products and services. Regardless, everyone has an opinion. With the allure of pompousness to “civilization”, if given the occasion, the majority would quickly degenerate to the most basic singularity of survival selfishness. Certain institutional deterrents, as in the power of the state to enforce laws, encourage a tenuous state of pompous piety that masks a sense of mutual selfishness. Pretentiousness claims the incompetence of arrogance in shortsighted protestations of unsubstantiated claims. Large swaths of society enjoy their stupidity, as they embrace “celebrity authority”. The phony hallmarks of a failing culture includes that which relishes a lack of knowledge and smug reliance on the fake authority of others. Smoke screens of psycho-socio-babble, steeped in multifarious forms of illusion, conceitedly proclaim the two-facedness of foolhardy self-gratifications. In the glitz, glamor and gore of the entertainment world, two-dimensional characters become “scientists, diplomats and philosophers”. For a price, and the promotion of their fame, they will act for any cause, whether right or wrong, as cover and concealment loom larger than ever in narcissistic fallacies. According to some researchers, in this case those from the pseudoscience of psychology, several offered the disturbing portrait of more and more people displaying psychopathic tendencies. For those frightened or otherwise disturbed by the use of the term “pseudoscience”, the application is to that which is not a hard science, as in physics, astronomy or chemistry. In other words, the inference is toward the various schools of philosophy, in which the purveyors, mainly from academia, cannot claim absolute certainty of scientific validation for their particular point of view. This would include realms of theoretical inference from criminology, sociology and psychology. Societal conjecture, as in mainstream media, many part of academia and political processes, vacate the truth of a proposition in favor a phony appeals to fallacies of pretentious inference. It has become routine, commonplace and standardized in a detachment from reality that circumvents the burden of evidence. Absurd possibilities for witless attempts to substantiate nonsense go many times without question, critical analysis or demands for sufficiency of evidentiary artifacts to prove or disprove an issue. In the emotional aftermath of a nationally televised critical incident, logic often fails as overly sensitive reactivity instantly replaces the necessity of critical thinking. The burdensome nature of logical deduction and rational objectivity falls upon duly authorized investigative personnel. Law enforcement typically are the key participants in the official process to ensure and safeguard critical thinking and ultimate case solution. Because of oversimplification and faulty rationalizations in the simplicity of quick answers to complex behaviors, stupidity finds expression in diverse ways. For the comfort and ease of safe mediocrity, simplistic “answers” are self-assuring. This allows frightening potentialities to unfold particularly where national public policy is concerned. Worse yet, is the appeal to “authority status”. In a celebrity worship culture, as in the U.S., seemingly but superficial, “intelligent” claims as to a significant social or political matter gain instant attention from pundits and politicians. The clamor for attention is hideous. If the claimant of an issue, say gun control for instance, happens to be a Hollywood actor, then certain sectors of the public may conclude the viewpoints are valid. With the need by many people to satiate their own dysfunctional needs for attention, glamour and glitz of some magnitude, the vicarious means to achieve some connectivity is to revere another dysfunctional person. Everyone experiences maturation issues, as most people seem to never get beyond their manifestations of infantile narcissism. In a recent article, from an international online newspaper, the reporter claims that America is obsessed with the “celebrity concept”. Supposedly, this suggests a means to venerate the status of celebrity to a stature of “authority” on a range of social and political issues. Such notions go beyond simply having an opinion. Instead, the inference is that a person of presumed fame and fortune is qualified as an expert in areas outside their primary domain of talent. Skilled in one area does not infer competence in another. Again, a flash back occurs to the various fields of pseudoscience, often accepted without question. In a “celebrity worship” culture, and the inference slants to those with little or no real world experiences, such a notion can suggest a number of aspects relative to the gainful acceptance of those biased in a particular direction. Being famous, desiring notice and seeking validation for the amative inclination of “being seen”, involves a variety of venues. Not only that, with varying levels of self-evolution, or not, people are invariably gullible and naive. From academia to entertainment, to mass marketing consumption, politics and preaching an ideology, salesmanship of personal dysfunction finds many outlets. Bias generally instigates conclusions drawn for the satiation of subjective validation. Everyone brings that with them. Personal feelings, ideological beliefs, and mythic inclinations are just the beginning of the slippery slide into “magical thinking”. Poof, it’s “true” because someone said so. In addition, the fallacy of preconception further colludes intimately with observational self-interests. Alleged “experts”, particularly those who spent decades in safe and secure environments, like academia or movie studios, find all kinds of ways to make commentary about things for which knowledge is limited. In response to those who think they found the answers to ultimately explain human behavior, relative to thinking processes that lead to actions, extreme caution is warranted. Likewise, a healthy sense of skepticism is necessary, along with seasoned cynicism. In some cases, particularly on lecture circuits or “talking head” shows, a guest speaker or panel discussion, should be treated with suspicion. The arrogance of subjectivity surfaces in attitudes that devolve to the flaunting and taunting of simplistic generalizations. Human behavior is complicated and the regurgitation of unsubstantiated conjecture without scientific evidence fails to answer many question. In the aftermath, where anecdote, rumor and gossip masquerade as confirmation, phony appeals to pretended rationality lead to perpetration of misinformation and potential disaster. From other sources, one might encounter the “born again” proselyte whose bias on a particular topic is influenced by a “supernatural mindset” reinforced by dogmatic doctrine. Subjective validation assumes one’s position on an issue is credible given the claim they believe in the mysticism of this or that. In addition, the claimant wants confirmation they are correct in the questionable assumptions, which support the fallacy of inference. Soon or later, in trying to convince a listener, the assertion in cognitive bias stumbles into the nebulous regions of hasty generalizations where correlation is confused with causation. In one major study of devolving processes of reliance on factually substantiated data driven dialogue, the researchers assert the prevailing social atmosphere as one characterized by declining intellectual capacity. Some real scientists, those in the realm of the “hard sciences”, suggest data that shows a degrading or declining rate of I.Q. levels. Additionally, some claim there is a sense of socially deteriorating respect for the value in seeking the truth via the facts in evidence. This in turn translates into the perception that critical thinking erodes with each subsequent generation. As a result, what might be considered as “human devolution” in a devolving culture offers the prospects of a dismal future for humankind. For this writing, it is presupposed that American culture is in regression, with the human species slanted toward an eventual extinction. Part of the criticality of such consequences, is the oppressive nature of status quo conformity that encourages the less imaginative to cope at a primal level. A simple all-encompassing explanation for complex social issues is easier and less demanding. Embracing the non-reality of safe mediocrity by emotional reactivity, further devalues the necessity of intellectual achievement. Critical analysis and rigorous inquiry are frequently avoid in favor of simplistic thinking. To allow fuzziness in the boundaries between opinion and truth worsens the efficacy of valid conclusions. Investigators from diverse backgrounds in collaboration in the previously mentioned research, offered concern about the debasing nature of public discourse. Through commercial, educational and political processes that rely less and less on facts dangerous consequences lurk in the shadows. For the sake of hedonistic perpetration of egoistic motivations, by willful intentions, many forsake transformative efforts for the advancement of enlightened inquiry. Rather than think for themselves, to satiate their whims, wishes and wants, they chase the mystical notions of clever gurus. For immediate gratification, regardless of systematic and logical validation, any notion of “pop psychology” will suffice to most people. A focus on the facts for many is tedious, time consuming and requires a sense of unabashed authenticity. That which sounds good, feels comfortable and seems tolerant of everything, yet intolerant of anything that disagrees with whatever went before it, is the superficial ideology of the moment. Easily accepted unsubstantiated and cowardly rhetoric passes of shallow intellectual stimulation. Most will swiftly rally around a simpleton’s limited world view of safe mediocrity. An abomination to those who attempting to be creative, innovative and enlightened, the herded bellow of the mainstream is to flock around anyone who appears, sounds and acts as though they have “special knowledge” or discovered “hidden secrets”. In a celebrity worship culture, that could be anyone who is media friendly, know the art of the sound bite, and looks good on camera. Young and old alike, millennial or boomer, the art of the con is not restricted to any particular age group. A selfie moment is essential. For those constricted by their self-conceit, their moment of glory, and the fame of the instant blog, time spent in the spotlight is worth the deceit of the conceit projected. The con artist in promotion of an array of “pyramid schemes” is adept at clever deceptions. Postmodern advertising, 24/7 “news media” and consumer marketing capitalize on consumptive gullibility of the naïve and the uninitiated. Actors, sports figures, politicians, are practiced in the art of trickery. So are teenagers enamored by their puberty. Always playing to the audience, pretentious conjecture often overwhelms attempts to disprove mere speculation by weight of evidence to the contrary. Sleight of hand, if done well, or seems simplistically convincing, will get top billing because others think they might be smart. Many times, off camera, there is someone pulling the strings with a hidden agenda or a myriad array of self-interests. Meanwhile, serious social problems remain unaddressed, ignored or glazed over by phony appeals to egregious fallacies. For a few seconds of sound bites, an ability to read a teleprompter, or memorize a few lines of commentary, instant “experts” blather an array of opinions. In a culture that created a deified pantheon of wannabe “authorities” on just about everything, an eventual dystopia looms closer that one might think. With primal subservience, or primitively ancient submissiveness, a majority dwell in realms of anti-intellectualism and unscientific medieval thinking. The unevolved status of many cling to adolescent states of poorly constructed ideological processes. Subjective validation overrides reality. Social strata transference of individual responsibility, and accountability for actions, is freely abrogated to other presumed authorities, institutions or communal entities. Historic warnings to beware of false prophets have long gone unheeded. In the meantime, just about everything has become profitable in a gluttonously consumptive society. Usually, that reflects the wishful thinking that everything will be okay, so long as one remains happy with the status quo, eats more, buys more and gets more. Habitual primeval functionality ensures easy expectation for the laziness of critical thought devoid of logical analysis. Such “devolutional” antics further hasten symbiotic relationships that foster social deterioration and the degradation of cultural interactions. Where pseudoscience overshadows real science, superstition surpasses evidentiary authenticity, and ignorance is more popular than knowledge, extinction looms closer. Once upon a time, serious educational endeavors were part of a pioneering spirit of a developing nation. With that, there was a powerful sense of public service commitment. In addition, a drive of devotion and dedication to the “greater good” meant an obligation not only to personal development, but that of others as well. Yet, the present atmosphere of selfishness is not only debasing to the culture, it is also counterproductive and mean spirited. Demeaning conjecture in social media, news reporting and political engagements punctuate an era of divisiveness that characterizes a devolving society. As such, phony appeals to fallacies of pretentious squeals the devolving aspect of human stupidity. To the debasing scale of alleged social progress, such inclinations toward “cultic” or “occultic” beliefs is more important to the vast majority than a maturing sense of wisdom. Whereby the maturation to an altered, or more profound, in depth analysis, is stifled by a particular dogmatic doctrine unsubstantiated by scientific validation. As a result, the suggestion here is that belief systems, ideological perceptions, or mysticism, etc., become foundational biases that influence thinking processes. From ideation, or the imagery that precedes thought activity, to formulation of thinking processes and subsequently communicated to others, is cognitively prejudicial in favor of the individual. Viewed further along these fragmented lines of social dysfunction, fake “experts” and phony “advocates” of one trendy thing after another, seldom promote more than themselves. Likewise, “celebrity worship”, or constant appeals to “authority”, seldom produce well-founded evidentiary substance that reveal the totality of human nature.  From psychics to religious zealots, to pandering politicians and celebrities, the interrelationship of “dominance and submission” to spurious conjecture, works the contrivances of myriad human misunderstandings about cause-effect reality. According to a recent national poll, at least 75% of the public believe in some aspect of the supernatural, the occult or some version of the paranormal, and often in connection with a religious ideology. That number, according to other surveys, may range from 80% to 90%. Phony appeals to pretended loftier articulations frequently result in specious conjecture that end up saying nothing and doing little. Greedy and self-indulgent, observation of contemporary “infotainment culture”, also called the “pop culture”, sees a symbiosis of intentional malevolence for selfish reasons. With devolving consequences, arrogant and condescending behaviors span a diverse spectrum. In a flashback to the 18th century, an American poet and philosopher admonished each to awaken. To wake up and know the manipulations of premediated, purposeful, and deliberate deceptions, is to recognize malevolent predation through society. In addition, at the time, it is a necessity to understand there are no excuses for uncivil and illegal actions people commit toward others. Torturous and murderous behaviors are serious examples of a species approaching the end of its existence. Corporate and governmental corruption, along with celebrity and pundit stupidity, further exemplify behavioral regression. In what some call a civilized world, and this one is definitely not one of those, such behaviors descend in opposition to any semblance of a cultured and enlightened populace. In spite of a couple hundred thousand years to get it right, humanity proves in many ways it doesn’t want to change. Yes, of course, to those who would argue the “basic goodness” of a “civilization” that is changing for the better, others would counter with skepticism. Although on an individual basis, there are exceptions. Yet, too few and too late. For the most part, in a society that relishes in gossip, sitcoms and celebrity adulation, social discourse is kept light, fluffy, feel good simplistic and smugly self-righteous. In spite of the devolving process of regressive societal disintegration, a few, probably no more than 25% of any given population group, work to improve themselves. For this effort, among this diverse grouping, self-evolution is critical. This means an extraordinary capacity for personal development in relation to self-education, independence, ideological freedom and liberated actions to become a better version than the original personality. Such is a quest to insist upon a disciplined non-materialistically focused life, and a mature process of rejuvenated mental-physical health. Differentiation of the wholeness within, invites the strength of healthy skepticism, tinctured by a modicum of cynical insightfulness to advance one’s sense of creativity. That’s of the utmost necessity. Hesitation to free oneself from all the gluttonous proclivities of crowd consensus, from assumption to consumption, breeds the bleeding discontent of defeat. Contemporary so called “trendy pop culture”, filled with the greedy hedonistic mindlessness of self-promotion and “selfie absorption”, so much for many observers of behavioral issues, the selfish indigenous nature endangers the future species to extinction. In a closer look at the current reality, many gifted scientists have speculated that human civilization faces a major collapse in the next 100 years. Some analysts shorten that time span to roughly about 25 to 30 years. Meanwhile, as debates continue, the social spectrum, from alleged news reporters, the infotainment industry, and social media pundits, continue to dabble in plenty of mundane and mostly irrelevant societal tripe. History, for those who pay attention, is rife with lessons to be learned. Yet, generally those are learning processes most fail to heed. For all human history’s warnings, the species ignores and forgets the essentiality of the prologues to subsequent generations. For the few who are of a rebellious nature, self-evolution is a solitary act of differentiation, and at the same time, an act of defiance against mainstream stupidity. That is, a lack of self-evolution, a grown-up mature outlook, and ongoing commitment to personal creativity. To be alone, to be a rebel, but an advanced and wiser one, requires action in certain ways that adversely goes against the toleration of the oppressive consensus that “sheep herds” the many. As such, no American institution is safe from the ravages of self-interests that hinder the forward momentum of an evolved human species. Currently, there is more a preoccupation with pseudoscience and pretentious claims of knowledge, as opposed to real science and hardcore evidentiary substantiation. For that, the brave few who look to the real expert veteran, the seasoned practitioner of real life experiences, the learned mentor of hard earned expertise, one is cautious as to the admonitions of conventional consensus and mainstream media. Instead logical deduction is replaced by feelings. The darkness of human nature, that which foments evil intentions and horrific inflictions, will speak differently from public to private self-interests.  Diverse forms of illicit motivations willfully contrive all manner of deception. When wants and desires are not satiated, anything imaginable is possible. Yet, the fear of recognizing one’s own dysfunction often finds clever but phony appeals to fallacious assertions and shallow self-serving interests. For serious minded, and the few who ascend to higher levels, the quest is to go beyond the mere satisfaction of limited inquiry. Facts, data, evidence, etc., where bias and subjective validation are controlled, seek higher planes of understanding."
16,Rally 'Round The Flag? We The People,politics," February 2020 With the impending political and military activity due to the actions surrounding the US Embassy in Iraq, now is a good time for citizens to sharpen their ""observatory lenses"" when assessing the United States politicians' actions and behaviors. Yes indeed, President Donald Trump is a key player and we should regularly zoom our focuses on him. Just as important, though, we as citizens, have a duty to also remind ourselves to regularly switch to a panoramic view and note those politicians who march in lockstep agreement with Trump on the international stage. It's one thing to put your past moralistic and altruistic notions in your idealistic pockets in a blind effort to protect your party's leader during a politically-engendered impeachment process – it's entirely different, and much more grave an act, to do so when American policy effects U.S. citizens abroad due to the negative spotlight being shone upon them as appendages of our politicians' cowardice in the face of true avarice demonstrated by the blatant, impetuously childlike actions of our politically impulsive president. For those who reside on the political left and now feel that the allegorical morally-righteous needle has swung to their favor in light of the impeachment process and the facts revealed during the process (presidential tweets, White House staff emails), a more vital and telling test is sure to come: Will they back the president on military actions based on the traditionally fantastical (if only that were an oxymoron) notion that the nation must be united in times of war and blindly adhere to the concept known as the ""Rally 'round the flag effect"" (or syndrome). Two schools of thought derive from this effect – patriotic inclinations in the citizenry to support the president unconditionally in military actions; and political impotency of the opposition party – in this case the Democrats – evidenced by that party's unwillingness to question a commander-in-chief's war wagering. As former CIA director (of the Clinton administration) Michael Morell told ""CBS This Morning"" the drone strike on Iranian General Qassim Soleimani will lead to ""dead civilian Americans."" On ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos"" Matthew Dowd pointedly noted that the attack on Soleimani was a direct attack on a military leader ""of a foreign sovereign nation"", and added that countries around the world will indeed take note. What this means is that people the world over will absolutely be keenly aware of how our president conducts U.S. Military operations abroad. But be assured citizens of the United States, with the timing of this attack and its chronological relationship with the upcoming elections, you, the electorate, the people of this country who will be selecting the next commander-in-chief, will be under an observational scope never before available to a world audience with such easy access to information; which will provide a 'brutal' level of scrutiny. Previous degrees of the natural cloaking of our electoral process provided by both geographical distance and general disinterest will be unmasked. Those nations with pervasive anti-American bias will experience an enhanced version of such sentiment if we re-elect a leader whose definition of military protocol for such an invasive military action is to inform a party-friendly sitting Senator of such an act on a golf course. (Any consultation with domestic or foreign intelligence agencies/entities?) Nations with an underlying resentment of America's seemingly presumed station of superiority will nationally disrobe of any such aesthetic restraint. If political preservation trumps national security (no pun intended, but unavoidable here) and even international security, America's spotlight as operating as the ""leader of the free world"" will diminish our standing to that of a dimly lit station - just another nation ""in the mix"". Or maybe... a shinier object - a target of resentment for our arrogantly self-appointed role atop of the world's moral hierarchy. This is not a call for anti-Republicanism – it's an appeal for the end of the current hyper-partisan state of our national political psyche. This president has 'skillfully' guided this nation, using his maniacal tendencies, into a partisan divide we haven't seen since... the Civil War? Okay, I'll cease and desist of my own hyperbolic transgressions and return to a normalcy of straightforward talk: Just keep your eyes open, people, forget about the politics, and vote for the person you believe to be best to move this country forward and is able to do so without allowing their own personal interests and inflated ego to obstruct their view of what is in the best interest of our nation. Don't fall victim to the comfort zone you so cherish in your political party's rhetorically soothing environs. Maybe I can simplify this even further with the opening line of a document you might be familiar with – the United States Constitution. It is: ""We the People of the United States""... NOT ""We the Party""."
17,Pathology of the decadent Few,politics," Several hundred years ""B.C."" or ""B.C.E."", warnings emanated from Grecian culture about the necessity for wiser instigations to enhance civilization. Yet, that is only one point of reference, as there have been many for which the heed of such continues to go unnoticed for the sake of the greed, corruption and selfishness. For the mean spirited slant, there are many adherents. In a recent article appearing in a major publication on the western coast of the U.S., an author asserts the regressive tendencies of a culture bent on its own ""victimization"" and eventual destruction. Another has called this era the final phase, the ""circus"", which alludes to the collapse of a civilization. Seemingly, many prefer abuse, pity and pampering, rather than maturity, growth and knowledge. Counterproductive in the process of self-evolution is the willful weakness non-competitiveness in any sphere of social interactivity. For the sake of ""political correctness"", or other illicit attempts at enforcing ""level playing fields"", by means of intolerance for tolerance, hastens communal deterioration. A determined sense of individual liberation, by disciplined determination, is often confronted by pretentious emotionalism and maladaptive condescending confrontations.  That hastens extinction. Enlightened transformation is not considered a lofty and noble goal for evolving transitions of individual self-reliance to higher states of ascendency. Smarter, competent, skilled and self-evolving excellence is not widely rewarded, as more and more information sources appear ""dumbed down"" to baser levels. In its place instead, most interactions tend toward a disingenuous ""victimhood"" of pretentious helplessness. One writer described many people in contemporary American culture as sissies. Pampered, spoiled and irresponsible, many, including the wealthy few, seek personal enrichment. In the process of criticizing post-modern society, several writers have questioned whether or not most people, by lazy general consensus and apathy, have allowed U.S. society to become a nation of wimps, crybabies, and weaklings. While a part of such accusations are associated with a person’s overall physicality, the focus is more on the intellectual, ethical and maturity side of acting like a grownup. Instead, some researchers have suggested intellectual and morals capacity is regressing. An indication, or at least an implication, is the emotional reactivity or exceptional sensitivity to any perceived slight, insult or insufficient recognition for needy validation. The instant ""selfie"" or inability to accept criticism reflects overly sensitive immaturity in reaction to a perceived ""insult"". Rather than pursue the moral high ground of differentiated self-reliance, juvenile antics devolve to a state of abject reactivity. Overall, due to purposeful maladaptive choices, to satiate escalating degrees of selfishness, meaningful change in human behavior stagnates. Increasing numbers of the population desire greater emotional subsistence provided by others to satisfy their self-centeredness. It seems to some who study social processes and by extension societal deterioration, more ""children"" than ever are living in adult bodies. For which, they require more attention for someone to take placate their neediness. Given the intentional persistence of biases, prejudices and assorted animosities, regardless of socio-economic or political placement, many easily provoke their own deception and thereby potentially bring harm to others. The lack of serious creativity, innovation and productively motivated individuality appears less and less a socially positive aspect. More want attention rather than invention. Additionally, with hate speech disguised as ""social justice"", and intolerance for differing opinions with vicious physical attacks as ""free speech"" resistance, child-like behaviors on the part of adults are increasingly degrading. And, once you are insulated from the reality of the real world, you can ignore the factuality of cause and effect in terms of rational explanations. Feelings will prevail over facts. As subjective validation for the unimaginative expression of personal bias replaces logic and reason, the resulting stagnation of thought debases meaningful commentary, as gross fallacies of inference foment hideous hastily drawn conclusions. Along with that, there is the never-ending collective of herd-minded assumptions based on little or no factuality. Since most people are selfishly fixated on their own self-righteous superficiality, the evolving essence of enlightened discourse is problematic. Choosing the less cumbersome travels of in-depth investigative research, in order to prove the viability of an issue at hand, most interactivity defaults to the simplistic and emotional conjecture of self-validation. As such for instance, the mythology of the ""American Dream"" embraces the destruction of the human species by way of gluttonous consumption and exploitation of global eco-systems. To perpetuate the associated frauds speaks to the decadence of the few. While there are sets of ""law"", procedures, rules, regulations or guideline parameters for a select group, the so-called 1%, there is also another set of legal frameworks for the other 99%. By means of what might be called the ""legerdemain of the corporate state"", as described in at least one novel, the ""American Oligarchy"" ensures its safe and secure insulation. Upper reaches of society do not play by the same rules as the majority of socio-economically challenged lower realm. But, the majority goes along with the mass marketing appeals for a ""herd mentality"" of bloated consumer schemes, in order to satiate desires for an endless array of consumptive commodities. In a once proud culture of pioneers, adventurers and creative entrepreneurs, as cited by one researcher, society has descended into a ""nation of wimps"". A collectivist collusion of ill-informed, lazy, obese and fearful ""sheeple"" hastens the devolution of an entire country. Such references are not about well-built bodies, food fitness or bulging biceps. Instead, it is about the courage of convictions, ethical enlightenment and fortitude of character to insist upon justice over emotional justification. A sissified population is one that relishes in the smug piety of its stupidity, disdain of intellectualism and creative laziness. Self-righteousness in emotional reactivity, intolerance for the opposing views of others and naïve notions of cause and effect, likewise express a growing self-perpetuating pathology of infantile narcissism. Fiction trumps facts, with revulsion for thought provoking rational insight and advocacy of enlightened perspectives. The quest for wisdom in higher states of learned pursuits gradually transitions to illusions of fakes, frauds and facsimiles of human expression. Behind the scenes, the decadent few encourage the abject foolishness and adherence to the never-ending saga of unlimited resources. Flourishing across a devolving landscape, with incessant appeals to the rich and famous for words of no so profound ""authority"", or pretentious ""expertise"", speeds up the eventual demise of the human species.  In one way or another, decadent few collude to the acquiescence of collective primal subservience for the incessant satiation of predatory arrogance. Voluntary servitude enters the mix with myriad excuses to promote excess and hastens the regressive escalation of diverse forms of modern enslavement. Discourteous, haughtily condescending and mean spirited, immediate gratification presses the persecutions for all manner of selfish deception. With antagonistic persistence, the landed gentry, the robber barons, and the heirs of aristocracy threaten the republic. With smug disdain for those at the bottom of the socio-economic pyramid, the modern aristocrats condescendingly flaunt their presumed entitlement. If one were to stop, look and listen intently, the pitch and tone of decadent contempt comes through loudly. The extravagance of greediness to acquire worldly possessions underscores a society of bloated consumption. At the same time, predation in one form or another panders the seduction of primal subservience, as modern day slavery become more pervasive. For which, the promotion of gluttonous consumption seeks to pacify the many for the sake of the few, who remain well insulated in their materiality. The hypocrisy is limitless. Much like the ruling class of ancient Rome or Greece, according to one source from an online investment advisory, the decadence of the ruling classes exploits materiality not for the greater good, but greater greed. As institutions decline, political and social interactions devolve, and people act out their hatreds, prejudices and multiplicity of self-interests, the collective pathology willfully shares eventual societal collapse. Meanwhile, as the ""devolution cliffhanger"" is uncertain, another worldwide study offers the inequitable tipping of the global socio-economic scale in the direction of the few. Over two years ago, a British news agency published a report that indicates what some already knew. To add to a dismal perspective regarding the decadence, or perhaps social debauchery, a small percentage of ""oligarchs"" governor a large amount of wealth. That is, a small concentrated group of wealthy people controls a significant amount of planetary prosperity and affluence. As such, the divide between rich and poor continues to expand. By regressive capacity in maladaptive ways, the rift is demeaning, oppressive and destructive. For 1% of the population to exercise dominion over more than 50% of the wealth, creates an extraordinary inequity for the other 99%. Nearly 100 billionaires, in reflection upon the aforementioned study, enjoyed a 50% increase in wealth over a 4-year period. During the same time, more than 50% of poorest on the planet experienced a loss of nearly a trillion in wealth. The disparity of such decadence of the few, or call it corruption, depravity and self-indulgence, degrades any prospects for long-term survival of the human species. Further, of the reaming 48% of the earth’s wealth, that falls to the richest 20% of the population. Which could be interpreted that one fifth of the people on the planet now owns all the planetary riches. And the majority, 80% of the population, has limited ability to access such wealth. With the disparate divide between arrogant wealth and abject poverty, closing the gap for greater opportunity, for the greater good, appears a dismal prospect. An oligarchic class, which fails to ensure the nobility of equitable distribution of resources, and otherwise use the power of influence to affect productive change, aids and abets the demise of the human species. Smugly self-righteous and piously ""entitled"" to their ""inheritance"" of corporate-political aristocracy, the decadent few perpetuate a devolving complicity of a ""ruling class"". Neither by intelligence, accomplishment or competence, the collective pathology of the decadent few promote the safe mediocrity of a greedy status quo. Then again, what’s new? Not much. A small percentage of very smart people invent various means by which to ensure the comfort of a leisure class. An even smaller wealthier group that uses influential means, some by support of the American taxpayer, to create multi-national corporations, in turn conscripts them for expansion of ""corporate cartels"". In the process, the ""power elite"", an echo of warnings from nearly 75 years ago, ensures riches remain consolidated within a narrow societal spectrum. Yet, in the short span of finite existence, what really matters in terms of personal transformation. For the reassurance of acceptance as time passes, where youthful passions dissipate, primitive thinking and eventual conformity stagnate, and materiality through greed replaces personal transformation. Subjective validation for nearly anything stimulates the urges for selfishness in the performance of maladaptive behaviors. By the greediness of constant accumulation of material goods and services, counterproductive ideations plot and scheme the neediness of worldly acquisitions. For the most part, it is not for the greater good for the greatest number, but for the few who pillage and plunder. For the want of excessive materiality, in the pleasures of exceptional self-interests, the mainstream satiates its illusions in obedience to the perpetrations of the upper streams. As opposed to the frugal sharing of the training, education and discipline for imaginative dreams, a unity to advance civilization, oppressive behaviors invite the final inflictions. Creativity fragments into disuse and over-consumption that drains environmental capacities. A few strive to transform in wise rebellion for a union in personal ascendency. Coming out of nowhere, a void, and then in the end, going back there, to the nowhere to be forgotten, terrorizes into masses into protective submission. Ignorant of history, the majority embrace the failures repeated endlessly to self-destruction. Lacking the innovative forces of energies untapped, accepting stupidity instead of rationality, in lieu evidentiary substantiation, aids the eventual death of the human species. Many malicious factors participate in the contrived demise of the American society. Undercurrents that undercut the viability of creative enterprises for the advancement of human civilization are intricate. Interwoven in a complexity of deceit, manipulation and greedy subversion, the decadence remains pervasively malevolent. Self-caged to primal and immature emotions, steeped in the hypocrisy of supernatural fixations, and imprisoned by amative unimaginative proclivities, the degradations continue in divisive criminalities. For the perceived necessities of illicit gain with little effort, greedy self-righteous ignorance for unmerited entitlement, and consumption without limits, fosters a collective devolving social ""mindset"". As one generation after another perpetrates the nihilism of devolution, the human species follows others that vanished. With various calamities occurring globally, from hurricanes to tsunamis, as one example, many opportunities to observe aspects of human behavior. For most, self-centered, selfish and foolishly arrogant overrides humility, self-evolution and service for the greater good. While there are noble acts of heroism, there are degenerate acts of criminality at every level of socio-economic strata. Without question or opposition in any form, with nominal exceptions, the majority eventually embrace the conformity of non-resistance. The oligarchs continue to deceive and exploit the many for the greater gain of the decadent few, the so called 1%. In time, for the brevity of each life, liberation diminishes, as diverse forms of slavery binds and confines the masses. Meanwhile, communal educative and restorative resources stumble and creative enterprises falter, as the oppressed fixate and spur the demise. In an academic study by a major western university, the wealthiest top one fifth of the U.S. population controlled or otherwise manipulated 90% of the wealth. With the riches concentrated in the hands of a few, one wonders how much can be done to rectify major societal problems. But for the valiant efforts of the few at different rungs of the societal ladder, the vast majority remain mesmerized by the deceptive manifestations from the top down. The status quo is perpetuated by any way possible. As generations come and go, and easily slip beyond the possibilities of species advancement, normal becomes degenerative and decadent. As a result, the probability of species extinction grows nearer. Of ghosts, goblins and gremlins, the illicit nature of magical thinking perpetrates the short-term gain over devotion to a long history of tireless enlightenment and mature self-evolution. For that, among those interested, it becomes essential for the few brave ones to break the bondages of modern day slavery. To think more deeply, passionately committed to rationality, less emotionally distracted and more imaginatively creative, the quest is long and cumbersome. Transforming selflessly, as opposed to regressing selfishly, escapes the imaginings of many. However, for there are resistance fighters, they struggle against the seduction of their basic essence to succumb to devolving primal subservience. Hedonistic tendencies for immediate gratification, reinforced by the greediness of cognitive prejudices, retaliate and demean in ways that stifle personal liberation. Fame and fortune, in metaphorical glory, sell the ""American Dream"" as though the social systems are not rigged or otherwise manipulated. Yet, for the pathology of the decadent few, who control the majority of wealth and resources, as though human value is cheap, replaceable and easily restocked, that fantasy remains. Illusions of the status quo are kept in place and out of reach for most people, as the contrivances are persistent. Self-indulgent inclinations, or proclivities, whatever the designation still reside within the power and control of the individual to freely choose subsequent actions. Of an earlier comment, based on many years of professional observation, investigative application and contemporary research, analytic capacity for profound mindfulness, critical thinking by way of logical analysis, appears elusive across the broad expanse of society. On this point, a number of studies indicate regressive processes by which the populace is devolving intellectually. Prone to increasing emotional reactivity, reasoning in reality transitions to a lesser capacity for more insightful assessment based on evidence. On the part of many people, the inability to apply serious and enlightened introspection, by well-reasoned logic and mature analysis as applied to current social issues continues to be woefully inadequate. In close proximity by ideation and formulation, most refuse the strenuous exertion of laborious self-revolution. For one to look with passionate forthright authenticity in constant examination of the self, the effort expended pales in competition with the tumultuous onslaught of self-exaltation. Immediate gratification takes precedence. Although the complexity defies simplistic delineation or easy solvability, the dismal perspective of it all yields little prospects for productive change. Probably of sadder degree than disappointment, or even regrettable disenchantment, is the permissiveness of selfish behaviors. These of course come in many forms and forums, from intolerance of free speech, to the con artistry of commerce and industry, as well as associated political processes.  The divisive self-interests of the few perpetrate illogical misguidance and distrust among the many by multiple societal processes. This of course does not mean a person cannot resist by purposeful assertion of individuation through exercise of willful liberation. On the contrary, resistance is not futile. One can oppose the foolish juvenile behaviors of those who feel entitled to their self-appointed lofty status within the social layers of society. To do so means profoundly determined efforts to assure personal differentiation from the nonsense. Innovations and creativity of thought and action are essential to self-evolution. In contrast, stupidity in selfishly pursuing the constraints of the many, for the assurance of conformity, under the illicit power and control of others, reflects intentional choices. Fraudulent contrivances ought to be exposed for the bogus conjectures that emanate from that. Aside from the ""pandemic of the stupidity virus"", which crosses all socio-economic and political spectrums, those of greater means have the advantage over those of lesser influence, power and sustainability. As such, the smug piety of the oligarchic pinnacle is such that insulation becomes protective in the negation of greatest good for the greatest number. The blatant pathology of the few, with linkages to the willful perpetration of selfish maladaptive and anti-societal intentions, expresses a sense of social disparagement against those of lesser means. In this regard, to ""form a more perfect union"", ""establish justice"", or ""promote the general welfare"", no longer seems relevant. The idea of ""domestic tranquility"" appears to apply to the safe, stale and secure enclaves of ""gated"" entitlements, rather than purposeful actions to ensure broader equality. With all the wealth concentrated in an increasingly smaller niche, the reach of inequality burrows deeper. In one study of ""wealth oriented behavior"", from a major west coast university, those in the higher realms of materiality tend to disregard the interests of those at the lower social levels. Seemingly, less generous, not as prosocial, seeking to safeguard the status quo, and minimal empathy for those who have not ""made it"", characterizes the growing divide between upper and lower echelons of society. With all the affluent power, control of the majority of resources, at least economic disparity should have vanished."
18,The Wiener Theory – Human Devolution Query,politics," Meanwhile, in the adventures of the pseudosciences, an interesting proposition rises with stiffened resolve to take notice of post-modern maladaptive behaviors. With a turgid state of insistence, the unrelenting willfulness for actors in the social mainstream to act in stupid ways invites the speculation of the Wiener Theory. What is a wiener? More than a frankfurter or a Vienna sausage? Simply a hot dog? Actually much more than that, as the Wiener Theory is summoned to confront the rapid spread of social stupidity. Metaphorically speaking of course, will due deference to the few who persevere toward self-evolution, the social descriptor applies to the devolving state of human affairs. In particular, the insidious antics of cultural regression is prime for the symbolic reference of the ‘weeny"". So many fun and fascinating applications come to bear on the condescending proclivities rampant juvenile narcissism. While opinions may vary, and they will, any typology or description is arguable. As such, the concept of ""narcissism"" raises the possibilities of a number of critiques. For the Wiener Theory, this distinction most likely applies more than several other descriptors, which may or may not be considered so called ""personality disorders"". As to that, briefly stated, philosophical perspectives, absent scientific validation, fall short of technical authenticity. In the pseudosciences, or ""social studies"" arena, as in criminology, psychology, sociology and theology, opinion driven conjecture is always subject to critical analysis. With the Wiener speculation, the suggestion is that a person behaves with intentional and premeditated purposes. To this, the classical school of criminology enters the discourse and particularly with regard to the broader scheme of the Gonzo Theory. Behavior is a matter of free will based on rational thinking and subsequent cost-benefit analysis by the perpetrator. A utilitarian doctrine, the conceptualization is one in which a lucent process of thinking renders freely made choices. Aside from the howling, screaming and yelling of dissenters, rational decision making for maladaptive actions is neither abnormal nor suggestive of a ""personality disorder"". In the viewpoint of one author of a college criminology text, perpetrators of an offensive act, select targets of opportunity, based on gain minus risk, to maximize their advantage of others. As a metaphorical subset to the overall framework of Gonzo Theory, the Wiener concept identifies several substrata of ""antisocial"" members of the human species. To digress for the moment, as used here, the so-called ""antisocial"", ""psychopathic or sociopathic"" and ""narcissist"" personality types merge into a mental matrix of profound selfishness. For the incessant self-centeredness of exaggerated personal worthiness, a more consolidated perspective warrants a unitary configuration. This of course will no doubt provoke some in the pseudoscience arena to gasp, feel agitated and experience an altered state of consciousness. Regardless though, the issue is not about defining behavioral inclinations with extraordinary specificity or clinical sufficiency. Instead, the intention is to call notice to purposeful illicit behaviors that intentionally inflict harm on others. In this context, probably more relevant than other descriptors, the common feature of condescending attitudes reflects in the conceptualization of ""narcissism"". Using the narcissistic reference, the ""wiener idea"" conjures an intentional motivation on the part of perpetrators to act in selfish ways. As to this speculation, there is a broad spectrum of premeditated inflictions evident in modern society. Accordingly, in one online archive, depicting definitional criteria from the primary reference material of the psychiatric industry, a possible label or construct might be useful. This relates to the theoretical configuration of something called ""narcissism"". Acting, being and otherwise exhibiting oneself as a wiener could be ascribed this speculative notion. A grandiose intention for self-aggrandizement, purposeful application of subjective validation for self-importance, and selfish inclinations come into play. On a smaller scale, outside the ""fixation fantasies"" of politicians in general, reduce the comparison to modern academia. To that, take the typical faulty meeting. Observe carefully the mixture of pretentious portrayals of credentials. Note the chasm between the real hardcore scientists (biology, chemistry, physics and physiology, etc.), and the softcore or pseudoscientists (criminology, psychology, sociology and theology). The former are scientists, the latter are philosophers. This of course, produces instant emotional reactivity among the nonscientists. Regardless, there are wieners in both groups. Yet, upon closer inspection, it appears the pseudoscientists, some of whom are serious wannabes, are quite indignant if their school of thought is not treated as a ""real science"". After all, they assume they have all the answers to the mysterious questions of human behavior. This brief illustration goes to the point in part that being a wiener also reflects ideological perversities. As to the cause and effect notation, ""wienerism"" fluctuates along a human continuum of self-indulgence and presumed entitlement. Next faculty, as a side note, observe who needs to ask the most questions, or raise irrelevant issues, especially when it is time to end the meeting. Now compare ""wienerism"" to the neediness of unwarranted admiration or self-validation. Being a ""dick"" can be complicated to explain to the totality of the intricate components. Politicians so easily fall into the realm of the wiener. So prevalent during election season is the grandiose sense of self-importance. With the advent of millennials entering politics, it gets comical. Not in every case or situation, as there are always exceptions to generalizations, but the egoistic fixations of ""beauty and brilliance"" shines through. Their political role-play fantasies pervade the prime time news with their pretense to entitled ascendency. Exaggerated claims of ""open borders"", ""immigration reform"", free college education, or easing student debt, and so on, reflect the narcissistic condescension of smug disregard for the voting public. The overwhelming desire to be seen as the one who knows everything, the person to connect with, and the extraordinary fixer of complex problems, speaks volumes of insatiable self-promotion. Deeper the probing query delves to the far reaches of dogged idyllic sense of entitlement. For the American political aristocracy, assumption of privileged anointing passes from one generation to the next. Offspring sometimes assume they are next to enter the political realm. It is their turn now to ""feel the call"" to public service. It is something they felt they had to do for the betterment of humankind. Yet, only elected office will do, absent of course, any prior real-world education, experience, training or rough and tumble exposure to reality. Conceit tries to hide deceit. As entitled nobility, superficiality knows few limits. Likewise, accountability for things said and done, no matter how illicit, ought to be excused because the American people need them.  Conventional laws, rules, codes of conduct, and so forth may or may not apply, as these things could get in the way of ""getting things done"". Outlandish and lavish displays of personal relevance portrays the dynamics of someone who needs a lot of personal attention. Although politics is a good source of entertainment for the many dicks clamoring for validation, other walks of like have plenty of dicks. From Hollywood celebrities, to Wall Street financiers, the hot dog stand is alive and well cooked. In particular, movie stars and movie wannabes have ample representation among the film industry’s elite. There is a walking talking wiener everywhere. Talk shows, radio and television news sources present a cast of characters, in which some of them provide active portrayals of wienership. Nothing is completely safe. Incongruous rhetorical hyperbole flaunts fraudulent conjecture in place of rationally meaningful discourse. Exaggeration, overstatement, and embellishment beyond reason permeates the news and social media to the extreme. For those who indulge in such babbling, it is yet another characteristic of being a wiener. Exposed to someone being a dick seems to be a frequent encounter. In every venue of public experience, whether working, shopping, recreating, or movie going, there is a high probability of an occurrence of the wiener theory. With so many people playing the role of the ""offended"", just being a dick, exposure is very likely. As to an informed and logical interactive discourse, it is as though I.Q.’s have slumped like a downturn in the stock market. Probably more significant than intelligence quotients is the perceived maturity level. As one writer put it, American society appears characterized by increasing expressions of ""infantile narcissism"". With adult children, sometimes it is extremely challenging to engage in a profoundly intellectual conversation. For that matter, simply to expect a grownup level of mature civil behavior on the part of those who appear to be adults. Concerning one writer’s perspective in observing mainstream culture, a kind of ""regression to infantile"" behavior appears widespread. Such is the expression of some, particularly in the college environment to be hypersensitive and emotional in child-like ways. To have safe places, insulated from harsh realities of the real world, devolves to self-indulgent regression. Likewise, an exaggerated sense of self, especially at a juvenile level, underlies the intentional contrivances to promote and advance one’s personal agenda. As a perpetual selfie of self-promotion, attention-getting antics look for opportunities to exploit on personal ""victimization"". Whatever gambit they are playing, the wiener, or the dick, sometimes standout. He or she will be the person most likely the loudest, outlandish or provocative in a crowd. In a sense, on a very base level of expression, the ""hot dog"" needs validation. From a variety of sizes, shapes and backgrounds, for the satiation of personal insecurity, validation is important. From a simplistic and unimaginative perspective, they want to be noticed in ways very similar to most politicians in general. Within the scheme of thinking, often contriving deception of themselves, there are the mystical notions of intense cognitive bias. With perseverance, there is the frequent flirtation with self-centered adoration of one’s imagery. For the public official the photo-op is vital, along with superficial facial expressions, shallow smile and insincere handshake. With the deceptive affect, the disingenuous flare for rhetorical hyperbole and the fixation on self-importance, the modern politician expresses a regression to infantile vanity. Like the kid who never quite got over high school graduation into the real world, the self-admiring absorption avoids the maturity of wiser differentiation. In the commentary of one online politically oriented magazine, for instance, the writer proposes the observation that modern politics is rife with examples of narcissistic behaviors. For contemporary politicians, the writer asserts the very word itself, politician, defines narcissism. Vain, conceited, and selfish, applies widely. As to that perspective, a more caustic descriptor is the symbolic reference to the wiener. Used as a condescending primal identifier, the hot-dog, the stuffed sausage, the weenie, and given the phallic shape, the dick. Alternatively, applied with a little more disdain, simply being a ""prick"".  This further suggests the calculated villainy of individuals who think they somehow are the answer to all the social and political ills of society. For them, they alone are the ones who can solve all the problems. It is their time or their turn to change the planet. Because they are so special, at least from their perspective, their ancestry, social status, political ""aristocracy"", etc., grants them certain privileges of public office ""ownership"". Admiration of self is boundless. However, the self-aggrandizement does not stop there. Subjective validation for an excessive interest in one’s political arrogance also includes speaking stupidly. Factual reality becomes overwhelmed by specious conjecture based on emotional reactivity. Objectively validated evidence is relegated a subservient role, replaced by unsubstantiated self-serving opinions. Modern politicians say idiotic things on a regular basis. More often than not, they escape accountability. Whether or not they actually believe the foolishness they regurgitate is arguable. Nonetheless, the stupidity spewed in public is nauseatingly insulting. Grotesque fallacies of inference degenerate into inconsistent hasty generalizations that defy logical explanation. In addition to the intentional ignoring of facts, with a preference for magical thinking, human wieners insist they know what is best for everyone. Even though found predominantly in politics, wieners are found in all places across the social spectrum. Where ever there a people, wieners are readily available to interfere at any given moment. They are more than willing to offer their unsolicited opinions, and promote any gossip that satisfies their advantage over others. The human hotdog relishes in the divisiveness they create by pandering to whatever advances their interests. Unfortunately, human selfishness is part of the devolving consequences for human extinction. Aside from the socio-political ramifications, the Wiener Theory has an additional sinister and debilitating aspect. According to many reference sources, but one in particular, the ""wussification of the U.S."" is the condescending and degrading vector of overly sensitive and emotionally reactive people.  Such an atmosphere is destructive and dangerous. Little social advancement is possible. As such, wussification portends toward several humanistic inclinations signaling multiple characteristics of intentional human frailty. Various descriptors come to the forefront. These include, but are not limited to, words like coward, sissy, and wimp. Yet, the underlying framework of wiener theory encompasses the diversity of individual and group shortcomings. Hidden within the recesses of a crybaby mindset is potential for horrific interpersonal inflictions. Mean-spirited, condescending and divisive, hateful and hypercritical, the social mainstream if filled with egregious displays of animosity. As to wussification, additional depictions comprise things like crybaby, pushover, wimpy, weakling, pansy and so forth. Nonetheless, the protestation against ""wimpiness"" argues that by various complicities many accept assumptions of exceptional inadequacy. Instead, a gluttonous decadence proclaims the cowardice of intentional maladaptation. The malevolence of infantile narcissism extends adolescence will into adulthood, as the Peter Pansy refuse to grow, change and mature. Applying the Wiener Theory, emasculated personalities succumb to the seductive wimpiness of anti-intellectualism in favor of emotional insecurity. Likewise, preferring a ""dumber downed"" framework of simplistic thinking, facts are replaced by fictions, as specious conjecture replaces scientific validation. Intentional gullibility persuades an indifference to logical data in the evidentiary necessity of proof, while foolish fallacies of inference pretend to be reality. Wussy politicians, political supporters, academicians and pundits, to name a few, pontificate one false narrative after another. Rather than assert a rational basis for logical discourse, many would rather rant condescending invectives toward those with whom they disagree. Cowards come in a sizes and shapes. Fraidy-cats fear the chickens they see in the reflections of themselves. Meanwhile, the regressive notions of anti-social inclinations hasten the drift toward the final exit of an infantile species. To be insulated from reality, the pains and pleasures of life, the suffering and successes, perpetuates cowardly antics that personify child-like behaviors. By protracted adolescence well into adulthood, unhealthy states of non-evolving people persist in adhering to unending states of limited intellectual capacity. The cowardly are everywhere. In a 1993 treatise on ""national cowardice"", an author ponders the erosion of self-respect and personal individuality. Instead, in contemporary America, the mere mention of something akin to ""cowardice"" finds replacement by such things as ""self-esteem"", or feeling good about oneself. Individualism, particularly as related to self-reliance, competence and perseverance, appear permanently damaged. Regressing with each decade, the foolhardy decadence of ""sheep-like"" behaviors amplifies the neglect of social responsibility to ensure cultural advancement. As such, the Wiener Theory includes the accusations of a cowardly society and the subsequent betrayal of personal integrity. With that comes the debasing ingredient of purposeful stupidity. Unwise, senseless and imprudent thoughts that become voluntary actions provoking the basis for asinine actions. Acting stupid is a cheap way of evading personal responsibility and hiding from subsequent accountability. Cowards enjoy such infantile narcissism and go to great lengths to avoid growing up as mature adults. It is about being a perpetual phallic symbol. Avoiding pain and suffering, to relish in comfort and ease, absent any aspect of sacrifice, is what cowards do. Learning from good, bad and horrible experiences are parts of enlightenment as self-evolving life forms. From one source that studies human behavior, people develop by way of a diversity of exposure to sordid harsh realities. Discovery by real-world encounters assists in the development of strategies to cope with varied challenges. In today’s world, some have criticized the excessive sensitivities of many who fear being offended, threatened or otherwise challenged in any manner. In a regressive risk-avoidance culture, eventual collapse looms closer. For the weenie, under the umbrella of Wiener Theory, cowardice, stupidity and loser thinking degrades social structure. In addition, weak, timid and fearful in transforming life skills into prosocial endeavors, invites the downfall of community, society and nation. For some, America devolved into a ""nation of wimps"". Naturally, there are exceptions to wimpiness. For example, a small percentage of the population chose a different course of action. By contrast, roughly 5% of the population dared the bravery in serving community and country. This includes men and women who became first responders and joined the military. Another small percentage, say another 5%, serve valiantly in allied fields of public service. That suggests about 10%, maybe more, pursued ""anti-weenie"" exceptionality. Regardless of numbers or percentages, a sizeable majority linger in the shadowy collusions of the Wiener Theory."
19,Mera Jism Meri Merzi--Negative Feminism,politics," Mera Jism Meri Merzi--Negative Feminism by Shahid Ali Abbasi The all-pervasive notion of Mera Jism Meri Merzi in Pakistan needs a deep and careful analysis. On the surface. it looks simple and gives an easy opportunity to anyone to give an opinionated comment. But in reality it’s deep and old, as old as human race itself. And I would not perhaps be fully wrong to say that it was one of the most fundamental, and strongest, arguments put forward by Satan in paradise while poisoning Eve's mind. Did Eve not practice Mera Jism Meri Merzi ideology when she ate of the fruit, against the Divine Decree? It demands a deep thinking. In this short article, I would endeavour to present to you the arguments in this regard from religious and social perspectives. To start with the religious perspective, I would briefly say that in Islam our body (jism) is not ours: it's Allah’s; it’s a sacred trust given to us by Allah that is why why we are not allowed to self harm ourselves (suicide), or even modify our body (tattoos, etc). So from Islamic perspective neither our body nor our merzi (will) is fully ours. Rather we have to use our will to understand The Divine Will and then dissolve our will into the Will of God; that’s the optimum level of will or free will (merzi) we have. Is it not outrageously blasphemous that we say it's ‘my body’ when Allah categorically says everything on the Earth, in the Heavens and in-between belongs to Him?: ""And blessed is He to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them and with whom is knowledge of the Hour and to whom you will be returned."" Quran (Surah Zukhruf, 84-85) ""To Him Belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and all that is between them, and all that is under the soil."" Quran (Surah Taha, 6) ""And to Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth; and those who are with Him are not proud to worship Him, nor do they get weary."" Quran (Surah Al Ambiya, 19) These are just a few but there are numerous other occasions in the Quran where Allah clearly and categorically claims the ownership of everything in the universe and beyond. Please beware of those who twist the interpretation to serve their purpose. It's as evident as it is. Everything, every single particle in the whole cosmic order, is Allah's Ownership, and whosoever else ""has"" anything, it is given for a certain time and thus has associated roles and responsibilities which have to be fulfilled as long as one keeps that sacred trust. This interpretation can also guide us towards the essential purpose behind creation, because the purpose can only be assigned by the owner. You change the owner, the purpose changes. If I own something then why would I let someone else allocate the purpose to it? It's like I build a beautiful house and then ask my neighbour if I should make it an orphanage, a shop, a school, a hospital or a pub! Verily, as long as the house belongs to me, it’s ‘I’ who will give it the purpose and none else. Now here comes the trick. The moment we claim the ownership of our body, we actually take the ownership of its purpose as well, and that purpose may or may not be Divine. In fact, in that case there may or may not be any intervention or inclusion of Divine whatsoever because it's ‘my’ body. This will completely displace us from the path and purpose assigned to us by our actual Creator and Owner. So the claim Mera Jism Meri Merzi is outrageously blasphemous in Islam. Let’s not confine the argument to Islam only. The relationship between the Creator and the creation is more or less similar in all religions around the globe. You name any religion, the most fundamental belief system that you will find there is that of the creation and the Creator and the subsequent relationship between the two, which then defines the roles and responsibilities of the creation towards the Creator. Now when we claim our bodies to be solely and wholly ours, we in fact split apart the whole Cosmic Order (caps mine). We separate the actual Creator and Owner from the creation and with that the creation from  the purpose of the creation. It's deep isn't it? According to all religions, the Creator created the creation to serve His Divine Purpose. I would say even the social purpose coincides with and correlates to the Divine Purpose. In other words, all the social purposes, roles and responsibilities given to us and things are there so that we could more conveniently accomplish the Divine Purpose allocated to us. As for Islam is concerned, Allah made it clear at numerous occasions in the Quran and the Hdith. Allah says, ""I created the jinn and humankind only that they might worship Me."" Surah ad-Dhariyaat, verse 56. Now those who say the body is fully there's are actually revolting against the Creator and are deviating from the purpose of the creation. So from religious perspective, Mera Jism Meri Merzi is the most Satanic belief of negating the Creator and claiming the ownership of something that is not ours. It was absolutely this very ideology preached to Eve by Satan in Paradise, causing our fall. The campaigners of this notion might give various explanations saying it's not like that but it is what it is and it is what it explicitly says on the surface and in the deep. Now the second aspect of Mera Jism Meri Merzi is sociological one. As human beings, we live together in societies, so there must be certain rules and regulations to be followed so as to peacefully coexist. But this social existence does not have any purpose exclusively of its own; it actually correlates with and facilitates the fulfillment of the very same Divine Purpose of creation. In other words, the Creator created us to fulfill a Purpose and in order to fulfill that purpose collectively and individually there has to be a certain code of life, regulations, norms, traditions, morals, ethics, etc. all of which come under the same broad principle of peaceful coexistence. The moment we shatter the Cosmic Order of the relationship between the Creator and the creation, we compromise the terms of the individual and collective behaviour. If I own my body then I will give it my personalised purpose, and that purpose can be anything. If I'm poor, I will give my body a purpose to be rich; if I am powerless, I will give my body the purpose of gaining more and more power, so on and so forth. I will in that case follow my instincts. And that will determine my overall behaviour and dealing with the people and things around me. To put it simple, suppose I buy a gun. Once I paid for the gun and bullets, it's mine and I own it, and there's no doubt about it legally, socially and religiously. But does this ownership give me the entitlement to start shooting others? After all, it's my gun so ‘I’ will give it a purpose as per my will (merzi), and why not!? No society will allow me, will it? You see how personal motif clashes with the collective one!? Now because, according to this notion, I own my body and I have the purpose to it, I will use every available resource/part/capability in it ,my hands, my legs, my mind to achieve that purpose. Where is human morality gone then? So, the ideology of Mera Jism Meri Merzi is not only Satanic and blasphemous but also socially impracticable and detrimental to a society. Somehow Mera Jism Meri Merzi is often (and wrongly) associated with women, and more particularly a very very few in Pakistan. Why is that such slogans are usually raised by a few, and ironically privileged, women only? Even the most liberal societies will put a check on individual freedom and will not allow indecency. Even the societies which are secular will say yes it is your body and your resources but there are others as well and we cannot allow you to use your personal belongings (Jism) in such a way that they cause harm, disruption, indecency or moral perversion to others (Arabic word عَوْرَة is related with things to cover). Call it Law or Common Decency. If any champion of Mera Jism Meri Merzi, campaigns were living in a cave, completely and absolutely isolated from other things and humans, it could perhaps be possible to practice Mera Jism Meri Merzi philosophy there, but NOT in a society (and by society I do not mean humans only but other animals, birds, plants, the whole environment, everything). But it was told to us by Islam 1400 years ago. So I would say to all these campaigners of Mera Jism Meri Merzi that you could be right but you are at least 1400 years late because the issues that you raise have been comprehensively and once for all addressed by Islam 1400 years ago.  The slogan of equal rights is irrelevant not only in Islamic society but any society in the world. You can only give equal rights when there are two things equal, whereas there are no two things equal in the whole universe. So instead of ‘equal’ they should say ‘just’ and that is what Islam is founded on: not ‘equal’ but ‘just’, hence justice. Here the subtle difference between rights and privileges should be kept in mind (briefly, a privilege is much higher than a right). Islam gives more privileges to women than men so I do not understand why the so-called women rights campaigners do not understand that if they get ‘equal’ rights to men, they will actually lose many they already have. Also, they confuse rights with social status. A child will have more rights if weighed against his parents’ rights but that doesn't give the child a status higher than parents. The child will still be under parents’ control. Similarly, a woman has more rights than a man but she has a status subservient to man: Allah says, ""Men are in charge of women, as Allah has made one of them superior to the other, and because men spend their wealth for the women; so virtuous women are the reverent ones, guarding behind their husbands the way Allah has decreed guarding; and the women from whom you fear disobedience, (at first) advise them and (then) do not cohabit with them, and (lastly) beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek to do injustice to them; indeed Allah is Supreme, Great."" (Surah Nisa, verse 34). Also, please explore women and Satan, auret aur sheitan…. So, such women should deeply read the status of women in Islam. Islam not only gives rights to women but rather gives privileges to them. The idea of equality is the most absurd one (not today’s topic though). Nature does not run on the principle of equality but on the principle of justice because there are no two thing equal in the whole cosmos. And that justice can only be assessed and then dispensed according to the purpose of the Creation. You name anything under the sun that does not fit in the Cosmic Divine Order dictated by Allah. Everything has a purpose and all things collectively have one Purpose, and that is what Allah the Creator has set, not us. So even sociologically, the philosophy of Mera Jism Meri Merzi  threatens and undermines the very existence of life on this planet. So, to conclude, I would humbly suggest you all to think deep and relate the creation with the Creator according to whatever religion or philosophy you follow. That will clarify your understanding of the purpose of creation of the things, and their roles and responsibilities thereafter. Once we have that clear understanding, we will then be able to interpret an combat this Satanic philosophy and many others like this.

20,"The Least Worse Presidential Candidate? Trump, Biden, Sanders, Warren, Yang, Buttitieg, Bloomberg?",politics," It is widely known the upcoming 2020 Presidential election will be the most important election in our generation. President Trump, isn't exactly earning the approval of the majority of Americans and the Democratic Party does not have a front-running Presidential candidate. As a result, the next president will NOT be a candidate with the majority of American votes. There will be more Americans who did not vote for the next President than Americans who did. Yet, we Americans must pick one candidate to fill the open job position of POTUS. Sadly, our goal will be to vote for a candidate who is the least worse of the bunch. Below are our options. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP - Trump is the most polarizing president in our lifetime. We know what has happened to the country since his election -- hatred towards immigrants, promotion of racism, justification of white nationalists, and sports teams refusing to go to the White House. Trump isn't responsible for all these dark things, but he sure is an influential figure. You just have to look at his rallies to realize 99% of those in attendance look like each other. Trump is the American version of Hitler. JOE BIDEN - The real reason why Biden is running for president is to get Trump out of office. His main skillset on his resume is that he once knew Barack Obama. If Biden becomes president, our whole society takes a step back to the year 2008. Biden even said it himself, ""Nothing will change"" if he becomes president. So, if Biden becomes president, he's going to take naps and slack off and our country will too. He'll need the extra naps because he can't form a complete sentence anymore. Biden should have retired the same time Obama did. BERNIE SANDERS - Anyone who wants to use the Wealth Tax to fund his or her promises, should automatically be disqualified from being a President. Even an idiot can Google, ""Does Wealth Tax Work?"" to find out this wealth tax doesn't work. You can forget about FREE College. You can forget about the Single-Payer Healthcare because no one in Congress wants to work with this guy and no American wants to pay extra taxes for it. Sanders want Billionaires to be the ""Bad"" guys. This is a political move because 99.9% of you American voters are poor suckers who are not billionaires. Sanders is loud and obnoxious and a lot of his supporters are of the same mold. Sanders supporters are as toxic as Trump supporters. If Sanders become president, he will become the Democratic version of Trump. ELIZABETH WARREN - Her idiotic plan to pay for ""Medicare for All"" pretty much ruined her chances to be President. We know she can't come up with good solutions but we do know she's a good liar. From claiming she is Native American to get perks, to saying she was fired from her job for being pregnant (when in reality she wasn't qualified to be a full-time teacher), to claiming Sanders said a women can't be president, to using the victim-card... we absolutely can't trust this woman to be president. Although it would be nice to have a women as US President, Warren should not be the one, she will just make all women look bad. ANDREW YANG - Why would anyone trust an Asian man who wants to give us all $1000/month? That seems to be too good to be true. This Yang guy looks like someone who should be our enemy, a Communist Chinaman. Yang claims the government can fund this by taxing tech companies with the VAT tax. I have done the MATH and realistically, Yang can only get the funding to give us about $750/month. That's less than what Yang promises. But hey, that's still $750 more than what any other politician is willing to give us. PETE BUTTITIEG - Mayor Pete is a smooth talker with witty comebacks and lots of wine to drink. He says he can bring the country together. But he can't even bring his little city in Indiana together. It's troublesome when black protestors show up at your rallies. It's just as troublesome when white people also protest at your rallies because you take money from billionaires. When your support group is mainly rich white folks, you're going to be hated on bad. He's not even President yet and he's got the same protestors like Trump. Pete is the candidate who is least likely to unite the country. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG - If you're sick and tired of seeing Bloomberg on TV you're not the only one. When a billionaire has enough money to make himself look good on TV commercials, he's going to stuff it down your throat. What is his reason to run for President? It's not for you, it's for his ego. It's to fight against the billionaire-hating politicians like Sanders and Warren. Bloomberg does a good job of hiding behind his commercials because if he attends a debate, his bad track record as mayor will be exposed. You will see another one of his ads during the Super Bowl - this will be a good time to go for a potty break. Who should I vote for? Or should I even vote at all?"

1,Europe suffers from excessive care on the part of the U.S.,politics," Historically, the U.S. perceives the EU as a developing organization which needs guidance and advice. Though just a few years ago Europe seemed more united and found consensus more easily, the United States managed to influence the European politics easier. Everything has changed. Europe ""has grown out of children’s clothing"" and has become a serious organization capable of making informed decisions by itself. As soon as France, Germany or any other European country starts to oppose the U.S. and express alternative opinion, Washington doesn’t tolerate this. It uses all available means to keep control over Europe, thus making tensions in Europe even harder. One of such tools to manipulate the European states is ""give something to get what you need later."" Washington gives support (financial, political or military) some European countries consider very precious, usually in exchange of their loyalty to all U.S. decisions. This gained loyalty allows the U.S. to defend its interests not only in Europe, but in other world regions either. Let’s make some examples. U.S. lawmakers announced an agreement on Monday on a $738-billion bill setting policy for the Department of Defense, including new measures for competing with Russia. In particular, it included sanctions on companies helping Russia’s gas giant Gazprom to complete the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project in the National Defense Authorization Act for the U.S. defense in 2020. Russia is building the pipelines to bolster supply to Europe while bypassing Ukraine, and members of Congress have been pushing the Trump administration to do more to stop the projects. Serious political tension is rising among the European countries relating this issue. Some European Union member states, including Germany do not sacrifice national economic interests from realization the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project to please the U.S. and strictly oppose the U.S. sanctions. The route will traverse the territorial waters through the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of five countries including Russia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany. Chairman of the Bundestag Committee on Economics and Energy Klaus Ernst even called the US sanctions against the Nord Stream 2 AG project ""contrary to international law."" Ernst emphasized that the United States should not be bothered by the way in which Germany ""shapes its energy policy."" At the same time, Ukraine, Poland, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania oppose the construction. Latvia and Lithuania call it political. In reality, they just support the U.S. in exchange of its military help. The matter is these countries highly depend on Washington in defense issues and consider the U.S. and NATO (where the U.S. is the leader) the only guarantee of their security in case of war with Russia. Europe is forced to be obliged to the U.S. And Washington strengthens its military presence in Europe to consolidate the status of defender. A massive military exercise in Europe DEFENDER-Europe 20 involving 20,000 U.S.-based troops will take place soon in Europe. Even the name of the exercise speaks for itself. It is the largest deployment of U.S.-based forces to Europe for an exercise in the last 25 years. The U.S. military unit, which employs more than 500 land force troops with heavy equipment – about 30 Abrams tanks, more than 20 infantry combat vehicles and other equipment have already arrived to Lithuania. The more so, it is well known that the U.S. demonstrates in every way its commitment to the Baltic States’ defence and provides these countries with military equipment and arms. Thus the Baltics have no other choice but to support any US decisions. Such behavior, in its turn, makes tension among the EU member states stronger and does not strengthen relations, but leads to a further split in the EU. Europe suffers from excessive care on the part of the U.S., but the ""log-rolling"" model is in action. Europe became a bargaining chip in the confrontation between Russia and the U.S."
2,"How to Properly Insult a Democrat- Voters Guide for GenXYZ, Millennials and some Boomers too.",politics," If you have an overwhelming desire to control our climate, vote Democrat. But can you really predict the climate when our planet is spinning at 1000 MPH, revolving around the sun at 67,000 MPH, moving through our galaxy at 515,000 MPH and our galaxy moving through space at 1,300,000 MPH? And you want to tell us anything we should take seriously about the climate decades from now? We're busy hanging on for dear life as it is. Google it. If you love Donkeys, vote Democrat, but as the Democrat party falls apart after the 2020 sweep, now even more bad news arrives.""Half the world's donkey population could be killed amid surge in demand for Chinese medicine"". I have an idea. Every Democrat in the country should adopt a Donkey. Since you voted for a BUTT you should be perfectly comfortable living with one. Since global warming causes global cooling which causes global warming which causes global cooling, vote Democrat. With the unprecedented cold headed this way that's exactly what you are going to hear from the MSM. Now, try and convince yourself that you understand what they're saying, and even more importantly that they understand what they're saying. You don't. They don't. Oh yeah. Let's get rid of fossil fuels so you feel what frostbite feels like. OMG, Venice Italy is underwater. It's sinking. Know what else is sinking? The DNC, Impeachment, Democrat Fundraising, Adam Schiff's poll numbers, and Top Brass in the Interagency Group {NSA, CIA, FBI... }. Venice was built on a Swamp. Sound Familiar? So vote Democrat, then get the first flight out to Venice. The Democrat Party better get themselves a new Swamp to live in 'cause this one's gonna be 'Closed for Repairs'. Since you believe in global warming, vote Democrat, but here's some really disappointing news. The science, that's right, science and mathematics of prediction proclaim that all predictions are unreliable 3-5 years out and thus global warming predictions are by definition unusable, useless, misleading and dangerous. Climate predictions being the equivalent of a monkey throwing darts; no offense to monkeys. If you're a victim, vote Democrat. But here's the truth. Minority status does not = Victim. Majority status does not = Predator. Democrat-inspired Paranoia and lack of historical perspective drive most people to the Democrat Party. I guarantee should you change party affiliation, your paranoia will immediately disappear because you will be part of the Silent Majority. See how easy that was?"
3,Who really defends the Baltic States?,politics," About 500 U.S. troops arrived in Lithuania in October. This news is widely discussed all over the Baltic States and Europe. The issue of permanent NATO presence in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia has been discussed for a decade. There is still no legal basis for this step, but NATO and Baltic authorities found the possibility to deploy troops on a long-term basis. The justification for such long deployment becomes participating in military exercises that take place almost continuously on the territory of the Baltic countries. The U.S. armed forces are among the most powerful in the world. American soldiers participated in numerous wars, operations, missions and exercises. In the U.S. military persons have a lot of preferences and substantial allowances. The occupation of a military person attracts a lot of young men, even those who have criminal records. Unfortunately, the need of military personnel enforces the authorities to turn a blind eye to the criminal history of applicants. Though some types of criminal activity are clearly disqualifying; other cases require a waiver, wherein the each service examines the circumstances surrounding the violation and makes a determination on qualification. Applicants require a waiver for enlistment. Applicants with six or more minor traffic offenses, where the fine was $100 or more per offense are required to obtain a waiver. Applicants who have three or more civil conviction or other adverse dispositions for minor non-traffic offenses are required to obtain a waiver. Felonies are the most arguable of recruitment offenses. The problem is the U.S. Armed Forces utilize their own definitions of what constitutes, for example, a felony. Examples of felony offenses include aggravated assault, arson, burglary, manslaughter, robbery, and narcotics possession. Many states allow a felony conviction to be expunged and reduced to a misdemeanor. All military branches consider felony as a disqualification, but they do make some exceptions. In recent years, it appears that the US Army has issued more waivers when we talk about percentages. Bad conduct and drug waivers in the US Army accounted for 19% of waivers issued in 2016, 25% in 2017, and over 30% in the first half of 2018. Thus, if a person receives a waiver for such cases of antisocial behavior he could be enlisted regardless of his or her criminal records. When the authorities of the Baltic States allow U.S. troops to deploy on the national territory, they even cannot imagine the possible consequences. Locals can face alcoholics, traffic offenders, brawlers and other criminals in the U.S. uniform, who even cannot be judged by national courts. And it’s a very complicated question if foreign criminals are worthy of being called defenders of the Baltic States."
4,Two-faced Lithuanian politics,politics," Lithuania continues attempts to support the image of a democratic state and at the same time not to lose foreign military support. On September 26, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda made his first address at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. In his speech he said that threat to Russia's neighbouring countries remains strong and Moscow is attempting to further destabilise neighbouring states. Such statement can be regarded as a call for further support in developing Lithuania's military capabilities to oppose Russia in the Baltic Region. In order to look ""nice"" in the eyes of the world community, Gitanas Nausėda added that Russia could change and inspire confidence. As we know, it could be done only by political means and only through negotiations. The Lithuanian president underlined also that ""determination to adhere to international law is often the last barrier separating our countries from unpredictable and therefore dangerous disorder"". From the very beginning it sounded as if Lithuania would like Russia to change its position on the international arena. But later Lithuanian president contradicted himself. He called not to create any international platforms with Russia's participation designed to resolve existing political and military problems. Thus, he strongly rejected the idea of some political leaders to create a new geopolitical space from the Atlantic Ocean to Vladivostok, drawing Russia in. It turns out that Lithuania is not interested in changing Russia's position. The recent events in Lithuania illustrated such two-faced position on contemporary politics. Lithuanian authorities are not going to change their plans. According to Ministry of National Defence Rotational U.S. force, a battalion-sized unit of over 500 U.S. Army soldiers, will deploy in Lithuania to ensure deterrence and train in exercises shortly in October. The unit is part of the U.S. Army Europe Operation Atlantic Resolve. ""We have sought for a larger long-term U.S. military involvement in Lithuania and the region consistently and patiently. Therefore the deployment of the U.S. Army battalion for a longer period of time is good and awaited news and a result of our efforts and investment,"" Minister of National Defence Raimundas Karoblis said. He also underscores that Lithuania has already hosted many U.S. battalions, however, that used to be in the framework of concrete exercises. This time the U.S. forces are arriving for a long-term deployment, not for an international exercise. The troops will bring heavy equipment 30 Abrams tanks, 25 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, 70 wheeled vehicles and will deploy at Gen S.Žukauskas Training Area in Pabradė. The U.S. battalion is planned to stay in Lithuania until spring 2020. The more so, on September 26 the Lithuanian Armed Forces accepted 110 Unimog U5000 trucks of 5t payload manufactured by Germany's Daimler AG as it is updating its truck fleet with vehicles of the same make as there already are in the fleet. The trucks are delivered on the basis of a contract signed back in 2015 though continuing successful cooperation of the Ministry of National Defence and the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA). 88 such trucks have already been delivered to the Lithuanian Armed Forces; the contract covers acquisition of the total of 340 new Unimog trucks. The 110 have been delivered to the Lithuanian Armed Forces on the basis of the contract on the Unimog truck acquisition between the Defence Materiel Agency under the MoD and the NATO Support and Procurement Agency updated in 2018. Daimler AG is committed to delivering the remaining 142 trucks in 2020-2021. In other words, Lithuania does not really want Russia to change its position and behaviour. it is profitable for Lithuania to show its political concern, arm itself and get help. Lithuanian authorities do not care of escalating tension in Europe and it ignores attempts to resolve crisis of political confidence in Europe by political means."
5,Do Something,politics," I have been waiting for many years for the Republicans in Congress to act to  make our country safer from mass shootings  I thought they would do something when 20 children and 6 adults were killed at Sandy Hook--a shooting which shocked the whole nation. I thought they would act after The high school shooting in Parkland, (17 deaths), the Orlando night club (50 deaths), the Las Vegas music festival, (59 deaths) the El paso Walmart (22 deaths), Sutherland Springs church (25 deaths), Odessa and Midland,  (7 deaths), San Bernardino (14 deaths) Virginia Beach (12 deaths), Thousand Oaks (12 deaths), Pittsburgh synagogue (11deaths). and Santa Fe High School (8 deaths) Since Sandy Hook there have been 2219 mass shootings with 2406 people killed and 9280 wounded.The CDC reports that in 2016 there were 39,000 gun deaths from homicides and suicides. 14,000 homicide and 23,000 suicides. We have been told that guns don't kill people, people kill people. What is a truer fact is that people with guns kill people  We have been told that people need guns for self-defense. According to Harvard University analysis of figures from the National Crime Victimization survey, people defended themselves in 0,9 percent of crimes from 2007 to 2011 The survey shows that guns are used very rarely for self-defense. The following statistics compare all the mass shootings in the world in 2019 by country. 18 countries had 0 mass shootings, New Zealand—1, Netherlands-1, Canada-1, Mexico-3, United States 249 All of these countries have the same problems that we have. They have mental health issues. They have differences of political opinion. They have crime, but they also have sensible gun laws which keep their citizens safer. When the citizens of El Paso gathered for the memorial for their dead children and husbands and wives and friends and shouted at their Governor to DO SOMETHING, they issued a cry of pain that echos in the hearts of every caring person in this country. If our government has done nothing all of these years when they first saw the dead children at Sandy Hook and have continued to do nothing to deal with all of the successive violence that happens every year, then we can assume that the present administration and senate for their own selfish goals will continue to do nothing. It is now the responsibility of every parent, every husband, every wife, every voter in this country to take on this responsibility and finally do something at the ballot box.--vote out every Republican and every Democrat who will not take action to remedy this danger to our families. If we don't do this in 2020 then we will be the ones that are ultimately responsible for the next mass shooting. If we vote in a new president and a responsive house and senate who will DO SOMETHING then we will have finally given a fitting memorial to all of the babies and children and men and women who have tragically died as a result of the inaction of our legislators. The responsibility now is ours!

6,UNRWA Under Fire,politics," UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, has been building the Palestinian human capital and equipping boys and girls with education, vocational training and improved livelihoods for years. For some time now, the entity has been under a fierce attack.  On the surface, allegations of corruption and abuse of power by senior UNRWA staff members have suddenly manifested. Looking beyond, corruption can very well hide under the guise of adopting anti-corruption measures. Demographically speaking, UNRWA provides aid to more than five million Palestinian refugees in the diaspora. That is, in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, the West Bank and Gaza. In other words, more than five million refugees who have been force-migrated are on hold to be returned to their homeland once the prolonged Palestinian-Israeli conflict is resolved. While the hope remains the light at the end of the tunnel, it has never suited the Israeli palette. One administration after another, the Americans were pro-Israel. With the cherry on the top, President Trump seems to have all the Harry Potter wands at the disposal of the Israelis. ""The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into smaller manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one"". The American Initiative aka the Deal of the Century is stumbling. Here comes the shutdown of UNRWA, thus, blurring the line between humanitarianism and politics, where the unknown people pay the price every day.  For Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, UNRWA must be shut once and for all, for the very existence of the entity promotes the right of return of the Palestinian refugees, which to Netanyahu eliminates the state of Israel. How to shut UNRWA down? Corruption allegations of course. Only by the logic of the naive is discrediting UNRWA at this particular timing a coincidence. End of the day, the entity has been meeting its budget, its projects are manifest on the ground, it has benefitted millions of people and gained the support of uncountable number of renowned volunteers from all over the world. Volunteers and civil society members turn to support Palestine the minute their feet touch the Palestinian soil for they can see injustice in action. This, however, ends up costing them their life and if they survive, their reputation. Mads Gilbert is labelled an anti-Semitic. Vittorio Arrigoni and Rachel Currie, to mention but a very few, ended up being murdered. UNRWA spokesperson Chris Gunness, who witnessed the bombardment of a school on Gaza and couldn’t help cry on air, was labelled crazy. No one can get away with criticizing the Israelis, except for the free of course. Call it an ""Ethics Report"" and voila! You got what it takes! In July, a ""confidential internal"" report was issued by the UNRWA ""ethics office"". Its confidentiality allows no one to verify its content. However, its media summary-leak goes far to attack the senior staff of UNRWA by descriptions rather than incidents and actions. The report accumulates all the words in the dictionary to demonize UNRWA. ""A culture of low morale, fear of retaliation, distrust, secrecy, bullying, marginalization, concentration of power, beyond the professional relationship/sexual misconduct [between senior staff members], funding crisis, irregular recruitment etc."" were among the media coverage of the report. Common sensically, the accusations alleged do not take place overnight. It takes years to build a culture of low morale and the rest of it. It is known to the world that recruitment measures of the UN in general and the UNRWA in particular are very strict. Only creme de la creme make it to an entry position, let alone senior positions. The sudden exposure of long practiced misconduct is a red flag by itself.  While the alleged conduct is said to present ""an enormous risk to the reputation of the UN"", the report itself seems to be what pauses a huge risk to the reputation of the UN. Supposing the alleged misconduct is true, the UN would have massively failed to implement monitoring and evaluation procedures, in which case, it would be liable for any misconduct practiced on any micro level. In fact, with such a report, the UN could have facilitated such misconduct to channel funds here and there, a matter which would subject the UN in whole to stand accountable and open to external investigations. The report findings, unknown to the public save by descriptions, are under investigation. The accused may not make any comment till the investigation is concluded. Confidentiality might come across as a measure to ensure impartiality. However, the leaks to the media defy the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. Those accused have been fed to the media to tear them apart without a chance to respond. An entity as established and so called professional as the UN would have not leaked any of it until the investigation is finalized. However, with the miscalculation and in the event those accused are proven innocent, the UN would again be liable for the defamation of the persons concerned. One interesting accusation stood out. A senior staff member named Maria Mohammadi is implicitly accused of having intimate relationship with Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl. Maria Mohammedi is an Algerian activist who has been working in the West Bank and Gaza for years. To the western reader, for such relationship to pave the way for work privileges is corrupt and it ends there. However, for an Arab, such accusation would actually threaten the life of the woman in the name of honor. The support of Algeria to Palestine has always been exceptional. As an Algerian, Mohammedi could lose her life on grounds of betraying the Palestinian-Algerian cause, that is, freedom of Palestine. Any way perceived, a woman could very well be sacrificed at the altar by the very entity which promotes women’s rights and equal opportunity. Again, the UN stands liable for any ramifications of a situation that seems nothing but mismanaged in favor of shutting the UNRWA down one way or another. Conveniently, Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands cut and/or froze their funding to the UNRWA. As financiers, these countries and whatever representations they have, preserve every right to monitor and evaluate the progress of the projects implemented on the ground. Have they also failed to do their job for the past years? or has their sense of justice been compromised? the questions remain unanswered. Timing is of the essence but let’s not forget Netanyahu’s speech on Iraq ""if you take out Saddam’s regime, I guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region"". The world knows better how that turned out. Gideon Levy puts it better, ""Israel is occupation- addicted. The drug addict who is your friend, if you give him money, he will really care about you. But are you really caring about him?"""
7,Random Thoughts About War,politics," War is a complex problem which will not be easy to solve. The reason for this is that war has many underlying causes that are often difficult to identify and change. There are economic imperatives and land issues, There are anger issues, intolerance issues and the inability of leaders to compromise on conflicting goals. There are the masculinity issues about being a warrior and perhaps even many as yet undiscovered factors that propel us toward war. Until all of these underlying issues are identified and the appropriate actions taken, we will never be able to look forward to a world without war, When each of us ultimately becomes more aware and begins to identify these obstacles and then commit ourselves to work toward making the necessary changes, one problem at a time, only then will we will begin to see the beginnings of a more reasonable, a more cooperative and a better functioning world where all people will be able to look forward to a brighter future which will finally allow them to live dignified and peaceful lives. According to scientific thought, our planet is now 4.5 billion years of age. Since the first humans began to roam the earth millions of years ago, their first instinct was to find food and defend themselves-- violently when necessary. We are still functioning in this primitive, violent way these many millions of years later, not taking into account that the world is no longer the same and human beings are no longer cave dwellers. Since the advent of the hydrogen bomb, our way of thinking about war must change. We are on the brink of total annihilation either through the complete destruction of our world or through released radioactivity which will kill or injure everyone on our planet. War is no longer a rational way of solving differences. How will we secure our future without resorting to war? It means that alternative ways must be found to put pressure on rogue states— diplomacy, sanctions, increased dialogue and the ability of the rational world to try to understand the thinking and the motivations of others and the ability of everyone in confrontational circumstances to make compromises. There is no longer any other alternative. The time is now. More and more small unstable countries are getting the bomb, and we can no longer pretend that this danger does not exist. All of us who care about the future must put our energies to this task, or we will be facing a time when this wonderful earth that we love so much will be reduced to a few atoms of radioactive dust."
8,A New View of Crime and Punishment,politics," Whether we live in poor areas or more affluent environments, we are all affected by the crime around us and the fear it engenders in all of us. Long ago people viewed crime in a more simplistic way. There were good people and bad people and the bad people needed to be punished and crime would then disappear. That has not happened. When criminals are punished they do not ordinarily stop being criminals. New information has taught us about the relationship of cause and effect. There is still a dialogue going on about nurture versus nature, but no authority will deny that poverty, environment or bad parenting play a large role in producing individuals who have lost any hope that they can survive as productive citizens of our society. It is very easy for young people to get caught up in the current drug culture and make serious mistakes that can have lasting consequences in their lives. For various reasons, minorities are at particular risk in our culture. These early mistakes must not be allowed to ruin our young people's entire lives. Our laws must begin to reflect the reality of the lives that young people are exposed to and treat these young offenders with understanding and compassion. According to current statistics, it costs an average of $33,000 a year to keep one prisoner in jail. How much better it would be to spend that money on preventative measures like better counseling, better recreational facilities, better parenting classes and better job training programs for young people who are at risk. For those people who are already in prison and will one day be paroled, wouldn't it be wiser to give them counseling and job training and get them ready to live productively instead of warehousing and punishing them and then throwing them back on the streets to become a danger to us again? We must change our own view of these vulnerable people in our society. They are people who, because of the circumstances of their lives, are not able to make a living, who cannot control their emotions or who feel a sense of hopelessness. Instead of taking revenge, we must begin to find the cure for this disease and treat this like any other chronic illness with tolerance and understanding and wise life-changing programs. By doing these things, we will perhaps begin to make some inroads on the problems of crime, drug addiction, family violence and insure a future of healthier families, safer communities and ultimately more hope for us all."
9,Freedom of Speech in a Diverse World,politics," Voltaire (1694—1778) said, ""I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"". That statement made so long ago is more timely than ever. As our country and our world becomes more diverse as to political, religious, ethnic and racial values, it will be increasingly important that all of us have a high tolerance for differences of opinions, because it is likely that we may differ from our neighbors as to values, clothes, behavior or relationships. It is also important that while we must allow all diverse opinions to freely be expressed. we must not allow any political, religious, ethnic, or racial group to dictate to everyone else their ""truth"". A free society allows every person to follow the dictates of his conscience, but not to impose them on others. This means that we will all need to compromise our ""truths"" when they are in conflict with other people‘s ""truths"". It means that no one is above the secular laws of the land in which they have chosen to live. If the laws are not considered fair, in a free society we all have the power to work to change those laws. As in all good families and societies, communication and compromise are the key to good relationships.  Why is this adjustment of our thinking so difficult for all of us? I like to think of myself as a tolerant person, but I notice that I too have my prejudices and stereotypical ways of thinking. These past erroneous ideas became part of my thinking when I was young because of the prevailing, more intolerant thinking of the times and the community in which I then lived. They came at a time when I was too young to question them. Now however as an adult I do have the strength and the ability to question and change them if those ideas are not longer valid.  It is important then to be aware of where our less tolerant thinking has originated. For most of us new ways of thinking and new ways of living are not always easy for us to understand, accept and change. It does take patience and effort to change our opinions to a more tolerant way of thinking and acting in the new and more modern, diverse world. Our best hope in a diverse country and world, is that we all learn from each other, Just as we have learned to enrich our cuisine with spaghetti, chop-suey , french onion soup, sushi—all the good diverse foods of the world, so too can we enrich our lives with new ways of living by taking the best of each culture and perhaps making them our very own."
10,Greed in our Time,politics," ""Greed is Good !""--from the movie ""Wall Street"" More than 2000 years ago the wise and famous scholar Hillel wrote "" If I am not for myself who will be for me. If I am only for myself, what am I?"" Recently there have been people and corporations in the news who have been only for themselves with no regard for the damage their greed has done to others. This list includes schemers like Madoff, many bankers, unscrupulous insurance companies, dictators, politicians whose only goal is to accumulate vast amounts of money. For these groups of people it is no longer about being more secure or supporting one’s family. It’s about unlimited accumulation. Greed is rapidly becoming an illness and an addiction as deadly as drugs. If this were an individual addiction we would not need to examine so closely what is happening, but when so many of these individuals and large corporations steal money that rightfully belongs to other people then it becomes legalized theft. We all can see how someone like Madoff stole from others, but it is harder to determine when insurance companies charge higher premiums than they should or bankers higher rates than they should or when politicians take money from corporations to vote for legislation which denies ordinary citizens their lawful rights. These individual and corporate actions are just as much a theft as a criminal robbing a bank. When a dictator or leader steals from his people more money than he will ever be able to use in many lifetimes, than we need to look at what drives these greedy people to do what they do. Why do these enormously rich people continue to steal? There is a subconscious drive that impels them to search for more and more power to enhance their self-esteem and to gain the admirations of others. Often it is the only way that they can feel admired and loved and this neurotic need often originates in an underlying feeling of low self-esteem. Corporate stealing is all about making the most money that’s possible without regard to injuries this may cause to others. Even our own societal values contribute to these neurotic drives of individuals and corporations for more power and money because most of us still admire and pay homage to those who are rich, and we don’t always question or care about how they earned it. So we too become a part of this worldwide illness. How can we begin to curb these greedy people from stealing from us all? We must of course watch them much more carefully and hold those who steal to a higher accountability. We must also build a new value system that does not admire those who become rich at the expense of others. How different the world would be for all of us if the following wise words became the universal mantra for a better and more just society--- "" If I am not for myself who will be for me. If I am only for myself, what am I? If not now, when?"
11,About Media and Influence,politics," We are fortunate to live in a country and at a time when we have almost unlimited access to information — political, social and personal through many TV and radio outlets, through newspapers and through the internet. What many of us don’t always take the time to realize is that all of these outlets are businesses who have owners and motives and agendas of their own which do not always reflect truth. These businesses also have advertisers who ultimately have their own agenda which can compromise the objectivity of reporting what is true. How then can we decide that the source of our information is truthful and reliable? We probably can’t, unless we know who owns the outlet and understand their motives. The other way to seek the truth is to get our information from as many different sources with diverse opinions as possible and then sift through all the different opinions and make an informed judgment . This may seem like too much of an effort for most of us. Is it really important that we do this? It is one of the most important things that we will ever do . If we don’t make the effort to be thoroughly informed, unscrupulous individuals will be able to bend us through emotional or intellectual manipulation to become their puppets for carrying out their ideals. That is how countries ultimately lose their freedom. It is all the more important now because the current world trend in so many countries including our own is toward limiting challenging ideas and trying to demean and control our media. We must value all of our media and fight for the freedom of all the press to write and speak whatever they feel is their truth even if we don’t agree with them and even when we are concerned about what they say. That is what makes a democracy strong. If any individual or group attacks the freedom to express our ideas no matter how distasteful those ideas may be, then we must suspect that these people and groups want to ultimately enslave us and limit our freedom. No one, of course, must be able to advocate violence, but beyond that one limitation, in a free society we must allow all diverse opinions. No matter how difficult that is. It will take the awareness of all of us that there will always be unscrupulous individuals who will try to manipulate our thinking, if we allow them to do it. A truly informed electorate is the one way that we will always be able to know the truth of any given situation and the only way that we will continue to retain our precious freedom of thought and action in a continuing free society."
12,"The U.S.: Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia cost $125 million",politics," The U.S. does its best to strengthen its positions in the Baltic States. The U.S. hunts out excuses for being there, having no actual reason and legal grounds to deploy its military contingent in the region. For instance, though its troops are not even a part of the NATO enhanced Forward Presence Battle group in Latvia, the U.S. troops and military equipment are permanently present in the country. The more so, the U.S. always finds a basis for its presence. Thus, it is eager to take part in military exercises, give money to build military infrastructure, participate in different joint military conferences, sell military equipment or just give advices. For such purposes The U.S. initiated Operation Atlantic Resolve as a demonstration of U.S. commitment to collective security in the region. As part of this operation thirteen UH-60 and HH-60 Black Hawk helicopters arrived in Latvia in February. Likewise, 150 soldiers from the 3rd battalion of the 1st Combat Aviation Brigade arrived and are stationed here on a rotational basis. The U.S. contingent is expected to stay in Latvia for nine months. It is said they fulfill operations in the National Armed Forces base in Lielvārde. Another fact of the U.S. active involvement in domestic affairs is the so called advisory assistance which has turned into a guide to action, supported by the U.S. financial help. U.S. defense think-tank the Rand Corporation has produced in April a new report titled Deterring Russian Aggression in the Baltic States (https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2779.html). According to the report, ""a robust technology initiative to enhance military capabilities for all three states would cost about $125 million, could be implemented over several years, and is scalable. The authors discuss the benefits and risks of expanding unconventional and total defense efforts and potential Russian responses and countermeasures. Finally, they outline steps that the Baltic governments, the United States, other NATO allies and partners, and the European Union could take to enhance these efforts. The authors conclude that total defense and unconventional warfare capabilities can complement the existing conventional defense efforts of the Baltic states and NATO, improve warning of an attack, augment initial defenses, and buy time for (and provide support to) national and NATO conventional responses."" For Latvia, in particular, the authors advice to enhance the size and capabilities of its national guard and reserve forces and improve whole-of society resilience efforts. Just after report's release, Latvian Minister of Defence Pubriks announced the planned snap checks of combat readiness. The Defence Ministry also wants to prompt residents' involvement in the comprehensive defense system, so they know what they must do in order to defend their country. A booklet with all the necessary information for residents will be released in the fall, the booklet will also be available online, added Pabriks. These all steps should be considered as the attempts to influence Latvian authorities and population and to force them to grand the U.S. the possibility to do what it thinks is better for Latvia. The U.S. wants to create a condition under which the small Baltic States cannot exist or behave by themselves. The key recommendation given by the authors of the report is ""the United States, other NATO allies and partners, and the European Union could take further concrete steps to support the Baltic countries in developing their total defense and unconventional warfare capabilities."" And they will take these steps even if Latvia is not ready to accept their help."
13,Social uncertainty weakens Latvia,politics," The latest data of the Central Statistical Bureau (CSB) show that at the beginning of 2018 population of Latvia accounted for 1 million 934 thousand, which is 15.7 thousand people fewer than a year ago. Another survey conducted in 2018 by the CSB, shows that the share of Latvia’s population exposed to the risk of poverty grew by 1.2 percentage points from a year before to 446,000 people. CSB representatives said that the monthly at-risk-of-poverty threshold went up to EUR 367 per one-person household (EUR 330 monthly in 2016). In households consisting of two adults with two children aged under 14 years the monthly at-risk-of-poverty threshold reached EUR 770 in 2017 (EUR 694 in 2016). Dry statistics hides awful things. One forth of the population that is about 400 thousand can’t enjoy a normal life. According to the survey, the worst situation is in Latgale where 39.2 percent of residents live at-risk-of-poverty. The striking fact is the largest at-risk-of-poverty rate fixed in large families (couples with three or more children) (20.5 percent). Paradoxically how could a European state allow its children to starve and deprive of hope for basic needs, such as food, clothes and good education. The conclusion is disappointing: depriving people of hope for normal life, the state authorities deprive Latvia of future. Thus, there is nothing surprising in population outflow. What does all this mean? It means that Latvians are so poor, that they can’t think about something but food. They can’t be fully engaged in political, cultural or other spheres of life. They are not capable to support their children or parents. They exist, not live. That is probably the main reason for Latvians’ political apathy. Otherwise how to explain the protracted process of government formation, social problems. The only sphere that flourishes is defence. Latvia is one of a handful of NATO countries that spends 2 per cent on defence with more than 20 other members missing that goal. Thus, the government increases the defence spendings but does not pay enough attention to social problems. Is it not a normal state of affairs. The result may be devastating: there will be modern military vehicles and equipment, but will be no one to serve in the armed forces. Poor people have no desire to defend their poverty, they have NOTHING to defend."
14,No one will deter Russia in the Baltic region,politics," Recently researchers and analysts of the RAND Corporation issued the report ""Exploring Requirements for Effective Deterrence of Interstate Aggression."" The stated aim of this report is ""to provide a fresh look at the subject in this context, with two primary purposes: to review established concepts about deterrence, and to provide a framework for evaluating the strength of deterrent relationships."" Chapter Four of the report is called ""Deterring Russia in the Baltic Region"" and presents analysis of security challenges in the Baltic States. This particular report is interesting by the fact that it acknowledges the minimal likelihood of Russia's military aggression in the Baltics. It is more than strange when take into account the previous report that insisted on high level probability of Russian aggression. This time experts consider the situation to be less dangerous for the Baltic Region. According to the RAND Corporation analysts, Russia does not consider the Baltic States to be a strategically important region for itself. Therefore, despite the Kremlin’s desire to change the balance of forces in Europe in its favor, Russia does not consider ""aggressive actions in the Baltic States as a tool of achieving these goals."" The US specialists have not found evidence of preparing the invasion of Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania, and Russia’s buildup of military power on their borders. They have made a conclusion that a more aggressive behavior of Russia towards the Baltic countries can occur in case of the anti-missile defense systems deployment on their territory. Instead, experts recommend that the US authorities treat Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania with understanding and condescension and even take into account that their eternal anti-Russian fears are associated with difficult common historical past. In other words, they advise to rather provide moral support. The report of the RAND Corporation cannot be treated only as a private opinion of a non-governmental organization. The findings of this center of expertise usually anticipate and justify strategic decisions made by the United States. Thus, two years ago RAND Corporation held a war game, which revealed that the Russian armed forces need only about 60 hours to occupy the Baltic States, and NATO allies would not physically have time to help Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The analysis of the results of the war game was one of the rationales for deploying four multinational battalion-size battle groups on their territory. Today, the RAND Corporation concludes that Russia does not threaten the Baltic States, and military tensions over this region can arise only if the missile defense systems are deployed. It follows logically that the further militarization of the Baltic States is explosive and undesirable. So, the US elites as well as NATO do not want to deal with the Baltic States. They do not want to be distracted by countries that are of no importance for Russia, their main antagonist. The first recommendation made by the analysts of the RAND Corporation in the report is ""to assess the motives of potential aggressors and ease security concerns. In Europe, this could include avoiding deployment of the most provocative U.S. systems in or near Eastern Europe, thinning Russian and Baltic forces, and working on a successor to the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty."" In the case of military provocation in the Baltic Sea, similar to the one that occurred in the Kerch Strait, NATO, the US or the EU will not even provide the Baltic States with active diplomatic assistance, not to mention immediate military support. The RAND Corporation made this more than clear for the Baltic States."
15,"Give people mansions because they can breathe, and because they can count to 10",politics," I don’t exactly believe in mansions. Mansions are nothing more than the effect of miscalculated management and government. If people were much better at co-ordinating with other people, mansions along with nationalism and skyscrapers wouldn’t come to pass. However, since mansions have come to pass, and since enough mansions have come to pass that the idea of just demolishing all mansions seems somewhat over-the-top, I think I may have come up with a reasonable compromise. More mansions can be built, but are built and are given to people on the purse basis that they can read and write (or better yet, on the pure unadulterated basis that they can count to 10). As far as the status quo goes, people already have mansions (or numerous mansions, knowing some people) because of nothing: I hardly see why movies and tv shows should be why people have mansions, or why politics and boardrooms should be why. Indeed, mansions can be kept, and even more can be built, but people should be allowed to possess and use mansions simply because of their basic ability to comprehend – to add more insult to injury, the endgame of many movies and tv shows is the basic ability to comprehend. In practical terms, I can see why giving mansions to all people is difficult: there isn’t the land mass to enable such a distribution. However, come the point when space travel is more the routine, and the point that people can live on other planets, I honestly don’t see why on earth there should be any contrived and concocted opposition to the argument (of course, I’m aware enough of the depravity and insidious nature of right-wing politics to know to expect bullshit counter-arguments regardless of the logic of the original argument). Nevertheless, I still stand by my point: mansions don’t have to go, but if they are retained then it’s essential that people have mansions for the right reasons – the right reason being nothing more convoluted and complex than they basic ability to think and live. In the meantime, I also think it would be worthwhile that all people in Mexico have their own statue, for no reason other than their basic ability to breathe and live."
16,What influence does print media have on elections?,politics," As you’ve probably noticed, we’re living in a digital age. Due to this, print media is often overlooked and is seen as a less effective way to spread a message. But what if we told you that over £15m was spent on print during the 2015 General Election in the United Kingdom? Direct Letterbox Marketing (DLM), a specialist in door to door leaflet distribution, has investigated further: Looking back on previous elections To understand how widespread print media was used, we can look at the spending across the big political parties in the UK. During the 2015 General Election, we found that the Conservative party spent the most money during its campaign — totalling £15.6m. Labour closely followed by spending £12.1m, Liberal Democrats with £3.5m, the UK Independence Party with £2.9m, SNP with £1.5m, and lastly the Green Party which spent £1.1m. Of course, some parties had higher marketing budgets than others, but the way they spent was entirely different — each had their own set of priorities that they thought would benefit them in the run up to 10 Downing Street. The success of print Research discovered that Labour spent over half of its entire budget on print (£7.4m). This major investment highlights the importance of print media, and the impact it can have on a large audience, and shows that it is still relevant today. One reason as to why Labour spent this amount of money on print media is because 45% of people get their political news from a newspaper — with The Guardian being most popular at 16%. Was there a reason behind Labour’s lack of focus on digital media? According to YouGov, only 15% of people reported that they received their political news from Facebook and 8% from Twitter — showing that, although the world is going digital, more people trust printed information in comparison to information that is displayed digitally. In 2017, research showed that Britons trusted the television more than any other media outlet (42%) during the 2017 General Election. Print media came in at 32% whilst social media influenced only 26% of people. With algorithms changing constantly, more people become distrustful towards online social media platforms, as they try to enhance the experience with what they think the user wants to see — not necessarily showing the full picture when it comes to who to vote for. Print media has a duty to be impartial, and give political parties equal space to get their points across — evidently, this isn’t the same case for social media platforms. The good thing about flyers and posters is that they can be customised to the individual based on where they live. This can help political parties immensely, especially when they’re trying to win seats and help their representative succeed across different authorities. But what are the common methods that political groups use when advertising in print? Campaigners can create leaflets based on topical local issues. For example, if there was an area in which more schools were facing closure, they would capitalise on this and address it in their flyer, reassuring potential voters about what they would do to fix that issue. Or, if the party is not currently in control of that area, they could blame the problems on another party. Politics is a difficult game, but influencing an audience can be easy. There’s a huge misconception that print media is dying — but it’s not going anywhere and the influence it has on an audience is recognised by anyone working in business."
17,UAE sponsors controversial anti-Qatar conference in London,politics," LCPA, London, UK (09.09.2017) – A controversial UAE conference has been announced late august 2017 in London, UK. The Conference planned to take place on 14th September 2017 seems to be yet another UAE endeavour to damage the flourishing Qatar-UK relations and the wider Qatar-EU unshakable bonds. The conference titled, ""The Qatar, Global Security & Stability Conference"" is part of KSA-UAE-Bahrain campaign which aims at isolating Qatar on international level. LCPA has learnt that this event is being run by US media consultancy company which has contentious history of running similar negative campaigns. London Centre For Public Affairs (LCPA) warn UK MPs, politicians not to fall victims of this conference which apparently has no announced speakers nor working agenda. The conference has not even announced its venue! LCPA is observing cautiously this conference and other UAE negative lobby and pressure efforts in the UK. As an organisation interested in the UK-Europe Public Affairs, our centre vows to stop such activities by reaching out to UK parliamentarians and decision makers to expose this counterfeit event. Our centre will also contact Daniel Kawczynski MP who has been misled by the organisers. ""Indeed, this is a very notorious bogus event that aims at damaging Qatar image and meddling its relations with UK and Europe. Qatar’s investment in the UK has reached a record high of more than £35 billion with £5.3 billion – a remarkable 98% increase in the last 3 years. This is golden relation that must not be affected to satisfy the foreign UAE’s goals."" said LCPA spokesperson. The Centre will conduct an immediate campaign to stop this conference from achieving its misleading goals. We believe in strong UK relations with Qatar and refuse any external efforts to ruin the ever-flourishing bonds with Qatar. Recently, Secretary of State for International Trade, Dr Liam Fox stated,"" And as our countries go from strength to strength, we can be assured that this bond is stronger than ever."" LCPA will reach to the UK Government as well as the Foreign Affairs Committee to expose the goals of the organisers."
18,"Idi Amin’s Reign of Terror, Trial and Error",politics," Introduction Whenever the name ""Idi Amin"" is invoked, it denotes elements of brutality, bloodshed and dictatorship--the leadership techniques that made him famous for being infamous. Amin was arguably one of the most polarizing political leaders of the 20Th century. His mental stability has been a subject of contentious debate across the globe because of the cruelty with which he ruled Uganda from 1971 to 1979. In an attempt to understand his disastrous regime, some geniuses have dramatize it through theatrical satire. The snippets of comic episodes in the movies ""The Last King of Scotland"" and ""The Rise and Fall of Idi Amin,"" give us a glimpse of what looks like his clinical insanity--Idi Amin was unable to discern fantasy and reality. His narcissistic character and dictatorial style of leadership are known. What has not been explored extensively, however, is how his lack of qualities of a good leader played a role in his downfall, which is the main focus of this article. Amin's Rise to Power Believed to have been born of a Kakwa father and a Lugbara mother between 1923 and 1925, Idi Amin was the third president of the republic of Uganda. What made him a fascinating figure of the 20th century was his ability to rise quickly through the ranks: assistant cook with the King's African Rifle (1947); army private with the infant division of KAR (1947); commissioned officer (1949); lieutenant (1959); captain (1962); deputy commander of army (1964); army commander (1965); colonel (1967); commander of all armed forces (1970); and president of the republic of Uganda (1971-1979). In 1965, Amin and Prime Minister Obote were accused by the Democratic Republic of Congo of smuggling and trading in ivory and gold with the rebels fighting the government of Patrice Lumumba. This controversial trade in exchange for guns to aid the rebels engendered an investigation into the matter by the Ugandan Parliament--at that time the ceremonial presidential position was being held by King Mutesa III. To obstruct justice and block their possible indictment, Obote initiated a constitutional amendment that abolished kingdoms. He then connived with Amin to attack Mutesa's palace and force him into exile. After King Mutesa had been deposed, Obote declared himself the executive president with full presidential powers. Following Amin's suspicious recruitment into the Ugandan army of mostly people from his tribe and from Southern Sudan, Obote demoted him from being in charge of all armed forces to commander of the army. When Amin learned that the government was planning to arrest him for embezzlement of public funds, he staged a coup that toppled Obote's government in 1971. Reign of Terror One of the qualities of a good leader is his ability to instill confidence in his followers. To the contrary, Amin created doubt, suspicion, anxiety and fear in his people. He is believed to have murdered over 500,000 people. He carried out public executions of his opponents and suspected criminals in broad-day light; murdered religious leaders, judges, and intellectuals; massacred over 5,000 Acholi and Lang soldiers loyal to former president Obote; and butchered prominent and public figures he suspected to pose a threat to his presidency such as Benedicto Kiwanuka, Janani Luwum, Joseph Muburu, Frank Kalimuzo, Byron Kawandwa, Erinayo Wilson Oryemo, and Charles Oboth. His reign of terror led to his loss of support, not only from his army loyalists, but also from the world leaders. His inability to hold himself and his close associates to higher standards suggests that Amin did not have strong values that are characteristic of a strong leader. His authorization and facilitation of the hijackers loyal to a Palestinian terror organization, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine External Operation (PFLP-EO), to hijack the plane carrying Israeli nationals in 1976 indicated that he was the terrorists' sympathizer. This led to Israeli commandos' seizure of Entebbe Airport and the eventual rescue of most of their hostages in a matter of hours. The ride on Entebbe embarrassed his presidency and exposed the weaknesses of his army. His alliance with a terror organization estranged his former allies, in turn Israel and Britain started withdrawing their presence in Uganda, which continued to isolate him further. Amin was emotionally unintelligent--a recipe for disastrous leadership. Neither did he have the ability to manage his own emotions, nor did he have the understanding of what his emotions meant and how they affected others. When Archbishop Ben Kiwanuka delivered a note of protest to his policies of arbitrary killings, he murdered him together with his two ministers in a staged car accident. This brutal action continued to reveal that his regime was a human-rights violator and diminished his international support. In order for a good leader to succeed at fulfilling his vision, he needs to build a network of valuable people around him who have the ability and the necessary experience to implement and manage his or her change efforts. Idi Amin's reign presented a unique contradiction. He oppressed not only the poor, the intellectual and the religious; he also persecuted his close associates. The incident in which his Vice president Idris was injured in a suspicious accident led to the beginning of the end of his presidency. When Idris got injured in the motor vehicle accident, his bodyguards suspected foul play and mutinied and ran into exile in Tanzania. Amin pursued them and annexed Kagera, one of the regions of Tanzania, falsely accusing Tanzania of creating hostilities against his country. Tanzanian defense forces responded militarily, chased Amin out of their country and orchestrated his ouster in Uganda in 1979. Trial and Error A good leader is the one who is focused, personable, knowledgeable, good decision maker and visionary. Amin seemed to posses none of these leadership qualities. He made errors after errors--from the time he set foot into State House to the time of his overthrow. Nobody knew what exactly Amin's vision for his country was. As soon as he ascended to power, he promised to relinquish power and release prisoners of war. This changed in an instant as he suspended some provisions in the Ugandan constitution and placed military tribunal over the civil law. These new constitutional amendments meant that cabinet ministers would be subjected to military discipline. Consequently, many members of his cabinet ran into exile for fear of their lives. The manipulation of the Ugandan constitution also damaged his reputation and signaled to the world that he had ushered in an era of terror, which would go on to grip the country for the rest of his presidency. Amin lacked the ability to recognize skill and develop those around him--one of the great qualities of an accomplished leader. Instead, he looked at intellectuals and the educated as his adversaries. He filled his army and his cabinet with sycophants--foreigners and people from his own tribe who had no leadership experience. His army was composed of 50% South Sudanese, 26% Congolese, and 24% Ugandans. His tribe occupied 60% of the 22 cabinet ministerial posts. Seventy-five percent of the ministerial posts were occupied by army generals, and 80% to 87% of the army generals in his cabinet were Muslims--despite the fact that Muslims constituted 5% of the Ugandan population. As a result, his stooges mismanaged his government, caused the destruction of the infrastructure and contributed to total economic collapse. It is ironic that his Libyan friends fought alone during Uganda's war with Tanzania while his own soldiers resorted to looting and packing their army trucks with their belongings to flee the country. Open-mindedness and flexibility were in short supply in Amin's regime. Instead of investing, developing and maintaining relationships with investors and entrepreneurs who were a revenue stream for the country, he harassed them, destroyed their businesses and expropriated their properties. After the expulsion of the Asians and Indians, his relationships with Britain, India, and Israel got ruined. Britain reduced its presence in Uganda in 1973. India also severed its relationship with Uganda. And Israel cut its ties with the Ugandan army. In retaliation, Amin expelled Israeli military advisors and turned to Libya and Soviet Union for consolation. His continued isolation by the super powers affected Uganda economically and militarily. Furthermore, unemployment rose; sugar and cement factories collapsed; and Uganda's industries came to a standstill because of the failure to repair industrial machinery. Instilling in his people a sense of belonging is another trait of an experienced leader. As I mentioned earlier, Amin's brutal and dictatorial regime caused massive movement of intellectuals into exile. One of the major defections was his Prime Minister Henry Kyemba in 1977; he wrote a book ""State of Blood"" while in exile that exposed the inner workings of Amin's regime. Amin underestimated the brain power of Ugandan intellectuals. It was through the intellectual alliance of Ugandan exile--working alongside Tanzanian defense forces--that expedited the collapse of Amina's regime. The intellectual alliance comprised of 28 military units including the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA); Kikosi Maalum, led by Milton Obote (former president of Uganda) together with Tito Okello (former president of Uganda) and David Oyite Ojok as commanders; FRONASA led by Yoweri Museveni (Current president of the Republic of Uganda); Save Uganda Movement (SUM) led by Akena p'Ojok, William Omaria and Ateker Ejaly; and Freedom Union lead by Godrey Binaisa, Andrew Kayiira and Olara Otunnu. Conclusion Idi Amin's regime (1971-1979) can best be described as a comedy of terror, trial and error: he carried out summary execution of his people; associated with, and sponsored terrorists; expelled investors and expropriated their properties; persecuted intellectuals; invaded Tanzania, a sovereign nation; surrounded himself with bowing henchmen with no leadership experience; alienated and isolated Uganda from the rest of the world because of his foreign policies; mismanaged the government; and orchestrated the total collapse of Uganda's economy. It is inconceivable and inexplicable that when all this was happening, the world was watching. As a saying goes, ""the world is dangerous, not because of what people do, but because of those who sit and watch."" I would appreciate it if someone told me a person who said those immortal words!"
19,Our Modern Plight: An Observation Into Our Current State in Time & How It Affects Us All,politics," As of lately the media has portrayed much chaos, all at an immensely alarming rate, and not just local predicaments, but major events taking place globally. Everyday you hear news of ""Shootings"" ""Riots"" ""Attacks"" etc. Simply put, its violence affecting vast amounts of people. From my research and overall observance of not only these current issues, but within the web of it all, the truth has become evident. The real issue here doesn't lie within our Race, Ethnicity, Police, Presidential Election or anything else the media continuously force- feeds you. Yes, these are individual concerns; however, they are due to a much greater problem. Once you are aware of this problem, all else will fall into place. The media's recent portrayal of events is merely a textbook case of: Divide and Conquer: The policy of maintaining control over one's subordinates or subjects by encouraging dissent between them. This strategy is executed by the technique of: Creating or encouraging divisions among the subjects to prevent alliances that could challenge the sovereign Why? The U.S government is run by a privately owned Central Bank named the Federal Reserve, or Fed; this system creates its own policies, and controls both the Interest rates and entire money supply of the United States. No, it is not actually Federal nor does it have any reserves. The Federal Reserve operates in absolute secrecy. As Alan Greenspan, Former Chairman of the Fed, said when asked what should be the proper relationship between the Chairman and the President of the United States, ""... The Federal Reserve is an independent agency, and that means,... that there is no other agency of government, which can overrule actions that we take. So long as that is in place... then what the relationships are, don't frankly, matter."" This corporation was given the ability, to not only create money out of thin air, but to then lend it to the government, with Interest. Interest that the Government pays by the enforcive means of the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security system. The IRS acts as the collection branch for these payments; our taxes go directly to the Federal Reserve. Currently, there is no ""law"" which states we are actually required to pay an Income Tax. The Fed and IRS were both established in 1913. With the Social Security Act being passed in 1935, wherein all citizens were covertly pledged as collateral to these Central Banks for the debt of the United States. This debt can only be paid off by borrowing even more money into existence; money that is no longer backed by gold or anything for that matter, the value it has is the value we give it. This worthless paper currently in circulation is actually a loan from the Fed to you, with Interest. As Josiah Stamp, prominent banker and economist, once said, ""... If you want to continue to be slaves of the banks and pay the cost of your own slavery, then let bankers continue to create money and control credit. Money = Debt = Slavery This means a private cartel of bankers have complete control over the Government and its money system as we know it. What we call a ""Democracy"" In the Unites States, in actuality, is an Oligarchy consisting of largely foreign banking families. These families have historically been called the ""Money Changers"", Manipulating and controlling a nations money system while allowing it to appear to be controlled by the government. As Mayer Amschel Rothschild, founder of the Rothschild banking dynasty, famously said, ""Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws."" Or better yet, as his son, Nathan Rothschild said, ""Who controls the issuance of money, controls the government."" These banking families, with its institutions and its financial system, had seized the U.S government over a century ago, through years of corruption and manipulation. After Woodrow Wilson became president, agreeing to sign the 1913 Federal Reserve Act, in exchange for sponsorship and campaign funding from these bankers, he later wrote, ""... I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit... We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world, no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men. "" Today, we are facing some of the most violent, inhumane treatment of our people in every way, and the rate of which these major incidents are taking place is reaching its boiling point. No, these aren't accidents or sporadic acts of hate, these are orchestrated events inflicted by these same families. With a hidden hand in virtually all levels of commerce, they are able to utilize the monopoly of resources they fund, such as the influential Media and of course, the Military Industrial Complex. From funding opposing sides of wars to opposing sides of political parties, these International Bankers have artificially created panics, wars, and countless *False flag events throughout history; One crucial example, ""The Panic of 1907"", was the catalyst of the governments change to a private Central Bank, the Federal Reserve System. The bankers engineered a staged panic in order to alter public opinion and thereby outcome of the matter, bringing in laws and legislation that citizens would not accept otherwise. These False flags are still taking place today, with consequences and repercussions being devastating, not only to ourselves, but to our freedom and future as well. The changes in which these events bring, will inevitably affect us all. The goals of these families would face resistance if openly stated, so in order to execute their plans, they do so without stating their intentions. As what's been called ""P.R.S."" Problem-Reaction-Solution The Banking Families (Elite), Government Etc. create a Problem, whether its an Attack, War, or Economic crisis, Whatever is best for the pursued outcome. They blame someone or something for this ""problem"", using the media to portray and thereby control the event and information how they best find suitable. They will only tell you what they want you to know, presenting it as fact or truth. This in effect, causes whatever reaction among the people they initially wanted. Now with the masses sharing this urgent reaction, Fear, Anger, Hatred, Etc. The government shall respond with an urgent Solution, one that will seem justified due to the outcome of the problem they covertly created.This will on the surface, seem like the appropriate action, it was manufactured to appear so, however, the true intent and sought outcome are only to advance their agenda. Simply put, the purpose of P.R.S, with the use of False flags, is to attain a desired reaction in order to implement a desired solution. Why? The goal of these families is to usher in, what has been called by Politicians and bankers, a ""New World Order"", or the rebranded version, ""Globalization."" As David Rockefeller, prominent banker, said himself, ""We are on the verge of a global transformation. All we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order."" That is to bring all life on earth under one single global state, a one-world government. It is a merger between Capitalism and Communism, based on the theory of Collectivism: The practice or principle of giving a group priority over each individual in it, with ownership of land and the means of production by the state. It isn't necessarily about world government, but rather world governance, with personal control by a few. Individuality will no longer exist; we will be born and bred for the sole purpose of serving the state, never understanding the true nature of our self nor our lives. Our world will be one of enslaved servants, with no families, no spirituality, no intellect, no creativity, no privacy and no freedom, only labor. We are being conditioned, and our youth indoctrinated, to accept these changes being imposed upon our lives, to obey, and even learn to like these changes. You can see it in our educational system, where the focus isn't on life, creativity, uniqueness, or true wisdom; but on conformity, obedience, repetitiveness, memorization and standardized testing. We are told what to think, not how, nor why. We are taught less about the real history of our world, preventing us from learning from our ancestor's previous mistakes. Controlling how people perceive their past, controls their perception of the present. As George Orwell, acclaimed author, accurately said, ""The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history."" They seek to keep us uninformed, misled and oblivious to the true nature of the world around us, accepting what we are given as reality. Through the usage of drugs, legal or illegal, genetically modified foods and chemicals within our air and water, we are literally being sedated, to become further docile and content within this system. We are constantly distracted, using our mind, time and energy for work, consumerism, materialism, and all forms of entertainment, never allowing ourselves to truly experience and focus on what matters most. We are forever immersed in an external, false reality of ignorance. One in which privacy does not exist, virtually everything you do on a phone, computer, or at work, is monitored and recorded. We are giving away this privacy ourselves, by accepting agreements with terms and conditions we don't even read. To use applications, which rarely enlighten us nor educate us, but rather distract and evoke ego, competition, separation and jealousy within us. This in effect, causes our impressionable youth to make less independent decisions in their lives, being influenced by others within this false reality of perfection. This repetitive cycle of work-eat-sleep, while blindly entertaining ourselves in between, is what keeps us supporting this system. It only works because you do. In order to rid ourselves from the shackles of this society and break free from this tyranny, we must become more attentive and observant to the changes occurring in our lifetime. We must analyze current and past issues, not only from mainstream media coverage, but rather independent research. Look beneath the surface, ask who would benefit from your reaction to this news, put the puzzle pieces together yourself. The facts are there. You will start to the see the process of Problem-Reaction-Solution unfold right before your eyes, and how major events the media perpetuates, are all inner connected. The truth becomes apparent, even obvious. Do not ignore it. It is imperative that we educate ourselves and share this information, the more awareness we spread, the more power we gain through each other. We need to become more vocal about the corruption and manipulation in our system; we must work to expose the lies of this minority, ruling the vast majority. We must organize. If not, we will find ourselves living within a totalitarian society, where thinking independently or questioning the ""establishment"" will indefinitely, result in death. We've already watched this happen to many of our great leaders of the past, who've advocated this same truth, and even millions of innocent people who fell victim to an oppressive regime or system. History repeats itself; and we are on the verge of this same change. We cannot continue to let this happen, to ourselves, our youth, our families, our world, nor our future. We must wake up, we need to seek clarity within this matrix, and we must seek truth. Above all, we must let go of all indoctrinated beliefs, dogmas and ways of thinking about one another, and ourselves. Through mainstream religion, political ideologies, race, age, wealth, class and gender, we have separated ourselves from one another, judging each other based of external illusions. We are being played into the classic divide and conquer method, used through out history to control populations. For if we are constantly fighting amongst each other, blaming opposing political parties, both in fear and ignorance, we will never fully recognize the real force controlling and manipulating our lives. The simple truth is, we are all one. All living and deceased matter is made up of the same particles, for it is only our physical manifestation within this dimension. We are in actuality, soul, spirit and consciousness within a human body. We are eternal, infinite beings of energy, sharing a physical experience on earth. We are all equal, in every way. We are equal to each other, all humans, all animals, all nature and all living entities, all life. Let us free our mind of ego and imposed ideologies, so that we may come together in harmony, and unite as one, co-existing as loving, conscious, intelligent beings. That in turn, would allow every soul to rejoice and feel absolute beautiful and pure peace within, until then.

20,Largest U.S. Oil & Gas Source Discovered - No Motivation To Get It,politics," On November 15th, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) assessed that Texas’s Wolfcamp shale contains an estimated 20 billion barrels of oil, and 1.6 billion barrels of natural gas liquids.  These figures elevate Wolfcamp to being the largest assessment of continuous oil discovered in US history—serving as yet another reminder that even areas that have already yielded billions of barrels of oil and gas are still capable of producing billions more. That said, the questions on everyone’s minds are ""will discoveries like this continue to occur?"" and ""what does this mean for jobs and the economy?"" It’s important to point out that even the already-discovered and tapped O&G deposits tend to only give up 50-60% of the oil and gas that’s buried in earth.  These low percentages are due primarily to technological limitations, so as time goes on, not only will our discovery and assessment practices improve, so too will our recovery ability increase to more effectively exhaust these deposits. ""Changes in technology and industry practices can have significant effects on what resources are technically recoverable,"" said Walter Guidroz, program coordinator for the USGS Energy Resources Program. ""That’s why we continue to perform resource assessments throughout the United States and the world."" While it’s good to know we are growing more technically capable of both assessing and producing oil and gas from on and off-shore locations, the current economics simply fail to motivate most O&G companies from presently taking advantage of new discoveries like Wolfcamp. With the current price per barrel hovering around $46 USD/bbl, it’s just not fiscally attractive enough to pursue at this time. The bottom line for hopeful US job seekers is that foreign entities are still putting a strain on domestic companies’ ability to expand.  Like we saw from January of 2013 through July 2014, participating countries in OPEC failed to reach an agreement on production limits [to cap production and thereby protect unit price], and their insatiable quest for profits led to an ever-increasing rig count and production—an unchecked expansion vis-à-vis market demand.  The result: $97 down to $45 USD/bbl. The US rig count has been slowly trending upward (though last week, the count decreased by 1), but the price per barrel needs to rebound to Q2 2015 numbers before worker-demand increases. Morris Burns, a former president of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association noted, ""We are picking up a few rigs every now and then but we won’t see it really take off until we [get] that price in the $60 to $65 range."" We have more oil, and no motivation to go get it."

1,A Challenge to Our Two Candidates – Why Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton MUST Read This Book,politics," E. Dennis Brod, the philosopher and author of The Essence of Ethical Pragmatism (the common sense philosophy), has issued a challenge to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The recently published book, lauded as being non-partisan and impartial, explains the philosophy of ethical pragmatism (EP) and shows how we can all lead our lives smarter and better, whether simply doing a personal, individual chore or running a government like that of the United States. In terms of serving in federal government, whether in a low-level ministerial job, in the Congress, the judiciary or in any level of administration in the executive branch including the president, the simple tenets of this philosophy as set out in the book would seem to help in reaching all the goals we seek in our lives and, regarding candidates for the presidency, in reaching the goals that candidates often talk about but seldom seem to achieve. The challenge deals with one specific goal related to the philosophy. The author’s views on how to get things done should not be considered a theoretical, utopian fantasy. This is a philosophy that deals with reality. EP is based on pragmatism and insists on doing only that which will work without regard to labels, prejudices, ideologies or dogmas. It requires accurately assessing facts and ignoring all corrupting emotions. It is completely non-partisan, impartial and objective. It requires the use of common sense. Three major industry reviewers just recently said about the book: ""Brod’s exposition is undoubtedly clearer than those of his philosophical predecessors …This is an admirably bipartisan book and it radiates open-mindedness."" —Kirkus Reviews ""Brod’s book is clearly written and easily accessible to lay readers … those seeking a practical philosophy will find interesting ideas presented here."" —Blueink Reviews ""Observing incompetence and hypocrisy in government and society, the author proposes that these current systems are faulty … There is much food for thought in this readable philosophical book"" Rebecca Foster, Foreword/Clarion Reviews This is what Brod’s challenge says about this one crucial topic in his challenge to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump: I challenge Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump to acknowledge and address the issue described in this article. Not very long ago, our government managed to get us through some very difficult situations. In the last century, we fought two world wars, engaged in other armed conflicts around the globe, survived the greatest economic catastrophe in history and made great progress in the beginnings of overcoming racial oppression. Unfortunately, we may never be able to repeat whatever successes we achieved then because the political character of our nation has changed dramatically. As a result of this change, shown in the following paragraphs, the candidates for the presidency now must realize that they have to prepare for something entirely different in terms of intensity than that of their predecessors if they are elected. They have to know that they will be stepping into a figurative combat zone in attempting to lead our country. The great change between politics of today and that of yesteryear relates to attitudes and behavior of elected officials and others serving in, or working in relationship to, government. I am talking principally about the flagrant and destructive hostility between our only two real political parties. There have always been differences between and among members of different political parties. Differences among humans is what defines us as a species and, in many way, contributes to the development of ideas, technologies and varied perspectives that result in myriad benefits to our race. But today we see something that is inimical to mere differences of opinion or broad philosophical approaches to government. Today we have hatred. And the hatred is not confined to elected officials and those serving in government. It is rampant among journalists and in all aspects of what we call the media. It is felt and expressed by the general public. There are many issues being addressed by both candidates for the presidency. But in reporting, in general, the media tend to focus more on personalities than issues. The media appear to have the notion that the general public is incapable of appreciating the serious side of election campaigns and perhaps they are right. They seem to believe that the average voter prefers to hear about, see, and to a much lesser degree, read those things that are commonly regarded as sensational. Predictably, that is exactly what they provide. As a result, coverage of elections in our country has degenerated into a pandering frenzy. Many commentators, not all in the United States, believe that, in general, the media are biased. In this particular election the overwhelming criticism indicates a bias in favor of Hillary Clinton, doubtless growing out of the notion that most of the media are on the left of the political spectrum, but also based on actual observations about the content of coverage. But this tends to mean much more than favoring one candidate over another. It also means favoring one political party over the other, ignoring the reality that nearly half of the American electorate will vote for each party’s nominees. Although newspaper and other media endorsements are a tradition in American elections, media efforts to ruin a candidate are something else, and this appears to be the situation orchestrated against Donald Trump, and of necessity, the Republican party. This is not limited simply to negative photos and slants on statements, speeches and policy positions, but an outright scheme to ruin the candidate by making him seem ridiculous at every opportunity. As one of the recent reviews states, my book is ""admirably bipartisan"". This is true, but the philosophy is more than ""bipartisan"", it is totally non-partisan. It is completely objective and impartial. I can only speculate about the above reviewer’s thought processes, but this conclusion was presumably reached due to the express tenet of the philosophy which requires focus on the facts – objectively, impartially and unemotionally with a total disregard of labels. Focus on actual facts is no longer occurring in our political campaigns in general, and in the one being waged now, the loss of focus is a disaster. In terms of the relationship between the respective supporters of our two political parties, the media are doing a great disservice to the electorate. Whatever the media think of the electorate – that they are stupid, ignorant, irresponsible, foolish and gullible – the electorate deserve the truth. This means the unvarnished truth, without spin, without slant, without secret agendas and without opinion unless such communication is openly declared to be an opinion. Reporting the truth means treating both political parties without bias. It means holding the candidates to the same standards, regardless of gender, personality, hair style, size, weight or any other characteristic that does not directly reflect on one’s ability to govern. Intelligence, integrity, compassion, executive prowess – these are relevant. Reporting or commenting on trifles, personalities and the sensational is not simply irrelevant, it is an abandonment of responsibility. But there is something more. Holding up any candidate to personal ridicule foments the type of enmity that augments emotional responses and contributes to the abandonment of focus on values and issues. It fuels the emotions rather than the intellect and it creates and atmosphere more conducive to conflict than cooperation. In terms of coverage, whether in favor of one candidate or the other, any intelligent observer has to be dismayed at the amount of media exposure regarding, as examples, Hillary Clinton’s difficulty getting through a subway turnstile or Donald Trump’s hair. But this is what we have and it is difficult to change. Speaking of change, Donald Trump wants to make America great again. This is a noble goal. Although this notion is a slogan of the Trump campaign, I am certain that Hillary Clinton, if she felt that America was no longer great, would be in favor of making America great again too. To make a point, let us assume that both candidates came to publically agree on wanting to make America great again. Does this relate to anything in the book about EP? Is this related to the challenge being made in this piece? Yes, because the simple, apparently unacknowledged fact is that no president alone has the power to make America or anything great again or even for the first time for that matter. In fact, all plans, projects and programs, whether foreign or domestic, whether social or military, cannot be implemented in our country without the participation, consent and funding by the Congress. And at this time in our history, our Congress consists of two parties at war with each other. The two candidates are challenged to acknowledge this. In the book, the philosophy indicates how to get things done in a pragmatic way. In order to do that, certain requirements have to be respected, one of which is being totally objective when making observations so as to start working with the facts. And by facts, we mean the real facts, without spin, without preconceived notions and with complete impartiality. This is very difficult for the public to do when, among other negative things, they are bombarded nightly by the bilge from scripts written for late night talk show hosts bent on ridicule. No one in that situation wants to be serious about the future of our country because entertainment, no matter how destructive to our nation, is better for television ratings. EP requires being honest with others, but particularly with one’s self, no matter how painful it may be. Without the unabashed truth, any attempt to address a problem, confront an issue, design a plan or create anything new is like trying to build a skyscraper on quicksand (no intention to refer to a Donald Trump here). In terms of this particular concept, this is what the book itself, as well as the philosophy explained in the book, would propose: that the facts to be acknowledged by both candidates are the realities associated with relations between our two American political parties. This is the most pressing situation ruining our country because it diverts focus away from issues to partisan political (what the book defines as ""competitive politics"") activities. These activities cause legislative gridlock, waste energy, effort and talent and cause the failure of our elected and appointed officials to meet their responsibilities to the American people. So what is the totality of the challenge to these two candidates? What can these candidates can get from this book? First, they can sincerely begin to recognize and confront reality of what an elected president will face. They can get the point that unless each has a way of bringing the two political parties together, they will go nowhere in attempting to fulfill the loftiest goals they are promising to the American people. And second, the respective candidates and their teams can, and must, through the type of critical thinking described in the book, devise a sensible program for effecting a reconciliation between Democrats and Republicans. In so doing, they will be on their way to making our government function the way it was intended to function and the way it did for generations before. When I suggest a sensible program, I do not mean platitudes and generalities, I mean specifics and details. They could start with such things as making appointments in the new administration or in the judiciary. They could use their considerable collective abilities to devise other creative ways to bring all our officials to believe they are all on the same team. This does not require a sacrifice of one’s core beliefs. Quoting from Chapter Four of the book ""[W]e should never compromise principles, but always be willing to compromise positions"". In an overview of this specific challenge relative to the prevailing reality of the state of our two political parties, this writer believes that the candidate who presents the first credible plan for accomplishing this goal will have an easier path to the White House."
2,The Muslims in India are Blackmailing The Indian Majority in the Name of Cow Slaughter.,politics," The Muslims are never happy anywhere in the world and more so in Islamic countries. They always find out innovative ways to invent stories of atrocities on them and start destabilizing wherever they are in minority. Throughout the world Muslims never place country before the religion, it's always I am Muslim first then I am Indian or Iranian or whatever but for the rest of Indians Its I am Indian first then a Sikh or a Hindu or whatever and this is the underlying worrying part for a diverse nation like us, to have people around us whose loyalty is more for their faith than the country and this is always dangerous. In India in fact they are vetoing Hindu development. There is a reservation for Muslims in India but the majority of India's poor committing suicides in Haryana, Punjab, Chhattisgarh are poor Hindus yet being Hindu they receive no reservation. They are not given a chance to seek salvation through visiting Char-Dham at state expenses on the contrary when they attempt with their own hard earned money they are halted at the drop of a hat. It has nowadays become an annual event so there is no hue and cry. Even During extreme emergencies Haz is never delayed and its heavily subsidized. Haz according to me not at all important as if it is so important according to their faith and if it is accepted that a true Muslim should conduct Haj at least once in his lifetime, then why is it that I never find a mention of any of our great Muslim Nawabs and Rulers from Tipu Sultan the Great, Akbar The greater, Aurangzeb the greatest etc and none of the other great rulers of India has ever conducted Haj. What should be my ideal take on this fact? that they were not Muslims or Haj is not so Important in Islam? There is a cry of intolerance from the likes of Amir khan and some others but do they realise that if they were to conduct their business from other liberal countries like The Calipahate, Iran, Saudi etc they would be now hiding or dead already. There is a lot of shout against the beef ban. Now Muslims to destabilise the atmosphere cry that Islam is under threat. In fact as Hindus believe in respecting other's religious sentiments. This also one major reason for banning cow laughter in India and not for reasons the media and Carnivorous group of men vying for the last blood drop of a cow are putting forward. In Hades Muhammad the prophet described and advised his followers to not eat beef as it is also referred to as poison by Muhammed Himself. Beef is not a food of Muslims anywhere in the world, nowhere in the Muslim countries beef is a food. Arabs don't eat it, pathans don't eat it, Pakistani's don't eat it, Turk's don't eat it,Iranians don't eat beef, Iraqis don't,. Now which Muslims started eating this in direct disobedience to the Hades? It's the Muslim Nawabs of Central India who were then ruling a Hindu Majority Kingdom started this custom of eating beef as a symbol of humiliation, control and power over the Hindus. It was akin to showing the majority Hindus his proper place. To insult the majority Hindus and show brute power they started eating beef, This helped in creating an atmosphere of fear and felicitated their rule. In fact the word 'Bara-Gost' generally is referred to Beef was coined in by native resident of Pakistan and as they never ate beef used it in a derogatory parlance to refer to the Mohajirs that went from Central India Thinking Pakistan would be heaven. In fact it's the Muslims who should come forward and fight for a Beef ban and not otherwise."
3,Phosphate Mining In Central Florida Riparian Lands,politics," Florida’s phosphate industry is known to own and strip mine lands in riparian areas of the state. Particularly in central Florida where the regions drinking water is degrading, caused by phosphate industry practices (1). The phosphate mining industry consists of some twenty seven sites in Florida as a whole, but most of the largest phosphate mines are located in central Florida south of interstate four (I-4). Riparian areas in central Florida, which include floodplain uplands as well as wetlands, are considered to be the most important buffer areas for protecting ""receiving water"" quality (incoming water to the system). The water quality and quantity rely on a particular set of variables. Each variable is responsible for a particular task in the natural production of clear clean drinking water. One pollutant in particular causes the most severe environmental impacts called phosphorus (2). High levels of phosphorus in an aquatic habitat causes sever outbreaks of algae which in turn lowers a critical variable called dissolved oxygen in water. This in turn causes the weaker flora to disappear taking with it the fauna that it fed. The cycle continues until all the flora and fauna disappear causing dead zones. Dead zones are sterile areas that can exist as long as the toxin creating the dead zone exists. In this case, phosphorus based nutrients (pollutants) from phosphate mining are causing dead zones in riparian lands and navigable waterways. Industry practices are the cause of many environmental issues including polluting public freshwater resources. After all the freshwater resources belong to the state and considered as public domain. Florida’s phosphate industry can consume only enough water as to not disrupt adjacent land owners and downstream users of the water body in question. Phosphate industry officials direct operations to strip mine this region of Florida possibly without legal authority based on the Public Trust Doctrine of Florida. Keep in mind, this region holds most of Florida’s watersheds north of the Everglades, so ecologically speaking, are without equal anywhere in the world. Unfortunately, the natural process creating such a landscape also produced one of the most sought after minerals for the production of fertilizer called phosphate and it intermingles with central Florida’s fresh drinking water resources sustaining numerous habitats including a 1.8 billion dollar sport fishing venue. Florida does not need phosphate mining as an economic pillar. In fact, over the last forty years, phosphate mining has cost local taxpayers billions of dollars in lost revenue due to industry accidents alone. Interestingly this same region holds central Florida’s freshwater resources intertwined with watersheds supporting lowlands and wetlands. One phosphate mine can cover as much as one hundred thousand acres which includes central Florida’s watersheds, wetlands and drinking water resources. The central region of Florida also contains navigable waterways and riparian lands being completely removed from the earth by the phosphate industry. Using Google© Earth, it is clear to see the severe environmental impacts in the region described above. Unfortunately, the Peace River basin lies in land owned by the phosphate industry and even though the industry has no legal right to mine the regions’ navigable waterways, they do anyway. Florida’s elected officials seem to be blind to the severe environmental impacts to Florida’s freshwater resources. However, water management officials continue to issue permits to strip mine very large tracts of land in Florida’s watersheds, knowing the irreparable damage being caused. The Peace River in central Florida is the 8th most endangered river in the United States while supporting the regions critical environmental connection including natural habitats for numerous species of flora and fauna. Not surprisingly, the head waters of the Peace River are polluted with high levels of algae do to phosphate based nutrients (pollutants). Curiously, the phosphate industry strip mines this region as well, creating phosphorus based pollutants. Industry officials claim they do not know how the high levels of phosphorus are entering the head waters of the Peace River. Industry officials say it is not their facilities causing the problem. Now the phosphorus concentration in central Florida water bodies is so great, the University of Miami researcher’s study suggest the high levels of phosphorus are also increasing outbreaks of red tide where the rivers and streams reach the Gulf of Mexico. The importance of the Peace River basin producing drinking water and essential habitats cannot be overstated. This region also holds floodwaters for recharging the aquifers, rivers, and lakes in the area. Central Florida’s wetlands provide habitats for priceless species of flora and fauna. All of which helps maintain production of clean fresh drinking water.

4,Florida Phosphate Mining Buffer Zones,politics," Phosphate strip mining is known to cause severe landscape disruptions. Mitigation and final land reclamations plans are a must to be ""permitted"" to strip the central Florida earth for phosphate ore.  Strip mining is considered to create the most severe man-made land disturbance known said the Department of Environmental Protection. Phosphate, strip mining in general, creates severe environmental impacts to Central Florida watersheds including the Manatee River, Myakka River and Peace River to name a few. Central Florida’s watersheds produce enough drinking water yearly to support almost 6 million people and still growing. One can imagine how important central Florida’s watersheds are producing public drinking water quality and quantity. In other words, water is absorbed and contained by the landscape. Water is held in the ground sometimes for years before coming back to the surface, all the while moving through the sub-surface ""percolating"" (cleaning) the water for all to enjoy. All the above mentioned naturally contained fresh water resources are considered a treasured natural resource by all in central Florida. Most of Florida’s freshwater resources are consumed for drinking, cattle, irrigation, and other public uses. The water consumed is typically recycled by natural processes such as evaporation and rain water. However, Florida’s phosphate industry located in west central Florida over consumes water that cannot be released back to the environment because the water is extremely toxic. During consumption by the phosphate industry, the water is mixed with toxic pooling liquid acids containing radioactive materials and other toxic phosphatic waste by-products from the production of fertilizer.  Once the water is consumed by the phosphate industry, it cannot be released back into the environment but seems to find a way. One can see some advantages of building ""buffer"" zones to mitigate the toxic environmental impacts caused by producing phosphate based fertilizers. Buffer zones surrounding phosphate mining operations seems to offer empirical evidence in the reduction of phosphorus from clay settling areas (CSA) of highly compacted soils. The compacted phosphatic soils are poor water conduits for surface absorption making buffer zones ecologically important to millions of acres of land holding watersheds and phosphate facilities together in central Florida. ""In finding economic solutions to environmental problems, we are discovering ways in which the goal of regulation, rather than the process, is paramount."" Schlesinger Dean, Nicholas School of Environment and Earth Sciences Duke University.  Buffer zones are paramount, if not required, which surround phosphate facilities for the purpose of reducing severe environmental damage caused by phosphate strip mining in general. Buffer zones (1) offer a way for toxins to be absorbed (uptake) by the landscape when planting particular flora which is based on the type of toxins to mitigate. Buffer zones are an environmental advantage because they create barriers between toxic and non-toxic tracts of land. Buffer zones are set up by planting particular grasses, underbrush, and trees which uptake (absorb) specific toxins. An example is planting a three ring buffer zone. The outside ring of the buffer zone (furthest from the toxic source) is planted with particular grasses known to uptake specific toxins. Then specific underbrush (middle ring) is planted inside the grassy ring which surrounds the ring closest to the toxic source where trees are planted for maximum uptake of toxins. The tree ring or inside the ring, of the buffer zone could be planted with eucalyptus trees because this type of tree is known to absorb phosphorus (1). Phosphate facilities can mitigate much environmental destruction based on sound engineering practices, such as constructing engineered buffer zones. Engineered buffer zones are needed by the phosphate industry to mitigate damage to severely disturbed landscapes. CSA’s are a perfect example where buffer zones would reduce severely disturbed landscapes for phosphorus uptake. Eucalyptus trees apparently thrive on phosphorus uptake creating larger yields for raw wood to use for construction and other purposes. Interestingly, all of the technologies mentioned above are known to produce positive results, but Florida’s phosphate industry may not want profits to suffer at the cost of building engineered buffer zones surrounding phosphate facilities. Phosphorus uptake by eucalyptus trees around phosphate facilities using engineered buffer zones is known to decrease phosphorus nutrients (pollutants) being transmitted through to the soil outside the buffer zone including aquatic(2) areas as well. Techniques such as buffer zones are real world successful applications of engineered soils, grasses, and trees for maximum toxic soil uptake.

5,Phosphate Industry Strip Mining Central Florida Watersheds,politics," The state of Florida owns all riparian lands and navigable waterways held in ""trust"" for the public at large by the sovereignty granted to Florida at statehood in 1845 by the United States of America. The lands under ""public"" navigable waterways are defined as riparian in nature and not to be altered in any way without state consent. Additionally, anyone purchasing land holding such natural waterways must use the land so as ""not to interfere with the public’s right to use the waterway over the land"" (i.e., river bottom) in question and must recognize common law riparian rights when ones actions affect the land. An example of altering the bottom of a waterway may be strip mining, dredging, building a pier, or boat dock. What are riparian land rights you may ask? Riparian rights are those given to lands incident to navigable waterways (3). For example, the land tracts owned by the phosphate industry adjacent to or containing waterway holding riparian ""public"" lands from the low water mark to the high water mark in the waterway and cannot be privately owned, blocked, or altered. These lands are held in trust by the state of Florida for its citizen’s use since 1845. However, phosphate industry officials direct operations to strip mine large tracts of land including riparian lands and navigable waterways for the phosphate 30 to 50 feet beneath the landscape. Some of the lands being strip mined by Florida’s phosphate industry are riparian lands. Some of the waterways the phosphate industry alters are navigable waterways. Both instances (2) are highly controversial and may be illegal in some circumstances based on the U.S. Constitution and Florida laws as well. However, changing riparian lands or navigable waterways to better ""public uses"" may be allowed and is encouraged by the state. In another example, a large tract of land called the Altman Tract is owned by the phosphate industry and contains navigable waterways with riparian lands. The phosphate industry cannot alter the waterway or the land under the waterway in a way that interferes with downstream riparian lands rights and downstream waterway users. However, the phosphate industry is entirely removing waterways from the surface of the earth while stripping riparian lands as well. Why are Florida’s elected officials and public media silent concerning the above industry practices? Producing ""public awareness"" on this topic is almost unheard by most of Florida’s taxpayers, says the Florida Institute for Phosphate Research, FIPR. Are we to believe that is coincidental? In the last example, upstream waterway users cannot interfere with the natural characteristics of the navigable waterway that adversely affects downstream users. Riparian lands and navigable waterways are granted to the public by the state of Florida as public domain and may be used by anyone for travel, commerce, leisure, and the like. However, when state politics are used to rewrite history related to Florida’s lands being ""public domain"" or sovereign based on statehood, then all state laws may be subjugate and seemingly encouraged by Florida’s elected officials. Unfortunately, Florida’s phosphate industry purchases large tracts of land holding ""public"" navigable waterways and riparian lands to strip mine for phosphate. These large tracts of land are located in west central Florida, home to many environmentally challenged critical riparian lands and public waterways providing safe drinking water to millions of people year after year. Most of central Florida’s drinking water is produced by regional watersheds. What are navigable waterways you may ask? Navigable waterways are defined as water bodies offering possible benefits for ""public uses"" (2). Navigable waterways are not limited by the ability to navigate a vessel on the waterway. Public uses cover a broad range of possibilities, including drinking water, leisure, commerce, travel, and the like. Large land tracts which contain riparian land and navigable waterways in the central Florida watersheds are owned by the state since the time of statehood in 1845. The problem occurs when the state’s elected officials ""permit"" (1) mining in large tracts of land in central Florida’s watersheds to the phosphate industry knowing the industry draglines will strip everything including ""public rights"" from the earth’s surface until it finds phosphate. State officials also know that strip mining in the regional watersheds historically degrades drinking water quality and quantity and will from now on, says the Department of Environmental Protection. State officials know the severe environmental impacts caused by the phosphate industry but continue to ""permit"" strip mining in state riparian lands and navigable waterways critical for millions of Florida taxpayer’s safe public drinking water resources. Let your elected officials know how you feel on the subject of phosphate strip mining degrading Florida’s drinking water.

6,Phosphate Industry Siege On Alafia River And Watersheds,politics," The Alafia River watersheds and smaller tributaries in the area are known to be used as ""navigable waterways"" by the state of Florida during the early-19th century by European (1) settlers. During the early-19th century before and during the time of Florida’s statehood, the Alafia River was traveled by early Americans on a daily basis. The fact mentioned previously settles any doubts this river and its watersheds are defined as a navigable waterway and is considered public domain for travel, leisure, and commerce. A settlement called Riverview took root near the mouth of the Alafia River in west central Florida. Riverview is the first recorded settlement in Florida on the Alafia River in (1) 1835. The first area settled by pioneers from the 19th century is near the present day Bell Shoals Bridge just outside of Brandon, Florida. This area of the Alafia River watershed is one of the most scenic areas on the river. The river takes two dramatic bends while flowing under the Bell Shoals Bridge causing the river banks to erode into thirty foot bluffs on both sides of the river. Bell Shoals Bridge was one of the great spots for fun on the river during the summer months. (2) The bridge is about twenty feet above the average water level at this particular bend in the river. The depth of the river at the bridge was usually around twelve feet deep. The river water clarity was generally about eight to ten feet of visibility, so most of the river bottom was not easy to see. My friends and I spent many a day swimming in the river and jumping off the bridge into the river; it was great clean fun. Lithia Springs was a great fun spot feeding millions of gallons of aquifer water to the river, daily. In the early to middle 70’s the springs fed millions of gallons of cool crystal clear aquifer water into the Alafia River all day every day. Unfortunately, the phosphate industry demands so much water from the local aquifers that the main spring at Lithia dropped over ten feet, and the small spring no longer exists, but the rocks where the little spring did exist are still visible. Tubing down the river from Lithia Springs was awesome. The spring was a great place to start the tubing trip because just about a half mile down river was a small set of rapids that dumped into a vast underground cavern. We used to start tubing at Lithia Springs and tube down the river about three hours and end up at Bell Shoals Bridge. Once one passes Bell Shoals Bridge, the river gets fairly deep and slows to a crawl. The area is perfect for slowly drifting in the cool, shaded river, relaxing and catching some rays. Tubing from Bell Shoals Bridge to Riverview takes about three hours, but the trip was well worth it. During the voyage, it was not uncommon to see a family of the manatee, alligators, various water snakes, and other fellow tubers. The river empties its contents into the Tampa Bay estuary in west central Florida among the mangrove islands, sandbars, and oyster beds just west of Riverview.  This area holds one of the most critical environmentally challenged waters and ecosystems in Florida. The region contains significant environmental treasures such as breeding grounds for many species of fish, mollusks, shrimp, oysters, clams, manatee, and the like. Historically, the Riverview phosphate plant causes toxic waste releases creating miles of dead zones in the Alafia River and Tampa Bay estuary. Phosphate industry officials call these massive kills and dead zones just a ""mishap."" The ""dead zones"" may last years depending on the volume of poisons released into the environment from the phosphate facilities. However, the phosphate industry wanted a phosphate plant built at the mouth of the Alafia River on the back of the Tampa Bay estuary. Interestingly, Tampa Bay is the largest estuary and is environmentally critical to commerce on the west coast of Florida. The Tampa Bay estuary is a navigable waterway by definition, but Florida’s elected officials ""decided to permit"" the phosphate industry officials to alter navigable waterways to build a phosphate plant. Historically, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA says, ""the Florida phosphate industry is the worst environmental hazard in the state."" Why did Florida elected officials ""permit"" phosphate industry officials to construct a phosphate plant in the best environmentally critical ecosystems on the west coast of Florida? This area brings in billions of dollars yearly from tourism alone. Unfortunately, phosphate industry officials are not environmentally savvy and continue to pollute the Riverview area along with Tampa Bay and the Alafia River watershed. Historically, the Riverview phosphate plant is a site where many of the industries worst environmental catastrophes occurred. Unfortunately, the Riverview phosphate plant is one of the largest in Florida with a phosphogypsum stack over two hundred feet in height and covers about one square mile. This ""stack"" is a radioactive phosphogypsum pit full of toxic acidic sludge. Billions of gallons of lethal sludge fill the stack where sulfuric acid and other deadly liquids pool. The large pit surface produces a poisonous sulfuric acidic aerosol, polluting the air in and around the plant all the time, ""day in and day out"". The poisons are carried as far as the wind permits, sometimes for miles. Why would Florida’s elected officials allow this type of industrial environmental harm to continue to occur in such a critical environmentally challenged ecosystem? For the record, phosphate industry officials donate millions of dollars annually for ""access"" to both political parties in Florida, this is no secret.

7,Phosphate Mining The Peace River Watershed Basin,politics," The Peace River watershed lies in west central Florida about forty miles east of the Tampa Bay area. Florida’s Peace River was declared an ""endangered river"" by ""American Rivers.org,"" a non-profit organization committed to protecting and restoring North American rivers. The central Florida region holds unique pristine watersheds, marshlands, bogs, and other freshwater naturally occurring filtering systems. Watersheds are areas of land with waterways that flow to a common destination. Most of the region's drinking water is pumped from aquifers that are ""recharged"" from the watersheds described above. Water seeping or percolating down through Florida’s landscape is naturally filtered by biological and physical reactions on the groundwater. Florida’s residents depend on this process for safe drinking water pumped from the public aquifers below (3). Strip mining these valuable resources show adverse effects on drinking water including quality and quantity. American Rivers.org lists the Peace River as the ""8th"" most endangered river in the U.S. as a combined result of phosphate mining, urban sprawl, and agriculture (2). However, typical household and agriculture water consumed is either returned to the aquifers by ""percolation"", run-off for rivers or evaporates and returns to earth as rain and so on. Freshwater consumed by the phosphate industry cannot be returned to the public domain because the water is toxic to all life forms and must be stored indefinitely in huge holding ponds of toxic waste by-products from the production of fertilizers. The waste by-product holding ponds can be a square mile in area and over one hundred feet deep. Unfortunately, over 320,000 acres of watersheds have been strip-mined for phosphate in the Peace River, its tributaries, watersheds, and basins along with crystal clear natural freshwater springs and aquifers. These once pristine unique ecologically rich areas are now no more than a toxic wasteland. There are no more flora and fauna in these largely abandoned tracts of land because the mighty dragline has stripped everything in its path, including navigable waterways and riparian rights causing disastrous severe permanent hydrological landscape changes. Suppling freshwater to over five hundred thousand residents, one can see how critical the Peace River, its tributaries, and watersheds are to the citizens living in this region of Florida. Natural wetlands provide a vital function and severe land disturbances such as phosphate strip-mining display stark negative impacts to the landscape as a whole and create adverse effects on central Florida’s drinking water. Florida’s phosphate industry officials insist that operations literally ""strip"" the fabric of the landscape by completely removing the wetlands, creating ""wastelands"" while decreasing public water quality and quantity. Over six million people in this region depend on the Peace River basin and watersheds for their drinking water. One must remember the phosphate industry has legal control for ""reasonable use"" of Florida’s freshwater reserves under phosphate industry property. However, phosphate industry officials waste more freshwater reserves in the state of Florida than any other industry consumes. This region also boasts some of the best fishing, boating, and eco-tourism in the world, which are vital industries in the area, each bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars annually by visitors from all around the world. Unfortunately, the Southwest Florida Water Management District, (SFWMD) states the Peace River is in danger of ""significant harm"" because of reduced water flow resulting from Florida phosphate industry’s over-consumption of freshwater reserves; destruction of navigable waterways, while leaving the environmental damage for Florida taxpayers to resolve. Researchers from the University of Miami previously completed studies using a mathematically based model solution to calculate associations of mining with streamflow (1). The model includes parameters derived from empirical data taken in this case, from the upper reaches of the Peace River basin at that time. The study produced an answer that pleased no one, finding that phosphate mining does have an effect on streamflow. Over time, the model has proved empirically to be correct about lower stream flows in the Peace River basin and all that it encompasses.  Interestingly, the results also show regional planning is ""urgently"" needed for reclamation designs containing and enhancing hydrological cycles in the areas of severely disturbed landscapes as an objective.  Little if any progress was made toward new reclamation plans based on predispositions concerning more industry funding required for real world reclamation applications. The Department of the Interior U.S. Geological Survey states environmental stresses to the Charlotte Harbor estuaries is adversely affected by lower stream flows from the Peace River basin. The likely cause was determined to be phosphate industry related from over consumption of freshwater from Florida’s freshwater resources.

8,Florida’s Phosphate Industry Officials Display Little Concern For Florida Riparian Waterways,politics," The state of Florida supports riparian waterways as public domain by law. Riparian waterways are defined as rivers, stream, lakes, marshes, bogs, aquifers, springs, or any navigable waterway above or below ground, including freshwater and saltwater. For instance, one navigates a canoe from a riparian (public) river into a small spring that is surrounded by multiple landowners encompassing the land around the spring. Riparian water rights grant anyone the right to canoe, swim, boat, or just spend leisure time anchored just off the shoreline of the spring. Following the example above, imagine one scuba diving into the aquifer feeding the spring through an opening between the rocks in an underground (riparian) cavern filled with crystal clear water that also traverses property bounds above. Once in the cavern, one can cross property bounds with riparian (public) waterway rights (2). The examples of riparian waterways described above do exist all over central Florida. Florida’s phosphate industry officials know this as well. Phosphate industry officials know the irreparable environmental damage caused by strip mining riparian waterways. Florida’s phosphate industry officials buy television commercials showing wholesome industry practices that create local jobs to feed people worldwide. This is a ""smoke and mirrors"" tactic that Florida citizens as a whole do believe, based on Florida Institute for Phosphate Research, (FIPR) studies. However, industry practices have little if any relationship to the TV ads portrayed by phosphate officials as described above. The TV ads do not mention the last seventy years of destruction to Florida’s unique hydrological landscape and riparian waterways. The ads are not true based on empirical daily industry practices by phosphate industry officials. Statistically speaking, historically, phosphate industry officials reclaim abandoned mines in a 1 to 5 ratio. Meaning, reclamation of abandoned mines occurs to one out of five abandoned mines. The rest of the environmental damage is hidden from public view by building thousands of acres of massive earthen berms to surround the abandoned highly toxic leftovers (1) When industry ""mishaps"" occurs in ""abandoned phosphate mined lands"", historically, Florida’s taxpayers cover the cost to neutralize the severe environmental damage, not the phosphate industry. Mishaps occur regularly at all Florida phosphate plants causing severe environmental impacts, being hidden from the public, only to be discovered later by state environmental officials. However, many ""accidents"" occur in public view such as when a phosphogypsum stack failed and billions of gallons of toxic radioactive wastewater and by-products inundate the surrounding areas with a radius measured in kilometers. Riparian (public) waterways also become polluted, disrupted, or entirely stopped from flowing by phosphate industry mishaps. Natural water flow volumes in the major riparian waterways near phosphate industry operations decline steadily year after year without much ado from Tallahassee, (capital) or local authorities. Maybe the millions of dollars donated to both political parties in the state stop the legal process and oversight to remedy Florida phosphate industry accidents?

9,My Thoughts On Why Donald Trump Is Doing As Good As He Is,politics," Even though I think most of us are tired of being sold, hoodwinked,or basically lied to just to get our votes, we’re pretty much fed up with the normal politician, no matter who they are. But, there are some Americans that still believe some of them are really honest and care…….I’m not sure I know what to say to you guys there, but, how has that been working out for this country? OK, never mind. Anyway, here are some points that may spin a light on why people in the thousands are hopping on the Trump Express: –   Intense verbal attacks on police officers labeling them as racists who hunt down young black men. –   A porous southern border where narcotics and human smuggling continue unabated. –   A stagnant economy where workers have little bargaining power any more. –   A growing jihadist terror threat that the Democratic party refuses to define. …… (Islamic Terrorism) –   A Democratic President who, after he announces the beheading of an American citizen by ISIS, plays golf. –   A culture that now demands political correctness even if it goes against sincerely held religious beliefs. –  A legal system that may harm a business owner if he or she refuses to participate in a gay marriage or nuns against birth control. It is our ""right"" to do so. –  A press corps that generally embraces liberalism, using its constitutional privilege to diminish non-liberals who speak out. –  An education system dominated by leftist teachers and administrators who often impose their views on defenseless children. That’s right. When was the last time you spoke with a High School or College student who described this exactly? –  A grievance industry that is often promoted by the media. Thus, anti-American zealites call this country evil and oppressive. And my last word on Trump, is very bad people are trying to disrupt and exploit his campaign to disguise racial and social hatred…….BUT, make no mistake about it. We are seeing the backbone of this country, and they are standing up by the thousands and giving him their votes…….It’s unprecedented the bashing he is taking, and the will of most Americans will not be broken by the very establishment that they know could care less about the everyday man and women of this country…….It is clear and also amazing to witness…… And I’ll finish with just one bit of proof of what I’m saying here…… These ""rally busters"" are using their 2nd amendment rights to speak out any way they feel they need to…..But, in a Fascist way, to stifle the oppressors, they want to STOP someone they don’t care for from THEIR 2nd amendment rights to speak and say what they want. As this progressed, Clinton, Sanders, Cruz, Rubio, Kasich, and Obama himself (yes the grand poo-bah), came out to put Trump down, and say these fascist, lead by the money of Soros to disrupt, and possibly cause harm CHILDREN, are at no fault for speaking their minds……….I just want to say, as soon as Cruz did that, his followers on Twitter dropped by 300,000…….That’s right, American citizens understanding BS when they clearly see it…… OK…..I’m done ranting…..You make up your own mind…And I also could go on here for about a day or two, but I’ll spare you. You may already know the things I would talk about too. Thanks for reading, and I hope you don’t think I’m wrong….."
10,"Phosphate Permits, Altman Tract, Manatee County Florida",politics," West Central Florida is home to the mega-mining phosphate industry. This area is also rich with the only ecosystem of its kind worldwide. This unique ecosystem is one reason Florida has so many visitors yearly. Billions of dollars are brought into the state through tourism because Florida is the only state with a tropical climate other than Hawaii (3). However, phosphate industry officials are intent on completely eradicating west central Florida’s unique ecosystems for the phosphate ore just beneath the surface. In the recent past, news about the environmental devastation being caused by Florida’s phosphate industry is spreading to communities all around central Florida. The news is on a local level but does not seem to find national coverage. Interestingly, when (culpable) lawsuits are brought against the strip mining juggernaut, strong arm tactics are displayed by industry officials. Manatee County, Florida is facing phosphate industry financial strong arm tactics and various other political strategies which are very effective deterrents and can be observed every day by all who seek. Manatee County Commissioners now know the (financial) pressure that phosphate industry officials can apply by threats of lawsuits totaling over 600 million dollars (2). The industry is taking Manatee County to court for denying badly needed permits because Florida Department of Environmental Protection stated that industry planning reports failed to provide accurate information, a clear reclamation plan, and necessary financial assurance that the site would be properly reclaimed after mining. Phosphate industry officials are used to getting their way even when it is environmentally unsound to do so for Florida’s citizens as a whole. Meaning industry uses its financial muscle to destroy as they please, where anyone else would be denied permits. Historically, phosphate industry officials may financially bully anyone opposing their point of view on the ""status-quo"". Phosphate industry officials insist on strip mining another 2048 acre tract in Manatee County called the Altman Tract (1). This tract is adjacent to recently strip-mined landscape located near the unspoiled headwaters of Horse Creek, in the Peace River basin, which delivers around fifteen percent of normal flow into the lower Peace River. All of which threaten Charlotte Harbor, Florida, risking local venues bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars yearly. Simultaneously, Charlotte County officials are negotiating with the phosphate industry. This is significant because Hardee County is adjacent to Manatee County in Florida. Unfortunately, Charlotte officials submitted to the phosphate juggernaut and are now on board with industry officials and will reluctantly issue permits to strip mine the areas adjacent to previously enormous stripped tracts. The agreement called for changes requested to provide stronger restrictions in the area mentioned above by Charlotte County officials. The changes required by Charlotte County does not follow the phosphate industry ""status-quo""; so one will see if Mosaic Co. officials will entertain the requests. Historically, Florida’s phosphate industry officials do not like changing the status-quo, presently it is in the industries favor. However, litigation is significantly increasing over phosphate strip mining in central Florida. Mosaic Company is the defendant, in this case, simultaneously fighting multiple legal battles in four central Florida counties, hiring three different law firms, based in Tampa, Orlando, and, of course, Tallahassee (capital). Phosphate mining giant Mosaic Company is contesting Manatee County for 617 million dollars just two weeks after Mosaic was denied permits to strip mine the environmentally protected Altman tract (over 2000 acres). Manatee County cannot compete financially with Florida’s phosphate industry officials. County officials also submit to financial pressure by the threat of legal battles and will ""permit"" Mosaic Co. in this case, to strip mine over 2000 acres of pristine environmentally challenged wetlands, springs, rivers, aquifers, marine life, and habitats for thousands of species of life including both floras and fauna.

11,Is The Second Amendment Outdated?,politics," The second amendment to the constitution gives United State citizens the right to own and carry a firearm anywhere in this country. Why would the people founding and declaring a new country called the United States of America want all citizens to own a firearm? The answer remains the same, food and protection. Remember, rights are not the same as privileges, where driving is a privilege, but voting is a right. In retrospect, owning a firearm is your right, not a privilege. It seems the people founding this country expected everyone to own and use a firearm. Training to use one’s firearm came naturally by practice shooting for food or protection. However, sanctioned weapons training were not required because most families used a gun on a daily basis. Historically, understanding how, why, and when to use a gun was necessary in family life. Interestingly, the United States Supreme Court decided one more time in 2010; the second amendment gives all U.S. citizens the right to keep and bear arms. The Court ruled in 2010 the right to carry without infringement, trumping state law. The Court’s decision is directly related to the right to protect one’s life from evil doers. Some people say they have no weapon nor do they want to have a firearm. They do not carry or own a weapon based on the premise one will never be required. This premise seems based on feeling relatively secure in yourself even understanding or, at least, considering people around you are carrying a gun. In many cases, this scenario plays out daily all around us. Why would one feel secure while believing people around them are carrying firearms? Maybe it’s because the unarmed citizen holds all people including the armed citizen, be and act fully accountable for keeping true to the highest sanctity for human life. This makes sense because the example mentioned above plays out daily all over the world, not just the United States. The same scenario plays out daily because the vast majority of people owning firearms feel the same unequaled sanctity for life as most humans feel. If the example here is given credence, then the evidence speaks for itself. Historically, civilizations do not condone chaos because humans have always felt compelled to protect the innocent even over fear of the attacker. Today is no different; most people understand the sanctity of life and respect one another enough not to use violence to solve a disagreement, especially when the stakes are life itself. So it is for most people owning and carrying a weapon. Personally, I hold the belief that such an event will not occur in my life causing me to use deadly force. After all, it may be my death. However, I believe I may be involved in a car accident, even though people driving understand the consequences of being involved in an accident. Meaning, drivers are aware of their vehicular responsibilities and the consequences of their actions. In the same way, most people carrying a weapon share the same awareness and do not walk or drive around expecting to be involved in a gun fight, based on the consequences of being shot. In retrospect, most evil doers also know people are unsuspecting and attack their victim’s at the most opportune time. Unfortunately, evil doers will take advantage of the innocent and use fear to intimidate their victims. This fact cannot be denied. These demented cowards use many types of weapons to intimidate their victims, causing fear and confusion to assist in accosting their victim. The experts say having a gun could cause one to be killed in an altercation because citizens carrying firearms are not trained well enough to thwart off attackers. (1) Experts in law enforcement say citizens carrying guns may be more likely to be shot with their gun during an attack because the attackers are assumed to be better trained or have the advantage of surprise. However, law enforcement does not display statistics for proof of their statements. The people writing and creating the second amendment had no second thoughts about the importance of a firearm. These early Americans knew they needed protection from all wanting to do harm, even the most powerful nation on earth at the time, Great Britain. It is no surprise these brave souls risk their lives by communicating the intent of the newly born United States. The example illustrates these early Americans used firearms for self-protection from all, including the mother country and can be used today for the same reasons, added security measures with firearms.

12,Has Zuma made one bet too many?,politics," I am not South African, but it is a country very close to my heart and one which I always watch with interest. This week saw #ZumaMustFall day. A series of marches in cities across the country calling for the immediate recall or resignation of President Jacob Zuma. It was sparked by the remarkable decision by the President to go through not one, not two, but three Finance Ministers within the space of a week, which in turn sent the country’s currency, the Rand, in to a temporary freefall. Although it has stabilised slightly since. This is not the first time that Jacob Zuma has faced calls to resign from protesters on the streets. The recent #FeesMustFall social media campaign also saw protesters take to the streets, that time about the prohibitive cost of tertiary education in South Africa. Then there has been the long running saga of the property in his hometown of Nkandla, which has seemingly been paid for using public funds. Combine this with the economic downturn affecting the country, which has seen it lose its place as Africa’s largest economy for the first time, as well the poor state of public services, rampant unemployment, and a crime rate that remains stubbornly high, and it is staggering to those not familiar with South African politics that he has survived this long. This is leaving out some of his personal uhum…. statements, regarding the HIV menace that riddles the country he leads. Through all of this the President has never been put in any kind of real political danger though. Partly this is due to the unique makeup of South African politics, which sees an almost religious devotion to his party, the ANC, the anti-apartheid freedom movement turned party of Government, which Nelson Mandela led to victory in the country’s first ever free elections in 1994. Part of it is also down to Zuma himself though. He is a political survivor who specialises in the type of dividing rhetoric that ensures that he presents himself as a son of the freedom movement, and that is ultimately all that matters. This has helped him weather all the previous storms that have come his way. This time feels ever so slightly different though. Nobody with any sense thinks that the marches will actually lead to the President going, but it does show a shift change. Namely the involvement of two key groups. One, the educated and reasonably affluent black middle class, and two, whites. On the second of these groups, there has been criticism by the President’s supporters that this is primarily about white people wanting to get rid of the first President who has actually threatened their privileged position, and one look at the pictures from the marches does definitely show a heavy Caucasian makeup-especially in Cape Town. But this is to miss the point. Until very recently the only whites who would be seen publicly voicing their despair and anger at the current Government would have been either highly political people activists, or right wing fringe characters harping for the return of white rule. What was different about yesterday is that normal, sensible and, until now politically unengaged, young white people were marching through the streets demanding the President go. That this generation of white South Africans feel confident enough in their place in South African society to so clearly and publicly state their views and criticisms is, in itself, a sign of progress in the country. Their parents-the generation that went through the transition from apartheid to democracy- would almost certainly been too afraid to show any signs of not being happy with the new national project for fear of being labelled as racists who are living in the past. The other key group, and one that ultimately has the potential of doing more damage to Zuma, is the educated black middle class. For these young people they see their country being left behind in the global race for progress as a result of a corrupt and incompetent Government, which is now actually costing them money and opportunity. If you look at the democratic toppling of leaders throughout history, they have almost all come about for the same reason. And that is that they have cost the middle class money, or put another way, that the middle class didn’t trust them with their money. In the UK it was not, despite all the fuss, Labour’s foreign policy that cost the party, it was the feeling that middle income families did not trust them with their mortgages, savings and pensions anymore. Conversely the same can actually save an administration. Bill Clinton survived the relentless attempts by his Republican opponents to impeach and defeat him, because of, as he said ‘the economy, stupid’. As long as people’s money was safe, they could look the other way at everything else. Thatcher achieved the same magic trick, until the magic ran out. The same is true in South Africa. Even the great Nelson Mandela, rightly deified in the country, had enough political nous to understand that he couldn’t alienate those who are responsible for bringing money in to the Government’s coffers. Hence the middle of the road economic policies of his time in office. His successor, Thabo Mbeki had the same understanding, although lacked the personal charisma to carry it off to the same extent, and was often criticised for the fact that his Government left too many of the people they were supposed to help, out of the new South African dream. That criticism was not entirely unfair, but it was not what ultimately ended up costing him. Zuma on the other hand, has followed a different path. A more radical and redistributive political and economic plan based, apparently, on redressing past wrongs. Oddly, that would have probably worked better for him in the 90s, when any redistributive policies would have only punished a white minority that was already on the naughty step and in no position to push back. But South Africa in 2015 is very different, and the people who are now being having their pockets hit by his plans are black as well as white. And they don’t like it, not one bit. On their list of priorities, bringing up past injustices is fairly low down, especially when compared to the success of their business and the economic security of their families. President Zuma has underestimated these people. He wagered that they will put up with taking the brunt of his policies and forgive his personal shortcomings, as long as it meant correcting the past. In that wager, South Africa’s political gambler has been beaten by the house. He will survive this week’s events, but one can’t help feel that this is the start of something not the end."
13,Woman exercises her right-to-die and takes her own life surrounded by her family,politics," Brittany Maynard, the American who became the public face of the controversial right-to-die movement over the last few weeks, ended her own life Saturday at her home in Portland, Oregon. She was 29. ""Goodbye to all my dear friends and family that I love. Today is the day I have chosen to pass away with dignity in the face of my terminal illness, this terrible brain cancer that has taken so much from me ... but would have taken so much more,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""The world is a beautiful place, travel has been my greatest teacher, my close friends and folks are the greatest givers. I even have a ring of support around my bed as I type ... Goodbye world. Spread good energy. Pay it forward!"" Doctors told Maynard she had six months to live last spring after she was diagnosed with a likely stage 4 glioblastoma. She made headlines around the world when she announced she intended to die - under Oregon's Death with Dignity Act - by taking a fatal dose of barbiturates, prescribed to her by a doctor, when her suffering became too great.brittany-maynard 2 ""My glioblastoma is going to kill me and that's out of my control,"" she told PEOPLE last month. ""I've discussed with many experts how I would die from it and it's a terrible, terrible way to die. So being able to choose to go with dignity is less terrifying."" On Oct. 6, she launched an online video campaign with Compassion & Choices, an end-of-life choice advocacy organization, to fight for expanding death with dignity laws nationwide. ""For people to argue against this choice for sick people really seems evil to me,"" she told PEOPLE. ""They try to mix it up with suicide and that's really unfair, because there's not a single part of me that wants to die. But I am dying."" A Heartbreaking Choice Arriving at her decision was a gradual one, she said. ""It's not a decision you make one day and you snap your fingers,"" she told PEOPLE. She said she began thinking about death with dignity in January - when she was first diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor - after coming across an article on it while researching possible treatments. ""Really, from the beginning, all the doctors said when you have a glioma you're going to die,"" she told PEOPLE. ""You can just Google it. People don't survive this disease. Not yet."" Doctors removed as much of the tumor as they could, but it came back larger than ever two months later, she said. After researching her options, she decided not to try chemotherapy or radiation. ""They didn't seem to make sense for me,"" she said, because of ""the level of side effects I would suffer and it wouldn't save my life. I've been told pretty much no matter what, I'm going to die - and treatments would extend my life but affect the quality pretty negatively."" In June, she moved to Oregon with her husband, Dan Diaz, 43, her mother, Debbie Ziegler, 56 , and her stepfather, Gary Holmes, 72, so she could have access to the state's Death with Dignity Act, which allows physicians to prescribe life-ending medication to certain terminally ill patients. Maynard originally told PEOPLE she'd chosen Nov. 1 to end her life, but on Thursday she released a new video saying she might not do it that day. ""I still smile and laugh with my family and friends enough that it doesn't seem like the right time now,"" she said in the video recorded Oct. 13 and 14, ""but it will come because I feel myself getting sicker; it's happening each week."" Her Final Months Maynard spent the last months of her life making the most of the time she had left. She traveled to Alaska, British Colombia and Yellowstone National Park with her loved ones and explored more local attractions like Olympic National Park in Washington.brittany-maynard 3 On Oct. 21, she and her family took a helicopter ride to the Grand Canyon, a place she'd been longing to see before she died. ""It was breathtakingly beautiful,"" she said in a statement. The following morning, though, she had her ""worst seizure"" so far, she said: ""The seizure was a harsh reminder that my symptoms continue to worsen as the tumor runs its course."" Maynard said she was deeply touched by the ""outpouring of support"" she got after going public with her diagnosis and her decision. ""I want to thank people for that, for the words of kindness, for the time they've taken in personal ways,"" she told PEOPLE. ""And then beyond that, to encourage people to make a difference,"" she said. ""If they can relate to my story, if they agree with this issue on a philosophical level, to get out there and do what we need to do to make a change in this country."" Maynard also talked to PEOPLE about her legacy. ""For me what matters most is the way I'm remembered by my family and my husband as a good woman who did my best to be a good wife and a good daughter,"" she said. ""Beyond that, getting involved with this campaign, I hope to be making a difference here,"" she said. ""If I'm leaving a legacy, it's to change this health-care policy or be a part of this change of this health care policy so it becomes available to all Americans. That would be an enormous contribution to make, even if I'm just a piece of it."" Before she died, Maynard asked her husband and her mother if they would carry on the work she started to get death with dignity passed in every state. ""I want to work on the cause,"" Ziegler told PEOPLE last month. ""I have so much admiration for people who are terminally ill and just fight and fight. They are so dignified and brave. This is a different choice, but it is also brave and dignified."" She also shared with them her hopes and dreams for their future. Upstairs in the home she shares with her family are neatly wrapped Christmas and birthday gifts for her loved ones for the next year. ""She made it clear she wants me to live a good life,"" Ziegler says. In her second video, Maynard, who is an only child, said she hoped her mother does not ""break down"" or ""suffer from any kind of depression."" And for Diaz, ""I hope he moves on and becomes a father,"" she said. ""There's no part of me that wants him to live out the rest of his life just missing his wife."" Source: People"

Honor and Truth Paul Chehade's biography: Paul Chehade was born in Wilmington, Delaware on October 26, 1965. He is a political truth and righteous seeker, successful business entrepreneur, humanitarian rights activist and ideologist, polyglot, musician, writer; was and has sophisticated his character by a plan of virtues, which he believes in and continues to practice in order to develop his uprightness which it is the foundation for his solid moral. Such moral is based on respect for the human customs and believes, knowledge, religious tendencies (as long as those do not hurt society but do provide love, brotherhood and progress in peace and harmony) regardless of color, race and culture. His character is based on Temperance, Discipline, Silence, Order, Resolution, Frugality, Industry, Sincerity, Justice, Moderation, Cleanliness, Tranquility, Chastity, and Humbleness. Paul Chehade is a believer of the practical and democratic values of prudence, hard work, education, honesty, spiritual development, self-governing institutions and opposes to authoritarianism both political and religious based on scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment. Paul Chehade supported the idea of basic rights and freedoms to which all humans are entitled. Human rights include civil and political rights, such as the right to life and liberty, freedom of expression, and equality before the law; and social, cultural and economic rights, including the right to participate in culture, the right to food, the right to work, and the right to education and health. Paul Chehade is the Chairman of the Board of a diversity group of corporations since 1999, which are dedicated totally to serve the ill-timed humans, regardless of a person's religion, race, ethnicity, or gender, as a demonstration of God's unconditional love for all people, helping communities worldwide.

Based on the principles expressed in the Bible, which Paul Chehade has been raised with; profound values and the riches of his Christian traditions lead him to base his desire to serve the community in neighborly love as preached by Jesus Christ. What is required is to return to the old fashion principles on morality, ethics based on respect to all living creature. Being ethical is not the same as doing ""whatever society accepts."" Being ethical is to follow the rules that respect the human right and integrity. An entire society can become ethically corrupt. Discrimination is a good example of a morally corrupt society. A reform to our values back to basics will provide the standards to a moral and righteous behavior. Education is an avenue. Religious principles of love are also valid. God must prevail in our schools our daily life and our families. The family is the basis of our society and the future of our children therefore of our nation. God Bless America.

15,The United States or Just America,politics," Does the United States actually exist as the country we once knew, or is this nation really just some sort of transitional nation which is or will be called America? The concept of our founding fathers, obviously, was to create a Constitutional Republic where men could pursue their dreams and live a life free from the twisted whims of tyrants. Of course, as we all know, nothing man-made lasts forever and it appears that dream is either dead or dying and at a rapid pace. I believe what we now have, is exactly what the framers fought to rid themselves of, a dictatorship run by petty demagogues in a so-called foreign nation which is now just called America. So just exactly what has transpired to foster this atmosphere, which has festered over time into this seamy dictatorship that would make King George proud? One factor is undoubtedly the misguided belief that the U.S. Constitution is a ‘living Constitution’ which evolves over time. According to David A. Strauss, ""A living Constitution is one that evolves, changes over time, and adapts to new circumstances, without being formally amended."" Mr. Strauss explains some of the pros with regard to a living Constitution such as, ""The cumbersome amendment process, the world has changed in incalculable ways, the nation has grown in territory and population, technology, the international situation, the economy and social mores,"" are all different today. But he also touches on the cons, ""The Constitution is supposed to be a rock-solid foundation, our basic principals-our constitutional principles-must remain constant, and the term…is hardly ever used, except derisively."" So, although time moves on and the nation and the world changes, should the U.S. Constitution change? I believe the Law of the Land is just that and it shouldn’t be surreptitiously altered, by public opinion, a liberal or conservative agenda, or the whims of anyone, especially politicians. I believe a cumbersome amendment process is a good thing; it keeps politicians and judges from forcing their opinions and their laws down our throats just because they are in office or on the bench. However, that rock-solid foundation appears to be more like quick sand than anything else. Obama care is actually a good example of why a living constitution is a bad idea. Whether we need some sort of overhaul regarding our health system or not, is a matter that should be up to the States. Yet, somehow this immediately went to the Supreme Court to decide. In essence, doesn’t that remove State sovereignty? The University of Alabama Law Review states, ""A problem for our time is that we cannot help knowing that our highest courts are not merely enforcing rules…We know too well that they often shape the rules… according to their own preferences to assist one rival interest or another."" (p. 4 of 68) Something tells me if Judges are supposed to be impartial referees, their own preferences should have absolutely nothing to do with enforcing rules. The Alabama Law Review goes on to state, ""Justices sitting on the Supreme Court…have by the terms of their certiorari rule almost completely disowned responsibility for assuring that individuals’ legal rights and duties are actually enforced by lower courts in individual cases. They seldom bother to decide a case unless it has impact on some public interest…It decides only those cases which provide a suitable occasion for expressing policies the Justices choose to express."" (p. 5 of 68) So it would appear that the Supreme Court has, in effect, become an activist for political cause within the U.S. government. How is it possible to be an activist and impartial at the same time? Rather than allowing the States to decide an issue which is inherently an issue for the people of each sovereign State, the Supreme Court has decided that for us all; the Supreme Courts usurpation of the rights of each and every sovereign individual as well as each and every sovereign State is apparent. If the U.S. government wishes to make a nationwide health care system, shouldn’t they actually be required to go through the extremely cumbersome amendment process in order to make that law? As far as I can tell, a national law, such as Obama care, is much like an amendment to the Constitution as it becomes (part of) the Law of the Land. As sovereign individuals, which is a status guaranteed to each of us in the U.S. Constitution through Republicanism, we cannot simply step away from this edict, because the self-serving type of politician which has decreed a national health care system, is the same type of politician which has decreed we are no longer a Republic, but a democracy where we are governed by force. This is the malevolent effect of a living Constitution. Lobbyists and PAC’s are another form of decimation to the U.S. Constitution, which gives the extremely wealthy organizations who can simply pay for votes to achieve their goal. I’m certain Machiavelli would be proud of our politicians, after all, to these types of people, the end justifies the means. However, if you stop to consider the Republic of the United States is not supposed to be a Machiavellian society where the Prince rules over the people with an iron fist, then there must be a problem. What we now have, like it or not, is a nation which is sold to the highest bidder. This comes in the form of the special interest group. Among these advocacy groups you will find according to Dr. Kathi Carlisle, ""The AFL/CIO, Amnesty International USA, the Arab American Institute, the Business-Industry Political Action Committee, Campaign for United Nations Reform (or Citizens for Global Solutions), Communist Party USA, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the Feminist Majority, Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders (GLAD), the John Birch Society, Muslim Public Affairs Council, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the Socialist Party USA"" and many more. In essence, these groups attempt to influence the way which elected officials vote, which basically puts the politician in someone’s pocket. These groups also attempt to steer the country in one direction or another with no legal basis for their actions. Governance paid for by pressure groups is governance by force, not freedom. Another factor which I believe erodes our Constitution and the status of our nation are agreements such as NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement), OAS (Organization of American States) and GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), which is now called the WTO (World Trade Organization), and are all undoubtedly beholden to The World Bank. Organizations such as these can only tend to move jobs and money out of the United States to others around the globe and leave us here, in the United States, in a position of poverty and servitude. We no longer have a manufacturing base of well paying jobs, we are stuck buying substandard products which are intended to break and be thrown on the junk heap as well as further the misguided notion that we are the world’s policemen. All of this has been done at the cost of our bank accounts and our sovereignty. While Americans are and have always been a people who are extremely generous, that generosity needs to come directly through the people as we see fit, not as the government sees fit. Organizations such as these, especially when given the blessings of our so-called leaders, can only chip away at our individual, State and national sovereignty. I believe this is, in part, the New World Order. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, ""Many economists agree that NAFTA has had some positive impact on overall U.S. employment. But most also agree that gains have been accompanied by some painful side effects."" According to Edward Alden, ""Wages haven’t kept pace with labor productivity and that income inequality has risen in recent years."" Opponents of NAFTA such as the Economic Policy Institute state, ""The deal’s trade agenda has served to widen U.S. trade deficits and has indirectly pushed some U.S. workers into lower-paying jobs."" I don’t know about you, but I personally don’t like the idea of ‘painful side effects’ or ‘lower-paying jobs’ for Americans. According to RT Question More, ""The US government’s official unemployment rate, now at 8.3 percent, only takes into consideration those who have no jobs and are looking for work…this is called a ""U-3"" rate…The national U-6 rate is 15.3 percent, but some states have a shockingly higher individual rate."" Somehow, I just cannot fathom how these so-called economic blocs are good for either U.S. workers or our economy. But with such a high unemployment rate, the U.S. government still thinks we should allow others to come and take our jobs away from us. I defy anyone to prove to me that politicians in the U.S. aren’t crooks. In a report by Erika Lovley on 6 November 2009, ""Two-hundred-and-thirty-seven members of Congress are millionaires. That’s 44 percent of the body – compared to about 1 percent of Americans overall."" Keep in mind that was nearly 3 years ago, so the figure is undoubtedly higher today. Yet these individuals believe they know what is best for the people of the United States. I believe other factors which further this agenda are a perverted immigration policy, the Department of Homeland Security, FEMA and even TSA. If we look at our immigration policy, the word amnesty is used far too often. The Washington Post reports, ""Under the new policy, as many as 1.4 million undocumented immigrants under age 30 will be able to apply for the amnesty."" It appears the Federal government doesn’t have a problem with the 1.4 million ‘undocumented immigrants,’ which is a really a euphemism for people who broke U.S. law by entering the United States illegally, and their families. If 1.4 million are eligible, how many others are there who are also here breaking our laws? Apparently, the Department of Homeland Security (the name itself smacks of Soviet style language) doesn’t see this as a threat to our sovereignty. But I have to wonder why? Isn’t it their duty to protect the ‘Homeland’ against invasion? If it isn’t, then why have they ordered 450 million rounds of ammunition from ATK? If it isn’t to keep illegal invasion from happening, perhaps it’s for some other diabolical reason. We already know all too well what FEMA’s position is with regard to Americans. During Hurricane Katrina, they stood by and did nothing while Americans died and lived in squalor in New Orleans and many still do. In a PBS NEWSHOUR report, Senator Lieberman stated, ""But government failures…allowed much more human suffering and property destruction to occur than should have."" Louisiana Governor Blanco’s press secretary stated, ""We wanted helicopters, food and water. They wanted to negotiate an organizational chart."" How pathetic is that? It wouldn’t surprise me one bit if FEMA, which was incorporated into the Department of Homeland Security in 2003, was in league with the rest of the Federal government in an attempt to assist in the formation of a new North American Union, made up of Canada, the US and Mexico, after all, they are doing quite a good job of turning the United States into a Third World Nation. In a report by Jerome Corsi on 19 May 2006 he stated, ""Secretly, the Bush administration is pursuing a policy to expand NAFTA politically, setting the stage for a North American Union designed to encompass the U.S., Canada, and Mexico."" The report goes on to state, ""President Bush intends to abrogate U.S. sovereignty to the North American Union."" The report concludes, ""His secret agenda is to dissolve the United States of America into the North American Union. The administration has no intent to secure the border, or to enforce rigorously existing immigration laws. Securing our border with Mexico is evidently one of the jobs President Bush just won’t do."" As previously stated, it appears President Obama is on board with this same idea. He also refuses to secure the border with Mexico, he refuses to enforce existing immigration laws, and neither the Bush nor the Obama administrations are friends of the sovereignty of United States of America. Quite frankly, I believe this goes back even further. Something tells me George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barak Hussein Obama are all cut from the exact same piece of cloth. Plots such as these do not hatch themselves overnight, but take decades to form and implement. Could this lead to a complete loss of our rights guaranteed to us under the U.S. Constitution? Would the U.S. Constitution even exist under such a system? While it isn’t much of a secret that the United States has been bankrupt by our leaders; our outstanding public debt as of 7 August 2012, according to Ed Hall of brillig.com is, ""$15,918,879,613,227.57."" Would such a ploy by the Federal government con-artists of this former Republic be for such a simple reason as to gain new taxpayers? I can’t believe it would really matter. Without the United States or the U.S. Constitution, we would be nothing more than slaves to our usurpers, who already are nothing more than puppets of their masters, the so-called ‘illuminated ones.’ So just exactly where would the central power then be located? I have no doubt the central power would temporarily be somewhere in North America. I can’t help but imagine some sort of Triune would be set-up. After all, the United States has already proven their affection for Trinities; Nimrod-Semiramis-Tammuz is a good example of that. But undoubtedly, the central power would eventually be shifted, or should I say freely given to the Vatican. All of this is simply a precursor to a One World Government; a New World Order which has been envisioned by certain extremely wealthy families for thousands of years. Before you laugh too hard, perhaps you should take a moment and think about the ramifications of such an idea. Ask yourselves if the Constitution and your rights have been slowly eroded by the U.S. government, extremely wealthy multi-national corporations and banks. It’s funny how they seem to get bailed-out by us, but we get shafted by them. And by them I do mean the government, corporations and the banks. Please prove me wrong. Tell me, are the secrets which are enthusiastically and fastidiously guarded by our so-called leaders for the protection of the nation, which means the people of the United States, or are they kept for the protection of the ruling elite? I submit that these secrets are maintained because the people would most likely revolt if they knew the truth. These deceivers know they can continue to spoon-feed us lies and they know we will accept the continuation of those lies because they are easier to swallow that the truth. Don’t be fooled by the families of those who have prepared for countless millennia for their ‘thousand points of light.’ It’s not the light which they seek, although they call themselves ‘the illuminated ones,’ they seek darkness; war, famine, disease, slavery and death, all in the unholy name of their master who yearns for our wanton obedience to feed his desire for the power to control and destroy. Be assured, these people and their master, seek to enthrall others by any means available, but they prefer to receive this through our free-will. Treachery and deception are a small part of the arsenal from which their cabal ensnares others into taking their mark freely by thoughts and beliefs as well as acts and deeds. Now is the time to wake up! Arise and throw off the chains of mental, physical and spiritual slavery which unknowingly have been fastened around our throats with the sole intent of dragging us down into the depths of the abyss where they reside. It’s never too late to come to our senses and do what’s right and save ourselves and our Republic, the United States of America. God Bless this Great Republic, the United States of America. Brett L.

16,On Sovereignty,politics," We, the people are the rightful masters of both Congress and the courts, not to overthrow the Constitution, but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution. Abraham Lincoln Are we in the United States sovereign individuals? I believe we are according to the U.S. Constitution. The purpose of this treatise is to investigate and expose the principals of not only what it means to be sovereign, but of sovereignty in general and whether the U.S. Constitution actually guarantees the individual sovereign status. This discourse will touch on the differences between republicanism, democracy and the actual make-up of the United States with regard to the U.S. Constitution as well as the beliefs of our founding fathers. What is sovereignty? Black’s Law Dictionary 2nd Ed. defines sovereignty, ""The possession of sovereign power; supreme political authority; paramount control of the constitution and frame of government and its administration; the self-sufficient source of political power, from which all specific political powers are derived."" By definition, sovereignty gives the ownership of power; ultimate political power to determine; preeminent direction over the make-up and structure of not only the government, but the administration of the government as well; the provision for one to supply for his own needs, sans external assistance; and the source of our ability to act with regard to politics. According to 1215.org Lawnotes, ""A republic and a democracy are identical in every aspect except one. In a republic the sovereignty is in each individual person. In a democracy the sovereignty is in the group."" This may seem like a very small distinction, but the difference is great. The individual’s sovereign status cannot be taken by the majority in a republic, with the exception in the U.S. being ""100% of a jury convicts, then the individual loses sovereignty and is subject to group-think as in a democracy."" But, in a democracy, ""The minority only has those privileges granted by the dictatorship of the majority."" A republic is, ""That form of government in which the powers of sovereignty are vested in the people and exercised by the people, either directly, or through representatives chosen by the people, to whom those powers are specially delegated."" A Democracy is, ""That form of government in which the sovereign power resides in and is exercised by the whole body of free citizens directly or indirectly through a system of representation, as distinguished from a monarchy, aristocracy, or oligarchy."" So, ""In a republic the group only has advisory powers; the sovereign individual is free to reject the majority group-think."" Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution states, ""The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government."" Article VI, Clause 2 states, ""This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof…under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land."" As unequivocally stated in the U.S. Constitution, the sovereign power which is vested in the people through Republicanism is guaranteed by the supreme Law of the Land, the Constitution of the United States. There can be no doubt, our forefathers, believed in the sovereign individual or the U.S. Constitution would clearly state, we the people of the United States are a democracy. Yet nowhere within the U.S. Constitution is the word democracy even mentioned. The Constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people; it is an instrument for the people to restrain government. Patrick Henry Are our Constitution and our sovereignty inviolate? I would argue, by Law, i.e., the U.S. Constitution, and by definition, our possession of sovereign power; the answer is undeniably yes, both are inviolate. But if you look not only at our modern day society, but to some of the founding fathers themselves, it is obvious there is a debate on this issue. Modern day discussions involve such matters as the 2nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court has ""Ruled the 2nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution confers an individual right to possess a firearm for traditionally lawful purposes such as self-defense,"" in District of Columbia v. Heller. In United States v. Cruikshank, the courts view was the 2nd Amendment ""Has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government."" Of course, one case (D.C. v. Heller) wasn’t for a criminal enterprise, while the other (U.S. v. Cruikshank) was. Yet what is interesting is the wording, ""Has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government."" But in the case United States v. Miller, Mr. Miller and another person ""Were indicted for transporting an unregistered sawed-off shotgun across state lines in violation of the National Firearms Act of 1934."" Mr. Miller’s argument was, ""That the section of the National Firearms Act regulating the interstate transport of certain firearms violated the Second Amendment."" The U.S. District Court agreed with Mr. Miller, but the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision. The reasoning was, ""The absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a [sawed-off] shotgun…has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument."" Obviously, one has the tendency to believe none of the Supreme Court justices at the time, had ever been in the military. I can only believe with regard to Mr. Miller’s case, as well as present day politics, We the People may as well refer to the Supreme Court as Nine Empty Chairs. Unlike the U.S. government’s belief in dictatorship, whether it’s Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Federal, State or Local, I personally believe, as I believe many of the founding fathers of this nation believed, the government needs to be restrained by the people for good reason; they cannot be trusted. Let’s take 12 of the founding fathers of the nation - 6 truly believed in a Republican form of government; Madison, Jefferson, Franklin, Mason, Wilson and Randolph, but 6 truly believed in a Federalist form of government; Washington, Adams, Hamilton, Morris, Sherman and Jay. Which 6 were correct and which 6 weren’t? All 12 men believed in the U.S. Constitution, the Federalists simply believed in a stronger national government while the others believed in more of a Republican form of government where the individual and not the government maintained the most power. Yet to the British, they were all traitors, and none of the founding fathers of this nation believed in an overreaching government or wanted one. The men who fought for Independence risked their lives, families, wealth, property and their positions for Liberty and Freedom. Now we have just the opposite. We live in a country which is governed by force, the people are fed lies, the economy is a joke, our foreign policy is that of murder and our so-called elected officials are what appear to be Satanists who thrive on killing in order to satiate their thirst for blood. Whenever governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order to raise an army upon their ruins. Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts Just exactly what the etymology of sovereign or sovereignty is, is also a matter of debate, which I will not go into. I have no doubt the Supreme Court or any other court in this nation would argue I know nothing, but what I do know for a fact, is the men who wrote the U.S. Constitution, ordained, established and ratified it, for the people. But the Hussein Obama administration and the rest of our self-centered narcissistic leaders have apparently once again proved their love for Liberty, Freedom and the People of the United States by awarding ATK a contract to supply 450,000,000 rounds of hollow point ammunition to the Department of Homeland Security! By all appearances, the U.S. government doesn’t believe in the sovereign individual. James Madison wrote in the Federalist papers No. 37, ""Among the difficulties encountered by the convention, a very important one must have lain in combining the requisite stability and energy in government, with the inviolable attention due to liberty and to the republican form."" In Federalist No. 39, Madison posed the question and gave the answer, ""Whether the general form and aspect of the government be strictly republican. It is evident that no other form would be reconcilable with the genius of the people of America; with the fundamental principles of the Revolution; or with that honorable determination which animates every votary of freedom, to rest all our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for self-government."" The individual citizen is guaranteed a Republican form of government by the U.S. Constitution, so why does the individual who is guaranteed sovereign status by the Law of the Land, the U.S. Constitution, have to seek remedy before the court with regard to his sovereign status? Has the Judicial branch of government violated the very Law which they have taken an Oath to defend, protect and preserve; the U.S. Constitution? The obvious answer is yes, but the Supreme Court with their life-time appointments have, in effect, furtively elevated themselves to what they consider to be the level of Godhead. It is not only his right, but his duty…to find the verdict according to his own best understanding, judgment and conscience, though in direct opposition to the direction of the court. John Adams Has the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution been misconstrued and ill applied by the courts? The true purpose of the 14th Amendment was to ensure a Constitutionally guaranteed right was not abridged, such as States enacting ‘Jim Crow Laws’ which were portrayed as ‘separate but equal’ but were in effect, ‘separate and extremely unequal’ in order to circumvent the 13th Amendment. But isn’t the 14th Amendment which should be viewed as ‘basic fundamental fairness’ viewed as ‘Federal supersedes State instead?’ Federal should only supersede State when the Constitutionally guaranteed right of the sovereign individual has been violated by the State or for example, if by some strange reason the State of North Dakota decided to invade South Dakota or either of the Provinces of Saskatchewan or Manitoba. The Federal role in this is merely to assure the State cannot violate the individual or the U.S. Constitution, the Federal government has no authority to decide how the individual exercises freedom, nor does the State, unless the individual has committed crimes. If you consider the fact that in a Republic it is the guarantee given in the U.S. Constitution, that the individual is sovereign and the State is sovereign, the Federal government cannot take away that guarantee; the tail cannot wag the dog, as the Federal government is nothing more than the tail and We the People, which make up the States, are the dog itself. The hierarchies within the United States are the sovereign individuals, which make the sovereign States, which in turn make up the sovereign Nation. The power and responsibility within a Republic is vested in the People, not the government; who serve only at our pleasure. Picture if you will, a pyramid. The triangular point at the top is the Federal government’s three branches, the middle portion would be the States and the bottom portion would be the People. In a democracy, this would be an accurate depiction of the power structure. But in a Republic, where the People are guaranteed a Republican form of government, where the individuals are sovereign and the States are sovereign, the pyramid must be inverted. The portion or base which is now at the top is the People, the middle portion is the States and the bottom triangular portion is the Federal government. Everything flows down to the State and to the Federal levels through the People. And as the People are the power of the United States, it is our duty to ensure the government, whether State or Federal, are defending, protecting, preserving and furthering the U.S. Constitution which is the Law of the Land or they need to be removed and held accountable for their actions. But the usurpers of the Republic of the United States are the government officials at every level. They have done nothing more than attempt to destroy our Law, the U.S. Constitution, and this has been done in many ways. The manipulation of our monetary policy; a weak dollar, low interest rates, excessive debt, unchecked spending, the surreptitious voiding of the gold standard and the creation of a worthless fiat currency, as well as voodoo economics where the belief that wealth trickles down to the people, when the wealth actually trickles down to the State and Federal governments from the people. The destruction to our Law has also occurred through a very destructive and misguided foreign policy agenda which clearly debilitates our nation’s stature as well as our wealth, and has an appearance not based on anything which has any semblance of peaceful diplomacy. The national policy of the United States is one which appears to be, and is in effect, governance by force. So, are we in the United States sovereign individuals? I believe we are supposed to be, according to the founding fathers of this nation, but in reality, we are slaves to the Federal and State governments. Are we a sovereign nation? Once again, I believe we are supposed to be, according to the founding fathers, but in reality, our so-called leaders are really nothing more than puppets of the Illuminati; the destroyers of men and nations and the proponents of a one-world government or New World Order, where no man is Free and Liberty is non-existent. We must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our selection between economy and liberty or profusion and servitude. If we run into such debts as that we must be taxed in our meat, in our drink, in our necessities and comforts, in our labors and in our amusements, for our callings and our creeds...our people…must come to labor sixteen hours in the twenty-four, give earnings of fifteen of these to the government for their debts and daily expenses; and the sixteenth being insufficient to afford us bread, we must live… We have not time to think, no means of calling the mis-managers to account, but be glad to obtain subsistence by hiring ourselves to rivet their chains on the necks of our fellow sufferers.  Our landholders, too...retaining indeed the title and stewardship of estates called theirs, but held really in trust for the treasury, must...be contented with penury, obscurity and exile…private fortunes are destroyed by public as well as by private extravagance. This is the tendency of all human governments. A departure from principle becomes a precedent for a second; that second for a third; and so on, till the bulk of society is reduced to mere automatons of misery, to have no sensibilities left but for sinning and suffering... And the fore horse of this frightful team is public debt. Taxation follows that, and in its train wretchedness and oppression. Thomas Jefferson God Bless the United States of America. Completed on this 25th day of July in the year of our Lord 2012. Brett L. Baker"
17,The United States and the U.S. Constitution,politics," The Constitution of the United States is much more than just a piece of paper; it is a document written by God fearing men who believed in Liberty and Justice for all who are citizens of this great nation and their Posterity. While the U.S. Constitution is a guide for ourselves and for those who represent us, the U.S. Constitution is much more; it is the ""law of the land"" and should be viewed as such, as well as considered whenever any of the three branches of government, i.e., Legislative, Executive, or Judicial, enact new laws or perform the duties of their respective offices. I also believe every Citizen of the United States should question themselves with regard to their actions; are we Just, are we promoting the general Welfare, are we striving to ensure Liberty, are our actions helping to form a more perfect Union? These ideals cannot simply be for one, they must be for all, as eloquently stated by our fore-fathers, ""We the People of the United States."" On the 17th day of September in 1787 the U.S. Constitution was Ordained and Established; the U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1788. This document gave us reasonable guidelines by which to govern ourselves in a responsible and civil manner and the delineation of the processes by which we elect government officials, the formation and function of the three separate branches of government and the duties of each within the boundaries of the Constitution of the United States. Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution also guarantees to each and every State in the Union a ""Republican Form of Government,"" whereby the individuals as well as the States themselves are sovereign. Enough cannot be said about the value and intent of the words within the U.S. Constitution itself. Article II, Section 1, Clause 8 clearly states the President shall, ""Preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."" Article VI, Clause 2 clearly states, ""This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States; shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding."" Article VI, Clause 3 goes on to further state, ""The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution."" Undeniably, the framers of the Constitution of the United States demanded the continued preservation, protection, defense and support of the Constitution in perpetuity for the People of this great nation. There can be no doubt the Constitution of the United States is the Law of the Land. Our leaders are bound by the oaths of their offices to uphold the Constitution of the United States. The U.S. Constitution is a means to promote not only the general Welfare, but to promote an equitable system of governance, through just laws which provide the framework to form a more perfect Union. As stated in Article III, Section 2, Clause 1, ""The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority."" The U.S. Constitution is the conception of an ideal by decent, free thinking men, whose sole purpose was to live a life free of tyranny from those who would oppress us, and to ensure those same ideals existed for their Posterity. The United States of America is, in effect, not only a conglomeration of people, but of ideas as well. Through the supreme Law of the Land, the U.S. Constitution, sovereign citizens of sovereign States, within a sovereign nation act to establish a just and equitable society, where Liberty is unfettered and the government exists to serve the People. While the art of articulation does not elude me, I find myself unable to match what I consider to be a perfect man-made statement of Truth and Wisdom: We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and to our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. God Bless this Great Republic, the United States of America Brett L. Baker"
18,The UK's Compensation Culture Explained,politics," The so called ‘compensation culture’ of the United Kingdom has been one of the media's favourite topics for sensationalist journalism for the past few years. However, much of it is precisely that. The media has made a point out of creating scapegoats and generally generating a great deal of hype surrounding the compensation culture phenomenon. It's true that car accident claims and whiplash injury compensation claims are clearly on the rise but let's take a look at what is really going on from the view of an insider for an explanation to how the car insurance premiums got so out of control. The phrase compensation culture started getting bandied around in the late 1990s when the introduction of Conditional Fee Arrangements was seen in the UK legal system. This type of legal arrangement is also referred to as the ‘no win no fee’ claim. Because claims brokering companies were able to refer claimants to solicitors and other legal professionals for a referral fee, it wasn't long before people involved in car accidents and other types of personal injury case were being encouraged to start compensation claims. With the increase in the number of claims, it was only a matter of time before a few highly frivolous cases made their way through the courts. This was fuelled by the notoriously elusive nature of whiplash injury diagnosis. Once the media had picked up on a couple of such claims, it wasn't long before they were splashed all over the headlines. Once Great Britain entered into an economic downturn, people had a lot less spare money going round and somebody crashed into while driving, they were all too aware of an easy four to five-figure sum of money which could be made. The brokers, which are also known as claims management companies, are regulated by very strict series of rules in order to stop them from encouraging people to start car accident claims or to contact them using unsolicited means to encourage them to take legal action. However, as word got around that these regulations could be broken without authorities such as the Information Commissioners Office taking legal action, it wasn't long before many companies started trading illegally and cold-calling people to make claims. It was basically a combination of the economic downturn, the elusive nature of whiplash injuries and a lot of media hype which added to the mix which caused the UK's compensation culture to spiral out of control. In spite of what any sensationalist media stories may say, this is the crux of what happened. There is no one party to blame and it’s the result of a series of badly timed circumstances. With pending changes to personal injury law due to be put in place by the UK government in April, it looks like some positive changes towards stopping the compensation culture may soon be seen. However, even with these changes, there are no guarantees that this will be the end of the story. Until then, citizens of the United Kingdom will have to wait with baited breath to see if their car insurance premiums go back down to the previously acceptable levels."
19,"Some Myths about Federal Health Care Reform or ""Obamacare.""",politics," When the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA, aka ACA) became federal law in March of 2010, there were many assumptions about what the law would and would not do. As everyone knows, it has become known simply as ""Obamacare,"" because President Obama was the one who wanted health care reform. Here are some misconceptions about health care reform. One of the first statements made was that the new law was tantamount to ""a government takeover of healthcare."" For this to be true, the government would need to inform every citizen that they were being enrolled in a federal healthcare program, sort of like Medicare, which is a federal health care program for any qualifying citizen or permanent resident over the age of 65. In fact, there is no federal alternative to private health insurance today. Since most if not all health insurance companies that were doing business in 2010 are still insuring millions of policyholders today, it is safe to say that there has not been a government takeover of healthcare.  It is also true however, that many people would like to see that happen. They would love to see Medicare expanded to include everyone; but that is very unlikely for many years to come, if ever. ""Medicare benefits will be reduced."" Actually the opposite has happened. Medicare now covers annual physical exams and colonoscopies in addition to the quite comprehensive benefits they have long provided. It is true that premium costs to Medicare beneficiaries will go up in future years, but medical costs and premiums have been rising steadily for decades, and seniors do use more medical services than people under 65. There will be government ""death panels"" that will make end-of-life decisions for people on Medicare. This idea was borne out of a well-intended provision in the health care bill that would have helped pay for the end-of-life planning discussion cost that the elderly already have with their physicians and caregivers. So a good thing became a bad thing. Now there can be no provisions in Medicare for this benefit which, ironically, hurts seniors and can actually adds to the cost of health care.  Illegal immigrants will now be covered. The ACA specifically prohibits undocumented immigrants from receiving coverage. What is not known is the true long-term cost of this legislation. There are many people on both sides of the argument, time will tell what the real cost will be, and there are many components of this program still to be implemented. The truth about health care is that it is expensive no matter where you are.  Canada, England, France, Switzerland, Italy, China. All of these countries have some form of government provided health care and while it is less expensive per-capita than in the United States, it is expensive nonetheless. The common element of all health care programs is that every citizen or legal permanent resident is covered. The cost of care per person is far lower when everyone is covered. What needs to be understood about health care is that every person at some point will seek it out when they need it. Whether or not they have health insurance is not a factor when there is a need for treatment. If a person cannot afford car insurance they have the option of not driving, and few people drive without car insurance. Not so with health insurance, and the situation is made worse by the fact that uninsured people often ignore minor medical issues because of the cost. Unfortunately those minor medical issues have a way of becoming serious, and that is when the uninsured seek care. And where do they go to get treatment then? The emergency room, which happens to be the most expensive entry point into the entire health care system in the U.S. They go there because federal law prohibits hospitals from turning away anyone during a medical emergency. This is a huge factor in the cost of health insurance, and a major reason why health insurance premiums have risen far in excess of the CPI over the past 30 years. Until that part of the health insurance equation is resolved the cost of insurance will continue to be out of reach for millions of Americans. In summary, the cost of delivering health care in the U.S. is not going to go away as an issue. The debate over the number of uninsured and whether or not they should be covered, public vs. private insurance, and who pays for all of this will go on until our politicians realize that there is no one best solution.  All sides will have to agree that there will always be some elements of a common health care system that not everyone will like.  There are many elements of the Affordable Care Act which work, and those elements need to be preserved.  Many insurers who initially opposed the Act have since re-tooled their benefit and pricing models to reflect the major objectives of the program.  The irony here is that abolishing the ACA would actually increase the cost of coverage as insurers once again had to redesign their policies and coverage.  What is needed most of all is a system that works reasonably well and covers everyone or nearly everyone.  In the long run, the cost of excluding millions of uninsured will cost more than covering them."
20,Spanish King Juan Carlos the first  visits Brazil,politics," In recent months Spain and Brazil have experienced a number of problems affecting their relationship. Strong efforts have been made to try and resolve these difficulties, culminating in the recent visit to Brazil of the Spanish King, Juan Carlos 1. The main purpose of his visit (at least the main one declared and admitted) is to boost two-way economic links between the countries. This has clear implications of course for the billions of that constantly ebb and flow in both long-term and short term investments and commerce (and its potential for growth or shrinkage) between the two Atlantic countries. After all, last year alone mutual trade between Spain and Brazil was the equivalent of over eight billion US dollars. However, and despite this, one of the main areas of dissension between them is the thorny issue of immigration. Both feel this has now got to be treated with the urgency that they feel it merits. Unsurprisingly, given the circumstances, the starting point for last week’s tasks was a declaration of mutual respect by the Spanish and the Brazilians. In addition, the discussion between Juan Carlos and the Brazilian President, Dilma Rousseff had a particularly cordial and constructive tone. This was evident when the two Heads of State conferred about the spate of unfortunate mutual deportations of each other’s citizens that have so soured the recent relations between both nations. After he arrived last week, the Spanish King and his staff also met with Antonio Patriota, the Brazilian Minister of External Relations, as well as Dilma herself. Among the Spanish delegation were also a number of leading business executives. These included those from Santander (the Eurozone’s largest bank) and communications giant Telefonica (which already operates in Brazil under the name Vivo). Also present were representatives from Iberia, the Spanish Airline. All these (and others) are clearly seeking to expand their own financial and commercial interests. Underpinning all this however, this recent set of discussions also focused on concerns about Spain’s current economic woes and the steps involving the EU to try and fix them. Brazil is seeking assurances that the 'right' actions will be taken by all concerned. A side issue is the increasing influx of Spanish workers coming to Brazil in the past months. In the last full year, for example, The Brazilian Ministry of Employment declared that the total of work visas issued to Spaniards went up by over thirty percent compared to the previous year. In contrast, there have been a number of high-profile cases of Brazilians being refused entry or work permission when they sought these from Spain. In most instances, the reasons given hinged on the declined applicants not having the right paperwork. This is suspected by some of possibly being more of an excuse than a reason. Despite these admittedly serious upsets, the economic relationship between the two countries demands that solutions be found. Following these meetings between the two trading partners, both the Spanish and the Brazilians expressed optimism. Subsequent announcements by both the King and the President looked forward to an even better relationship in future."

1,Who are the Globalists and what is a Globalist,politics," The Globalist agenda is real and the Globalists themselves are the greatest threat to human civilization. Every day, more and more people are affected in some way, shape or form because of the Globalists and the Globalist agenda. In consideration of the entire Globalist plan, the Globalistideology and other Globalist propaganda, I think it's time to redefine what a Globalist is. The most popular definition of what is a Globalist and who are the Globalists so far is ""the Globalist movement is an alliance based on self-interests of the private international financiers and the royal, dynastic and hereditary land owning families of Britain, Europe and America which over the years have intermarried to create a self regenerating power structure that through lies and deception seeks to control everything and everyone"". Although this definition of who and what is s Globalist is true, I think the definition doesn't go far enough to explain why the Globalists intend to bring forth the new world order, why the Globalists exist and where the Globalists intend the global community to be in 50, 100 and 200 years. It's also an appropriate time to evaluate the standard definition of who are the Globalists as the Globalists have now encroached in almost every country of the world. Up until 30 years ago, the Globalists only had an interest and presence in western countries and a limited number of African and Asian countries. A New Definition of Who Are The Globalists and What Is A Globalist. After much consideration and thought, I would like to propose to the activist, free thinking, and anti-Globalist movements that we define the Globalists as: The Globalists are a conglomerate of individuals, interest groups and large corporations who actively seek to eliminate all countries to create a global border-less society so that they can centralize, reduce and standardize all economies, production and the processing of natural resources so that they can directly control, manipulate and influence the decisions we make to ensure they maintain their power, control, wealth and historical influence. This new definition of who are the Globalists takes a broader view of why they exist and why and for what purpose do they seek to implement their Globalist agenda."
2,Derrick Bell:  His Literary Legacy,politics," Civil Rights Attorney And Law Professor Rediscovered In March 2012, five months after he passed away, Derrick Bell became the target of conservative media, in particular Breitbart.com and Sean Hannity, in an slap against President Barack Obama.  After the footage of a young Barack Obama hugging Professor Bell at a Harvard Law School student demonstration was shown on all the television news shows, the ""scandal"" waned as not much of a news story.  Paradoxically, this lame slap against Barack obama has given us a chance to learn more about the late civil rights activist, legal academic and respected author Derrick Bell. Critical Race Theory The majority of people who heard the reports of Derrick Bell's death probably had little acquaintance with his idealistic career as a lawyer and law professor or his importance as one of the architects of critical race theory. The Critical Race Theory (CRT) is a field of study focused upon the application of critical theory, a neo-Marxist examination and review of culture and society, to the intersection of race, power, and law.  According to CRT racism is inherent in the system and fabric of the American society. Bell continued writing about Critical Race Theory after accepting a teaching position at Harvard University in 1969.  Writing in a narrative mode, Bell contributed to the intellectual discussions on race.  According to Bell, his intention in writing was to analyze the racial issues within the context of their political, social, and economic dimensions from a legal standpoint. Embracing the Narrative Much of Professor Bell’s scholarship discarded dry legal analysis in favor of stories.  In books and law review articles, he presented parables and allegories about race relations, then argued their meaning with a fictional alter ego, a professor named Geneva Crenshaw, who compelled him to address the truth about racial bias in America. Scholarship Bell is probably the most significant source of thought critical of traditional civil rights discourse.  He used three major arguments in his analyses of racial patterns in American law:  constitutional contradiction, the interest convergence principle, and the price of racial remedies.  His book Race, Racism and American Law, now in its sixth edition, has been continually in print since 1973 and is regarded as a classic in the field. Noteworthy Writings of Derrick Bell Race, Racism and American Law Published in 1973 by Little Brown: This is Bell’s milestone work in the study of race, racism and civil rights law in the United States.  This was the first judicial decisions book devoted to race and racism in relation to the American law.  It has been part of law school curricula for almost four decades and is currently in its sixth edition. And We Are Not Saved:  The Elusive Quest for Racial Justice Published in 1987 by Basic Books: Bell initially wrote And We Are Not Saved as a foreword to a 1985 publication of the Harvard Law Review on the Supreme Court.  In this expanded adaptation, professor Bell stated that although racial equality has been legally confirmed, economic equality after initial gains is retrogressing despite affirmative action.  He recommended the formation of a alliance of disadvantaged blacks and whites, urging that entitlement standards include class as well as racial disadvantage. Faces At The Bottom Of The Well:  The Permanence Of Racism Published in 1992 by Basic Books: This group of essays discussed the problem of racism in America and the class differences involved in discrimination against minorities.  In this book, Bell discussed the civil rights movement in American society, and determined that racism is everlasting, and will forever be part of society. Confronting Authority:  Reflections of an Ardent Protester Published in 1996 by Beacon Press: Derrick Bell wrote this book three years after sacrificing his tenure at Havard Law School.  Bell provided a detailed account of the events that led him to give up his position as a Harvard Law School professor to protest the school's never having granted tenure to a minority woman. Gospel Choirs:  Psalms of Survival in an Alien Land Called Home Published in 1997 by Basic Books: Gospel Choirs is the third in a series of essays and parables by Derrick Bell that shed light on probably the most perplexing challenges of our day--racism.  Bell merged dialogues and dreams through his own voice and that of the fictional civil rights lawyer of the 1960s, Geneva Crenshaw,.  Not to mention, it's not just racism that Bell pondered.  Some of the writings challenge African-Americans' attitudes toward sexuality and sexism. Ethical Ambition:  Living a Life of Meaning and Worth Published in 2002 by Bloomsbury USA: In Ethical Ambition, Bell produced good insight into an individual's quest to live by the highest of personal ideals and standards.  Bell analyzed his struggle to meet what he termed an ethical standard.  He confessed that an obsession with ambition, even in an altruistic sense, may violate the ethical obligations owed to family.  He considered the conflicts of issues in his own religious traditions that he negotiated to reach a higher spiritual awareness frequently lost in traditional religions.  Bell also cited cases of well known ethically principled individuals--W. E. B. DuBois and Martin L. King Jr., among others--who often strove for higher ethical standards, single-handedly and at great personal cost. Silent Covenants:  Brown v. Board of Education and the Unfulfilled Hopes for Racial Reform Published in 2005 by Oxford University Press: In Silent Covenants, Bell critiqued the function and constraint of the landmark Brown decision.  He asserted that he, like many of his colleagues, confused the means of integration with the objectives of superb education and racial equality.  To analyze racial reforms, he created a theory of converging interests into one of racial fortuity.  In other words, when the interests of African-Americans converge with the interests of whites, African-Americans are more likely to have their needs addressed; otherwise they are not.  Bell admonished blacks to not abandon their real interests even when they do not converge with the majority, and certainly prime among those interests is the educational advancement of black children. Conclusion Whether you see Derrick Bell as a raving racist or a distinguished intellectual, introducing his books to your non-fiction bookshelf would be a sensible step.  In 1971 Derrick Bell became the first black tenured professor in the history of Harvard Law School.  That marked a significant critical point in his life.  Two years later he wrote his seminal opus, Race, Racism and American Law, thus starting his career as one of America’s most important theorists."
3,Is the federal government well prepared to set up insurance exchanges?,politics," It is common knowledge that many U.S. states are unwilling to launch their health insurance exchanges until the Supreme Court gives its final ruling on the constitutionality of Affordable Care Act of 2010 and its individual mandate clause.  If the states are unable to submit viable health exchange plans by January 1, 2013, the federal government will step in to establish their own exchanges in the defaulting states. With increasing number of states backing out of HIX establishment plans the pressure, of setting up federal exchanges in these states, is growing on the federal government. The common questions doing the rounds in the U.S. healthcare industry is that – is the federal government well prepared to establish their own exchanges by the designated HIX deadline of January 2014? The federal exchanges will operate similar to the proposed state health insurance exchange models – a one-stop, web based platform where individuals and small businesses would be able to compare health plans from different vendors based on different parameters such as quality of medical service, price and coverage options. The exchanges will also provide consumers with the facilities of checking eligibility online for Medicaid, small business tax credits, federal subsidies etc. The exchanges – established by state or federal government - will need to maintain a large pool of consumer specific income, residency, and financial status and employment data. It would be hard to evaluate the preparation and readiness status of federal government in setting up fully functional insurance exchanges by 2014, as there is not much data available on them to make a rough estimate. Setting up insurance exchanges will require a lot of deliberation on the structural, technological, administrative, data security and financial aspects and the task may prove equally daunting for federal government as it is for the state governments. While most of the U.S. states have taken Level 1 health insurance exchange establishment grants from the national government, some states such as Florida, Louisiana and Alaska have openly declared that they would not be setting up their own exchanges. Other states, who even though have applied for Level 2 establishment grants, may still not be able to meet the January 2014 deadline. For all such states, the federal government will have to step in and launch their own exchange websites if the status quo remains the same over the next year. Apart from setting up HIPPA and other security standards compliant online exchange, the national exchanges will need to be interlinked with other exchanges operating around the U.S., to maintain the integrity of data and establish connectivity. The consumer data for all Americans will need to be collated, maintained and regularly updated to ensure accuracy in any analysis. The federal government is facing formidable challenges as far as setting up fully functional health insurance exchanges are concerned. Although there is not much data available on the federal exchanges progress as of now, one can only surmise that when the deadline approaches, the federal government will be able to deliver on their promise of fully operative insurance exchanges."
4,Next president election 2012,politics," Ron Paul's administrative center has showed experiences that the Texas Congressman is about to run for the next president election 2012. Paul unites opposition to the warfare and the police state at home across all the political spectrum and against this to the current gaggle of criminals running the White House, represents the whole thing that America actually stands for. A gargantuan effort in reinforce of Ron Paul must be mobilized now to prevent Americans from being hoodwinked as soon as once more into electing a special puppet of the similar darkish establishment in 2012. Paul first ran for President because the Libertarian candidate in 1988, receiving a big 400,000 votes. He now commands the toughen of the ones all across the political spectrum, from libertarians through anti-war Democrats to real paleoconservative Republicans. Paul has been in and out of Congress because the 70's and is universally hated by way of the Republican elite, who routinely again Democrats towards him just to take a look at and get him out of office. The former Vietnam flight doctor is the perfect candidate for President and activists from every nook of each political persuasion will have to mobilize now in an try to assist Paul shatter the ability monopoly of the Republican and Democrat establishment who have labored together for decades to slit America's throat in the interests of power, greed, and ego - all running towards the belief of a brand new global order. The Texan represents a loss of life breed in Congress, individuals who in fact forged their votes according to the Constitution and no longer on the discretion of lobbyists or the fear that the elite will tarnish their political careers if they don't regularly fortify the establishment. As a result Ron Paul is the elite's worse nightmare, simply having him at the price tag itself will be a massive public members of the family blow, and that's the reason why media organs it is going to be activated to check out and discredit him ahead of next president election 2012. Paul was one among only a handful of Republicans to vote against the unlawful invasion of Iraq, contenting rightly that the Constitution clearly states that only Congress can declare war. In bucking a trend, Paul used to be anti-war lengthy ahead of the majority of the country came visiting to a similar state of mind following the disaster of the occupation. While Democrats soft-peddle and comfy up to Bush, creating phony arguments in regards to the stage of troop presence in Iraq and ignoring the bulk will of the country to deliver the troops home immediately, Ron Paul's opposition to pointless wars of intervention has remained steadfast throughout his complete political career. If a gargantuan effort is produced from now till the top of next president election 2012 to heighten Paul's media profile and forward him as America's final hope, he in point of fact has a vital likelihood of giving Jeb Bush, Rudy Giuliani or whichever elitist puppet the Republicans make a choice to put ahead an actual run for their money."
5,David Wood and Mitt Romney: Much In common But A World Apart,politics," David Wood and Mitt Romney: Much In common But A World Apart What do David Wood and Mitt Romney have in common? They’re rich and famous - and enjoys being so. However, they can be a world apart. What else is common? Don’t be shocked with what I have to say:  both are men of God ! You think it’s only from my point of view, but considering that both of them belong to The Church of Christ of the Latter Day Saints, or the Mormon Church,  they are pretty much into God and Religion. (That we differ from them in our religious views, is another matter.) As far as I know, their young people all go through a period of  at least three years in  active missionary service. Saw those clean-shaven young  men in neck-tied white shirt and black pants, wearing nameplates and smiles, knocking door to door Bible in hands? Yep. You can bet that’s who they are - missionaries in the service of the Lord ! (At this point, picture in your mind the young David and Romney exactly attired as described - and you have 2  saints walking together…) What else is common to both men? They’re businessmen - however, in different industries. David is a topnotch internet marketer with a Google monthly search of over 130,000 for the keyword David Wood alone. Add to it the other several keyword variations, and you get millions. He has thousands of downlines in different MLM companies he excels in,  founded his own company, and  has established himself as a go to mentor in his chosen field. (That’s really cool…) Not to be confused with many other David Woods,  try typing ""work with david wood"" or ""working with david wood"" and you’ll be taken to the site in .29 seconds, compared with simply googling his name. As for Romney, (never mind googling him as his face is one of the most familiar faces that you can see on every news channel) everyone knows what businesses he’d been into, and is into. Almost everything about his life is under public scrutiny - especially that he’s known to be worth at least more than $300M and counting up in assets. (He’s still entitled to some privacy that shelters him from having to declare the exact amount no matter how public a person he is.) They’re both family men. David is so public in his declaration of love for his wife. I believe this  endears him to her even more. And he can gain love and respect from everyone for that honest show of love and fidelity. Mitt enjoys and takes pride in the support of his wife, which they mutually express; and the number of their children is enough of a showcase to see that they live in love. What sets them apart is politics. David is not into politics but Romney is. Whereas businessmen  are always associated with money, whatever be the connotation of money, good or bad, (remember, the Gospel, in many instances, looks at money and riches with disfavor, like placing God and money as two masters you can not serve, or the rich being unable to go to heaven lest they go through the eye of a needle…) politicians are associated more with money, corruption and lies. Ugh. Guilty by association. Not fair. Rally, really not fair. Only lawyers may come in close second to politicians in being targeted with this guilt by association  mudslinging technique; but they are usually spared from this in a subtle way because they’re quite often its practitioners. Oh no… What have I written? (sigh…) I like David and Romney for who they are… could be a fan of both, however apolitical. Never meant to associate anything  with unsavory connotation. These are just generalizations… I like money. Who doesn’t?  Even they who may look at money from the Gospel point of view depends on money so much for their charity."
6,Atomic Iran: Countdown to Armageddon,politics," Award-winning journalist, Mike Evans is one of the world’s leading experts on Middle-East and has written many books and articles on the subject. In his latest book, Atomic Iran: Countdown to Armageddon, Evans exposes the terrific reality that Iran is working towards becoming the next nuclear state. Iran is a terrorist state Iran committed to Islamic revolution worldwide, including the streets of America. In fact, Iran’s fanatical President Amadinejad followed his radical Islamic teachings when in May 2006 he sent a letter to President George W. Bush offering to allow his enemy to convert to Islam or suffer merciless attacks on America! Dr. Mike Evans, President of The Jerusalem Prayer Team, is convinced that Iran will be able to launch nuclear attacks within the next twelve months, unless Americans unite and insist that our president and the Liberal Left appeasement politicians stand up to Iran’s president and supreme leader. The war in the Middle East may ultimately be the battle for the soul of America. Today, we face an evil unlike any we have ever faced before. Vile words of twisted hatred spill from Islamic extremists of Iran, who preach an apocalyptic jihad or holy war against the great Satan, America, and radically call for the purging of Israel from the face of the earth. Israel’s leaders believe the window of opportunity to eliminate the menace posed by Iran is closing sooner than expected. While the Obama administration is working overtime to restrict available options, Israeli leaders will not allow themselves to be boxed in by President Obama, Robert Gates, Hillary Clinton or anyone else. According to one source, ""Iran has had years to build up covert and dispersed facilities, and is known to have dozens of other facilities associated with some aspect of its nuclear programs.""Speculators have given Netanyahu until October to make a move concerning Iran. Israel doesn’t have the alternative of waiting for negotiations and sanctions to be effective; her very existence is at stake. Evans wrote this eye-opening book because stronger action needs to be taken to educate the global community as to the threat which Iran poses to civilization – to worldwide stability and wellbeing. Iran has long been described as simply a threat to the Jewish state of Israel and to the United States; that is a complete fallacy. The possession of nuclear arms by a fanatical entity, whether Iran, North Korea, al-Qaeda or any of the myriad other radical countries or groups, is a menace of great magnitude, and must be addressed with equal alacrity. This is the book that could literally save the world from Armageddon. The message of Atomic Iran is being lived out right before our eyes. This book will give you greater insight into events that could affect you, your children, and your grandchildren. It gives the real story on the Middle East conflict as it stands today and gives you a powerful insight into the current world crisis and what can be done about it."
7,"If the Evidence Proved Him Innocent, Why Did Dr. Malachi K. York Plea Guilty?",politics," This very seemingly simple question has a quite complex answer. Unbeknown to many outside of the judicial system, this phenomenon occurs much more often than one would think. This holds ever so true even more for the offender or suspected offender that cannot afford a good attorney. A court ""appointed"" attorney is a court ""paid"" attorney. Now, if you couple this idea with a person who may already have any kind of criminal record, you have a recipe for many people being put behind bars on false pretenses. Question: It seems far-fetched that someone would voluntarily ruin their life because of a terrible lawyer, is there more to it? Answer: Yes there is. Many times, the terror begins in the 'inTERRORgation' room. This is where investigators use all kinds of physical and psychological tortures to coerce(force, trick) a person into confessing to a crime they didn't commit or not even guilty of being an accessory. Often times, just as depicted on the detective shows that come on television, the interrogation process is for the most part the same just much more harsh. An interrogation may last three to four days for hours on end and the suspect is kept up and deprived of sleep, food, and bathroom breaks. The investigators rotate out and are well rested and keep reminding the suspect of all the time they are facing. They ask the same questions over and over. All it takes is one inconsistent answer and its all but over for the suspect. For example,""What time did you leave the party?"" If the suspect repeatedly says 10:15, they will keep him/her up for hours on end for days. Remember, the may have allowed the suspect a couple of hours of sleep here and there over the last two few days. Meanwhile, they are bringing well rested interrogators in like a relay team. The suspect is in an often cold, uncomfortable room, sitting on a steel chair. They will keep asking, ""Are you sure it was 10:15, are you sure it wasn't 10:45? If you are deprived of sleep, you may slip up and say, ""Maybe it could have been 10:45."" They will never let you live that down and say you lied to us. ""You said you left at 10:15, now you're saying 10:45, you know you just f---ed up right?"" It's pretty much all down hill from there. Next question is, ""What else have you lied about?"" I think the reader should have a better sense of how these interrogation techniques can get a  confession from someone, even if they are innocent by now. I strongly suggest that everyone has a lawyer on retention that will have your best interest at hand to protect your rights from the beginning of your arrest, be it false or not, this is very important. Question: Is there more? Answer: Sadly enough, yes there is. The reasoning behind the plea agreement is as such: The ""offender""is told if he/she takes responsibility for their crime and owns up to it, they won't be punished as harshly. On the other hand they are told if you don't own up to your crime and make the State waste time and money going to trial and you(WILL PROBABLY LOSE LOOKING AT THE EVIDENCE, KNOW WHAT WE MEAN) lose, we will give you a more harsh punishment. As stated earlier, a court ""appointed"" lawyer, is a court ""paid"" lawyer who does what he/she is told by the court. This is a very important component of the Corrections Corporation of America (Prison Industrial Complex) system. No matter what happens to the person being tried, the court appointed lawyer gets paid regardless. It is similar to a stock broker who gets paid whether your investments that he or she recommended you to take in the first place win, lose, or break even. With this reward system in place, human nature takes over. So how many will really fight for you, knowing they will get paid whether you got to jail or not? Ultimately, the Corrections Corporation of America (Prison Industrial Complex) needs bodies to fill the cells whether they are innocent or not. Understand, that these statistics go up even more for minority males in the low-income bracket, especially those from crime ridden areas. More and more, stories are being brought to light about men in the low-income, minority demographic being exonerated of crimes by way of DNA evidence. There are many cases that have been recorded that show a rash of Negroid Men having been arrested from no evidence and not even fitting the description of the eye witness accounts. It's basically, ""An Any Old Low-Income Man Will Do Attitude."" A study undertaken by the Innocence Project on April 14, 2009, revealed some eye-opening results. The first exoneration by way of DNA evidence happened in 1989. Since then, there have been 235 DNA evidence exonerations. 140 of these were Negroid men as opposed to 64 Caucasoid men. Before the next question, let's take a look at some of the factors that may lead to wrongful convictions: (1) 3% Mistaken I.D. (2) 21% Informant/Snitches (3) 21% False Confessions (4) 35% Hair Comparisons (5) 101% DNA Inclusion At The Time Of  Trial. It should also be noted that even DNA evidence can be fabricated as well. Question: So how does this tie into Rev. Dr. Malachi K. York? Answer: On so many levels it does tie into Dr. York. However, his case is much more complex and has so many more dynamics to be added to the mixture. One thing that should be duly noted is that his case was not about the alleged crimes of child molestation or that of racketeering. His case was more of a war of right against wrong. Many of the injustices that I have mentioned in this very article are things he is still fighting to see come to an end, not only in America, but world over. The reader should really digest the idea that when Dr. York erected the Egyptian village called, 'Tama RE, Egypt of the West', in Eatonton, Ga, that was not only an expression of his right to practice any faith, religion, or way of life he chose as long as he was not breaking the law, he was going against the grain of a system that thrives on abuse and oppression of those too frightened and un-educated to fight. So it must be stated that as he was pursuing his rights as an individual, he was also teaching others to become self- sufficient, doers, and thinkers. As people were becoming more productive members of society, The Corrections Corporation of America (Prison Industrial Complex) was losing its supply of uneducated, dependent, hopeless, and shiftless people that it needs to keep the cells full. Question: So why would someone of such high morals, ideals, resources, and intellect plea guilty? Answer: As I stated earlier, this was a very complex case to begin with and I will do my best to explain. Rev. York knew he was wanted removed dead or alive by a lot of different people and entities for personal, business, and religious reasons as well. With that in mind let me begin. Dr. York, at the time of his arrest, was accompanied by three women. One of which was his wife, who suffers from Multiple Sclerosis. Rev. York was being told that she was not receiving the medical treatment that she needs for her ailment. Multiple Sclerosis is an illness that attacks the brain and can leave the person crippled for life if untreated. Rev. York received ineffectiveness of counsel. His lawyers at the time were Manny Aurora and Ed Garland, of Garland, Samuel, and Loeb. It should be noted Ed Garland has a reputation for talking his clients into taking a plea deal, serving them up on a platter to the  Correction Corporation of America (Prison Industrial Complex). True to form, he did the same thing to Rev. York. Dr. York has a medical condition himself, known as Acute Hereditary Angioedema. This ailment causes the air passages to swell and IS TRIGGERED BY STRESS AND CAN BE FATAL IF LEFT UNTREATED. It has been well documented that Dr. York has not received the medical treatment he needs to this day, after almost 10 years of incarceration. Rev. DR. Malachi K. York was also interrogated for hours on end for days, deprived of sleep, given very rare bathroom privileges, placed in over crowded cells, and forced to sleep on floors with true, hardened criminals, murderers and drug dealers and the likes for 6 months straight. This abuse started from the time of his illegal kidnapping by way of arrest on May 8, 2002, all the way up to his illegal plea agreement on January 24, 2003. I will remind the reader to keep in mind that he was 57 years old at the time when all this was going on!!!! DR. York was being told by his own so-called counsel that the three women would spend the rest of their lives in prison, never to see their children again and it was all because of him. His attorney Garland, told him to take the plea, it was no way he could win the case, take the plea and let the women go so they can be with their children and families, it's you that they really want. If you were my son I would tell you the same thing. DR. York is also a Diplomat, Consul-General, Head of the Consulate Post for the Republic of Liberia, West Africa. Dr. York repeatedly informed the arresting officers during their illegal arrest and kidnapping who he is and that he has Diplomatic Identification and Passport Number: D/003828-04. They only replied to him by saying, ""Shut the F*&#  UP."" Let me take this time to point out that these were county sheriffs and police officers violating international laws, namely Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. So with all this, seemingly the weight of the world on his shoulders, Rev. Dr. Malachi Kobina York took the plea deal, which was if he would plea guilty, the women who were with him that day would be set free. As one can see by this article, there is a lot more than meets the eye as to why someone would plea guilty when they were innocent, so please don't be so quick to judge.  As stated earlier, I strongly suggest that everyone who reads this article go out at your earliest convenience and retain a lawyer that will have your best interest at hand for any legal problems you may encounter in the future. I hope I have answered your questions and have given you a clearer understanding of the reason why this happens so often right under our noses."
8,Pros and Cons of Globalisation,politics," It is obvious that the world is experiencing an economic globalisation. That is clearly stated in the development of the global trade compared to the total global production - the GDP. The global trade has been significantly increasing since the 1990s only held back around 2001 due to the IT crisis and recently due to the current financial crisis. As a result of the globalisation the economies of the world have become still more dependent on each other and especially economically, thus the trade with currencies and gilt certificates has increased too. Organisations such as WTO - The World Trade Organisation - work hardly to ensure this economic globalisation by removing trade obstacles as well as creating an atmosphere of free and fair trade globally. Another sign, which points in the direction of an economic globalisation, is the fact that the competition gets tougher on the global market, which is why company buyouts are seen together with cooperation in order for the companies to survive. Outsourcing of production has also become necessary for many companies to utilize the comparative advantages and thereby stay in the competition. And exactly an optimised possibility for companies to draw on the comparative advantages by, for instance, outsourcing production is one of the most important advantages of the globalisation. Products can now be produced where a qualified workforce is available for the right price and where the conditions favour the production. Another advantage of the globalisation is the increasing competition on the global market on especially the price and quality of products. This development will naturally be in the customers' favour. In continuation of this, investors can now place their capital where it is most favourable due to the free investment possibilities. The globalisation has also created the conditions necessary for an increasing trade between countries, which has turned out to be a vital part of the recipe for increased wealth. As a result of the increased world trade, technology is also spread around the world along with language. Western countries include more and more English words and many Asian countries get to know Japanese words and this development makes it still easier for everyone to communicate globally. However, not everything about the globalisation favours it. One disadvantage is the social distortion because the advantages of globalisation are not shared equally and in the industrialised countries it is often the unskilled workers who have to swallow the bitter pill. An increased distance between developed and developing countries seem to follow the globalisation. Many developing countries do experience growth, however, it is nothing compared to the growth experienced by the already developed countries. Countries have got too dependent on each other. That is brilliantly shown by the current financial crisis, which started in the USA and spread throughout the rest of the world. Sovereign countries have therefore become easier to influence from abroad. Finally, it is worth mentioning that big multinational companies get too much power since they often become absolute rulers with even more influence than politicians from smaller countries - a development that might undermine democracy."
9,The reasons why Donald Trump would definitely be a wonderful President,politics," The actual reason why Donald Trump would possibly be a amazing Chief Executive Mr. Trump as President could be a controversial topic among voters. There are two significant groups of people; the main group of individuals is extremely supportive of him while the other group is set in direct opposition towards him. Whatever the case, he does have several key attributes that can qualify him as a President. A number of the issues that lead him to be an important contender for the leading job consist of: His education It's an undeniable fact that a US president needs to be highly educated. In that regard, Donald Trump would not come short. He went to the New York Military services Academy where he graduated with honors and excelled in extra-curricular activities. He subsequently went to Wharton Business Institution and finished with honors getting a degree in economics. Subsequently,his education lifestyle went on as soon as he was employed for his father, presenting him the ability to employ his academic education in a number of real life situations. As a direct consequence of his fascinating academic background, many people are thinking about Donal Trump as one of the candidate for President 2012. This is attributed to the truth that he is the most effective contenders to mend the impaired educational system, rework it and eventually , help US get back its competitive advantage once more. His business organisation Knowledge We all know Donald Trump as being the incredibly successful real estate property tycoon.He owns deluxe resorts, casinos, rental property, golf courses etc. in both the United States as well as internationally. Staying significantly linked to the media channels ; he has an extremely well established TV series and makes numerous appearances in Television. Due to his increased contact with the general public, many people recognize who he is and will consequently consider him to become one of the contenders for Presidency. A person with a successful business empire would be in a most suitable situation to renovate the suffering American economy. He would undoubtedly have the capacity to use his expertise and business abilities to create additional job possibilities in areas in which there is prospects. Moreover, business men are extremely qualified in making use of the suitable and acceptable degree of resources to get used for each and every endeavor. This specific competency would certainly aid him to allocate government funds to areas throughout the economy that would generate ideal results. Inevitably, more job possibilities are going to be developed and also the economic climate will likely be worldwide competitive. At the same time, his success places him in a really excellent place to convince other business leaders to tackle a far more proactive purpose in career development and restoring the United States current economic climate. His ideas towards the United States Donald Trump has got big strategies for the US. This ranges from national restructuring to foreign policy. For instance, he wants to repair the national transport system, bridges and airport terminals. There are plenty of people who assert in which the United States transportation structure is in the exact same condition as many located in poorer nations around the world. According to Trump, US will need to have the top level transport system across the world and one of his ideas should be to transform US transportation program to the top level reputable transportation program on earth. President Donald Trump has got ideas for China. Trump declared that he will implement a considerably significant tariff (just about 25%) pertaining to products imported from China. He believed that this step can really help generate a a number of brand-new jobs for the US citizens as well as put China in their rightful position. He will as well avert American corporations from outsourcing their very own jobs, an operation which has had a harmful influence over the United States marketplace, causing the American citizens to give up countless job opportunities. His Personality It is definitely an undeniable fact that Donald Trump is definitely a straight-forward individual. He is one of the few individuals freely criticize Barack Obama regarding personal and political matters. For example, he has plainly said that Obama's national and international strategies have entirely failed for example he has ultimately failed to cure the issues with Iraq as a consequence of his poor negotiation skills . Having stated all these, choosing Donald Trump as Chief Executive would be the most brilliant issue that had ever happened towards the United States."
10,Iran On The Path Of Demonizing Technology: Constantly Jamming Satellite Signals And Banning Free Internet Access And Social Medi,politics," by Michael Orfanos Within the past few months, a wide number of news reporters and news agencies around the world have underlined the importance of free  internet access, satellite news and social media, in shaping the world politics  in the wider Mediterranean area (meaning Northern Africa and Middle East)-the so called: ""Arab Spring"" that swept  through a number of countries and brought down authoritarian regimes and replaced them with democratic governments. For decades the  people of those countries were governed by authoritarian regimes and were denied their rights, however technology was able to overcome the state barriers and reach the people. In mid 2009, foreign press reporters made a significant revelation: that people in Egypt (primarily)  Libya, Yemen and other countries, were using satellite dishes in order to be informed by foreign news channels-thus bypassing the local propaganda from the state owned channels- and they were using free internet access and Social Media in order to communicate with each other and organize into demonstrator groups. For example, a member of the central committee of the demonstrators in Egypt had more than 90.000 followers in his Twitter account. Since then, most authoritarian regimes in the above described area have collapsed and are in the process of implementing democratic reforms. However, Iran is persistently trying to oppose this democratization wave-better known as ""Arab Spring"". More specifically, the Iranian government is constantly jamming satellite frequencies of all Western channels and bans access to  Internet and Social Media sites.It is estimated that around 50-65% of the Iranian people are watching satellite TV. Instead of using the state media agencies in order to get informed, Iranians prefer using BBC, Voice of America and other similar Western channels. Accordingly, the number of Iranians using Internet and Social Media is estimated around 20-23%. What is ironic is the fact that at the same time, the Iranian government is using international airwaves in order to operate freely on an international level and broadcast state propaganda to Iranians living abroad: ""Iran is having it both ways"" says a US State Department official. ""It is basically a win /win situation for Iran. They are propagandizing on an International level while at the same time they are jamming all foreign satellites, banning all Western news agencies sites and Social Media"". Some human rights activists call for reciprocal banning of the Iranian state governed news agencies operating worldwide: Shirin Edabi an Iranian lawyer and Nobel Peace Prize winner agrees ""...until the Iranian government learns to respect freedom of expression and freedom of free information"".  The EU also called on Tehran to ""lift restrictions on communications, including internet censorship and put an immediate end to jamming of satellite broadcasting"".Iran was also referred to Jeebboo (www.jeebboo.com) latest quiz questions: More specifically the question was ""Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is President in which of the following countries: A. Iraq  B. Iran or C. Saudi Arabia"". Popular internet quiz games are also considered a threat by the Iranian regime thus are banned."
11,The Social Contract & Criminal Justice,politics," The ‘Social Contract’ was first introduced around the 17th and 18th centuries by a group of thinkers including Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean Jacques Rousseau. The underlying idea is the basic assumption that an individual will agree to give up some of their freedom in return for their freedom to not be imposed upon by others. It often falls to the state in order to police the line between different individual’s freedoms. Due to the ongoing malfunctions of the global economy we have seen a rise in the number of protest groups across the world. These protests have range from outright industrial strikes that pull individuals together to march against supposed wrongs, to the disparate Occupy movements that have been seen across the world, to the so called ‘Arab Spring’ where revolutions have occurred across the Middle East and North Africa. In order to contain these protests, enforcement teams have been employed to confront supposed activists who have sought to cause damage to property and individuals. It is at this point where we have to ask at what point does a protest become a dangerous situation? The argument over the strength of the supposed resistance by police officers has come to the fore with incidents in the U.K. where protestors are often combatted by policing methods which including ‘kettling’. This is where protestors are contained in a small area, often forcibly, and not allowed to leave. Secondly, the recent images of a police officer using pepper-spray on students at a peaceful protest at a U.S. university were described as, ""chilling"" by the chancellor of the University of California. It is incidents such as these that are driving the current debate over whether the ‘Social Contract ‘is breaking down. Questions are being asked and society itself is now asking whether a new idea is needed to consider how to form a political community in the face of ongoing economical, political, and societal fractures. There are a number of online schools which provide courses where students can study such activities. Indeed, by studying an online Criminal Justice degree, individuals will learn about law enforcement and, for example, how the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights apply to criminal law in that country. There is a great range of online degrees catering for students of Criminal Justice from a range of online schools. Whether you are interested in studying a Bachelor of Criminal Justice or a Master’s degree in Criminal Justice the range of topics available enable the student to learn more about the ‘Social Contract’ within a framework that covers a variety of topics. The average cost of a Criminal Justice degree can range from $12,000 a year to anything up to $25,000. If considering a career in Criminal Justice, it would be worth looking in to online schools which can generally provide online Criminal Justice degrees for a fraction of the cost of actually attending face-to-face lessons at another university."
12,Ask the Sheriff - Sheriff Ric Bradshaw,politics," Ask the Sheriff with Sheriff Ric Bradshaw It is that time of year and it’s the season for not just for shopping but for thieves. What you do you do to be careful especially at the malls this time of year? Sheriff Ric Bradshaw: A Couple Things are important: When we do a lot of shopping we will have a tendency to take care packages back to the car. We shouldn’t put them in the back seat or the front seat in plain sight so somebody to walk by and see the packages in there and break in. Put them in the trunk or keep those with you. For the women, keep your purse close to you. Don’t put it in the basket and walk off. One can get distracted and very easily do that and somebody could take advantage of this. These things seem very obvious but it happens all the time and then people forget the lock their cars after they do. Then it's right there where someone could take at any time. We get engaged in the shopping experience and it's very understandable when it happens. Is the Sheriff's Office beefing up some patrols especially in a nearby some of the malls? Sheriff Ric Bradshaw: We are paying real close attention to the parking lots. Our volunteers, our C.O.P.’s will be in the parking lots also. We're making sure that we're going to be seen in the high traffic areas. Especially with the traffic in and out of the malls, we want people to not get in a hurry. Put a smile on, put some patients on and remember there's going to be a lot of people out there. With all the extra Traffic and the snow birds that are going to be coming down here for the season, what about just being careful on the roads in general? Sheriff Ric Bradshaw: Absolutely, traffic is going to be congested so you know patients and courtesy goes a long way here. Also, there are a lot of DUI’s this time of the season. There are people partying and hitting the roads. We're going to have some Saturation Patrols without a doubt, so people need to understand if you're out here drinking and driving we're going to make sure that the roads are safe. We're also going to do the Tow-to-Go program again. That's where we team up with Brown Distributing and AAA so if somebody has too much to drink they can call 1-800-Tow-To-Go and get a tow truck to take them home. Be Smart, I know you want to drive your car home but listen, don't kill somebody or yourself or get the holidays ruined by going to jail because we’re going to be out there and if you're drinking and driving, it’s not going to go good for you. Call the one eight hundred number and you can get your car the next day. The program is free so there’s no problem."
13,The Safe Streets and Communities Act Restricts Some Canadian Pardons,politics," The Tory Government, led by the Honourable Rob Nicholson, Conservative M.P. for Niagara Falls has brought forward the Safe Streets and Communities Act (2011), fulfilling its Speech from the Throne promise to re-introduce law-and-order legislation to combat crime and terrorism. The current Canadian version of the Conservative Parliament re-introduced some reforms debated in the last session to The Safe Streets and Communities Act, stating a commitment to law and order. Canada's Harper government and the 41st parliament introduced the September 20, 2011 new legislation designed to restrict the ability of certain types of criminals to obtain pardons for their offenses to qualify for jobs. This is meant to filter them out from employment where they would be a risk around children, the ill, or the elderly. There is an emphasis on protection against violent and sexual crimes, especially against those who are underage. The law is made to protect the young; there are also sections that generally state that criminals will have less access to the public and more difficulty finding work when that job is one where a clear criminal record is an important requirement. Minister Nicholson stated: ""I am proud today to announce that our Government has fulfilled its commitment to Canadians to produce legislation to make our streets, families and communities safer. ""We campaigned on a promise to get tough on child sexual offenders, crack down on illegal drug trafficking, and improve the overall efficiency of our judicial system. Canadians gave us a strong mandate to bring forward these reforms."" They used this chance to announce laws such as The Protecting Children from Sexual Predators Act (former Bill C-54); The Ending House Arrest for Property and Other Serious Crimes by Serious and Violent Offenders Act; Sebastien's Law (Protecting the Public from Violent Young Offenders); The Penalties for Organized Drug Crime Act: The Increasing Offender Accountability Act; The Keeping Canadians Safe Act; The Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act - and other great-sounding titles that further enhance the justice system to whatever amount that may or may not affect you. Another part of the law doubles the minimum sentence for marijuana production from 7 years to 14, but go on to include an aggravating factor of ""for the purposes of organized crime"" ….but who's going to define what type of crime will be called organized. A small conspiracy of a criminal nature is organized but they're not hiding around every corner or necessarily a violent threat to the public. Their lawyers could have an uphill battle proving that they're not The Mob when the police might have a couple of bags of evidence and a list of phone numbers. It may not be a definition stretched out too far right now but ideally we should be seeing a better society with more freedom with more freedom where a pardon application isn't the only thing standing between a person and a job. The Government, however, wants to make it clear that some offenses are off-limits when young victims are involved. The Act provides provisions to increase higher penalties for possession of date-rape drugs in order to cut down on the incidents involving GHB and flunitrazepam, by moving these up to a higher drug category, schedule 1. Penalties have been increased for offences involving dealing drugs around schoolyards or to children. Moreover it will be taken more seriously when drugs are produced nearby and constitute a hazard to the children in the immediate area. Long called for by many I'm sure, but as we all know most good law is common sense; when laying down rules you should keep in mind that more laws lead to more laws. The Judge who rules on each law may have some draconian sentences up his sleeve if he comes upon a case that qualifies. The Canadian pardons process as it is spelled out in The Safe Streets and Communities Act won't guarantee certain types of employment to every ex-offender."
14,Dear Politicians – Don’t be Anti-Social: We Need to Know You!,politics," When it comes to voting for city elections, most people are ""somewhat"" informed about their local politicians. They are some of the same people who care about what happens in their city, are concerned about their tax dollars and how their policies will affect their families. However, the important thing for politicians to know is that these people are the ones voting. So, in order to vote smartly, they need to know which candidate will address their needs and concerns as voting tax-payers with families. So, it can be a bit disheartening when a person goes to look up information on candidates who are running for mayor and for city council and find very little concrete information. This is both sad and agitating. The amount of efforts put forth by these candidates make people feel duped. These candidates seemed to think that if they simply announce their candidacy that voters would flock to the polls. How could they think that? Voters aren’t sure who to vote for. In a few days, elections for major, alderman-at-large and ward alderman will be held where I’m from, Rock Island, Illinois. There are 9 candidates that should be vying for my vote. To date, I have received only one palm card (http://www.campaignpros.com/palmcards-postcards-businesscards.htm) and one cheaply created flyer in my mail box. I have had only one solicitation for a yard sign (http://www.campaignpros.com/yard_signs.htm) to be placed in my yard. And worst of all, not a single candidate has knocked on my door. This is completely unacceptable to me. From my online research, I have found that two of the mayoral candidates have a website and only one has a Facebook page.  One out of the 6 alderman candidates has a Facebook page and none have a dedicated campaign website.  I suppose I can forgive the aldermanic candidates for not having dedicated campaign websites, but Facebook is free and easy. This lack of accessibility and complete disregard for the needs of voters are extremely concerning. The laziness makes you wonder how badly these candidates really want these positions. Perhaps these expectations are too high but maybe candidates should offer their community more. What is concerning is that there are many voters who are expected to vote for someone they do not even know. Voting shouldn’t be like gambling. It should be a process in where voters can be confident about whom they are voting for."

17,Libyan secret files reveal that former US officials advised Qaddafi on how to wage a propaganda war to save his regime.,politics," by Michael Orfanos Try placing yourselves into Qaddafi’s shoes for a moment. You have been the absolute ruler of Libya for almost 40 years now, with unlimited powers, however things don’t go as planned lately, and rebels are marching towards your capital -in order to overthrow you- aided by NATO forces that place your demoralized troops under severe bombardment causing them heavy casualties. Your regime is on the verge of collapse, while you’re losing fast political allies and public support. You now realize that you have a limited time window for action, in order to save your regime, what do you do? Well, Qaddafi decided it was time to go lobbying… Case 1: ""State Department’s Golden Boy to the rescue!"" Al Jazeera news producer Jamal Elshayyal visited the deserted central offices of the Libyan Intelligence Agency, initially looking for files entitled ""Lockerby"" or ""IRA"", however, he found out something astonishing: he found out secret files containing minutes of meeting of a secret meeting between former State Department member Charles David Welch and 3 high-profiled Qaddafi deputes, on August 2, 2011 in Cairo. ""Who the hell is David Welch and why he did that?"" you may ask. Well, former State Department official (under the Bush administration) David Welch, was a US career diplomat (www.naro.gr), having as his personal career highlight the US-Libya Comprehensive Settlement Agreement Act (August 14, 2008). The latter settled the amount of compensation for both families of American victims (Lockerbie bombing was one of them) and Libyan (bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi-1986). As a result of this agreement, US restored Libyan government’s immunity from lawsuits accusing the Qaddafi regime for terrorist acts. For David Welch this agreement meant that he could now resign from his position and pursuit work in the private sector- he joined ""Bechtel"" the same year (www.naro.gr/blog), a multi-billion corporation that was interested in getting  Libya’s oil and natural gas business. What a coincidence eh? The Minutes of Meeting found regarding the meeting between David Welch and officials of the Qaddafi regime, in Cairo 2, 2011, are quite revealing: Welch advised them to take ""confidence building measures"". This meant the recruiting of high profile US political and public opinion personalities, in order to influence US (mainly) and world public opinion in favor of the Qaddafi regime. Also, Welch proposed to his newly clients a way to undermine Libya’s rebel movement, by ""surfacing"" of forged papers demonstrating a close cooperation between Libyan rebels and Al Qaeda (!). Welch added that: ""…it’s better to receive this information as if it originated from these countries (Israel, Egypt, Morocco or Jordan)"". In addition, the former State Department official said he would be gladly to ""…convey everything to the American administration, Congress and other influential figures"", while he also proposed that ""Qaddafi step aside, but not necessarily relinquish all his powers"". Both Bechtel and David Welch when asked by reporters today for a comment, declined to do so. Case 2: ""The American Lobbyist’s fiasco"" Secret documents seen by Guardian’s Luke Harding also reveal another desperate attempt of the Qaddafi regime to influence US public opinion in favor of his regime. It seems that Libya’s former Prime Minister Al-Baghdabi Ali al –Mahmoudi, employed Sufyan Omeish, a US lobbyist. The latter in a letter to Baghdani (dated June 28, 2011) states: ""It is clear that the NATO forces have no intention of ending their military campaign over Libya anytime soon"" and goes one step further, informing him of  ""evidence of covert logistical military planning for a future ground invasion in either late September or October this year"". Clearly such actions could constitute a state prosecution against Omeish, since he was providing strategic information to the ""enemy"" (since at that time NATO was on war against the Qaddafi regime in Libya). However, in his following messages, Omeish turns out to be playing Baghdabi for a fool, reassuring the Libyan Prime Minster that ""…we also obtained a new confirmation from a high profile Princeton professor and former UN fact finding commissioner, to join our delegation"" and also about his talks with ""award-winning / Oscar-nominated filmmakers to help document the truth about Libya"" (!!!) and ensure global exposure. Mr. Omeish declined making any comment. Case 3: ""You got mail Mr. President!"" Former Libyan Prime Minister Baghdabi, sensing the end is near, with the rebels surrounding the capital Tripoli, decided to rise to the challenge: If you’re thinking this meant that the former Prime Minister joined the Qaddafi forces fighting the rebels and earning a glorious death, this simply wasn’t the case. He just wrote a letter personally to President Obama, complaining about the US’s ""unprecedented decision"" to freeze Libya’s assets, and for siding with the ""evil rebels"", and quickly fled to Tunisia (where other members of the Qaddafi family are also located). This was as close to heroic as he could get… Case 4: ""The Oscar for best drama performance goes to..."" Finally, we mustn’t forget that Gaddafi himself send an appeal to both US Congress & Senate prior to the encirclement of Tripoli by the rebel forces. The letter, as it was announced by the Libyan government to the local media, would be a ""slap in the face"" for America. Libyan media celebrated this imminent action from their leader, as an act of defiance and bravery: Qaddafi would also include in the letter his determination to fight to death in his capital. However, the letter that was actually sent to the US Congress and Senate wasn’t quite like this. Using a humble tone, Qaddafi expressed his unhappiness about the US military assistance-through NATO- to the Libyan rebels and stated that there is actually no reason for a war, since he has no power – in fact, Qaddafi claimed to have left power in 1977 (!!). He also added that all these years since the 90’s he was working hard in order to: ""establish a special relationship with the US"", claiming to be the innocent victim of France’s expansionary policies that call for indirect control of Libya under its sphere of influence. As an epilogue, we can conclude that Qaddafi’s lobbying efforts were feeble, incoherent and widely unsuccessful. All these initiatives made by the onetime ""wanna-be-President of Africa"" could not turn the tide of events that led to his eventual downfall. However, what makes the Qaddafi case so unique, is that while it is an undisputed fact, that Social Media played a significant role in the ""Arab Spring"", thus the monarchs of the countries participating in the Arab Spring, tried unsuccessfully to suppress them or block free internet access in their countries, the Qaddafi regime, was the only one that tried to engage itself in lobbying-which is a distinctive characteristic of the American political system. This means that Qaddafi knew the dynamics of lobbying in the American political system, and tried to exploit it in order to save his regime, which can be seen as a quite unique phenomenon, in global politics.

18,The Road Ahead For Politicians Everywhere Is Not Easy!,politics," Politicians in the United States of America can surely do a better job. There must be a change of approach if they are to maintain their respect as the leading democracy in the world. The American people are in the middle of nowhere when it comes to the real state of their economic affairs. What does downgrading of the credit rating from AAA to AA+ by one agency and the refusal of the others to follow suit. What about the job situation? Unemployment is on the lips of every politician but what about the industry leaders on both sides? What are they doing to improve conditions? What about the proud position of private sector leaders that they are the ones who create jobs. Why are they not creating jobs? Listening to the debate I get the impression that unemployment has to do with the level of corporate taxes levied on companies. While the noise is in the corner of those seeking substantial reduction on current corporate taxes, there are those who feel that taxes can be reviewed upward. One of the wealthiest men in the USA – Mr. Warren Buffet favors increased taxes. The debate is heading for an obvious conclusion that there needs to be an overhauling of the tax and social benefit structures. President Obama is correct; there should be a balanced approach. The very jobs that are the concern of every politician will take a further hit if the social services are reduced. What is really needed is control of the indiscriminate fees charged by the Health Care Institutions. No politician wants to deal with the problem head on. It is all about the high cost of health care. Sometimes a patient is asked to do several tests when one will do. President Obama noted that and in my opinion it appears that he is ready to take on the GOP head on. The next few weeks are going to be critical. The 2012 election campaign will be a very noisy season.  The tea party crowd will be really loud but I also feel it will be a defining moment for them. I don’t believe that the majority of Americans were satisfied with the way the raising of the debt ceiling issue was handled. There was no need to link the debt ceiling with the reduction in spending. It was necessary to priorities the process. Get the debt ceiling out of the way and then deal with spending cuts. Here in St. Lucia there is a new trend with politicians in opposition stepping out to assist the communities they represent or hope to represent. I always asked the question why politicians in opposition are helpless and can only do things for their constituents when they are in government? This is changing now and it is a good thing. The life of a politician should be one of service whether in or out of office. The election season in St. Lucia is very much upon us and the politicians have begun to sharpen their swords. There are interesting days ahead. Many persons have already predicted the outcome, unfortunately politics is like cricket and it is never over until it is over. In the months ahead it will become clearer as to the likely outcome. In the meantime, as always the voters have a responsibility to cast their ballot. Whether it is rock the vote or get out the vote, the voter turn out has to be improved. Our young people must be taught to respect the gains made by their fore parents who struggled to achieve adult suffrage. This is not to be taken lightly and their victory must be celebrated by everyone who has attained voting age and is registered by casting his/her ballot. The road ahead is not easy for politicians as the majority of people have grown to rely on them for their survival. Self Help, Self Reliance, Self Determination, Self Worth, Self Esteem, are all words that are needed to give meaning in the lives of the people. When self worth is truly established in the minds of the people, only then will they be in a position to enter into meaningful partnership with the government. There are some fundamental steps that must be taken to get the people to contribute meaningfully to the progress of the nation. The first step is to open the door to dialogue with the people. The people should be involved every step of the way in issues that affect them. The main aspiration of the people everywhere, above all is to enjoy a reasonable standard of living and this can only be realized when the people are fully behind their leadership. Remember always to Keep the Faith, God is in Charge, Dream Big and expect Daily Miracles! Edward Harris"
19,Conservative Policies and How They Aim to Fix the Country's Problems,politics," Nowadays, the country is severely divided about various issues.  One of the main topics of debate currently is illegal immigration.  Capital punishment, education, and abortion are also other hotly debated topics.  Here's a look at current conservative policies on some of these topics. Our country can actually benefit from immigration, but illegal immigration isn't necessarily a good thing.  The main issue is the fact that illegal immigrants can get into the country so easily.  If anyone want to attack the country, they may be able to get in easily through some of the same venues. Another issue that conservative policies address is the role of government in its citizen's lives.  The government shouldn't stick its nose in our business.  We're dangerously close to becoming a welfare state also and that certainly shouldn't happen. Abortion is yet another issue when it comes to American politics.  Many conservatives are split about this issue.  Even if they can't agree on whether it's wrong or right, they still feel the federal government shouldn't have any say in it.  However, the Constitution can be amended to address the issue, giving the federal government some say-so. One of the most pressing issues in the country is education since it directly affects the future of the country.  Since it's an individual's right to believe whatever they want, religious prayer in school should be allowed. Capital punishment is also taken into account with conservative policies.  If someone takes another person's life, then it's only fair that their life be taken as well.  Other conservatives are a bit more compassionate about it, believing in the power of forgiveness because of their Christian roots. One of the biggest current arguments is in regards to the Second Amendment.  Conservatives don't like the thought of the government trying to take away its citizens guns.  Only criminals would be left with guns if regular citizens couldn't legally own one. Now you know how conservative policies address some of the most debated topics around the country.  Although immigration can be good for the country, people definitely shouldn't be allowed to enter the country illegally.  It's best to allow school prayer to go unchecked in school since it is an individual's right to do so."
20,'Judge Mary Devins is alcoholic' by Maura Harrington,politics," DISCLAIMER: all views expressed in this article are my own and do not represent the position of Shell To Sea or any organisation or cause I have wanted to write this piece for many years, but felt it best to wait until such time as my cases had resolved themselves in the Circuit Court and indeed other cases taken by the state against my colleagues had been rightfully dismissed too. As will be obvious from the title, my concern is our local District Judge Mary Devins here in County Mayo on the West coast of Ireland and a problem she has struggled with for many years. A problem that, unfortunately, has a marked and negative impact on the lives of us locals. Stories have circulated for nearly a decade now about Judge Devins being encountered in a highly intoxicated state at various Mayo restaurants and one hotel bar in particular. Usually these stories (which change slightly depending on who is telling them) also feature her ex-Fianna Fáil husband Jimmy Devins trying to placate her. In the interests of accuracy there are a couple of very important points to make about these rural myths right from the start. Firstly, it's now accepted by most solicitors, Gardaí, social workers and residents here in District 3 that such tales have not only been exaggerated but quite possibly multiplied and result mainly from one incident in 2002. Admittedly, the incident in question was noteworthy, occurring as it did in the social life of a Irish District Court Judge. It seems that many guests and members of staff at a well known hotel near Castlebar witnessed an incident during which Devins verbally abused both an elderly female friend and her own husband. Perhaps more worryingly, they also observed her repeatedly banging her head against a cigarette dispenser a short while later. This much behaviour seems certain, as so many present that night provided corroborating details and in fact to this day many people in Mayo know someone who knows someone who was eating or drinking in the hotel restaurant that night. In other words, it has become accepted as fact throughout Mayo. In my personal opinion, the story is perfectly true. I shall neither debate nor reproduce the various other anecdotes that circulate about Judge Devins being drunk in various places at various times simply because I don't have that same feeling of total confidence they are all true. Maybe the other stories are true, maybe they are not. Maybe some of them are true and some of them are not. Maybe none of them are true. It is only because I firmly believe the hotel incident is absolutely true that I have reproduced it in good faith. The second thing it's important to stress - with great haste - is the aforementioned incident really would have very little bearing on Mary Devins being a District Judge if there were not already extremely obvious problems with her. As a campaigner for the better part of my life, I want to be absolutely clear on this point. If we didn't have other reasons for concern, the nearly 10 year old episode would fall into the realm of the woman's personal life and not warrant reproduction here or anywhere. After all, who hasn't been drunk and behaved regrettably at least once or twice in their life? I myself am nearly 60 and more than a few times over the years have gotten tipsy and emotional. Haven't we all! It is when one starts to examine Judge Devin's far more relevant public court record, that her 2002 hotel incident becomes valid. That is because it's very clear to everyone that over the nearly fifteen year period since she was appointed to the bench in 1997 her record has brimmed with thousands of irritable exchanges, breathtaking mood swings and frankly bizarre rulings - many of which it is roundly agreed are profoundly unjust. It is the opinion of us locals that she has repeatedly come to work while still actually under the influence of alcohol. She has questioned whether she can trust any Gardaí in Mayo. Refused to adjourn a man's case when he was in hospital with injuries sustained in her very courtroom and a letter from the hospital was presented to her saying he could not leave their care. The judiciary itself has repeatedly had to censure her after finding that she has exceeded her jurisdiction. ""Why, when the country is on its knees do we have to pay for a Polish interpreter?"" she blurted one day. Everyone in the courtroom fell silent including the Polish defendants - and several people noticed that Judge Devins was visibly shaking. ""You have been in this country for seven years"" she seemed on the verge of tears, ""and you haven’t learned at least one of our languages?!"" As my astute blogger friend Gombeen points out, she was clearly not referring to Polish or Chinese which classify as our most widely spoken second and third languages when she referred to the plurality of dialects spoken in present-day Ireland. Nor did she seem particularly concerned with the fact that a courtroom can be a very intimidating place for a non-native English speaker. Or the fact there is a well established precedent for interpretation. On the contrary, the local wisdom was: ""she's pissed again..."" Another day, when dealing with a form of urban acrobatics in which participants known as 'freerunners' who use cities and rural landscapes to perform movements through their structures, Judge Devins said the new Defence and Dwelling Bill should make people think twice about freerunning through people’s property. ""The new bill is about household defence and people protecting their property"" she literally seemed to slur her words, ""if you do this [freerunning] through the property of a person who has a legally held shotgun, just think about it! If the bill goes through, people are entitled to take action they see necessary in their home or the curtilage of the home..."" There was a stunned silence - and almost unanimous agreement among us that this was inflammatory, incitement to violence and that once again she was not sober while speaking. Yet what could anyone say? She is a judge. On yet another occasion she described a farmer who let a line of traffic build up behind his tractor as ""arrogant and individualistic"". She then banned the driver, Michael Nevin, for one year although he maintained he had pulled over at the earliest opportunity to let traffic pass. Sound fairly unimportant? Consider that she herself has repeatedly courted controversy by consistently parking not just on double yellow lines outside Ballinrobe Courthouse but with poor co-ordination and sometimes one wheel on the path/one off, a practice highlighted by local councillor Harry Walsh. It seems that the issue of a District Court Judge blatantly flaunting the law - while doling out sentences to others - has raised the hackles of some locals. ""Lawmakers should not be lawbreakers"" Walsh reasonably maintains, adding: ""I honestly don’t see why a Judge, or any servant of the State, or anyone else going into town for business should be allowed to flaunt the law by parking on double-yellow lines. I can see why prison vehicles and garda cars need to be adjacent, but not a private car."" I invite the reader to examine Judge Devin's public court record themselves, some of which is reported through the print media and in other words available online. It speaks for itself. This servant of the state, who regularly breezes into court wearing massive earrings and sassy jackets, is not entirely in control. At the same time, I would remind people that not everything she does is reported by the media and that Devins herself knows this. Sometimes her worst abuses and offences take place when she is confident very few are watching. Therefore, it's also important to ask around and hear personal stories. Anyone who does so will soon discover that her drinking is regarded as a local 'problem'. There will doubtless be some people reading this who will assume that because I have protested against and appeared in the District Court regarding Shell's proposed pipeline, that all my ideas about Judge Devins must be based on that experience. However, the truth is her court record in general is a damning indictment of the Irish judiciary and that it's important someone stands up and says so. Important that someone refers to the elephant in the room in the Mayo judiciary. Ultimately, this has got little to do with Corrib or myself - and everything to do with the individual Mary Devins. Nonetheless, I would concede the orders that took me aback most were related to my own court appearances and because it's difficult for to remain subjective in such instances will instead quote Senator David Norris who raised my case in the Irish Seanad. ""She then referred Ms. Harrington for psychiatric examination in addition to jailing her for 28 days,"" Norris said of Devins and myself. ""Are we returning to eastern Europe? Is it an attempt to use psychiatry to control political expression? This is terribly dangerous territory!"" In fact, having a ridiculous report like that ordered on me was not what irritated me the most about Judge Devins. It was once suggested in court that I had been acting under the influence of alcohol while climbing a fence as part of my legitimate campaign against Shell. I believe that was probably the moment that most stuck in my craw. Everybody and his dog knows this Judge very has a serious drinking problem - I thought to myself privately - yet people in court are falsely suggesting the problem instead applies to me? You can imagine how infuriating that was. I suppose it's understandable that I have ended up being the one who says aloud what is on the tip of everyone's tongue. Yet I emphasize, once again, this is not about me or what I campaign for. This is a significant problem that touches the lives of thousands of people whose cases pass through the courtroom of Judge Mary Devins. I am merely the one who is saying enough is enough. The question we are all baffled by in District 3 is how do you fix a problem like Mary? From a legal point of view, the answer is simple. We have an appellate system in this country and when Devins rules in a way viewed as scandalous - as she so often does - the applicants or defendants or DPP may appeal. The case in question then gets kicked into the Circuit Court where there is no Judge Devins. Does that mean it doesn't matter how bad she is? Does it mean, essentially, that even though she might make some controversial decisions, our greater legal system provides plenty of space for us to remedy them? That she is just a soused regional dinosaur who should be forgotten about? I don't think so. In case there exists any doubt in the mind of a reader out there, all of this constitutes totally inappropriate behaviour for a sitting Judge. A significant and consistent number who come before Mary Devins are being openly and egregiously abused. The vast majority understandably come away distressed, concerned, shocked and appalled. Yet those who who question or resist Judge Devins invariably face indifference or risk paying an even heavier price at the time or if they come before her again. The existence of an appellate court does not mean anything should be tolerated in a lower one - obviously there should always be a certain standard demanded. This is to say nothing of the standard fact that appealing a case involves more money, time and stress which many cannot afford. In the interests of balance it's important to say that in addition to her aforementioned problems, Judge Devins does also have some redeeming qualities. At times, she appears to slice through layers of bureaucracy of the state, scheming by local solicitors and evasion by laypersons. Myself and many others sincerely believe that if she completely stopped drinking, she might actually be a good judge. That a certain genius we sometimes catch brief glimpses of - and which occasionally inspires people who spend only limited amounts of time in her courtroom - could blossom into something positive and genuine for the community. ""She does have a good side"" a local solicitor reassured me after my pychological report was ordered. ""But it's subsumed by an overwhelming belief in authority and what I think it's fair to say is at this stage a fairly well known problem with alcohol. She appears to completely lose control about two or three times a week. The processes and evidence that satisfies her tend to be highly questionable. In effect, she's a rogue judge and there's nothing we can do about it..."" This is quite true. In 2006 then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform Brian Lenihan Jnr was approached at an event, asked in a forthright way ""when are you folks going to do something about the problem in District 3?"" and responded by saying that impeachment of Judges is virtually unheard of in Ireland and in recent times only applied to Brian Curtain who was discovered to have purchased child pornography online with his credit card. It's worth remembering that, even in that instance, another Irish Judge tried to prevent the evidence coming to light on the basis the warrant used for the house search had recently expired. When judges are presented with evidence against other judges, their tendency is to sneeze at it. The chances of Devin's impeachment ever occurring or indeed any form of inquiry into her alcoholism are virtually nil. She will most likely do what nearly every Judge does: serve her time and retire. The only thing people of courage can really do is talk about this - raise consciousness. People outside our county and indeed country need to understand there is quite literally a climate of fear in County Mayo on the West coast of Ireland not unlike that which Irish Times editor Geraldine Kennedy spoke of experiencing in and around government buildings in the 80's during the reign of Taoiseach Charles Haughey. To those who don't know, he was leader of the government of this sorry state in which Judge Devin's husband Jimmy Devins was a TD until recent years when our country voted to remove them from power due to the profoundly decimated state of the economy they governed for 18 of the preceding 20 years.

1,Tough Questions Require Real Answers,politics," It is amazing to me that when talking to political candidates, so many of them seem to be running for no other reason than someone they know said they should throw their name in the hat.  Is this really a reason?  Are your friends and family true, unbiased measures of your ability or qualifications to run for any political office? There are some real questions that you need to ask yourself before you run for any office.  In addition, there are some core questions that voters will ask you while you are on the campaign trail.  You need to be able to confidently answer these questions without fluff and without waiver.  If you can’t give concrete answers to these basic questions, then you may need to rethink your run. Ask Yourself This Why am I running for office? Seems like an easy question to answer, right?  The duty of political office holders is to be representatives for the citizens in their town, district or state.  The leaders are entrusted to make crucial decisions that will affect real people.  So, it really isn’t enough to answer this question with, ""I want to make a change.""  That is assumed by all voters.  What do you want to change?  What is your plan to make these changes? Voters can see through vague, open-ended answers.  They may be entrusting you with their neighborhood and child’s future living conditions.  Think about why you deserve their trust and how you plan to make them believers. Am I qualified for this office? I chuckle sometimes when a candidate insists on putting the letters ""M.D."" or ""CPA"" on their yard signs.  I suppose for some, the quip ""Trust me, I’m a doctor"" really is comforting.  But, what does your medical degree have to do with your ability to be mayor of a city of 50,000 people?  I know a CPA who is running for sheriff.  He insists on printing ""CPA"" on his t-shirts, business cards and the rest of his campaign materials.  I can appreciate the intricate work a CPA does, but I will not vote for a career CPA to be the sheriff of my town. On the other hand, if you have spent 20 years as a law enforcement officer, perhaps spent time in a branch of the military and maybe worked as a correctional officer, please run for sheriff in my town.  If you are a respected CPA with 15 years under your belt, by all means, run for treasurer. Furthermore, when you design your palm cards to handout in the neighborhood, do not embellish your credentials, or include useless self-serving accomplishments that have no bearing on your ability to run for a political office.  Your time spent as a Boy Scout troop member means little when you are entrusted with a city budget. In his book, The Political Campaign Desk Reference, Michael McNamara gives sounds advice: It is important to gain a thorough understanding of the duties of the job prior to going public with an announcement of candidacy. Do yourself and your constituents a favor and do the research. Can I raise the budget needed to make this work? You may believe whole-heartedly that you are qualified for a position.  You may have answers that your community needs.  However, without the budget to equip yourself with the necessary campaign materials, your run may fall flat in a hurry. It is a good idea to sit with someone who currently holds office, or has recently run for office, and discuss a budget.  There are many obvious expenses you will incur—campaign signs, post cards, business cards—but, there are many that you may not have thought of, such as parade materials, booking a conference room for a rally, possibly paying a political consultant, etc. Your war chest should be funded, in large part, by supporters.  But, you will most likely need to dip into your personal funds to get things accomplished.  A certainty is you don’t want to run out of money.  You need a well-planned budget.  Many of the printed campaign materials can be researched online. Don’t fool yourself into thinking that funding is not an important part of a campaign.  I once heard a statistic that stated 80% of campaigns are won by the candidate that spends the most.  Don’t get me wrong, you still need to be qualified and organized. They Will Ask You This Voters will have three main questions on their minds when you ring their doorbell to ask for support. You should have already planned out your honest and passionate answer for this.  Be prepared to share time and time again. Proud, voting citizens go back to the polls each election to cast their support for the candidate whose objectives are most closely aligned with theirs.  You can’t win them all, but showing your genuine concern for their community and quality of life can go a long way.  Remember, voters are looking to put their trust in someone they feel shares qualities and concerns of their own. You’ve chosen to run for office, now what are you going to do?  It isn’t enough to simply have a goal.  You need to have concrete, attainable steps to reach those goals.  Don’t just tout that you are going to clean up the parks or rid the streets of crime.  How are you going to do these things?  What money and resources will you use? Don’t try and pacify voters with vague answers and generalities.  Put it on paper and share it intelligently. These are just a few questions you will be faced with.  The passion needs to be there, but so does the planning.  Voters need you and you need them.  Earn their votes."

3,The  Death of Civil Liberties Britain?,politics," The emergence and subsequent passing of the Bill of Right of 1689 into legislation date back to the English Civil War when parliament was fighting for the right to govern and protect itself against external interference from the monarchy. Article 9 of the Bill of Rights states that ""the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament"". The purpose of this article is to ensure that members of parliament are able to express themselves freely in parliament with impunity from the courts and the crown. However, despite such liberty, parliament has always observed a convention which encourages its members from making statements in parliament which are not in the public interest. One may also argue that the good intention of the founding fathers for enacting such a novel legislation was to ensure that parliamentarians are able to perform their duties effectively and responsibly.  Therefore  it is fairly reasonable to suggest that the founding fathers  would be very  saddened  if they  had thought  a member of parliament  will one day use the privilege they  had fought hard for  to satisfy his gossip appetite by making silly statements  in parliament which  promotes the interest of tabloid newspapers  . I am in fact referring to the latest incident in which an attention -seeking Liberal democrat MP (John Hemming) exposed a Premier League footballer as the celebrity who obtained a super-injunction from the court to protect his extra marital affair.  This kind of behaviour by Mr Hemming seems to go beyond the realms of the purpose of parliamentary privilege. It is not in my opinion for MPs to make statements about the private life of individuals which are not in the interest of the public. ‘’ I think we have to start differentiating between the public interest, and a proper definition of what that means, and stories that the media decide the public people might be interested in... It’s not the same thing."" (Alistair Campbell BBC interview) Shame fully enough, instead of accepting the fact that his attitude was out of order, he and his supporters continued to peddle the false argument that the public have every right to know about the marital life of the celebrity in question. If that’s the case, then what gave the public that right? Well, assuming an hypothetical celebrity had spent most of his celebrity career promoting himself as a good role model for unmarried men; and as a result he had managed to procure brand sponsorships for himself, then in this case, if he had then gone to do something that contradicts the image he had conveyed to the public, it will be justifiable for the public to express deep interest in his fidelities. Conversely, if all that the hypothetical celebrity does is to do the job he was paid for as opposed to projecting such image, then in this second situation, the public has no right whatsoever to know about his private life. The same logic also applies to the footballer’s case; his private life should not be subjected to public debate and scrutiny since he hasn’t done anything to suggest to he’s a good husband. Even prior to this particular incident, there had been series of attempt by some members of parliament to evade justice by claiming that their criminal behaviours fell within the parameters of Article 9 of the Bill of Right. This was certainly true in the case of the three MPs who were charged for abusing their parliamentary expenses. They argued ""proceedings in parliament cannot be impeached or questioned in any court or place outside of parliament. These principles mean that it is for the House of Commons alone to decide whether the conduct of Mr Morley, Mr Chaytor and Mr Devine has been such as to call for sanction.""(Mr Knowles; the MPs legal representative) But despite making such a despicable attempt to avoid facing the music of the law, the courts rejected the premises of their argument by reiterating that ""Scrutiny of claims by the courts will have no adverse impact on the core or essential business of Parliament, it will not inhibit debate or freedom of speech…the only thing that it will inhibit is the making of dishonest claims."" (Lord Philips) On the contrary if the courts had allowed such an appeal, democracy as we all know it will never be the same again.  It would have triggered cracks within the democratic society which our great grandparents fought hard to build for us. But luckily enough, the Supreme Court applied common sense which saw subsequently   resulted in the incarceration of some MPs. In addition, although Article 9 of the Bill of rights states clearly that members of parliament are unanswerable to the courts for things said in parliament, the British constitution has always impose a responsibility on the shoulders of MPs to respect the  judgements and independence of the judiciary. It will be disingenuous and wrong for the British government and its allies to go around the world (as they are doing now) preaching about the importance of democracy, the rule of law, civil liberties and the right for individuals to have free and fair hearing in their respective countries when members of their own country refuse to adhere to judgements made by their domestic courts. Moreover, one may also trace the root cause of the intrusion of civil liberties from the way the press has been allowed to operate. For so many years the British press has enjoyed an unprecedented right of self-regulation. This self-regulation, although good for freedom of speech, gave the press an unfettered playing field which encourages them to report stories which are damaging to civil liberties even when they know that such stories may have a detrimental effect on the individual and his family.  In some cases, some newspapers go the extra mile to hack into the phones of ordinary citizens; a further attempt to infringe upon individual’s right to privacy.  I am not in any way in favour of a privacy law which may or may not restrict the freedom of speech journalist. However I certainly think it is not morally defendable for a news organisation to plough through the phone records of ordinary people without any compelling reason for doing so. It is this relentless intrusion of civil liberties by the press that encourages the courts to issue super- injunction to ordinary citizens so as to protect their right to privacy. As judge Eady explained ‘’the court's duty remains to try and protect the claimant, and particularly his family, from intrusion and harassment so long as it can."" In this regard, it is therefore right for judges to be encouraged by both parliament and the government to continue to devise new ways of protecting civil liberties whiles at the same time making sure freedom of speech is properly upheld.  It is also time for MPs to stop hiding behind the veil of parliamentary privilege and take responsibility for their action. Failing to do so will push the UK down a slippery slope."
4,US Citizenship for Adopted Children,politics," The section 322 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as amended by the Child Citizenship Act (CCA) allows biological or adopted children residing outside U.S. to qualify for naturalization. Once the children enter the United States many foreign-born adopted children acquire U.S. citizenship.  They are entitled to get a certificate of citizenship but they need not formally apply for US citizenship since they become citizens automatically. Until certain criteria are met other foreign-born adopted children may have to wait after which they automatically acquire citizenship. Some need to formally apply for US citizenship especially children living abroad. Requirements to apply Following are the requirements to qualify: •	One parent at least should be living as U.S. citizen, else must have been one at the time of death. •	In the U.S. or its far-off properties the U.S. citizen parent or his or her U.S. citizen parent must have, or had at the time of death, been physically present for at least 5 years. This stay should include at least two of which after attaining the age of 14. •	Age must be under 18 years. •	The U.S. citizen parent must have legal and physical custody of the child residing outside of the United States. If the citizen parent is deceased consent of the individual in charge must be there. •	After a lawful entry for temporary period the child should be maintaining the status in the United States. •	The INA section 322 allows a child for naturalization if the child satisfies the requirements applicable to adopted children under sections 101(b) (1) (E), (F) or (G) of the INA. The person should be unmarried to qualify as a child for purposes of this section.  Children born out of wedlock must have been legitimated while under the age of 16 and should be in the legal custody of the parents. Under this section stepchild who has not been adopted does not qualify as a child. When applying for US citizenship Form N-600K must be filed on behalf of an eligible child for Application for Citizenship and Issuance of Certificate under section 322 of the INA. The U.S. citizen parent must file the Form N-600K on behalf of the child. Otherwise U.S. citizen grandparent or U.S. citizen legal guardian may apply on behalf of the child within 5 years of the parent's death. Before the child is 18 years old the whole process should be completed. The application must have been filed, approved and the child must take the oath of allegiance, if required, to obtain citizenship under section 322 of the INA. Once the adoption is final and they lawfully enter the United States as permanent resident orphans adopted by U.S. citizen parent are citizens. Children who were adopted by a U.S. citizen parent and obtained lawful permanent resident status acquire citizenship automatically though they did not immigrate as orphans. Whatever be the case it’s important that the children are below 18 years of age. Some service members who are on active duty, according to section 322(d) of the INA get a waiver from the requirement that the child be temporarily present in the United States and period of residence overseas on active duty is considered as residence in the United States. To summarize the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Form N-600 should be used for adopted children residing in the United States while filing for a certificate of citizenship and USCIS Form N-600K must be filed for adopted children residing outside the United States for naturalization. Once naturalization is complete if required the child can obtain a U.S. passport."
5,2G Special Court: Is it competent to carry out a fair trial?,politics," In an interesting move, Supreme Court appointed a Special Court to undertake the trial proceedings of 2G Spectrum Scam. Media has played a crucial role in generating heat about this case and it is reflecting in the trial proceedings, if not fully then at least indirectly in ways that can leave us wondering whether the Special Court will be able to carry out a fair trial. For instance, anyone will be taken aback on hearing that the Special Judge was able to take cognizance of the two charge sheets in just 15 to 20 minutes of receiving these documents. The element of surprise here is that one charge sheet was of 127 pages & another of 49 pages with their annexures running over 85000 pages. Now, is it that the Special Judge given some specialized training to read these documents so fast or was there some other reason . . . It is a shock to see that the Special Court room where the proceedings were taking place in front of the Special Judge was nothing but a room full of indiscipline. People talking, entering, exiting at their free will. One of the lawyers who was representing one of the accuseds in fact remarked that he was appalled to see that this shabby and congested room would be hearing an all-important case on which the whole country’s attention was tuned into. A thing that surprises the most that in times when the judiciary stresses on granting bail to lessen the burden on jail infrastructure, and given the fact that this very court of this Special Judge has granted bail in similar matters even after filing of the charge sheets, what is it that’s pressurising the Special Court to deny bail to the 2G accuseds. Legal Fraternity across has expressed its shock over the special judge’s decision. Harish Salve, a prominent lawyer & former Solicitor General of India opines - ""My personal view is that this is not a case for which bail can be denied. Today’s development is a worrisome trend"" (in Economic Times, Delhi). Another prominent lawyer and a senior advocate, Mahesh Jethmalani said on CNBC TV18, ""Bail denial to five accused in 2G Scam surprising!"" In such scenario, where people who are well aware of law are feeling strange on the decision taken by Special Court, for a regular citizen it does raise the question on the competency of the Special Court."
6,Obama's Birth Certificate,politics," Obama’s Birth Certificate President Obama released his Birth Certificate after two and a half years of people asking whether or not he was constitutionally eligible to actually be President of the United States.  The question in most people’s minds is (including Oprah Winfrey in a taping she held for an upcoming show): ""What took you so long?"" For the most part, that particular drama is now over.  I was never really that concerned about it because if Obama was kicked out of the Oval Office, the next one to fill that spot would be Joe Biden.  It gives me chills (and not the good ones that run ""up and down you leg"" like Chris Matthews had) to think of that scenario. But it brings up another drama; the continuing saga of a whether or not we should have an African American man in the White house.  I for one have never had a problem with our President being African American (is it still politically incorrect to say he’s ""black"").  I have a problem with this particular African American being our President.  But it has nothing to do with the fact that he’s an African American.  It has more to do with the fact that he’s inept and unqualified for the job.  No amount of on-the-job training is going to fix this problem.  The man seems incapable of learning even the basic tenets of economics or leadership, both which have been completely absent since January 20, 2009. Peniel Joseph stated that the problem with the ""birthers"", as they are called, is that they suffer from ""a deep seated and vicious racism"" which is fundamentally connected to a white supremacism in this country"". Peniel Joseph is a history professor at Tufts University.  Apparently, Mr. Joseph missed the memo that we live in a ""post racial"" society now that the greatest country that ever existed has elected an African American to be its President. Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts, Jr. said, ""So it is time to call this birther nonsense what it is --- not just claptrap, but profoundly racist claptrap"".  When tens of millions of people who live in this country are concerned because their elected leader will not provide a simple document proving that I had to provide in order to simply get a Maryland Driver’s License, this is not claptrap, much less ""profoundly racist"" claptrap.  Obama has a problem with credibility.  Not too many people believe him anymore.  It’s like that old joke that you can tell when a politician is lying because his lips are moving.  Here’s a clue:  not everything is about race. If the people at the Miami Herald, including you, Mr. Pitts, had done their job in the first place in 2007 instead of acting like infatuated schoolgirls hoping Barry would look your way, most of this ""claptrap"" would not have happened.  The mainstream news outlets, both the print as well as broadcast news, asked tough questions of the conservative candidates and tossed softballs at Barak Obama.  One candidate was vilified because the speaker who opened the night for his candidate dared to use Obama’s full name: Barak Hussein Obama.  John McCain actually was called racist because of this apparent faux pas (And to think we conservatives are called hateful and intolerant). And of course, we can’t omit the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has made a career of calling white people racists.  He told the Politico that Donald Trump’s campaign to get Obama to release his birth certificate was deeply rooted in race.  ""Any discussion of [Obama’s] birthplace is a code word…  It calls upon ancient racial fears.""  Jesse Jackson is an enigma in and of himself.  He’s a reverend who has never pastored a church and a politician who has never held an elected office.  He did march with Dr. Martin Luther King, though.  I really think that Dr. King, if he were alive today, would be distancing himself from Jesse Jackson and others like him because with Jesse Jackson, it’s all about the color of skin rather than the content of character.  They lack any content of character at all.  The only reason people like him continue to bring up race is that without the ""race card"", they have no authority and no following.  Without racial tension, the Jesse Jackson and Al Sharptons of this world would have no place to go, no purpose for being here and no platform from which to speak. I’m not saying that racism does not exist.  Unfortunately, it does.  In its ugliest form, it has caused untold harm to millions of innocent people worldwide.  We all identify with people who look like we do, hold our own same core beliefs, and have similar tastes as we do.  Heavy metal rock fans don’t hang out with the Euro-Techno beat crowd, the Country Western industry or the hip-hop crowd. Personally, outside of my immediate family, I don’t have many friends that are liberal in their politics or who vote the Democrat ticket. That is not racism.  That is called personal preference. To some degree, we all have a bit of racial preference in us to the extent that we all feel most comfortable with people of our own culture, people of our own nationality, people who look like we do, talk like we do, think like we do and act like we do.  This is how we were all wired from birth.  My first dog did not like people dressed in coveralls, like workmen used to wear in the early 60’s.  She had a bad experience with someone in coveralls and from that day forth, she would growl at anyone wearing coveralls, even my dad.  My first wife’s dog did not like people in uniform.  Right after we married, I joined the Army National Guard and came home one day in uniform and met a very angry Irish Setter.  Once she saw that it was me, she stopped growling and came bounding towards me wanting to play.  She got past the external appearance and realized I was still me, just in clothes she was not used to seeing me wear. In other words, once we get to know a little about the person in question (i.e. vetting them to understand who they really are), the race issue becomes moot.  Then we can have a dialogue about the issues without all the invectives and name calling.  The issue is character.  Obama has proved his character by his actions over the past two and a half years.  In the words of the Prophet Daniel (a Jew, different culture, different look, different language, yet character that stretches as far as the eye can see), : "" You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting."""
7,Why Donald Trump Must Run For President,politics," Our Government has now grown too large and too complex for any ""politician"" to manage.  As we have seen for a long time now, our Presidents just can’t seem to handle all the problems that our country has been facing. That’s because America’s major problems are mostly business problems that require the expert knowledge of a superstar Business Manager who has already been there, done that - and has a long record of success. We have people like that in America, plenty of them. The job of President has grown way past the capabilities of the politician who has to learn on the job, after being elected, when it is than too late. We have seen too many huge mistakes from our Presidents, that are dragging this country down. Even our politicians are now talking about ""can America survive?"" We need to elect a different kind of President, and fast. We need a President who has spent his entire life successfully managing and solving complex business and organizational problems, a President who has the training and experience to solve these problems, and a President that has been a successful business manager and now wants to give back to the country that he/she loves. Up to now, our Presidents needed only one skill: To learn the technique of being elected and re-elected. That skill has now proven to be totally inadequate for our modern and complex times. We need to select a new kind of leadership for our country. Somehow, our Presidents have decided that it's not their job to waste their time on all that technical stuff, that's the job of technical experts. After all, it's not the President's job to learn how to create jobs for the people, how to reduce the skyrocketing medical expenses, how to increase our exports, how to control the banks so they don’t blackmail us into giving them billions of dollars, or how to reduce our obscene debt, and so many of those other technical things like that. That's the job for the technical experts, who will tell us what to do. It's not my job. I was not trained for that kind of stuff. Instead, I have to spend all my time on figuring out how to be elected and re-elected. After all, I need to continue to be the President. That's my most important thing to concentrate on. It is now very clear, we need a President who has the training and experience to successfully managing a large, diverse business organization, and who has demonstrated the ability and knowledge to solve complex business problems. We need to modernize our government, with modern tools of management techniques and dedicated professional managers, including electing the right kind of President who already has the skills needed to solve major problems facing America. America has now grown beyond merely a ""politician"" as our President. We need to enter the 21st century and get a professional Business Manager to be our President. We need a person like Donald Trump who has the experience to apply strong business solutions to solve our nation’s problems. Even if Trump looses, America will still win. Donald Trump will have created a new set of criteria for selecting our President – finding the right Business Manager to be our President. Forget the Politicians, they have always screwed thing up. We never seem to know what the President will do, or what his agenda will be, until after they get into the Whitehouse, and than get us into deep dodo. The Politician’s primary goal is to be elected and re-elected. Or in many cases, to implement their hidden agenda. Whereas, the Business Manager’s primary goals are simple: solve problems, build the business, and satisfy the customers. In recent years, our Presidents have pushed their own political agenda, while blaming the other political party for any mistakes and ignoring the heavy problems facing America. The President’s agenda seems to be all about having wars, reducing our social security, lowering taxes for the rich, sending our young to war so fast that their equipment is unsafe, not helping the victims of Katrina, blaming the other politicians for not getting things done for America, telling us how great they will be when they become President – while meanwhile they send our jobs to China, run up our debt to obscene heights, borrow the money from China, let OPEC and oil speculators run up the price of oil, allow the banks to blackmail our government, than give the banks Billions of dollars, while the President is secretly allowing the American Dollar to be replaced in the future by an International Dollar (this secret plan is being spearheaded by China), the result of which will drastically lower the value of the US Dollar and cause a historic downturn in the American Way of Life, forever. We need Donald Trump as our next President to get these problems solved. Otherwise our President will delay, spin, blame the other guy, push the solutions onto our children, or just plain do nothing until it is too late. Save America. We need an experienced and proven Business Manager as our President, not a politician."
8,Federal Budget Affects Pulse Oximeter,politics," The budget show down the United States saw firsthand the week of April 8th. While congress members and members of the White House were fighting over various bullet points, over a million people were waiting anxiously to see what would happen. The shutdown of the government of course meant the furlough of non-essential federal government employees, but it also meant that the many business designed to serve the federal government would also be shut down for the time being. This includes anything from government contractors to the local deli that serves a federal agency. The ripple effect of a shutdown would have been very broad, and many people believed it would truly slow down the economic growth of this country. The momentum of the economy is very fragile at this time, and a small negative effect could throw the balance right off. One program that was in the hot seat for debate was Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood is a program designed to help low income women with health services related to birth control, mammograms, and various women related health check-ups. The two parties of congress were in gridlock over how abortion was being sponsored by this program. Even though this program was only valued at just over 300 million dollars, it tied into other medical programs. Many companies were keeping a close on this particular program, because they wanted to see if its outcome could affect other government sponsored programs. The pulse oximeter industry was one of those industries that were paying attention. The oximetry industry has nothing to do with Planned Parenthood or the abortion debate, but as a whole they do provide oximeters to the medical field as a whole. The government purchases thousands of pulse oximeters every year for both research and medical supply uses. A pulse oximeter, sometimes known as a pulse ox by some medical professionals, is a medical device which is used to get both the blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate of a patient. A pulse oximeter might not be a device that people first think about, but it is a crucial tool to the medical field. A pulse oximeter comes in various forms from a fingertip unit, a hand held unit, and a tabletop unit. Each type serves the same function though. Most clinical settings will use a tabletop unit because it can store more information within the unit, while people on the go will stick to either the fingertip or hand held pulse oximeter. A government shutdown affects various industries that are not all federal."
9,On level: a metaphorical adventure by way of the thoughts,politics," I really contemplate about thought-provoking and attractive items as taking the actual audience with a trek beside me as a result of my mind. In the act you will find signposts along with simple guidelines of their very own awareness not to mention stuffs that that they have presumed, heard, thought, in addition to wondered, reinvigorating those things for them along with calming these individuals that we are certainly not leading all of them into a cul-de-sac, the fact that the journey is always someplace new. Of course, if I'm engaging them in onward motion, from a common location to an unfamiliar location, I have to achieve it using outstanding language as well as various other attention-getting factor in which transfixes these folks as well as moves them down to their location That will get away from the many formal purpose of the term ""teaching"" but in the best way that's what it truly is, putting out for them on an fascinating as well as interesting means, getting all of them upon an helpful excursion. Since there is something you want them to figure out which they didn't realize or didn't know they understood when they sat down in their seats. I would never ever take advantage of the statement 'teaching"" (rhymes together with preaching) in case for hardly any other purpose than whenever brand-new suggestions are disseminated via teaching  (or perhaps speechifying or perhaps discussion), men and women appear to have a strong in-born safeguard towards them. The actual comedy experience is comparable to none alternative though. People appear in just to hear a person chatter and count on the best time - you won't want to teach them or even actually tell them what direction to go - merely captivate these people and ultimately place thoughts into their imagination, when they think about the actual hilarity from it all, you've honestly developed the real notion. And they exit believing, that is certainly a motivating controversy -- as good as in case you advise them to look at some thing a way. And once I'm standing on platform - there is absolutely no reason for becoming tense : actually almost all I am engaging in is actually referring to my encounters as well as sketching understandings and ideas with the target audience who may or may not recognize. However certainly not teach, in no way preach, under no circumstances make-believe that you have got a good single concept what you're speaking about. Because that may backfire as well as no person would want to discover what you really need to claim. Therefore love your own practical experience conversing with the audience. Hold dear the actual occasions exactly where these people laugh as well as agree with you, that's when you empathize. However when you're in front of an audience and you get them to smile on the brand-new concept, you are directing their  becoming for the moment. No one is ever before much more herself or themselves compared to when they actually laugh. Their own protection are generally straight down. It is extremely Zen-like, this minute. They are really completely open, absolutely by themselves when which concept hits the brain understanding that guffaw commences. This is when brand-new tips can be incorporated. When a completely new notion falls inside immediately, it features a chance to develop. Therefore for that moment, that tiny second, I own them. That is one of the matter I seek out by following this kind of course. To be able to claim: cease with your tracks and look at this"
10,America Has A Choice To Make,politics," The First Amendment of the Constitution states: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."" The genesis and purpose of the First Amendment, as it pertains to religion, was to protect people and churches from the State, not the other way around. But the Christian underpinnings of America can not be allowed to stand if the Left is going to reach its objective of making America a godless nation that places man’s baser instincts above the holy Word of God. The end result? No-fault-divorce, abortion, gay marriage, all manner of financial support for those who can but will not work, schools that no longer teach but rather indoctrinate, and another generation of statists who believe free higher education, a high paying job, and a luxury home are ""rights."" And the list goes on. Through an evolution pursued by liberal Progressives and sanctified by a Supreme Court that all too often plays politics, the clear intentions of our Founding Fathers has morphed into ""the separation of church and state,"" a phrase not found in the Constitution. The hypocrisy of the Left is mind-numbing. They demanded the State neuter Christians, and then turned the Constitution on its head to do so. Hence we have the invention of subjective ""hate speech"" that discourages pastors from speaking the Word of God from the pulpit on subjects like homosexuality. This denies our right to free speech and exercise of our religious beliefs. Worse yet, while they are demanding to be ""shielded"" from our country’s Christian foundation, they, in contradiction to the First Amendment, have imposed a religion on the rest of us. It’s called secular humanism. They are as devoted to their ""religion"" as we are to ours. We worship at the altar of Almighty God. They worship at the altar of the State. There is a dynamic confrontation taking place and in the balance is the future of our country. We are at a critical juncture, in every sense. For instance, even most of those on the Left have to admit now that we can no longer sustain the financial irresponsibility we have wallowed in all these many years. What they have trouble admitting is that our tenuous position is in large part because of their quasi-socialist beliefs, one of which is to remove God from every fiber of the tapestry that spells A-m-e-r-i-c-a. Whatever direction we choose, we must choose. As the Bible correctly notes, ""No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon."" (Matthew 6:24 NKJV) When I was a child back in the fifties we were taught right from wrong. Now children are taught that the world is made up of gray areas. Such muddling allows secular humanism to trump the Word of God, which then allows all manner of perversions as well as the death of common sense. Making the point, government strongly encouraged, and ultimately demanded that banks make housing loans to virtually everyone, some of who had no job. Even worse, in some cases the mortgages were in excess of the home’s value. Common sense says you can’t make immediately underwater loans to people without the ability to repay without substantial negative repercussions - but our government said not to worry, they would insure any loss. Citizens bought the lie, forgetting that we are the government, so the government’s loss is our loss. This is a classic example of robbing Peter to pay Paul. So with bailout after bailout we’ve mortgaged our future with nothing to show for it, except a debt that cannot be paid -- and never will be. Yet the Bible says, ""Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law."" (Romans 13:8) If only we had listened to God! This, of course, is only one example of what happens to a nation that turns its back on the teaching of the one true God. It is ultimately destroyed. How sad that we have stood by and let God be banished from what was once our proud Christian nation. How hypocritical that we call on Him when disaster strikes, as we did in the aftermath of 9/11. Some may say that we have not turned our back on God. But that false claim can be made only by a secular humanist with an agenda. For the rest of us, the standard is simple and direct and disposes of the ""gray-area"" theory that we’ve come to embrace. Jesus said, ""He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters abroad."" (Matthew 12:30) America is either with the Lord or we are against Him. We cannot be lukewarm on this. America cannot set God aside, to be used only in an emergency, for if we do we become His enemy by not standing with Him 24/7. America, as the Bible suggests, is being ""scattered abroad,"" and it’s because we have made the wrong choices. Thankfully God is lovingly longsuffering -- ""The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance."" (2 Peter 3:9) But while the Bible says no one knows when the end will come, we are, in the meantime, playing Russian-Roulette with this country that we love so dearly. Ask yourself this: Is it better for America to be with God or against Him?"
11,My President is a good son of a bad family,politics," ""Democracy is an impossible thing until the power is shared by all, but let not democracy degenerate into mobocracy"" - Gandhi As a Nigerian, before I share my pain with you let it  be known that the followership (all of us Nigerians) is as bad as the leadership and that is because we do not hold the leadership accountable like it is in Europe and America. Starting with a macro economic comparison between Ghana and Nigeria, Ghana foreign reserve is just below 3 billion US Dollars and the GDP of less than 40 Billion US Dollars. On the other hand, Nigeria’s GDP is 320 Billion US Dollars and foreign reserve of almost 40 billion US Dollars.  The euro bond issued by Ghana had a sovereign interest of 6.5% but that of Nigeria was 7.8%. Are you wondering about the wide difference in the interest?  Even though Ghana envies the Nigeria’s bequest of over 200 natural recourses and despite the fact that Nigeria is far richer than Ghana the global financial community has more credibility, respect, and trust for Ghana than the government of my country, the Nigerian government. The holy bible says, ""The hearts of my men are desperately wicked"" the bible did not say hearts of black men but 'men'. In this perspective, the white politicians in Europe and America have the predisposition to be corrupt but majority of them at least have either chosen or compelled to be transparent because the followership holds them accountable. Haven leaved in Europe for many years I now know that the leadership of Nigeria will continue to milk the country dry until the Nigerians themselves say enough is enough as we have seen in the Arab countries recently. Unfortunately, we Nigerians are too timid to embark on a path that will liberate us from the jaws of the clique that has held the country captive for many years. Occasionally we have the brave amongst us like our own Allen Greenspan, the bold central bank Governor, Mr Sanusi Lamido. He has spoken openly without fear or favour against the corrupt malpractices of the lawmakers in the National assembly and the presidency, these are those who should know better. The national assembly senators challenged him to clarify one of his public speeches or be sacked. He bluffed the senators who summoned him to defend his statement that the annual expenditure of the national assembly is massively burdensome on the overall national budget. The senators dug their own pit as he gave his televised defence to the detriment of the committee members whose mediocrity seems to have taken turn for the worse. The ruling party, PDP in the past 10 years or so have brought the economy of the country to its knees. From a rigged election to jailed corrupt party chiefs, speakers and governors. The ruling party has made a governing a do or die affairs as we have seen in recent years as they are the only party that failed to sign the electoral code of conduct. They now hurriedly read the freedom of information bill that has been avoided for over four years with hope of passing it before the election. Do they think Nigerians are fools? What has also characterised the ruling party is the failed Nigerian economy because of policy somersaults, mediocrity, and greed.  These unpalatable national antecedents have eroded the very little credibility the Nigerian state and people have in the international community before the ruling PDP came into power. My country’s economy is now on life support due to the unprecedented colossal looting of the treasury and the non-implementation of the national budget since 1999 How does one justify the National Security Adviser office massive capital budget of $580 million for 2011 whilst the Ministry of Education capital budget is just $399 million?  No one should expect anything better from a clique of mediocre that hijacked the country since the early 90s. My country have spent more than $333 billion on Nigerian roads since 1999 yet our roads have become more deplorable. Federal Road Safety Corp (FRSC) reports put daily deaths on our roads to about 780. That sadly means that there are 780 avoidable deaths on our roads while the politicians fly across the country in private jets and helicopters. We do not need UNO, EU or America to intervene in the man made national political Tsunami Nigeria is experiencing. We are blessed with enormous natural and human resources, therefore the future lies in our hands. Let the good people of Nigeria vote out corrupt politicians that have plagued the country and vote in those who they believe in. The election is next month and the president is vying for your vote again, unfortunately, he is the good son of a very bad family (the ruling PDP). The Holy Bible has it that seeds that falls on bad ground will die; the ruling party PDP is the bad ground whilst the president is the seed. Vote for whom you believe in not a party!"
12,When the heart sings and dances,politics," The second international dance and song competition Art Premier has come to an end in Kyiv. The strict jury didn’t give the grand prize in the singing nomination to anyone, while the students of the choreography department of the Kyiv Children’s Art Academy received the first prize for choreography. Children and youth from Ukraine, Russia, Abkhazia and even remote China danced and sang for three days. The singing contest was held in the Scientist’s House, while dancers competed in the Ukrainian Home. The singing and choreography contests had five categories (A, B, C, D and F). The oldest participants (F, adults aged 19-32) competed for two days in two rounds. Children and teenagers (A, B, C and D categories) vied in one round. On the first day the vocalists sang academic arias. On the second it was Ukrainian folk songs. The dancers performed classical, modern, pop and folk dances. ""The most important thing in the contest is that the children get involved in creative work,"" the singing jury head, Ukrainian National Music Academy Associate Professor, and Shevchenko Prize winner Valerii Buimister told The Day. ""We should be thankful for such enthusiasts as Svitlana Sukhomlynova (head of the charity foundation ""Vivat Art,"" which organized the ""Art Premier"" contest. – Author). This year about 100 vocalists participated in the contest. The oldest group (F) had 17 participants. We decided to allow all of them to sing in the second round in order to have the possibility to attentively listen to them once again, as some of them were very nervous during the first round and couldn’t prove themselves. We were pleased to listen to the participants from St. Petersburg, Moscow and a girl from China, Tsui Tsui, who studies at our Kyiv Music Academy. However, nobody was good enough to get the grand prize…"" Both academic and pop-singers competed in the singing category. The pop-singers were assessed by a jury headed by the Chancellor of the Kyiv Municipal Academy of the Vaudeville and Circus Arts, Professor Oleksandr Chukhinin: ""The pop-singers competition has revealed several bright individuals, but the jury didn’t give the grand prize to any of them. The singers from the Kyiv Leontovych School took the first place — they were the best. At present, we have a big problem with the pop-singing teachers. There are two or three of them in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa and Kherson. The repertoire is also a problem, especially for children. They mostly sing adult songs that are irrelevant for them. Today those who have their repertoire are in the saddle. Pop singing requires quite a lot of money. Parents have to invest a lot into audio records and costumes. For example, Mika Newton has the right to represent Ukraine at the Eurovision-2011, but she will do it at her own expense. Now she has to find the money for clothes, traveling, hotel, security and advertisement… It’s show-business. Today artists aren’t artists but ‘products’… I’m proud of Mika Newton. Professor Ivan Popovych taught her. She’s honest and hard-working. There were a lot of descent Eurovision pretenders. For example, Vania Berezovsky is a very gifted singer; Jamala is very bright as well, as is Zlata Ohnevych. However, the audience made their choice by voting…"""
13,Welfare vs. Charity,politics," A favorite political tactic of the Left is to shout ""hypocrisy"" every time someone from the Religious Right expresses an opinion regarding welfare that is not in keeping with liberal orthodoxy that endorses cradle to grave dependency on the government. The adhominem attack has been so successful that Christians have been cowered and rendered virtually mute on this and many other social issues. No one wants to be seen as hypocritical, especially those of faith, as being labeled such strikes at the very heart of what makes a Christian a Christian. We believe in the Golden Rule. ""Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets."" (Matthew 7:12 NKJV) We believe in the lesson of the Good Samaritan. (Luke 10:25-37) Helping others is a commandment of our God. So it would seem that the attacks from the Left are well-founded, for if we are against blanket all-encompassing welfare, how can we claim we are helping those in need as God commands? But labels are dangerous and often exploited. Shouting hypocrisy during every debate regarding the ""nanny state"" is a quintessential example of the point. One of the last things the Left wants to do is actually debate the welfare issue, because if they do they invariably lose. Knowing this, they’ve taken to name calling instead of meaningful debate. Hence, if the Religious Right argues against welfare they are hypocrites. The trouble is, the Left purposely misuse definitions hoping no one will notice. In this case they have manipulated the word charity to morph into the word welfare. Two different words with different meanings. Welfare is defined as ""relating to, or concerned with the welfare and esp. with the improvement of the welfare of disadvantaged social groups."" The welfare state, the result of never-ending welfare, is defined as ""a social system based on the assumption by a political state of primary responsibility for the individual and the social welfare of its citizens."" Charity on the other hand is described as ""a gift for public benefit purposes."" And ""benevolent goodwill toward or love of humanity."" Clearly, the words are not interchangeable unless someone is trying to cloud an issue to their advantage. Welfare is a government program used and abused for political purposes. Charity is a private decision to do good. Welfare is a program that has run amuck with no accountability. Charity can be directed as a charitable person deems correct and in keeping with their faith. Welfare is funded by taxes taken from people, mostly against their will. Charity is money freely given. Welfare is directed by Washington D.C. Charity is commanded by the Word of God. Welfare has at its core using other people’s money to buy votes for re-election of politicians. Charity has as its foundation helping those who need help with no thought of personal gain. Welfare administration eats up a substantial percentage of the money in the system, thereby denying much of what could be offered to those truly in need. Charity can be as direct as buying groceries for your neighbor - there need not be the expensive middle-man welfare demands. Charity is and always will be preferable to welfare. But more to the point, is it hypocritical for a religious person to be against government welfare? The ""War on Poverty"" that has spent trillions of dollars without any tangible results, and has basically ensured that generations of those in the welfare class will always be the welfare class; i.e., to ensure continuing checks one must make sure they don’t have income that would take them off the welfare rolls. So there is little incentive to work. In fact, just the opposite. Further, to increase one’s monthly welfare check, people are monetarily encouraged to, for example, have more children they cannot afford and/or raise as they should be raised. The Bible says in Luke 17:2, ""It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones."" Welfare harms children and should be held accountable. Lastly, 2 Thessalonians 3:10 says, ""For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat."" So the issue is not whether a person is poor, but why they are poor. Welfare fails because it employs no such discernment. Conversely, Christian charity offers help to those who are truly in need  - and tough love to those who can and should be working. ""And if anyone does not obey our word in this epistle, note that person and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed. Yet do not count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother."" (2 Thessalonians 3:14-15)"
14,Balanced Budget: Theory vs Reality,politics," I've long made a joke that credit cards are evil. But that's not true. When a person who is responsible with their money uses them responsibly, they are not evil at all. Try renting a car or making a hotel reservation without one. Credit cards also offer a level of protection when you make purchases. For instance, if you buy something online, and you're unhappy with it, or it's never delivered to you, you have the option of disputing the charges. It can protect you from many of the possible dangers of purchasing something from an unknown company. The problem is that many of us do not use them responsibly. When my wife went back to school to finish her degree, we were making very little money. We were basically living off student loans and our cards. By the time she got out of school, we had racked up thousands in debt. We were buried with it and finding it difficult to dig our way out. We considered bankruptcy. We went to a credit counseling service, chopped up our cards, and made monthly payments until we were out of debt. It's a liberating feeling to make that final payment on your cards. We haven't looked back. We no longer use them. If we can't afford it, we don't buy it. We have learned the hard way that we're better off without credit cards. It doesn't make them evil. It just means that we're not responsible enough to use them responsibly. Because of our access to ""money"" on our cards, we were spending more money than we were making. We were running a budget deficit every year. Does this remind you of our federal government at all? Since the early 1960s, our federal government has run budget deficits every year except 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. They spend more money every year than they receive in tax revenues. Many have brought up the idea of a balanced budget amendment. This would force the federal government to balance their budget every year, and eliminate budget deficits. In theory, I disagree with this approach. But in reality, it needs to be considered. Why? It's kind of like credit cards. In theory, credit cards are useful and offer purchasing protections for consumers. But in reality, many consumers use them to buy products they cannot afford. In theory I oppose a balance budget amendment. In times like these when our country is in a recession, or is coming out of a recession, tax revenues to the federal government are down. A balanced budget amendment would force the federal government to reduce services during a time we need them the most. But reality shows us a different picture. If the federal government ran budget surpluses during the good times, we could trust them to make good decisions and allow them to run budget deficits during the bad times. The problem is that our government does NOT run budget surpluses, even during the good times. They just continue to increase spending in good times and bad. They are not responsible with our money, and they need to chop up their credit cards. It's time for a balanced budget amendment. It would be good for our country, and ultimately, good for our economy."
15,It's Time for a Budget Surplus Again,politics," A showdown is looming in Washington. And it's all about debt. Just to put this into perspective, our national debt stands at about $14 trillion. According to the national debt clock on brilling.com, the debt is $14,107,455,627,940.78, and the estimated population of the United States is 309,976,811. So each citizen's share of this debt is $45,511.33. The national debt is increasing by approximately $4.16 billion per day. To put this simply, the federal government spends more money than it takes in. That's called a deficit. When you do this year after year, it creates a large amount of national debt. Did you know that since about 1970, we've run federal deficits every year except 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001? The politicians in Washington sure like spending our money. The federal government also has what's called debt ceiling. The Congress votes on and sets a national debt ceiling, the total amount of money the federal government can go into debt. In recent years, this debt ceiling gets raised almost every year. Sometimes more than once per year. Last year, the democratically controlled Congress raised the debt ceiling to $14.3 trillion, a political decision to push the next increase after the 2010 elections. We are expected to reach this ceiling within the next month or two. The CBO (Congressional Budget Office) recently reported that we are likely to set a new record this year with almost a $1.5 trillion federal deficit. Studying our federal deficits over the last 25 years, it's been clear that we've run through several groups in control of Congress with various fiscal priorities. Fiscal Conservatives In 1994, Newt Gingrich lead the Republican Revolution, and voters elected fiscal conservatives into Congress, taking control of both the House and the Senate for the first time in many years. First let's look at budget deficits before the 1994 election. These numbers have all been adjusted for inflation. 1986: $429.128 billion deficit 1987: $279.939 billion deficit 1988: $277.808 billion deficit 1989: $260.775 billion deficit 1990: $358.344 billion deficit 1991: $420.108 billion deficit 1992: $438.504 billion deficit 1993: $374.997 billion deficit 1994: $290.576 billion deficit Keep in mind that by the time the new Congress was in place in January, 1995, the budget was already in place for the '95 fiscal year from the '94 Congress. So what happened with deficits during the time that fiscal conservatives controlled Congress? They became surpluses for the first time since 1969. 1995: $227.96 billion deficit 1996: $145.125 billion deficit 1997: $29.04 billion deficit 1998: $89.96 billion SURPLUS 1999: $159.512 billion SURPLUS 2000: $290.772 billion SURPLUS Fiscal Moderates By 2000, moderates and liberals had made significant gains into Congress. While the House and Senate were still controlled by Republicans, they were now controlled by moderate Republicans instead of fiscal conservatives. These moderate Republicans controlled Congress be small margins through 2006. And by 2002, we returned to budget deficits instead of budget surpluses. 2001: $152.76 billion SURPLUS 2002: $186.204 billion deficit 2003: $430.1 billion deficit 2004: $462.56 billion deficit 2005: $347.71 billion deficit 2006: $260.4 billion deficit Fiscal Liberals In the 2006 election, Democrats finally wrestled away control of Congress from the Republicans. Here are the federal deficits we've run during the last few years with Democrats in control. Keep in mind, that like the example above, the 2007 budget was already in place by the time Democrats came into office in January of '07. 2007: $165.24 billion deficit 2008: $455 billion deficit 2009: $1.416 trillion deficit 2010: $1.294 trillion deficit 2011: Projected $1.5 trillion deficit It will be interesting to see what happens over the next few years. Fiscal conservatives now have control over the House, but Democrats continue to control the Senate and the White House. Do you want to know what President Obama had to say about our increasing national debt? He called it a ""sign of leadership failure"". But at the time, he was Senator Obama, and the year was 2006. And Senator Barrack Obama voted against raising the debt ceiling. Back then the national debt was only about $8 trillion. Since then, our national debt has increase by about 75%. That was only five years ago. On this one, I agree with Barrack Obama completely. Our current level of national debt is certainly a failure of leadership."
16,Bill C-23 Proposing Suspension of Criminal Records in Lieu of Pardons,politics," Erasing a criminal record in Canada may become tougher with the drafting and introduction of a new Act into Parliament. Bill C-23, titled ""Eliminating Pardons for Serious Crimes Act"" is the proposed amendment to the Criminal Records Act dealing with pardons in Canada. Serious criminals won't be the only ones affected however; all others will have the waiting period doubled from five years to ten for indictable offenses, and increased from three years to five years for misdemeanors. There is also a three strikes clause which will make anyone with three indictable offenses ineligible for a ""record suspension"", the new moniker for ""pardon"" used in the bill. Record suspension is a term devised to express the government's stance of not wanting to be in the business of pardoning, forgiving, or even relieving anyone convicted of any level of criminal offense. The bill has the aim of getting tough on crime but it also seems to be punishing people who are trying to put an isolated mistake behind them and live as productive citizens once more. Having a criminal record longer leaves an offender vulnerable to further discrimination in the job market and makes travel to other countries more difficult. In effect they are constantly being punished after serving their sentences so one might argue that this is contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Section 11(h) that states that once you are convicted and punished for a crime, you are not to be punished for it again. The place to get tough is in the courtroom. The government doesn't present any reasoning for the waiting period extension backed by statistics showing such a necessity. At the current waiting periods, 96% of the 400,000 people given pardons in Canada have not re-offended so the motive for demanding much longer waiting periods is not aimed at any weakness in the system. Making them wait longer to live full productive lives is surely a negative factor in reducing crime. On the positive side, Bill C-23 allows the National Parole Board to consider a number of factors when determining whether to order a record suspension. The Board may consider the nature, gravity, and duration of the offense. They may also consider the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense. They may also weigh information relating to the applicant's criminal history. These new rules should give a broader spectrum on which to base decisions. Getting a pardon in Canada should be done right away by those who are eligible in order to avoid longer waiting periods. Getting a record suspension doesn't sound as cleansing and there will be the necessity by the applicant to prove to the Board that it would provide him with a measurable benefit and sustain his rehabilitation in society as a law-abiding citizen. The Board would also have the ability to make any inquiries to determine whether the ordering of a record suspension would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. This would eliminate some loopholes that seem to let serious offenders slip by. The longer waiting periods remain inexplicable; it's a case of fixing something that's not broken and could lead to higher crime rates when frustrated ex-offenders can't find work after several years of good behavior and decide to make money in an illegal fashion. The effort could be better spent focusing on proper sentencing and the swift and effective rehabilitation of those who don't intend to commit crimes anymore."
17,Peter Orszag's early life,politics," Peter Orszag, the famous American economist and currently the vice chairman of global banking at Citigroup, has a long professional history, and after being born in Lexington, Massachusetts has ascended from success to success. Prior to his role at the Citigroup organization, Orszag was already involved with the Council of Foreign Relations, acting as a Distinguished Visiting Fellow and often contributing to the New York Times with his own column. Of course, the primary role that Orszag is renowned for is his role under the Barack Obama administration, where he would scrutinize the budget deficit and make key decisions that would change the life of everyday Americans. Orszag has an equally successful educational background, graduating from the Phillips Exeter Academy in 1987 with high honors, and earning an A.B. summa cum laude in economics in 1991, from Princeton University. Furthermore, his educational background boasts a M.Sc. and a PhD in economics, in 1992 and 1997 respectively, both from the London School of Economics. With interests and academic ability beyond the realms of economics, Orszag even has membership to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies of Science, as well as Phi Beta Kappa. In his earlier life, during the early 1990s, he was taught by notorious by renowned economist Alan Blinder of Princeton University, only later to be mentored by Robert Rubin.  This successful academic background, and his involvement with economic studies for so many years has without question allowed him to continue success in later life, becoming a prominent American political figure of the new millennium. After his endeavors in University, Orszag continued his work in economics and soon became a Deputy Director of Economic Studies at Brookings Institution. Here he directed the Hamilton Project, a project which ‘seeks to advance America’s promise of opportunity, prosperity and growth’. This important role expanded Orszag’s portfolio and allowed him to enter the world of real and effective economic work. He worked under this project with the intent to foster economic growth by enhancing individual economic security and embracing government investments. After serving as a Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy between 1997 and 1998, and as the Senior Economist on the Council of Economic Advisers between 1995 and 1996, Orszag continued his important political role for President Barack Obama as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget."
18,Pardons Are a Privilege Not a Right in Canada,politics," It may just be that the Canadian justice system could include more people in the process of rehabilitation and reform by seeing that they are guided through the pardon system and motivated to become productive citizens more efficiently. The system for discharging former convictions leaves the onus solely on the released offender to take care of the proceedings. This article will explore ideas that could result in a greater awareness of this privilege and services to assist them. Perhaps there would be less recidivism if loans and counseling were available to make sure everyone has a chance to get their pardon as soon as they are eligible. Those who have been incarcerated or been assessed fines or probation for criminal offences are left with a criminal record that can affect future employment and ability to travel. If there is a job for which you must be bonded, the criminal record will prevent you from being hired. While it is true that most people who managed to get into trouble aren't executives, if they were they wouldn't be able to sit on a board of directors. They wouldn't be able to buy a franchise or obtain a liquor license to open a restaurant or a bar. There is even difficulty enrolling in an education program. There are two respective waiting periods to apply for a pardon after the sentence has been completely satisfied: five years for Indictable Offences and three years for the less serious Summary Offences. The reason that counseling and assistance for getting Canadian pardons should be available for borderline offenders is that it will provide less opportunity for another slip-up that would result in another charge, especially for those who may have some resentment towards society if they feel shut out. It doesn't take much for a flash of temper to ignite some situation out of proportion. Criminals who have been guests of the state for any length of time usually have a different perspective on how they should be treated so there should be a social worker or other third party assigned to notify the offender that the waiting period is up and that assistance is available if the fee is the only problem. It may be that they haven't been told of the benefits of asking for the pardon. There are many pardon services companies in operation to do the work and streamline the application. It would seem logical that the fees on applications collected by the National Parole Board could go back into looking for more people to pardon as soon as possible, even if they have to lend them the money. This could create a greater percentage of former offenders with clear records who are ready to go full steam into any work they like. Moreover, they may need to travel out of the country to work and require a U.S.A. entry waiver to cross the border or go through an airport. Of course a pardon is not an automatic right but a privilege that must be earned. If some flexibility was put into place however, it could make a positive difference in hundreds of lives. Part of building a career is motivation and not everyone can be self-motivated, they often need a hand up."
19,Why do 1 in 5 Americans perceive Obama as a Muslim?,politics," US President has turned up a hornet’s nest with his suggestion that a mosque be built on ground zero where the twin towers of the World Trade Center existed in New York. Now speculations are rife that he is recommending this probably because he is a Muslim, as his name suggests. According to a recent poll by Pew Research Centre, close to one in every five Americans think wrongly that Obama is a Muslim, which is a far higher number than people who thought the same when he took up residence in the White House. The survey was conducted by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center and its affiliated Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life and was based on interviews conducted before the controversy over whether Muslims should be permitted to construct a mosque near the World Trade Center site. Little idea about their president Only 34% of people polled correctly answered that Obama is a Christian. 43% said they had no clue about his religion, showing how little the Americans knew about the person who holds the privilege of being the ‘most powerful man on the planet’. Most of the people (close to 60% of the respondents who felt he was a Muslim) said their perceptions were largely influenced by media information or mis-information in this case. And this feeling gained momentum once he supported suggestions by Muslim groups to construct an Islamic cultural centre and mosque near the 9/11 terror attack site. The issue about the has also brought to the fore, the underlying and growing religious intolerance of US citizens, who consider all brown-skinned people as Pakistanis, unaware about the diversity of the different cultures in the Asian sub-continent. Xenophobia has become rife in a country which was better known as the land for the free and fearless at one point of time. But post-9/11, people are on the edge and distrust most Asians, which is unfair. Where ignorance is bliss, is it truly folly to be wise? The Pew survey results show how important a role the media plays when it tries to influence people with their perception of reality. With the current viewpoint about Obama’s religion, his political career could see a period of turmoil, since most Americans have a not so favorable view about Muslims. When Obama supported the creation of a mosque on ground zero, doubts started creeping into the citizens’ mind about his religious beliefs, which could have a direct impact on his popularity. He has already faced a lot of opposition on the health reform bill which he pushed through the Senate and the Pew poll shows that now 41% of respondents disapprove of his job performance as compared to 26% who voiced their disapproval in the agency’s March 2009 poll. Following this poll Joshua DuBois, White House faith adviser shared his unhappiness and blamed certain factions in the media and his opponents for creating this wrong impression. ""While the president has been diligent and personally committed to his own Christian faith, there are certainly folks who are intent on spreading falsehoods about the president and his values and beliefs,"" he reportedly said. Now the White House’s public relations machinery will have to work on an overdrive to highlight that Obama was actually born to a Kenyan father and an American mother. He grew up in Hawaii when his father left for Africa, when Obama was just two. He was raised by his maternal grandparents and incidentally his grandfather, Hussein Onyango Obama, was a Muslim. The bone of contention The Islamic educational culture centre which also houses a mosque whose construction Obama supported is actually two blocks away from Ground Zero. This 13-story building is led by the Cordoba Initiative, which is headed by Imam Faisal Abdul Rauf, a cleric with a mosque in New York, who also belongs to an advocacy group that promotes improved relations between Islam and the West. The group aims to educate local masses about the actual teachings of the Islam and showcase that the religion is not fundamentalist in nature nor does it preach hatred. The message that the group wanted to spread is that ordinary Muslim Americans and most Muslims around the world do not subscribe to the terror attacks carried out by a minority faction in their community, under the guise of religion. Ironically, their centre itself has now come in the eye of the storm, with strong opposition from major Republican leaders. Amongst them is former House Speaker Newt Gingrich who claimed that ""Nazis do not have the right to put up a sign next to the Holocaust Museum in Washington. We would never accept the Japanese putting up a sight next to Pearl Harbor. There is no reason for us to accept a mosque next to the World Trade Center."" Obama on the other hand tried to fervently convince his opponents, during an iftar dinner (a dinner which signals the end of a day-long fast during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan) telling that the believed that Muslims have the same right to practice their religion as every other person in this country. And if they wish to build a place of worship and a community center on private property in lower Manhattan, in accordance with local laws and ordinances, then such a move should not be opposed. Bouquets and brickbats thrown in together Obama has found some supporters for his move like New York City Mayor Michael R Bloomberg, who also supported the planned mosque. He described that Obama’s views were ""a clarion defense of the freedom of religion"". But Republicans like former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin asked Obama, whether they should permit the building of the mosque steps away from where radical Islamists killed 3000 people? The mosque is just a symbol now which shows what the general public opinion is about religious tolerance, especially a religion which has unfortunately been linked to most terror attacks to the world over. Co-relating its construction with the perceived religious beliefs or even the religion that the President of United States subscribes is not only foolish, but also counter-productive to his detractors in the long run. Obama’s overtures to the construction of the Islamic center is a positive step in telling the world that the US is not prejudiced against any religion and supports their right to practice it peacefully in the country. One can only hope that his political peers see how this message will help assuage millions who have been trained to believe that the US is a demon to hated and feared and then inducted in terror camps in certain countries. http://www.newscollective.com/blog/?p=3385"

1,Why CSR alliances with local government is more important than a weak COP16 pact in a new age of austerity,politics," As expectations for a solution still at an all time lows the dust settles on the latest round of climate negotiations at COP16 (UN Climate Change Convention, Cancun) with world , it is timely for CSR practitioners like everyone else to reflect on how we are all doing ‘our bit’ for the cause. As a prompt, ponder on this quote for one moment: ""National governments have their national [sustainability] policies, but after all it is local governments who have to implement these policies"" (UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon, 2009) For many, local councils are pivotal to the delivery of sustainability as every aspect of their role shapes how people live their lives – from democratic elections to education, and planning and waste collection. Climate adaptation too, whether it is in relation to building controls (energy efficiency) or flood defences (emergency planning). This sentiment was recently reinforced by the European Union’s Committee of the Regions which went as far as to conclude that global efforts to tackle climate change are destined to fail unless local authorities are given a greater role. So, now ask yourself this question. ‘Am I confident when my company did stakeholder mapping and issuing scoping to craft our climate strategy that we fully recognised the vital role of local government in adaptation? If the answer is no, then you cannot possibly be a CSR leader. To make matters worse, this is a terrible time for companies to sideline local government in the fight against climate change. In a new age of austerity, national spending cuts mean that investment in local adaptation efforts is being squeezed at the very same time that public scepticism over the robustness of the science of climate change in on the increase. Wise CSR leaders may choose to ignore the COP17 jamboree in late 2011 and instead take the opportunity to forge new alliances with local councils that are both good for business resilience and the planet. One example is helping to establish low carbon trade zones with land use planners, such as that in Baoding, China, which has assisted 20,000 local people being employed in solar panel and wind turbine production. Another example is agreeing to contribute toward a carbon compensation levy when constructing new office buildings, such as that in Milton Keynes, UK, whereby instead of investing in carbon-neutral new premises the developers fund local schemes such as insulation for older homes which are much less energy-efficient. So what is holding your business back in this kind of engagement? Your low awareness of local government? Your lack of faith in working with town hall managers? Or is just your short-sighted CSR approach? To get yourself back on track, why not contact one of the 138 world mayors who signed a climate pact in advance of COP16 to show national leaders how easy it is to do a deal if one really wants to. I am sure your advances would be warmly welcomed."
2,Will Health Care Reform Be Repealed In 2011?,politics," That is the question, in a bid to flex their new won muscle the first attack of the year by the Republicans will be on the Healthcare Reform Bill passed last year. But can the bill be repealed or is it just for political show? The reality of the bill being repealed is practically zero. Many Republican opponents feel it is just part of a ploy to tie up Congress until the next presidential elections. Republicans, particularly from the fiscally conservative wing, emboldened by their victories in last November's elections and, as promised, will tackle the healthcare reform bill. With control of the House (242-193) and with a vote scheduled for January 12 it is very likely the reform will pass at least the House. Fighting back Democratic leaders warned against the uproar that will follow repealing a healthcare provision that closes a coverage gap in the Medicare prescription drug program for seniors (the Donut Hole). Senate Democratic leaders wrote in a letter to John Boehner, the incoming House Speaker ""Taking this benefit away from seniors would be irresponsible and reckless at a time when it is becoming harder and harder for seniors to afford a healthy retirement."" Besides writing letters the Democrats are preparing other counterattacks. Rep. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said he will try to force the House to vote separately on the Medicare drug benefits and other popular provisions, including one that allows adult children to stay on their parents' coverage until they turn 26. That could put Republicans in an awkward bind. In actuality full repeal of the health care law is still not likely. The House vote is just the first and the easiest step, the Democrats still control the Senate by 53 to 47 and most likely the re-form bill will not get through. Should it get past the Senate, President Obama still has the last veto and there are not enough votes to override it. There is also the fact that with no replacement plan in the wings this political strategy could backfire on the Republicans so it is not without some risk. The most likely scenario will be that both parties will drag the issue into 2012 and hope for their candidate to win the presidential election. ""It's not going to be easy; it's going to be a long, hard slog,"" said Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, an early leader in the health care repeal drive. The quick thumbs-down vote by the House will have ""tremendous utility and value,"" King said, but it may take electing a Republican president in Obama's place to accomplish the overall goal. In the mean time the Obama administration is not going to be detoured and is still moving forward putting the law’s framework into place for covering more than 30 million people who in the past were uninsured. Finally, we have the courts. Challenges to the constitutionality of the health care law are working their way toward the Supreme Court. Opponents say Congress overstepped its authority by requiring most Americans to carry health insurance, effective in 2014. The case may take a couple of years, and it could change whatever the Executive and Legislative branches come up with. Either way the American people again are just the pawns."
3,Missouri's Proposition B is Bad for Business,politics," ""Shall Missouri law be amended to: -require large-scale dog breeding operations to provide each dog under their care with sufficient food, clean water, housing and space; necessary veterinary care; regular exercise and adequate rest between breeding cycles; -prohibit any breeder from having more than 50 breeding dogs for the purpose of selling their puppies as pets; and -create a misdemeanor crime of ""puppy mill cruelty"" for any violations? --It is estimated state governmental entities will incur costs of $654,768 (on-going costs of $521,356 and one-time costs of $133,412). Some local governmental entities may experience costs related to enforcement activities and savings related to reduced animal care activities."" Yes: 995,368 51.6% No: 934,340 48.4% Measure Passed via Voters Missouri's Proposition B was passed by voters last Nov. 4th as a way to be ""humane"" to dogs in breeding mills. Note, there is already a law that regulated the industry at a state-wide level, and compliance was high with a few bad apples who were tried in court accordingly. This law does nothing to prohibit harm that isn't already covered, plus it is bad for business because it restricts it and harms free trade. First, this proposition does nothing to prevent abuse from occurring at facilities. Missouri's Animal Care Facilities Act (1) already prescribes the minimal amounts of care and area for dogs and cats within the state (2). Failure to comply with these regulations from this law typically include loss of license, business closure, and any fines or penalties applicable for not complying with the law. Through Missouri's Operation Bark Alert, compliance is already relatively high, and the staff are well-equipped to handle the burden the regulations are placed on businesses. By limiting the conduct of business upon those who are otherwise following the existing statues, this new law violates property rights and hinders the free market from functioning at its peak efficiency. Any dog owner who now owns more than 50 breeding dogs will either have to find a new home for those animals or kill them in order to comply. As these animals belong to the owner, only the owner should make these choices, not voters. No sensible breeder will expand beyond what their business can handle. As Proposition B forces a restraining device on business purely because they are ""too large"" it hinders the free market from operating well. In an industry that has little barriers to entry, dog breeding is very competitive. Those breeders who are able to raise quality animals at a cost consumers are willing to pay should not be punished because they want to expand their business. They should be encouraged, especially with the economy still in a downturn. For each dog a breeder acquires they will have to buy the appropriate amount of food, shelter, and medical services necessary to improve their service. This money goes back into the local economy, mostly helping retail stores, veterinarians, and other small-businesses with increased sales. The state and local governments then benefit from increased sales and income tax that is generated through increased business. Though this law was passed by voters, it is not conductive to the free market, nor does it punish those who harm others or another person's property. Following through with this law will damage the breeding industry, and will prevent business from expanding. Missouri State Senator Stouffer (1), has proposed legislation that would repeal the law, but here I will have to respectfully disagree with using the legislature to void this proposition..."
4,NHS Locums and the Great Healthcare Debate,politics," The recent criticism of the increase in the amount spent on locum doctors by the NHS over the last two years and the subsequent speculation over whether or not patient care has suffered as a direct result has served to underline the importance of ensuring high standards in the medical recruitment industry. Amid all the wrangling between unions, healthcare bosses, politicians and front-line staff, that most pertinent and worthy of questions ""Was it worth it?"" is perhaps the only line that can be drawn under the debate. The money has been spent. So what then of the services rendered? With the spectre of healthcare cuts looming overhead, this climate of heightened scrutiny surrounding the use, and indeed, performance of locum doctors, nurses and other specialists is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. The merits of it are threefold. Firstly, an increased demand for the very best professionals and expertise. Secondly, a thrust towards a more responsible, structured and consistent recruitment market. And thirdly, and most importantly, an assurance to patients that their healthcare providers are seeking top quality staffing solutions - both temporary and permanent - from top quality staffing providers. The 19th Century American physician Oliver Wendall Holmes once wrote ""Put not your trust in money, but put your money in trust"". In the business of healthcare, these are words to be ignored at one's peril. At its most extreme, in no other sector can a financial decision result so directly in a life/death defining outcome and this is the key reason why the debate over increased expenditure on locums has gathered such momentum. For healthcare providers in need of finding expert manpower, often at short notice, it ultimately boils down to placing trust in an agency that not only understands their needs but is also able to offer them the highest quality candidates available. The NHS is facing a staffing shortage. The debate about increased expenditure on locums will continue, drawing ever more attention to their role in the system. Regardless of this, the bottom line for healthcare providers is that there are temporary posts that need filling. Do it right and you get a professional and flexible workforce. Do it wrong and it is not just reputations but lives that are placed on the line."
5,Kanye West Says Bush is not a Racist – What Do You Think?,politics," A couple of days ago on the Today Show Kanye West, one of the most outspoken black men in America, was interviewed by Matt Lauer and was asked to apologize to George Bush for calling him a racist.  In typical Kanye West fashion, Kanye turned the interview, which was supposed to be about racism and George Bush, into a several day news cycle about poor Kanye and how he is perennially misunderstood and is constantly persecuted by the media.  This is unfortunate, as Kanye had the perfect opportunity to address an issue that has caused so much confusion, anger and distrust from black, brown and white alike – is American politics motivated by racism? For those who don’t remember, Kanye West was on a concert benefit on NBC in 2005 and blurted out on national TV that George Bush was a racist based on his slow response to the largely black victims of Hurricane Katrina.  George Bush told Matt Lauer recently in an interview that the remark by Kanye was the ""lowest point in his presidency"".  Everyone watched the events on TV unfold in the summer of 2005 in Louisiana.  Black people dying on rooftops, brothers and sisters dying in the streets, and the looting and anarchy that took over the streets of New Orleans was a an international news story.  The slow response by the federal government to provide food, water and medical assistance played out before our eyes as too many black people suffered and died.  These events surely brought out the many negative emotions that caused Kanye to call Bush a racist for not providing immediate aid to the largely black victims, but the honest truth is that Bush’s slow response was not a race issue, it was a class issue. Although not focused on in the media, we all know that many people escaped Katrina unscathed.   People who had cars and places to go left New Orleans before Katrina even came.  In the early hours of the Katrina aftermath, paying hotel customers (black and white alike) were whisked away in helicopters to safety.  Individuals and families who had the means to access federal and local public officials and services did so, and again were skirted off to safety.  It was only the poor (mostly black but many white) people who had no resources or access to resources who were doomed in the wake of the storm.  Bush and the response team did not act outrageously they simply did what the government, corporations, and those in power typically do – they took care of the rich and influential first and everybody else second.  Bush was not being a racist, he was just doing what politicians do. Too often we collapse ""black"" and ""poor"" as the same thing.  We also subliminally collapse ""rich"" and ""white"", ""Mexican"" and ""immigrant"" and ""gay"" and ""weak"".  If we as Americans stop doing this we would truly see how America works and how any individual can succeed in it.  If you are black and have money you can have everything that a white man with money has.  The most thugged out rapper can live in Beverly Hills if he wants – as long as he pays his mortgage.  The darkest brother can influence and control a party littered with racists and homophobes, just ask Michael Steele or Alan West.  A gay man can hit a baseball farther, jump higher, and run faster than 95% of people in this world – just check out, Glenn Burke, John Amaechi and Carl Lewis.   Success in America is a game where money, power and influence are the pieces you need to collect to win.  Racism, sexism and homophobia are blockers, but they do not determine whether you win or lose.  Focus on the pieces and avoid the blockers and you can have whatever you want. Remember – everything that happens to you or people you know is not a result of racism."
6,What Motivates the Tea Party?  Fear of a Black Planet,politics," Tea Party Pundits Before we can talk about what the tea party is scared of we must first define who the tea party is. Contrary to misconceptions perpetrated by the media, the tea party is not a group dominated by backwoods, racist rubes from Bumblestraw, Arkansas.  Sure there are some wing nut, racists in the tea party, but the vast majority of tea partiers are a combination of poor, middle and upper class whites who generally align themselves with Republican ideals of small government, low taxes and free market capitalist principles.  Plainly speaking, the tea party believes that people should be free to form businesses, make money, and live their lives however they want with minimal government interference.  That doesn’t sound too bad, right?  So why are tea partiers so vilified and hated by democrats and other non-tea partiers?  Because too many tea partiers believe that America is an exclusive club reserved for white men and the women and few minorities they allow in. For most of American history the whole country was one big tea party.  Outside of the up and down of the great depression America has experienced an unencumbered period of growth and success based on capitalism and free market principles.  White people were free to form businesses, make laws, form exclusive clubs and get rich.  Sounds great for the people in power, but it was a struggle for those who were not stereotypical white Americans.  Women couldn’t make laws (until the 20th century).  Blacks couldn’t get rich (they were victims of slavery and Jim Crow).  Mexicans could come here and work for those in power, but the vast majority were not allowed into the exclusive clubs or even given the path citizenship.  Gay people simply had to stay in the closet for fear of being ostracized or worse. White men (whether republican or democrat) historically have had the unencumbered path to be middle class OR rich OR powerful OR basic citizens, and they took full advantage of that freedom to become all these things.  For every arrogant rich white man there is a good and peaceful rich white man.  For every racist white organization there is a white organization devoted to equality for all.  The point is, there was unencumbered path to choose your own destiny if you were white in America.  For those white Americans who truly believe in equality for all, America is turning into a beautiful place: minorities and whites are integrating, marrying and creating beautiful rainbow children; our culture is rich with music, food, sports and entertainment that represent the true melting pot of America; and our political landscape has advanced enough where minorities can hold public office and even the highest public office in the land. For the tea party these changes are not to be celebrated.  These events all point to a loss of power and control that symbolizes the destruction of the US as they know it.  The economic downturn in America is seen by many tea partiers as being caused by the degeneration of our society through the infusion of hip hop culture, freedom given to women, the allowance of Mexican immigration and the granting of power to the black president.  If left uncontained, tea partiers believe their way of life will be forever lost, with all the wealth they have amassed lost and redistributed to others and the country being blown off the map by the ""evil Muslims"".  The tea party sees all this and is in complete fear – fear of financial loss and fear of a brown planet. Clearly from a social standpoint the Tea Party is correct that things have changed dramatically in America in the last 20 years.  Where black and brown people have been given unfettered equal opportunity (music, sports and entertainment) they have taken full advantage and have produced a mixed bag of results.  For every Drake there is a Li’l Wayne.  For every Kevin Durant there is a Lebron James.  For every Beyonce there is a Kanye West.  Tiger Woods is a womanizer but for every Tiger Woods you can name 100 white athletes who have had multiple affairs.  In reality, men with power have always had multiple women outside of the marriage almost as a ""right of power"".  The difference today is that Tiger Woods issues and all the issues mentioned above are all over the media. Tea Partiers are bombarded daily with images and stories on all the popular websites, news channels, newspapers, i-pads, and cell phones about: how bad the US economy is, how black and brown people are doing wrong, how thugs have taken over music, how there are no jobs out there and the Mexicans will take them all.  Of course they are scared.  I would be scared too if any of these things had anything to do with reality or real power.  The truth is, none of these items have anything to do with real power in America.  Real power in America comes from having money and the vast amount of money is in the hands of billionaire republicans. Billionaire republicans still run this country through their corporations and their influence over the political bodies that make and enforce the laws of this country. They have co-opted the tea party as their representatives to make sure that the masses vote for the political bodies that will best serve billionaire republicans.  The tea party members are willing recruits, as their moral, political, and social value systems are most aligned with billionaire republicans.  As a tea partier who is scared about losing control and power in America, it is only natural to align yourself with the group that has all the power to restore things to their ""natural order"".  In order for power to be restored billionaire republicans are going to have to make some changes.  Crackdowns on programs for the poor and disenfranchised must come.  Healthcare for all, social security after working all your life, and Medicare for the sick and elderly all take money out of tea party pockets and must be changed or eliminated.  Mexicans must go back to Mexico so white people can have their jobs.  Okay, so white people won’t do those jobs, but Mexicans must go back anyway because the tea party just says so. The republicans, backed by the tea party have formed a posse to come and get their country back and unfortunately after November 2nd there’s gonna be some new sheriffs in a lot of towns. More on the Republican crackdown later…"
7,How We Lost America :: A Brief History in Ten Points,politics," Preface:  For anyone of predominantly White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (i.e. European) heritage to bemoan ""How We Lost America"" is the height of hypocrisy.  But for the sake of the Cherokee blood in my veins mixed with that of the Aztecs in my children, I continue: Whether God preceded Greed or Greed preceded God is debatable.  The fact that all forms of government and all flavors of politics are the spawn of their unholy union is not. At the core of Christianity is the pursuit of good.  At the core of Capitalism is the pursuit of gold.  Beginning in 1492 at the latest, these pursuits connected all continents, corruptly conflating in the process. Global empires constructed on this corrupt conflation collided in what we called ""the Great War"", the bloody battlegrounds of which provided ideal breeding pools for the false profits and false prophets that followed. Massive military machinations offered Sheeple on all sides salvation from depression and oppression.  And at the end of what we called ""World War II"", an American military-industrial machine of unprecedented power prevailed. Not wishing to part with their power or profits, the ""rising military-industrial complex"" and Kleptocracy Ike warned us about began clandestinely fomenting fears of foreign foes and promoting puppet politicians at home and abroad. The demise of the Soviet Union brought about the need for a new Boogie Man to keep billions for bullets, bandages and bridges in the federal budget.  And after some behind-the-scenes bargaining by the Good Ole Boys, the Bedouins were happy to oblige. In the ""Coup d'etat of 2000"", the Kleptocracy overrode our Constitution and the electorate to install ""Dubya"", the idiot son of a former CIA Director, as POTUS (knowing that although they controlled Gore as well, he'd be harder to manage). On 11 September 2001, the Kleptocracy allowed or orchestrated the massacre of thousands of innocent American Sheeple as pretext for the perpetuation of their war profiteering and Peak Oil reserve pursuits. With the debris of the three towers still smoldering in Manhattan, political puppets Left and Right proudly voted away large portions of our Bill of Rights in what must have been laughingly labelled ""The Patriot Act"". The 2008 election brought no ""Change"", as Gates stayed in charge at the Pentagon and Goldman-Sachs kept their hands in the Treasury.  And to assure no change in 2010, Citizens United v FEC legalized unlimited anonymous (including foreign) corporate political donations. And THAT's how we lost America, folks..."

Phase II - Olshefski Campaign Moving Forward Hey Everyone, I hope everyone enjoyed the last burst of summer (Labor Day) with family and friends. Sharon and I made the trip to South Caroline to watch the Citadel play in their season opener. We had a great time recharging our batteries, but now are ready to meet, greet, and communicate again with our neighbors of District 3. Given the budget problem that the city is facing, having someone like me that has dealt with such issues in the past as Garrison Commander is more important than ever. In the coming weeks I plan to walk as many streets as my legs can take me, sharing my vision of south Huntsville and hearing your ideas. I look forwarding to seeing as many folks as I can, so I can earn your vote in the October 5th election. Thanks John O. Thank you for your Vote ""All-I cannot express in words the great appreciation I have for all of you that voted for me yesterday. It was truly a humbling experience as I went from poll to poll taking to so many neighbors and fellow district 3 residents. We have another 6 weeks to go, but I am full of excitement at meeting more citizens , listening to concerns, and sharing my vision. We intend to keep this campaign clean and above board, the citizens deserve that much and my character demands it. Do not let the frustration of the campaign cause you to say or do anything negative, as it will reflect upon all of us....just keep smiling, life really is good."" Thank you all, John O."
9,John Olshefski Huntsville City Council Candidate talking points,politics," http://voteolshefski.blogspot.com/ and http://www.voteolshefski.com/ John Olshefski: Short Bio With nearly 30 years of executive experience in service to our country and more recently with the Tennessee Valley communities and businesses, John Olshefski will bring his passion for progress to the Huntsville City Council. Hailing from Brunswick, Georgia, he attended The Citadel and then rose through the ranks in the United States Army holding numerous command and staff positions and retiring in 2008 as a Colonel. Upon retirement, he was selected to enter into the Senior Executive Service for Army Materiel Command. He and his wife of 29 years, Sharon, made Huntsville, Alabama their permanent home. With public service as his true calling, he is now employed with BFA systems as a Business Development Executive -- a position that allows him to have the opportunity to pursue serving District 3 on the Huntsville City Council. Proven Leader - Real Results Fiscal Responsibility The city council must be responsible for ensuring good stewardship of the public's finances. It must be remembered that every dollar the city generates in taxes comes from the people and that the money must be used wisely.  I have hands-on experience overseeing a $130M dollar budget as the Garrison Commander of Redstone Arsenal from June 2005 - July 2008. During that time I was responsible for providing all the services and programs expected of a major DOD facility despite budget shortfalls of $20M.  This experience, coupled with a Masters Degree in Strategic Resourcing from the Industrial College of Armed Forces (ICAF), gives me a solid background in financial oversight and planning. As an Army officer, I have always worked hard to protect the interests of the American taxpayer, in resources and people, as a City Councilman I will work equally hard to protect and add value to, the financial interests of the citizens of District 3 and Huntsville. Once elected I will work toward the development (within 90 days) of a strategic plan, whose goal will be to stop the erosion within District 3 and improve the quality of life in all neighborhoods. Huntsville Housing Authority (HHA) HHA handled the transactions within our community in a callused and insensitive manner. The lack of visibility of their process and communication was appalling. I will demand and work toward an appointment to the HHA from South Huntsville, to ensure that our interests are protected and that the workings of the board are transparent to all. I will support any measure locally that would provide the people of South Huntsville/Huntsville the opportunity to voice their concerns and have a say in the decision making process.  I fervently support the local delegation to the State Legislature (Senate and House) to continue pushing for 1) greater restrictions on the influence of HHA, 2) increased input by citizens, and 3) improved communication of their actions and future plans. Infrastructure The influx to Huntsville, especially District 3, as a result of BRAC and natural city growth, makes infrastructure a pressing issue to many South Huntsville residents.  To me infrastructure is defined as roads, drainage, nature trails, parks, sidewalks, bike routes, fire stations, police precincts, and other like items that anchor the high quality and safety of life in our neighborhoods that we have come to enjoy. As a result, it is important we plan ahead in order to secure the necessary funding and leverage the use of State and federal dollars. l will work with city planners to determine the best way to incorporate the complete streets program in future road developments as well as reviewing existing danger areas to best protect the lives of citizens. I will work to ensure that we maintain our existing roads and those within neighborhoods, returning to an 8 year paving cycle. Additionally, I will work with city planners and recreational leagues to determine how best to improve and expand our existing parks, and where needed, construct new ones. Declining Property Values - The biggest threat to our community and our way of life is declining property values. Three elements that have the potential to affect our property values are the 1) Huntsville Housing Authority (HHA), 2) the Huntsville City School System, and 3) Closed and abandoned commercial property. We must work closely with the HHA as an equal partner, ensuring that they are held accountable and South Huntsville is protected from arbitrary social experiments. We must protect our South Huntsville schools funding, ensuring that school funds are spread equitably by working closing with the Huntsville School Board as an equal partner in the planning of existing resources. Equally important is the restoration of retail and commercial activity within those business areas of our district that have sit empty for too long. Revitalization - South Huntsville's commercial and tax base has eroded over the years, reducing our ability to garner those city resources which we deserve. I believe a major way to get relevancy is to revitalize South Huntsville along South Memorial Parkway and Bailey Cove. South Huntsville has both the population and income to warrant more retail stores and sit down restaurants. Through my strategic planning process I canvas neighborhood needs and expectation and bring in the appropriate developers to determine how best to attract and retain high quality commercial interests. We should look first at developers providing their own financing, as they did in Jones Valley, but not hesitate, if the business case can be made, to leverage the Tax Increment Financing (TIF) method to help move things forward in a timely manner. Revitalization is one of the key elements to anchoring and improving our property values. Bottom-line, I will: Involve South Huntsville citizens and civic leaders in developing a strategic plan that stops District 3 erosion and improves quality of life. Protect our neighborhoods and schools from negative actions and funding cuts, through direct communication, equal distribution, and transparent representation. Increase financial resources for infrastructure (especially roads and parks) that will aid in protecting and improving property values. Secure economic development opportunities in South Huntsville that will restore retail vitality to empty storefronts. Ensure District 3's fair share of city dollars, police, and fire protection."
10,Fascism in Today’s Political Spectrum,politics," Fascism is commonly placed on the far right of today's political spectrum when it is described. Despite this, most scholars agree that influences by the left and right contributed to its development. Italian Fascism was created with both right and left influences. The ""Fascist right"" was made of members of fascist paramilitary and some ex-members of the Italian Nationalist Association. The ""Fascist left"" included those who wanted to replace Italy's liberal parliament with a national syndicalism and promote the interests of common people and workers. The Fascist paramilitary members desired a dictatorship. The members originating from the Italian Nationalist Association wanted the existing elites to remain while implementing an authoritarian corporatist state. Fascist Italy also had small groups who tried to shift the movement towards their beliefs. These included the ""clerical Fascists"" who promoted Catholic beliefs and the ""monarchist Fascists"" who pushed for an absolute monarchy. Several movements of fascism were self-described as a ""third force"" and not in today’s political spectrum. Benito Mussolini declined to specifically define his version of fascism in an attempt to gain support from as many people as possible.  Benito Mussolini pictured that the economic system of his fascist Italy could be described as either state socialism or state capitalism. Some political scientists have found that the left and right of the traditional political spectrum don't allow for the complexity of the fascist ideology. Some multi-dimensional models of the political spectrum have been devised to help explain this. As fascism started to spread in Italy it gained popularity around the world. The results of World War II quickly dampened this popularity. Marcus Garvy, Winston Churchill, and Franklin D. Roosevelt were all initial supporters of fascist Italy. Following World War II, fascism became quite unpopular around the world. Today, fascist is usually used to describe a preference for authoritarian rule. Fascism is used to attack both left and right wing stances and is often over-used and misrepresented."
11,Fascist Ideology,politics," Fascism, in it's pure form, is a political ideology based on radical views and nationalist ideas. Founded in Italy during World War I and the rise of Benito Mussolini, fascism combined both left and right political views but is considered a far right political belief today. Supporters of fascism believe that a nation is dependent on a central leadership and a single identity. They insist that a willingness to wage war is essential to keeping strength in a nation. Individualism is rejected and people's identity is expected to be gained through the ideas of the culture as a whole. Since they only see a nation as having one collective view, a totalitarian state is considered a representation of the whole nation. A single-party is preferred and anyone that opposes or defies a fascist government is silenced and punished. They will use violence, if necessary, and believe this creates a national spirit. Mussolini & Hitler Fascists are strongly against any groups that try to remain autonomous. Most ethnic and cultural groups are expected to assimilate. Those groups that cannot or will not are considered a threat to the nation. Believers of fascism are against the ideas of the Enlightenment, as well as Marxism and liberalism. They consider rationalism and materialism to be part of the failure of the Enlightenment. Among the ideas that fascists support are discipline, hierarchy, and will. They strongly disagree with the concept that a nation can be governed by economic classes and assert that a nation's military forces must control an aristocracy based on merit, including production.  Conservatism is opposed due to its views against change and modernization. Forms of Fascism Fascist Italy isn't the only form of fascism. Because each emergence of fascism is different, there are varying definitions for it. The exact definition is widely debated among scholars and historians. Scholar, Roger Griffin wrote, ""[Fascism is] a genuinely revolutionary, trans-class form of anti-liberal, and in the last analysis, anti-conservative nationalism."" He goes on to explain that in times of war fascism has shown up mostly in the form of an ""armed party"" led by the nations elite. In Griffin's opinion, fascism promises to combat a threat originating from socialism and degenerating liberalism. This is expected to be done by implementing radical policies that are believed to bring a renewal of social, political, and cultural life within the nation. Another scholar, Robert O. Paxton, believes that fascism is obsessed with the decline of community and becoming victim of ""compensatory cults of unity."" He states that national militants and the nations elite work together to combat these issues through violence without the restraint of ethics and to cleanse their nation internally while expanding externally."
12,Why as a Black Man I won't vote for a Democrat,politics," Why Blacks should not support Democrats. Blacks should not support the Democratic Party in general.  No minority group should support the Democratic Party in general.  If you have read my comments anywhere on the web, here, Fool.com, ArgueWithEveryone, and many other boards and forums then you know I have no love for the Democratic Party in general. History has shown us just how racist and bigoted the Democratic Party was and to an extent, still is.  The Democrats believe that minorities, especially blacks, cannot make it in life without their help.  The dirty little secret is that the Democrats are the reason that minorities have a harder than normal time making it. Democrats have shown through out history that they, in general, hate blacks and minorities.  They have passed laws upholding segregation, poll taxes and much, much more.  Democrats have shown through out history to be the major forces behind denying legislation that would give blacks and other minorities an equal voice in public discourse.  (Jim Crow laws anyone?) Civil Rights took so long to pass mainly because Democrats blocked its passage for decades before the 1960's.  Indeed, the Democratic Party is the home of the KKK and slavery.  This is documented fact and they cannot spin it any other way. The Democratic Party had more members sitting in Congress who where also members of the KKK than any other party including the Republican Party. (Another historical fact Democrats try to hide.)  Republicans have been the ones to advance civil liberty. (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was a  Republican for much of his adult life.  Another historical fact.)  Republicans have been the one who went to war to right a terrible wrong that was known as slavery. As blacks succeed and join the ranks of the middle class and the upper class, you will notice that they tend to register and vote Republican.  They specifically vote conservative.  Republicans, in general,  believe in the human spirit.  Republicans believe that each individual has an equal opportunity to shine and become successful in any en devour they choose so long as government gets out of their way. Democrats want to continue destroying urban minority families with their welfare policies and other public policies.  They keep our schools in the inner city a mess.  After all they are the ones who control most schools.  Democrats are the largest block against vouchers or any kind of school choice.  Even after such initiatives have been shown to boost minority education results. A Democrat founded Planned Parent Hood and its original goal was to ""control the minority population"".  (A historical fact and its documented in its founding documents.  Look it up.)  Democrats have promised much to help minorities and inner cities and have delivered little if anything.  Democrats are the ones who gave us ""Don't ask, don't tell"" in the military yet they blame the Republicans for it.  A Democrat signed the ""Defense of Marriage Act"" but blame the Republicans for this law. No, I will not vote for or support a party that has proven itself to be corrupt and racist.  Shame on any minority that supports such a group.  Including Obama.  Why do we assist in our own destruction?  I want the Democrats to come up with honest policy that truly is fair and colorblind.  Until then, this Cool Black Man will remain conservative and most likely vote for a Republican.  You should to if you are or if you like minorities."
13,Political Forums - No Lack Of Options,politics," There's plenty of choices on the web and one of the best  political forums are those where you feel comfortable knowing you could express your point of views and could get involved in constructive arguments with your fellow members without being personally attacked. The community forum may have an active membership with regular new posts and other people available for discussion. There will be a number of new threads opened at least on a weekly basis. Politics is a fast paced area and nobody desires to belong to a discussion board, political or otherwise that nobody posts in. Once you join a new membership website always be sure you learn the rules and observe them.  Otherwise you can find your very own posts being deleted and in extreme instances you might be requested to leave.  Have a read through the posts to see whether the threads become an exciting dialogue or just an argument - the web equivalent of a shouting match.  Political forums are by definition a place that people can go to argue.  So it is best not to be too sensitive about the replies one of your very own posts might get.  Nevertheless, if the particular person replying has launched a personal attack on you rather than entering into a positive argument, you should not respond in kind. It's ideal to inform a moderator or the community forum owner who can deal with the issue. Politics covers such a diverse range of topics that it is possible to be a Democrat yet maintain really totally different point of views on a certain subject to a fellow Democrat.  Thankfully we live in a culture that promotes freedom of speech and gives you an opportunity to talk about your own outlook without fear of punishment.  But sometimes people take advantage of this freedom mainly in web political forums where they may register without revealing their actual identity.  They could hide behind their call handle and utilize the membership webpage as a way to vent extreme opinions.   A well moderated discussion board will usually do their best to stamp out this sort of behavior."
14,"Fair Tax, Can It Be?",politics," It would be a difficult task today to find an American who is proud of our Federal Government. Rampant corruption permeates the Democratic and Republican parties and it seems the judicial branch is motivated more by politics and ideology than constitution. It is a terrifying time in America; our federal leaders have decided they know what’s best for us and have turned a deaf ear. It’s not an Obama failure or a Bush failure. For decades Washington has focused on self preservation through special interests and pork instead of the well being of America. Now for the first time in our history a weaker USA will be passed to the next generation. The thirteen trillion dollar debt is not the result of a failure of either party but of both. The special interests of corporations, unions, banks and others have muddied the political waters to the point where it’s impossible for our government to function for the good of ""we the people"". We find the situation infuriating! How did we reach the point where half our nation is  paying for the other half. I have yet to encounter an American who truly believes our current tax system is fair to anybody, so why let it continue? Recently a different tax structure has been researched and proposed as a solution, the FairTax. A website at www.passfairtax.com states; ""The FairTax Bill is fair, simple,eliminates the corruption in the 70,300-page current tax code, eliminates all income taxes, payroll taxes and deductions, capital gains, business and investment taxes, shuts down the IRS forever, and will create a huge economic boom and millions of American jobs."" Simply put you would get to keep every penny of your paycheck. No Federal income tax, FICA, or Medicaid monies withheld at all. No complicated tax code, no IRS and no April 15th. We will still pay taxes but will have control of how much and when. With the FairTax structure there would be great reductions in the corrupting influences currently raging in our Capitol. Imagine only being taxed on the money you spend, not the money you save. Employers won’t be faced with a payroll tax either, which is currently a ""double tax"" on money that is rightfully yours. The FairTax would cover our Social Security and Medicaid responsibilities as well. Think about it, you can pass on your estate to your children intact and without burden. If your personal situation requires a thriftier lifestyle you are not penalized for saving your money, you are encouraged to save. When you can afford to be more frivolous you will pay more. Either way you are empowered to choose. A great side effect is that Washington would be highly motivated to encourage the American dream. The FairTax bill will make ""we the people"" the only special interest of importance to Washington. Now that’s the kind of change America is looking for."
15,Sharia law: Already in the United States?,politics," Remember this little nugget of genius from Hollywood scholar Cameron Diaz during the 2004 election cycle? : ""We have a voice now, and we're not using it, and women have so much to lose. I mean, we could lose the right to our bodies…if you think that rape should be legal, then don't vote."" This was part of a rambling and obviously inane monologue Diaz gave on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2004 as she plugged both Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle and John Kerry for POTUS. Pundits tried to defend her diatribe by saying she was expressing her support for Kerry's pro-abortion views. How that translates into ""legal rape,"" I do not know. She should probably just stick to film scripts. Well, Bush won after all that and rape still isn't legal. In truth, it's closer to being legal under Hollywood's darling Obama six years later than it ever was under W. In New Jersey last year, family court judge Joseph Charles ruled against a woman's request for a restraining order against her ex-husband who she claimed sexually abused her. Judge Charles said he believed the man was behaving according to his Muslim beliefs, and that he didn't have ""the criminal desire to or intent to sexually assault"" her. The woman testified that her husband repeatedly forced her to have sex with him, telling her he could do anything he wanted to her because she was his wife and, as such, forced to submit. Judge Charles ruled that the husband's behavior ""was something that was consistent with his practices and…not prohibited."" Here, Judge Charles indirectly referred to Sharia law, the sacred law of Islam and, Muslims believe, the direct will of Allah. According to Sharia, women are considered inferior to men, and as such have fewer rights.  In fact, a woman counts as half a man in giving evidence in a court of law. A husband has the right and the duty, both morally and religiously, to beat his wives (yes, they practice polygamy) for disobedience or misbehavior, however weak the evidence may be. A woman does not have the right to choose her husband, where she will live, or the clothes she will wear. She also cannot travel freely unless accompanied by a male relative. Under this law, women are never independent from the fathers, brothers, husbands, and other men in their families. One of the most common punishments for women for adultery or other misconduct is the horrific and primitive practice of public stoning, sometimes at the hands of family members. In short, Sharia maintains the extreme patriarchy of the Islamic world. However, the feminist voices have been practically silent on this issue. It seems ""legal rape"" disappears as soon as a Democrat is in office. But as Judge Charles has demonstrated, this is not so. While judges try to respect various belief systems, as Judge Charles did here, they risk condoning Sharia law in the United States. In fact, a law proposed in Oklahoma, which will be on the November ballot there, would ban judges from considering international or Sharia law in their rulings. The fact that the issue is even being considered should scare everyone. We can only hope that Oklahomans have the good sense to uphold this ban, because without it, Sharia law would be allowed in America's courts. Our autonomous justice system should not be considering international and Sharia law. That's a sure first step to losing our sovereignty and becoming part of a global community with amorphous boundaries, which the left and Obama would enjoy more than we proud Americans can imagine or believe. If immigrants want to take advantage of all the God-given rights and freedoms we Americans enjoy, defended through the decades by brave men and women, they must accept that they are under the jurisdiction of our justice system based on equal rights. In fact, the primary catalyst of the liberation of Muslim women as well as the safeguarding of American sovereignty will be the obliteration of Sharia wherever it is practiced."
16,Melbourne – Sydney – Brisbane High Speed Railway = High Waste of Money,politics," It is interesting that Anthony Albanese said last night on channel 2’s Lateline that Labor will introduce an infrastructure project looking at a high speed rail line from Sydney to Newcastle.  What a waste of money!  This project as stated on the show last night would cost up to $10 billion dollars if not more.  Do that many people go from Sydney to Newcastle for it to be worth it? I know that the western suburbs of both Melbourne and Sydney are crying out for new rail lines – wouldn’t that be better money spent? Labor of course have not decided that the project will go ahead.  First they will spend $20 million on contractors and investigation but like many of their ‘intended projects’ I doubt it will go ahead – and I hope it doesn’t.  I know that many people have been crying out for a high speed inter capital city rail lines such as between Sydney and Brisbane but with Airports popping up in a large number of new cities and towns and Jetstar, Virgin, Tiger and Air Asia fighting for competition it is likely that the train ride will cost more than a plane fair and take 3 times as long. At the moment there is already a rail service using an XPT train between Melbourne and Sydney which takes 11 hours and costs around $100.  Now last time I checked it was cheaper to fly, much cheaper.  Not only that but flying is a hell of a lot quicker.  Now with lets say $10 billion spend on high speed rail the cost of a ticket would rise considerable to fund the costs.  The project has to be economically feasible because one day it will be privatised like all the other federal and state owned assets.  And for that to happen, the project needs to be making a dollar or two to entice some buyers. Europe has been the example of many to get a high speed rail line in Australia but the continents are very different in demography.  Firstly, Europe consists of a large number of cities which are geographically spread.  Many of these cities have populations of less that 3 million but over 500,000 and rail is much more feasible for many.  In Australia however, 90% of the population is in large cities which have airports that service most of Australia – in Europe, this is not the case. There are so many questions that need to be answered such as how many people will use the service?  How much will a ticket costs? What are the other methods of travel that could take business away from the rail line? and so forth. If you ask me this is a total waste of money and just shows how stupid this current government is.  Labor will go into the election holding this initiative up high but in the end it will be a waste of money and a waste of time just like so many other Labor broken promises. It will be a close 2010 federal election in Australia that's for sure."

18,Medical Translation Increased for Polish Patients,politics," Medical Translation for Polish patients has increased recently according to government figures. Medical translation is a highly specialized discipline where the translator uses his or her knowledge in medicine to deliver a scientific message across a language barrier. Medicine and sciences are based on universal concepts, unfortunately, languages are not. As the British and Germans were the first few who started documenting medical discoveries, most medical journals are widely written in their languages. Medical translation provides the means to broadcast the invaluable medical knowledge to the rest of the world. The demand for medical translation has been steadily increasing throughout recent years. According to recent figures, the hospitals in Edinburgh invested about 13,000 hours in medical translation from English to Polish alone last year. The health officials said that this is also one of the reasons why the medical budget for that region saw an increase.  This is understandable as the city of Edinburgh now accommodates one of the largest Polish populations in the UK. The National Health Service estimated that about £500,000 was paid to medical translations to Polish in 2008 alone. The use of medical translation has risen since then and the authority reported that the bill was about £700,000 in 2009. The officials forecast that there will be a similar increase in year 2010. As a result, the medical translation bill for Polish patients is now the highest compared to other non-English speaking patients. The associate nurse director for NHS Lothian said that the health care service provides its services to a diverse and ever increasing population in Lothian; therefore it is vital that each patient who comes in to see the doctor understands what is being said during every step of the way. The associate nurse director was not surprised by the increasing expenses on medical translation because it is proportional to the increase in size of the population and local birth-rate in Lothian. The figures released by the local officials showed that a total of 26,000 hours were spent on medical translation and about 13,000 hours were on Polish translations. Medical translations were also heavily used by Chinese speakers (4,000 hours), while patients who needed Arabic translations took up about 2,000 hours. There were also medical translations carried out for Turkish, Bengali, Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Russian. Interestingly, only a total of one hour was used for Somali and Tamil medical translation. The local Health authority commented that the provision of medical translation services to their patients is actually effective in lowering the NHS medical expenses in the long run. Why? They said that the medical translation provided free by the NHS actually encourages more people who do not speak good English to seek medical help at an earlier stage, and this in turn could save the NHS more money because there are less patients coming in at terminally ill stages, where a lot more time has to be devoted for treatment. Furthermore, it is very important that something like medical diagnosis to be one hundred percent understood by the patient because it will affect his or her decision to pursue further medical treatment."
19,EU Officials Entry Exam - UK Lobbying For Language Change,politics," The government is challenging the rules for the EU Officials Entry Exam. At present candidates must use a second language rather than their mother tongue. The new British government is now challenging the rules set down for the Brussels civil service exams. The civil service holds a compulsory exam for all European Union citizens who want to work as European Union officials. Currently, the Brussels civil service entry exam must be taken by candidates in a second language rather than their mother tongue. It seems that the British government has secured an early victory because starting from next year; pre-selection tests for EU civil servants can be taken in English. However, France may not be too happy with this decision. Paris is against such policy and defended for the EU civil service exam to be taken in the candidate’s second language. Some say the objection is because the French government is witnessing the use of French declining over recent years, compared to its rival English. What the British government is more concerned about is the number of Britons being admitted into the EU commission as working officials. The EU Commission is where early drafting of new policies and regulations take place. Without enough Britons working inside the EU Commission, the UK government fear that they are falling behind in influencing future policy making within the EU. The move to challenge the language rules for civil service exam aims to increase the number of British Citizens working in all level of the EU governmental machinery, in particular within the EU Commission. We have seen the decline in the number of British EU Officials working in Brussels following the drop of second language teaching in the UK. The newly elected Conservative government blames the previous Labour government of its second language education policy now resulting in a generation gap of British presence within the EU decision making organizations. The British Foreign Secretary, William Hague also agreed that the challenge to the civil service exam language rules is motivated by the need to increase the number of Britons securing more EU jobs. The current statistic shows that Britain only makes up for 1.8 percent within the EU Commission entry level positions, even though the UK represents almost 12 percent of the entire EU population. Mr Hague said the new government now aims to give due weight to the exercise of UK influence in the EU. The Foreign Secretary also outlined that the world political landscape has now shifted towards the eastern countries and therefore it is crucial for the new generation of British to learn second languages. Britain can no longer only play its cards with the Western diplomatic players. On the contrary, future diplomats must learn second languages that are useful in countries such as Poland, Russia, China, India, North African countries, Turkey, and Brazil. The United States is no longer the most reactive player within foreign affairs. Although the British government has managed to secure the short term victory to allow Britons to take the EU civil service exam in English, this move might not be the best for Britain’s long term interests. The widespread attitude of not needing to learn second languages by most Britons is likely to decrease its competitiveness in the international affairs arena. It is hoped that the new government will roll out new education policies that will encourage more students to take up second language studies."
20,"Yo, Don't  Mess With The Constitution!",politics," We are at a crossroads. Do we choose to participate in the destruction of our beautiful planet or can we look forward to new vistas of exploration?  Can we use this time to get it right? To help stop the greed and unwarranted rape and plunder of nature and our own bodies? Freedom is a choice, it comes from inside of us. It is a core belief that everything is truly in Divine Order; it is a belief that God Goddess wants the best for us, that no suffering is haphazard and always for a reason. America was built on the ideas of freedom. Can we continue this vision? From Gandhi: When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants and murderers and for a time they seem invincible but in the end, they always fall -- think of it, ALWAYS. YO, DON'T MESS WITH THE CONSTITUTION What happened to our country? Land of the free, and home of the brave. U    United in one path to freedom: freedom of speech, freedom to choose our lives, our hopes, our health. S     Sadness has overtaken us. Lost loves, lost ways, lost choices to be made. A     Almighty Great Spirit. God Goddess guides us. In God We Trust! Our forefathers and mothers wrote for us the Constitution. Words of strength, words of freedom, words that are loosing their meaning. Which way shall we choose? To impose laws and rules that bind us, chain us to ways we have not chosen? To force the path of governments decision on us: how we live, how we pray, how we eat, and how we choose to take care of our bodies. I say, ""Yo, don’t mess with the Constitution.""

1,Lesil McGuire takes leadership on renewable energy,politics," ANCHORAGE, Alaska - Fifty percent renewable electricity by 2025 is one of the goals for a state-wide energy policy passed into law Wednesday. Gov. Sean Parnell signed two energy bills that aim to create a long-term energy efficient vision. House Bill 306 establishes a state energy policy and Senate Bill 220 sets programs to implement that policy. For the past two years, both pieces of legislation went through a public process that involved hearings in communities across the state. ""Alaska decision makers will now have this clear path of vision,"" said Parnell. House bill 306, sponsored by the House Energy Committee, sets a goal for Alaska to get 50 percent of its electricity from renewable energy by 2025. It was drafted by a group of 16 energy experts, including Chris Rose, who says the state now has a long term vision on energy. ""The more non-fuel resources you have, whether it be wind, biomass, that you don't have to pay for the fuel, the less you have to worry about the volatility of fossil fuel prices,"" said Rose. House Bill 306 goes hand-in-hand with Senate Bill 220, otherwise known as the Alaska Sustainable Energy Act. Senate Bill 220 mandates older public buildings to make energy efficient improvements that will be funded through a loan program expected to create $250 million in bonds. ""We're taking $18 million of fed stimulus money, we're using that as seed money to create a revolving loan fund which will allow organizations around states to weatherize public buildings,"" said Sen. Bill Wielechowski, Senate Resources Committee. Among the programs designed to implement the state energy policy are establishing a new emerging energy technology fund, offering small businesses loan programs and a study to consider using compressed natural gas to power Alaska vehicles. ""While we live in one of the most robust states in the U.S., average Alaskans are suffering,"" said Sen. Lesil McGuire, Senate Resources Committee. Parnell says he expects the legislation to create up to 2,000 jobs in the construction industry as energy efficient improvements are made to buildings across the state. The governor says he hopes work will be completed by 2020. All projects are expected to gain savings within 15 years."
2,There are Thousands of Innocent People in American Prisons,politics," Remember those nice phrases about American history that you were taught in school like ""Give me freedom or give me death;"" ""My freedom is not for sale:""  ""It’s better to let ten guilty men go free than one innocent man suffer?"" Well, you can forget about them because today they are not relevant. While America dictates to the world about freedom and justice, it is estimated that there are thousands of totally innocent people languishing in American prisons out of the 2.2 million or so people held there. The lawyers know it, the judges know it, the DAs know it and certainly the president knows it yet they appear not to care and certainly not to intend to do anything about it. How can this happen? Well, unless you or someone you love has been mixed up in the justice system, you probably don’t care. When you see the police arresting someone on TV does it ever enter your mind that they may have the wrong man? Of course not. You will tell all your friends something like ""Hey they caught the rapist who attacked that young girl."" A comprehensive study of 328 criminal cases over the last 15 years in which the convicted person was exonerated, suggests that there are thousands of innocent people in prison today. Samuel Gross, a University of Michigan law professor, has calculated that 2.3 percent of all prisoners sentenced to death between 1973 and 1989 have been exonerated and freed. His research suggests that the vast majority in fact did not commit the crimes and an unknown number of innocents have not yet been exonerated. So how does this happen? There are many reasons. One of the main ones is money. Without that a suspect is unable to hire the best lawyer or investigators while the prosecution has none of these restrictions. While the Constitution guarantees that ""A lawyer will be provided,"" these so-called Public Defenders often have never been to trial and their only purpose is to get the accused to plead guilty. To those in the know, they are referred to as Public Pretenders or Pubic Defenders. Then there are the ""Expert witnesses."" It is easy to get two experts to claim the exact opposites of each other if you have the funds to do so. Joyce Gilchrist was for 20 years one of those expert police chemists. Often, her testimony in 3,000 criminal cases meant the difference between innocence and guilt. A preliminary FBI investigation found that in at least five cases that ended with convictions, Gilchrist testified ""beyond the acceptable limits of forensic science"" and that Gilchrist misrepresented hair and fiber analysis in court to get convictions. Now authorities are reexamining 1,448 cases that Gilchrist worked on including 12 death penalty convictions. But in 11 cases, the defendants have already been executed -- including Marilyn Plantz, despite the recent revelations about Gilchrist’s shoddy performance. A study by Brandon Garrett, a law professor at the University of Virginia, showed that flawed or corrupt testimony by scientific ""experts"" (about hair, blood types, and the like) figured in 55 percent of false convictions. Now let’s talk about the attitude of the district attorneys who are sworn to uphold the Constitution. In actual fact, they are not concerned with truth or justice but rather with convictions.   If they can claim a high percentage of these, then they can convince the unthinking public that they are fighting crime and so get reelected. They will try to resist the reopening of cases where new evidence is presented, DNA testing or the vacation of sentences to those convicted and then found to be innocent. Entrapment. It used to be illegal for the government to set up people for arrest but not anymore. If one has ""The willingness and capability,"" he can be set up even if he had absolutely no intention of breaking the law. The DEA uses this system regularly. For instance they target someone and offer them huge sums of money if they can introduce somebody who will sell drugs to them and then convict the target of conspiracy. Informants. When someone is arrested for a crime, the government often informs them that their offense will be forgiven if they name some other people and give evidence against them. This evidence is known as ""Hearsay,"" but is now accepted in court. Doesn’t matter if the named people are completely innocent, based solely on the word of the informant, they can be arrested and convicted. Erroneous identifications. This happens most often with African Americans. Many white people will say that many blacks all look the same to them. Often, the police will give subtle hints to get their suspect identified. In investigating 209 people convicted of crimes from 1989 to 2003 who were later exonerated by DNA and other evidence, 69% were wrongly identified by witnesses. Plea bargain. In order to save the cost of a trial and ensure a conviction, the prosecutors will usually offer the accused a plea bargain. Doesn’t matter whether they are guilty or not, it will be explained to them for instance that they are facing a 20 year sentence if convicted but, if the plead guilty the prosecution will ask for two years only. Their appointed attorney will tell them that they have little hope of winning as the juries usually believe the prosecution, so they would be better off just doing the two years and forgetting it. Jurors. Most people selected for jury duty have never done it before. They are unaware of the games played by the prosecutors and also of their rights. For instance, they can find the accused not guilty in spite of the facts as,  ""The jury has the right to judge both the law as well as the fact in controversy"".( Supreme Court Chief Justice John Jay). The jurors will never hear this explained to them. False confessions. The police will use any trick to get a confession out of a suspect, regardless of the truth. Some suspects are so frightened by them that they will agree to anything just to stop the abuse, which may be physical or psychological. The above constitutes only a partial list. There are other causes eg  Lack of thorough police investigation, biased news reporting, judges favouring the prosecution, destruction of evidence. So, who benefits from this travesty of justice? The police, DEA, FBI, Immigration,  prison guards, construction workers, prison food and canteen suppliers, lawyers, judges, courtroom personnel, power companies, investigators, expert witnesses, airlines, motor vehicle department, telephone companies, to name a few….Money talks! Does anyone care? Believe it or not, some people DO care. Various organizations have been formed to attempt to extract falsely accused persons from prison. The Innocence Project, IIPPI, Truth in Justice etc. You should also care because there is a very fair possibility that this will happen to you."
3,The Regression of Secular Progression,politics," As a Jew, I find it both fascinating and alarming to watch the political/philosophical/moral debate raging in this country between the leftist secular progressives and right wing Christian fundamentalists. As most of us know, the secularists, who claim to be atheists, want all references to the Divine stricken from all public documents and monuments. As well, they want all public utterances in all forums to be devoid of any mention of spiritual matters. While they are rallying under the constitutional banner of ""separation of church and state"", the driving force behind this campaign is to make morality a non-issue. These are the beginnings of a G-dless society in which government is the ultimate authority and there are no moral restrictions on private behavior. Anything that feels good is permissible as long as you don’t force it on someone else. There must be no impediment to the pursuit of pleasure. Those who call themselves ""progressive"" would be more accurately described as ""regressive"" because as King Solomon, the wisest man that ever lived once said, ""There is nothing new under the sun."" This amoral secular regressive crowd is an interesting and dangerous group of misfits who believe that America’s support of Zionism is the root cause of hundreds of thousands of maniacal Muslims who live to spawn human bombs and perform public decapitations. Further observation of this movement reveals that the ACLU fights to protect the rights of perverts to prey on children and the members of PETA were seen protesting the genocide of Turkeys on Thanksgiving. Their leader has stated that eating a store-bought turkey is tantamount to hiring an assassin. Moreover, there is a new lobby in Washington, D.C. called the ""Church of Atheism"" that was putting forth a considerable effort to get Congress to vote G-d out of office, so to speak, by removing ""In G-d we Trust"" from all of our currency. As a matter of fact, there was a church of Atheism representative on the Fox News cable network who said ""We also have a place were we go to worship."" I wanted to ask her, ""Worship what, yourselves?"" On the other hand, the conservative fundamentalists with groups like Christian Coalition, Right to Life, Paul Revere Society, Minute Men and the like, while they are fighting the good fight to preserve morality and justice, they articulate certain subliminal ideas that I find disquieting. For example, I keep hearing from pundits like Bill O’Reilly and others that the United States is a nation founded on ""Judeo-Christian philosophy."" What exactly is ""Judeo-Christian philosophy? If they are talking about monotheism, meaning the one true G-d who controls the world; that is exclusively Judaic. Moreover, the moral and legal principles of all civilized societies are based entirely on the Seven Laws of Noah, which come solely from the Torah (referred to by Christians as the ""Old Testament""). Additionally, the principles of love, peace and foregoing revenge are also entirely derived from the G-d of Israel and expounded upon by our great Sages of blessed memory. Therefore, when it comes to morality and justice there is no ""philosophy"", there is only the foundation called ""Torah"". Furthermore, the constitutional mandate of separation of Church and State is clearly there to prevent government from imposing or opposing any particular religion; not to create a godless secular society. In keeping with that principle the framers of the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were very careful to avoid making any references to any particular religion. They simply recognized the one true G-d as the ultimate authority to whom all government leaders are forever answerable. Thus, it would be inaccurate to say that the United States of America is a ""Christian society"" even though a majority of its citizens are Christians. To sum up, the connection between G-d and the nation chosen to live in compliance with His law and serve as an example to all others, is symbolized by the famous ""Jacob’s Ladder"". We learn that when our father Jacob awoke from his vision, he called the land upon which he slept, ""The gateway to Heaven"". Although the focal point was the future place of the inner chamber of the Holy Temple, this was also equivalent to the entire land of Israel. The ladder, i.e. two poles linked by rungs, being a symbol of the conduit through this gateway that connects the Land and its people to HaShem, begs the question, ""Why not a staircase?"" The simple answer is that a ladder is more difficult to ascend. The higher you go the more you need to rely on others to hold it steady and the more careful you need to be to keep from falling off."
4,Gen. Stanley McChrystal-Hard Questions,politics," Gen. Stanley McChrystal is in the news. He just resigned, or was sacked for Petraeus. We all know that. What bothers me is not the fact that he was 'loose lipped.' Or any of that. That's rhetoric. What bothers me is what he said. And to who he said it. And the fact that he had to say it in the first place. I know, I do not speak for myself alone when I say: Military life is different. It's a whole different head set. It's a culture. Military is military. Period. I spent most of my adult life in uniform, whether as a reserve officer in the Israeli army, on active duty during the entire Gulf War, or a full-time enlisted officer in the Israeli Prison Service for over thirteen years. Bottom line is: People in the military and law-enforcement are putting their necks on the line, daily. They are in life-threatening situations. And they are there to defend the people back home. That's us. There was one rule we always had in the military—you speak your mind. Staff meetings were daily, every morning. We went around the table, in organized fashion, for turns to report.  Each officer had his or her chance to speak his or her opinion. To make his or her case. To ask for whatever he or she needed. When the meetings were over, it was summed up by the commanding officer. He or she gave their decision for action. At any given time, we had a chance to object. It could be spirited. If our opinion was overruled, we could write in. We could even bypass our commander, and have our objections seen by our commander's superiors. One thing was always clear—you could speak your mind. Gen. Stanley McChrystal had a lot to say in that now famous interview. There is no need to repeat them, here, they're all online. He expressed bitterness. He expressed extreme discomfort with the competence of those 'running' the war back home. We've all read what he said. Brushing him aside is a diversion from the substantial questions. Here are the real questions: Why did Gen. Stanley McChrystal need to say what he said in the first place? This is a man seeing his underlings die for this country. He felt no one back home was listening. What brought a man busy leading a war to have to express these feelings in the first instance? Why did a military man feel that level of being alone that he needed to express himself through a magazine interview? There is supposed to be a chain of command, and an extremely open line of communication. Where was that?! What will change in the modus operandi now that he's been swept aside? Our soldiers are putting themselves in harms way, to put it mildly, or to put it more succinctly many are dying to keep us safe. Sweeping this General aside is nice headlines, and makes a nice photo op. But, will any of the causes which brought him to that interview now change? Our country is at war, one we did not wish for. Our military men and women need to know the above answers. They deserve to know them. And they deserve all this: Now.

5,Public Request for Changing the Draft Welsh Language Law,politics," A group consisting of 14 different organisations has come together to publish an open letter to have changes made to the draft Welsh language law. The group wishing to make changes to the Welsh language law include Wales' own teachers' union (Undeb Cenedlaethol Athrawon Cymru), language expert professor Colin Williams, the women’s voluntary group Merched y Wawr, as well as the Friends of the Earth Cymru. The open letter was addressed to the current Heritage Minister Alum Ffred Jones. In the letter, the group complained that the Welsh national language is facing threats from many directions. They are asking the Welsh government to make changes to the draft Welsh language law so that it delivers an unambiguous statement that the Welsh language is the official language in Wales. The proposed new language law was published by the assembly government back in March 2010. The Welsh language law is drafted in such a way that it places certain duties on some businesses to provide their services in the Welsh language if the service is provided in Wales. Businesses most likely to be affected are telecommunication providers, gas suppliers and electricity providers. Under the new language law, these companies will face sanctions such as fines if they fail to meet the required standard of language service delivery. The proposed law will also scrap the existing Welsh Language Board and replace it with the post of a Welsh Language Commissioner. Although the Assembly government has made clear that the law is still in its drafting stage, it has attracted a lot of criticism from local academics arguing that the Welsh language is going to be marginalised under the new rules. Their main argument stems from the fact that the proposed law does not create a clear linguistic rights or any statement that pronounces the Welsh language as the official language of Wales. Furthermore, the new post of Welsh Language Commissioner is not independent because the commissioner is accountable to the government. The 14 organisations’ open letter is also hugely influenced by a series of events that have taken place over the past few years.  First, the cutting of budget on S4C, the Welsh television channel that broadcasts from the capital Cardiff. Secondly, the Assembly government stopping its translation service from English to Welsh for all its record of proceedings. Thirdly, Welsh medium education in the capital city Cardiff is limited. Fourthly, Bethan Wyn Jones, a patient who was told that her consent for endoscopy was not valid because it was signed in Welsh language form. The doctor told her that she must sign the English form in order to be valid and legal. Therefore, Welsh language lobbyists are outraged by the fact that the Welsh language is perceived by doctors to be unofficial. In fact, the Welsh form is as legal as any English form would be. The group perceives these events as a series of threats to the very survival of Welsh language. So, the Welsh Assembly now has their work cut out before them to ensure that their constituents are going to be happy on the next revision of the language law draft."
6,British Ex-Minister Says French Is a Useless Language,politics," ""Unless we have sufficient numbers of people who speak modern foreign languages - and not just the useless modern foreign languages like French"" said British Minister Chris Bryant. With the changing world we live in, is this a reasonable point of view? The former British Foreign Office Minister, Chris Bryant, has told the media that French is a ‘useless’ language to be learnt by any young people. Instead, he is a strong supporter for the younger generation to immerse themselves in the study of Mandarin Chinese and Arabic languages. The former Minister said that Mandarin Chinese and Arabic languages are going to be the more important languages in the world in the foreseeable future compared to the French language. The words straight from the horse’s mouth: ""Unless we have sufficient numbers of people who speak modern foreign languages - and not just the useless modern foreign languages like French"". Bryant’s statement has raised quite a few eyebrows and some even said that the ex-minister was running a risk of insulting the neighbouring country. However, Bryant defended his position strongly by drawing from his first hand experience while he was the Minister for Europe under the previous Labour Government. He replied, ""I've said this to the French. I think they realise there are problems"". What the ex-minister is essentially saying is that French is no longer seen as the key diplomatic language that it used to be. In fact, the paradigm has shifted since 30 years ago. He urges the UK government to put more effort in introducing new foreign languages to the younger generations. Bryant’s recommendation should come as no surprise to the academics because research published earlier this year have seen the popularity of European languages (in particular French) had fallen dramatically amongst secondary school students. The report showed that less than 50 percent of secondary pupils are gaining a good GCSE grade in their European languages. He pointed out that the government got it wrong previously and now less people in the UK are learning foreign languages. Based on his experience in the Foreign Office, he stated, ""the number of people who spoke foreign languages has diminished, and the number who can confidently speak them is pretty low."" Bryant added, ""my biggest concern is that the effortless British superiority with which we stride around the economic world means that all too often we are the only country that presents business people in other countries who do not speak even the rudiments of a foreign language. That is a big problem."" As China is becoming one of the world super powers, it is only natural that the business world also starts to embrace the skill to communicate in Mandarin Chinese. On the other hand, the Arabic countries are an extremely difficult market to penetrate if one does not know the native language. Furthermore, the emerging markets in South America will also see a rise in demand for Portuguese and Spanish speakers within businesses. These are some of the factors that influence the former Minister to come to the following conclusion, ""the most useful languages to speak at present are Mandarin, and Spanish and Portuguese because of Latin America, and we need to focus on Arabic as well"". It is never too late to start, if that is what you are thinking. Indeed, you are right. Learning a new language and able to speak it fluently is going to be a great asset for future career prospect. We all got to start somewhere so make it a point to start now."
7,Book Review: General James Longstreet: The Confederacy's Most Modern General by Lieutenant Colonel Harold M. Knudsen,politics," I'm a novice when it comes to Civil War history. I get lost in the details of the major military campaigns of the war, much less the smaller skirmishes, and even the geography at times. My interest in the Confederacy relates to my ancestry and my interest in Confederate currency. I had three great grandfathers and three great uncles who served in the war. During a recent meeting of our Sons of Confederate Veterans Camp, Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Harold Knudsen of the US Army was our guest speaker. LTC Knudsen is the author of the book, ""General James Longstreet: The Confederacy's Most Modern General."" I had no idea of who General Longstreet was and, at the time, really didn't care all that much. After all, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson were my heroes. However, Knudsen quickly captured my attention as it became apparent that the legacy of James Longstreet had been swept under the rug by the philosophy of political correctness. I was so enthralled by Knudsen's lecture; I was the first person at his book table to purchase a hardbound copy of his book. LTC Knudsen's book is small and is less than one hundred pages. It is tiny in comparison to the monolithic volumes that exist on Lee and Jackson and other figures. I have in times past started to read some of those exhaustive works on the Civil War and its heroes, but have rarely completed any. It seems I would get bogged down in what would seem to be the endless battles and forever lost in the explanations of force movements, placement of batteries, flanking maneuvers and all the minutiae of military speak. Even though Knudsen is militaryesque in his writing, he is succinct and keeps the reader's attention. At one point I asked myself, where are the maps? However, I soon realized his descriptions do not require maps. Actually, I believe maps would have been a distraction. Knudsen makes the case that General Longstreet has not only been misjudged by history, but actually was one of the most successful generals of the war. He subtitles his book ""The Confederacy's Most Modern General"" and indeed it appeares Longstreet was. Longstreet broke with the Napoleonic practices of warfare and introduced innovations that had not been seen in nineteenth century warfare. Not until recently has Longstreet's reputation begun a slow re-examination. In fact, it wasn't until 1998 that the first monument to honor him was erected at Gettysburg. James Longstreet was a South Carolina-born West Point graduate who was raised on a Georgia plantation. He received his first combat experience at age twenty four as the US began its war with Mexico. At age forty, he accepted a commission as a Confederate colonel with the Army of Northern Virginia at the start of the Civil War in 1861. Biographers of the post war era stated Longstreet was smart and ambitious but also a ""know it all."" They turned against him for rejecting the ideology of the ""Lost Cause."" Indeed, Longstreet was not a politically correct person, and according to the author, considered political correctness a form of dishonesty. Longstreet wasn't interested in political debate and didn't engage on the causes of the war, but instead excelled in the art of war. His view was simple: once war was decided to be the course of action; his goal was to win it. It was at the Battle of Fredericksburg in 1862 that Longstreet carried out an effective and deadly approach to stopping a Union frontal assault. He merged firearm advancements with field modifications that Knudsen claims were fifty years ahead of its time. Longstreet combined discipline, low aiming, and clear lanes of fire, with one to two rifle loaders for each shooter. This produced an increased rate of fire equivalent to a machine gun in World War I. Knudsen offers a chapter on the ""defensive offense"" and a chapter on the vindication of Longstreet's strategic vision. It was the Battle of Chickamauga that gave Longstreet the opportunity to attack and set conditions for decisive victories. It was here that Knudsen believes Longstreet introduced a tactic similar to what the Germans used in their tank warfare in World War II, i.e., the Blitzkrieg theory. Knudsen leaves the reader with the notion that if Longstreet had been in charge of the forces at the Battle of Chickamauga instead of General Braxton Bragg, the Union Army would have been soundly defeated. Knudsen does not discuss Longstreet's post military career, other than mentioning his involvement with the passage of military reconstruction bills in Congress. However, that only fueled my curiosity in wanting to do more research on the general. My research uncovered that Longstreet enjoyed a career working for the U.S. Government and he was a convert to the Republican Party. Combining this with his support for reconstruction and some critical comments he wrote about General Robert E. Lee, he inflamed his detractors and distanced himself from his Confederate colleagues. Portions of Knudsen's conclusion were steeped with a good bit of military strategic lingo which required me to read it twice to obtain a good comprehension. Knudsen's background in military command structure and control is very evident as he knows his stuff. However, parts of the final chapter sometimes leave the reader with a feeling he is at a military academy receiving a briefing on military policy and doctrine. All in all, I believe his book is long overdue and it deserves a place on your bookshelf. You won't be disappointed."
8,Compulsory English Language Proficiency Exam for Immigrants Outside Of EU,politics," Immigrants originating from outside the European Union will now have to take the compulsory English Language Proficiency Exam, introduced by the Coalition Government The newly elected Conservative Liberal Democrat coalition government has made it a point to stop immigrants with poor English to come into the UK. Under the new rules, any immigrants originating from outside of the European Union will have to take a compulsory English language proficiency exam. Non-EU immigrants who married British citizens and would like to move to the UK are not spared either. They are also required to take the same English test. Some experts said that the problem stems from the overpopulation of London, and further increase in immigration will devastate the City in terms of accommodation, sanitary, transportation, and basic amenities. Although the previous Labour government also proposed the same test regime to be introduced in year 2011, it is now estimated that the new English proficiency test system will be brought forward one year. The current government has said that it is keen to push on with this new requirement and would want the system to kick in as soon as possible. This was one of the Conservative party’s manifestos prior to the 2010 election when David Cameron said that the immigration rate is too high and pledged to take swift action to slash the numbers. The compulsory English proficiency test will set a minimum standard on communication skills expected of all non-EU migrants. The Home office will roll out requirements for all non-EU citizens to take the test when applying for UK visa. Theresa May, Britain’s Home Secretary told the media that the ability to speak English is a pre-requisite for anyone who wants to stay in the UK in the future. The proficiency in English will ensure that all new immigrants are able to integrate into society without any problems. The Home Secretary said that the first step is to toughen up the requirement of English test across the UK visa application system. Secondly, the government will want to put a limit on the numbers of work visas as well as student visas being issued each year. New Rules Apply to Non EU Immigrants Already Living in UK The new test regime is not only limited to new immigration applicants outside of the European Union; it also applies to those fiancées, spouses, or unmarried couples who are already residing in the UK.  The government said that the new system aims to promote integration, water down cultural differences and protect public services. However, the government has not revealed whether the applicants will have to pay an extra fee to take the test. Critics said the new test system in reality, is aiming at Asian immigrants especially those from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and China. We have seen a huge influx from these countries in recent years while other EU migrants are also coming to the UK. However, the UK government has to adhere to the EU policy of freedom movement of workers and therefore, the only way to slash population increment is on non-EU immigration."
9,The Role of State Governments in Preventing Medical Errors,politics," On August 7, 2008, the Chicago Tribune posted a blog entitled ""Illinois ponders how to treat medical errors"" (chicagotribune.com). It was a scathing commentary on the lackluster performance of the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services in protecting the state’s residents against medical mistakes, wanton neglect, incompetence, abuse and callous disregard of patients’ safety and well-being that runs rampant in hospitals and nursing homes across the State of Illinois and America. The reporter, Judith Graham quoted the Health Department spokesperson, who said, ""We’re still in the very preliminary stages and it’ll probably be a while until we make a decision."" This shameful public display of indecisiveness and indifference from the state’s bureaucrats unfortunately reflects the attitude of the leadership in the governor’s mansion toward public safety. While I applauded Ms. Graham for bringing this travesty to light, I must respectfully admonish her for grossly understating the problem. Since the Federal Government, through the Institute of Medicine (IOM), made public the fact that hospitals were needlessly killing more than 100,000 people per year in 1999, actions taken that proved ineffective were as follows: 1.Hospital executives hired consultants to study the root causes of medical errors and make recommendations for prevention; 2.State legislators passed laws requiring full disclosure of medical errors; 3.State legislators passed laws requiring that health care workers take a one-time 2-hour course in the prevention of medical errors for licensure or registration renewal; Moreover, to make matters worse, some thirty states, including Florida passed laws creating roadblocks to finding legal representation to prosecute medical malpractice by cutting the contingency fees that lawyers may charge by at least two thirds. These new statutes completely undermined the whole concept of health care provider accountability. Then, of course it was no big surprise to find out that a private organization called Healthgrades, Inc had, in June of 2004, published estimates of more than two hundred thousand unnecessary hospital deaths per year and brought out the fact that hospitals across the board inadvertently kill 1 out of every 500 people admitted. Moreover, these statistics did not count the 192,000 reported annual deaths due to hospital-acquired infections. Now, we have federal and state governments taking unilateral actions to deny payment for services arising out of ""never events"", which are acts of gross negligence by omission or commission. While the jury is still out on these new fiscal tightening policies, we have yet to find even one lawmaker who will give a single thought to enforcing health codes, truth in advertising laws, statutory standards of care and fiscal responsibility regulations. Lawmakers and health authorities have yet to realize that in cases of flagrant violation of patient safety standards, they need to put those corporate criminals in jail where they can no longer perpetrate their wanton and callous disregard for human life. On the other hand, notwithstanding that the great State of Illinois is now just beginning to look at the problem of medical negligence being the fifth leading cause of death in the United States, the rest of the ""more aggressive states"" are simply denying payment for treatment of untoward complications, without any system for adjudicating accountability. This will cause a serious delay in the payment of hospital bills and further undermined the financial integrity of an entire industry that is already strapped for cash. Hospitals will inevitably challenge most of the payment denials based on claiming that the complication in question was the result of the disease process and not attributable to the ever-expanding list of ""never events"". This situation will also cause an additional financial burden with attorneys’ fees and the processing of tens of thousands of new denial of claim challenges. For the solution, it all boils down to holding individual members of the institutional controlling bodies accountable for deliberate decisions that place people’s lives in jeopardy, either civilly, criminally or both as the case may be. There also needs to be licensure for key positions in hospital management to ensure that those in charge are sufficiently knowledgeable as to how operate within acceptable standards of care."
10,How political agendas are influenced by lobbyists,politics," The term lobbyist refers to the people hired by groups or organizations with particular interests to convince members of Congress to pass or defeat legislation. Lobbyists may work on the behalf of different groups such as, business corporations, labor unions, executive branch agencies, foreign governments, or private or public interest groups. All these groups spend billions of dollars every year to gain access to lawmakers and try hard to influence their view on any political agenda. To clip the wings of lobbyists is a big issue in every democratic forum. Some people think that the lobbyists are victimized with prejudice. They argue that it is impossible to prevent lobbying without abolishing the First Amendment, which provides Americans, even those who are paid to do it, the right to ‘petition the US government for a redress of objections raised by them.’ They even went to the extent that the government will be helpless in carrying out business effectively in the absence of lobbyist. Although, the statement may not be altogether false but during all this they fail to observe that the failure to produce legislation in the public interest stems from the existence of lobbyists in the corridors of power. In the run up to the presidential election both Democratic Party candidate Barrack Obama and Republican Party nominee John McCain said that their campaign will not accept contributions from lobbyists. But that is hardly the truth. It's only a matter of time until someone calls for a law that makes it mandatory for every lobbyist in Washington to paint a big, ‘L’ on his forehead. You cannot rule out the presence of lobbyists in the both the major political parties Democratic and Republican. For a moment, if we discard away the conservative view then lobbying is as American as apple pie, which goes back to colonial times. The Rev. Increase Mather lobbied UK to get a new charter for Massachusetts. Benjamin Franklin is being referred by some of the intellectuals as the colonial lobbyist for Pennsylvania and other colonies. When the federal government came into power, lobbyists swarmed to Washington to safeguard the interest of their clients. Lobbyists are always in the news online. From the sources in the Democratic Party, media came to know that healthcare, carbon-emission, and tax changes legislation has faced heavy lobbying. A few section of the conservative democrat feels nothing wrong in it. They argue that whenever Congress tries to enact a law and the executive branch writes regulations---citizens whose lives are going to be affected by those words will try to modify it in their interest. To serve their purpose they hire the best people in the power corridors of Washington who can employ their connections and expertise to safeguard their interest. They can help the decision makers in the government to understand how the words they write will affect US citizens. In a nutshell, lobbying simply means if you have the cash in your pocket then you can influence governmental decisions, this is not even democratic. It is a form of corruption indeed! Still no government does anything about it, because they use lobbyists during the polls."
11,BP Oil Spill Astrology Analysis,politics," There has been no shortage of grief and tragedy linked to what may already be the greatest environmental catastrophe in US history. BP started the ""top kill"" operations to stop the flow of oil on May 26th, 2010, but the operation did not overcome the flow from the well. The spill could produce mass casualties and steep decline of wild life populations in the coming weeks, months and years. The situation in the Gulf is unprecedented for wildlife in terms of magnitude and numbers of species involved. Astrologically I have seen over my 20 years of experience as an Astrologer in Indian Astrology / Vedic Astrology, if a good or bad event happens in a family, there will be a clear indication of that event in the astrology chart of the head of the household. If a Company or an Organization goes through a good or bad time financially, there will be a clear indication in the astrology chart of the CEO of that company.  In a similar manner if a country goes through a good or bad time there will be clear indications of that good or bad time in the astrology chart of the President of the country. The day 9/11 happened I immediately opened the astrology chart of President Bush, and studied the planetary configuration at that particular moment. I found a very difficult and challenging time for President Bush. Now this greatest environmental catastrophe happened in the US history, and as an Astrologer I can see it coming from the President Obama’s astrology chart. According to Indian Astrology / Vedic Astrology President Obama is a Capricorn ascendant with ascendant at 21 degrees 56 minutes. The Lord of Ascendant, and 2nd house of speech & money Saturn (2 degrees 06 minutes) is in 12th house in Capricorn sign with 12th lord Jupiter (7 degrees 38 minutes), According to Vedic Astrology at present President Obama is going through Jupiter Mahadasha and Rahu bhukti. Jupiter is the ruler of 12th house in President Obama’s chart. Transit Jupiter entered Pisces sign (a watery sign) on May 1st, 2010, and came directly opposite transit Saturn in Virgo.  Transit Mars entered Leo sign on May 25th, 2010, and is also aspecting transit Jupiter in Pisces by its 8th aspect. Transit Jupiter is badly aspected both by transit Saturn and transit Mars at this time. Mars is a badhaka planet for President Obama. This clearly indicates a difficult and challenging period for President Obama, and the problem is related with Oil spill in the sea because Jupiter is the lord of Pisces, a watery sign, and at present transit Jupiter is transiting a water sign that is Pisces, and came directly opposite transit Saturn. The wild life population in the sea is represented by Jupiter because Jupiter rules the watery sign Pisces.  The casualties of wild life population are happening because transit Jupiter is transiting a watery sign and came directly opposite transit Saturn. Transit Jupiter will go retrograde in third week of July this year, and will come opposite transit Saturn in August, 2010 again. So in my opinion the Oil spill problem will not be fixed at least until first week of September 2010. So the period until first week of September is not a good period for President Obama.

12,McGuire works to strengthen Alaska's economy,politics," Alaskans want to live and work where energy is reliable and affordable. That is why we crafted the Alaska Sustainable Energy Act, which passed unanimously on the last day of the legislative session. This bipartisan legislation will pave the way for lower energy costs, greater energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy in Alaska. It will help Alaska families, businesses, schools and communities cut their costs and find more sustainable ways of meeting their energy needs. The act includes a broad range of policy tools designed to stimulate the economy and improve Alaskans' standard of living. They include: A new energy efficiency revolving loan fund: School districts, municipalities, state agencies and the University of Alaska will have access to low-interest loans to upgrade their facilities. Based on observations of the state's Weatherization and Home Energy Rebate programs, this fund will likely foster 1,500 to 2,000 jobs in the construction industry in Alaska. It will also save millions of dollars annually in heating and lighting costs around the state. Help for Alaska families when fuel prices soar: The act links benefits from the state's Heating Assistance Program to the price of oil, providing additional assistance to families when fuel prices are high, Alaskans need help the most, and the state enjoys a significant surplus. This program is a supplement to the federal Low-Income Heating Assistance Program, which benefits families in every Alaska community. Loans for Alaska businesses: The act revitalizes a dormant alternative energy loan fund within the Department of Commerce and Economic Development. The new program will provide loans of up to $50,000 to businesses for energy efficiency and alternative energy upgrades, enabling them to become more profitable and competitive. Educating Alaskans on low-cost ways to save energy: The act provides new authority to the Alaska Energy Authority to promote energy conservation, energy efficiency and alternative energy through training and public education. The state plans to kick off a public education campaign in the coming year with the goal of helping Alaskans cut their energy bills by taking simple, affordable steps, such as caulking windows and weatherstripping doors. ADVERTISEMENT Emerging energy technology fund: With the high cost of energy in many of our communities, Alaska provides a unique opportunity for innovation. The Alaska Sustainable Energy Act creates a fund that will provide grants for testing energy technologies in Alaska. This fund will foster innovation and enable Alaskans to develop solutions to our energy challenges, creating high-tech jobs and spurring investment in our economy. Coordinating and consolidating state energy programs: The act tasks the governor with evaluating how best to coordinate the state's energy departments and programs in order to avoid duplication and make it easier for the public to access state services, such as weatherization and heating assistance. The governor is directed to provide recommendations to the Legislature by January 2011. Leading by example: The act requires the state to retrofit at least 25 percent of the largest state buildings by 2020 to reduce energy costs. The Department of Transportation and Public Facilities has already begun to upgrade those buildings most in need. While annual saving for the first eight buildings was expected to be $278,000 a year, savings have averaged $497,000, making this new requirement a significant money-saver for the state. By retrofitting additional buildings, an estimated $2.5 million could be saved each year, money better spent on meeting critical needs. Energy is the keystone of our economy and the foundation of our modern life. We were pleased that Democrats and Republicans alike from both the House and the Senate came together this session to pass such substantial legislation. Alaskans contend with some of the highest energy costs in the nation. The Alaska Sustainable Energy Act will help ease that burden and move us toward greater energy independence and sustainability.

13,Brief historical review of the Colombian emeralds,politics," Emeralds have a fairly old historic home, experts do not know for sure where they come from many of the emeralds belonging to the great treasure of antiquity. This is especially true for a type of gems with which Indian merchants traded around the world since the seventeenth century. It was thought that the mines of Egypt, operated by the pharaohs between 3000 and 1500 BC, and those of Habachtal in Austria, discovered by the Celts, were the only sources of emeralds in the ancient world until 1545, when the Spanish conquistadors took possession of the Colombian mines. From these holdings by the Spanish, Colombian emeralds everyone arrived and were recognized as the highest quality emeralds in the world Emerald extraction dates back over 3,000 years ago, at the time of the Old Kingdom of Egypt. The ""green fire"" was so fascinating that Spanish conquistadors carried out a bloody campaign to discover the location of the emerald mines in South America. In 1557, the campaign finally ended with the discovery of the spectacular Muzo mines, and Coscuez Chivor, located in our country. In Colombia, the emeralds are so important that founded the first museum of the emerald. The objective is to create the Museum of Esmeraldas is to disseminate and publicize the whole culture of the emerald which little is known Colombians, that is valued most, or at least that is known as the second largest export product Colombia important after coffee. It is show and tell people how, for instance, the gem for thousands of years served to exchange it for women like Cleopatra and the Kings appreciated that transmitting energy mineral because it produced a sense of tranquility and inner peace. Here our Indians and traded emeralds Somondocon salt or livestock. In other words, the emeralds were used as barter trade, even as at present but with the difference that is bought and sold simply because a value that can be thousands or millions of dollars for one of those stones. Seeing the importance and beauty of the emeralds we may assume that acquiring them is only for millionaires or that these Colombian emeralds can only be purchased at major retailers in the world, but now with the help of the internet where we have everything on hand we can Colombian emeralds found loose in several places on the Internet, where we directly from Colombia. All this added to the price of emeralds is very varied and can be found in various sizes and prices, all with the assurance that it will acquire genuine emeralds from Colombia, the country with the best emeralds in the world. For all this is a good option when buying Colombian emeralds accessing the Internet and choose the best option."
14,China’s Navy an Emerging Global Force,politics," While still a long way off from challenging the United States as the predominant world naval power, China’s modernized People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is beginning to take a more assertive role in an expanding theater of operations. Previously content on patrolling coastal waters and preparing for an armed conflict with Taiwan, China now has a naval presence all along commercial sea routes to the Middle East and has stepped up military operations in the contested waters of the East and South China Seas. On April 10, a Chinese flotilla of 10 destroyers, frigates, and submarines from the East Sea Fleet, based in Ningbo, travelled through Japan’s Miyako Straight on to the Pacific to conduct open ocean military exercises. A few days earlier, China’s North Sea Fleet, based in Qingdao, passed through the Bashi Straight between the Philippines and Taiwan to do similar military exercises in the South China Sea. The PLA Navy’s recent operations in the region have troubled China’s coastal and island neighbors, with Japan’s government particularly irked by the proximity of the maneuvers to Japanese territory. Chinese President Hu Jintao met with Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama during the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington on April 13, assuring him that China’s intentions in the East China Sea are to turn the region into an area of peace, friendship, and cooperation. ""China does not hold an intention to challenge the U.S. in the central Pacific or engage in a military clash with Japan in close waters, though it is willing to protect its core interests at any cost,"" China’s state-owned Global Times printed today in an attempt to comfort the world. The problem with the statement is that China has expanded what it defines as its ""core interests."" Beijing has previously reserved the term for areas such as Tibet and Taiwan, but now places its territorial claims in the South China Sea under the ""core interest"" category, according to the New York Times. Beijing may find its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, take issue with that statement. U.S. officials in Washington are also fretting over the implications of a growing Chinese presence in the Middle East. In March, two Chinese frigates made port in the United Arab Emirates’ capital of Abu Dhabi; the first time in modern history that a PLAN vessel has docked in the Middle East. Beijing also committed three warships to the Gulf of Aden in December 2008 to aid with international antipiracy efforts; the first time in modern history Chinese naval forces have been deployed beyond the Pacific Ocean. Quantitatively, China and the United States are already on a similar playing field. A 2009 Pentagon report estimated the number of active Chinese naval vessels at 260, including 75 major warships and more than 60 submarines, compared to the U.S. Navy’s 286 active vessels. Qualitatively, though, China’s navy remains decades behind that of the United States.  Ten of the American Navy’s 286 active vessels are Nimitz-class nuclear powered supercarriers – each one capable of operating continuously for up to 20 years without refueling while holding up to 90 aircraft and 5,600 personnel. In contrast, China doesn’t have any aircraft carriers, and although Beijing has revealed that it will complete the first Chinese carrier within the next few years, the United States will surely belittle that accomplishment when it launches the new Ford-class supercarrier in 2015. China’s official military budget for 2009 stood at US$70.3 billion, good for second highest in the world, but the Pentagon estimates that China’s military spending last year was in the range of US$105 billion to US$150 billion. Whichever figure you use, it pales in comparison to the roughly US$533.8 billion proposed by U.S. President Obama for 2010. That translates into an expensive long-term battle for China if it wants to challenge America’s global military presence in the 21st Century."
15,Hold the Phone Mabel … Obama Facing Treason Trial,politics," Yikes!  I have seen and heard a lot of stuff over the last 50+ years of my life, but who would have thought that the good old USA, America the Beautiful would be led by a CIA operative that assisted Al Qaeda, the same terrorists that have slaughtered so many of our innocent citizens? This is really tough for me to get my head around, but I just watched the videos from the Honorable James David Manning's youtube channel about the life and times of Barack Hussein ""The Long Legged Mac Daddy"" Obama.  His answer is that Barack Hussein Obama was really working for the CIA for many years. Hold the phone Mabel! OK, so I thought I'd do some digging of my own and it seems that Pastor Manning is could be pretty much right on the money.  No one remembers the ""star"" pupil of Columbia University.  The only two people who would admit to knowing him during his ""Columbia"" days are a Pakistani friend, Sohale Siddiqi (former coke addict) and ""roommate"" Phil Boerner who roomed with him one semester while in New York in an unheated apartment.  These sure aren't warm, fuzzy memories.  Scheesch …I don't know, but if I became famous … maybe won the lottery or became President of the most Powerful Nation in the world ... I think all sorts of folks would be turning up from my past claiming that we were long lost buds.   I'm certainly not famous, but even I could come up with a few of the names of friends from those lazy, crazy college times! I have often wondered about the ""lost episodes"" of Obama's life.  The Democrats seemed to turn a blind eye to these lapses during the presidential race claiming that change was more important than what we might change to.  Personally, I think rooting around in a Cracker Jack's box looking for the prize might have been a better approach.  What about his trip to Pakistan?   Visiting friends, sure a great place to visit while the country was under martial law!  How about being a ""C"" student at Occidental College and then not only being admitted to Harvard Law School, but having the funds to pay for it? Why not! We could also go into the small item of the ""birth certificate"" and all sorts of other oddities, but hey, why beat a dead horse, huh? Perhaps this trial will finally let the American public in on a few of the deep dark ""CIA"" secrets and answer some of these previously unanswered questions … or maybe not. The Honorable David James Manning stated the treason trial again Barack Hussein Obama is scheduled for May 2010 … I know that I'll be sitting front row, on the edge of my chair waiting to see what dog and ponies President Obama strut's out for this affair. If nothing else, it will give the American public more to scratch their heads over and me more to write about … LOL! PS. BTW be sure to watch the youtube videos if you get a chance"
16,The Relevance Of Political News In Today's World,politics," In order to understand what political news is all about, it is first necessary to define the two words in the phrase. ""Politics"", as we generally use it, refers to civil governance and the various strategies involved in formulating and executing policies. However, in its simplest form, politics is the process through which power is acquired and maintained, and collective decisions are made by a group of people. The term ""news"" refers to the sharing of information related to current events. Political news, therefore, involves the aggregation, redaction, and dissemination of information regarding the current state of politics. Significance Of Political News: In the times of today, global trade has assumed such massive proportions that countries are more interlinked than ever before. Any event affecting one country can have far-reaching consequences on several other nations. Technological advancement has allowed the vast expanse of the world to be traversed in mere hours. This means that events affecting human life are no longer confined by geographical boundaries. Problems concerning terrorism can easily spread from one country to another. A ballistic missile can be directed from one corner of the world to another. In such a scenario, world political coverage assumes significance as the dynamics of power and relationships between countries keep changing. With the affairs of nations being so completed, the policies and decisions of one country can inevitably affect others too. Consequently, the political happenings in one nation can be of great concern to several others. Thus, political news plays a vital role in inter-country relationships. This news is especially vital to the existence of modern-day democratic society. In order for governance ""of the people, by the people,"" to be possible, it is essential that the public be aware of the current happenings in their state politics. Reporting this information is the role of the news media outlets. Mediums Of Political News And Media Responsibility: ""News media"" refers the various forms of information transfer and distribution. This collectively includes print (newspapers or magazines), television, radio, and online news portals. The process of gathering and reporting of news has come a long way from its primitive beginnings. Several advanced media of communication now exist that make it possible to share and transmit information all around the world at the click of a button. These channels of communication have improved the outreach of news, making it more readily accessible to the masses. The emergence of Internet has further taken reporting to the next level, providing a system of information sharing that can be contributed to by millions of people. However, all this comes with grave social responsibility. The immense power of broadcasting to millions must be handled carefully. Care must be taken that there is no misrepresentation of facts. Even more critically, media morals must be in place to ensure that disinformation (deliberately wrong information to mislead people) is never publicized. The press is socially obliged to avoid spreading material depicting gratuitous violence, and inciting religious, racial, or ethnic hatred. In summary, political news is a vital agent influencing the course of complex international relationships. It is the duty of the media to provide unbiased, accurate, truthful and fair reportage."
17,Failure to Act by the Kentucky House of Representatives Leaves Hundreds of Kentucky HIV/AIDS Patients with an Uncertain Future,politics," In a proposed commonwealth budget that allocates over $3.4 billion for road projects, a small request of $3.5 million to fund the Kentucky AIDS Drug Assistance Program (KADAP) has been ignored, leaving hundreds living with HIV/AIDS facing difficult choices. The cost for HIV/AIDS medication averages around $1,200/month--more than the entire monthly income of most families enrolled in KADAP. ""We've heard stories from people seeking out second mortgages to pay for their meds,"" say Kentucky Equality Federation President Jordan Palmer and Kentucky HIV/AIDS Advocacy Action Group (KHAAG) President Bobby Edelen. ""One person who approached us said, 'with the uncertainty of receiving assistance I am thinking about selling off my life insurance policy' to afford life-sustaining medications. We're back to the 80s."" The nearly 1300 patients enrolled in KADAP, which is currently unfunded, receive medications through a hodge-podge of resources that are temporary and unsustainable. In the meantime, Kentucky has the longest waiting list in the nation for drug assistance--numbering over 160 men and women--with more being added every day. ""When do we come off the waiting list?"" asked one HIV/AIDS patient, ""When we die?"" People with HIV/AIDS who do not have access to medications are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, more frequent hospitalization (often under indigent status), and early death. In contrast, a person who is taking HIV medications as prescribed and taking care of their health can reasonably expect to live as long as someone without HIV. ""Not funding the Kentucky AIDS Drug Assistance Program is inhumane, shortsighted, and threatens individual and public health,"" states Palmer, who met with lawmakers six times during the legislative session trying to get KADAP restored. Palmer held several meetings with Representative Tom Burch, Chairman of the House Health and Welfare Committee, DeeAnn Mansfield, Staff Administrator, House Health and Welfare Committee for the Legislative Research Commission, and Representative Jimmie Lee, Chairman of the House Budget Subcommittee on Human Resources. On February 17, Edelen met with House Representatives to discuss the state of KADAP and other factors causing health care disparities in those living with HIV/AIDS. ""Chairman Tom Burch, a champion for the cause of health equity, asked some very astute questions,"" noted Edelen."" In those questions, he demonstrated his support for re-funding KADAP and willingness to work on some measures to eradicate the waiting list. However, the House Appropriation and Revenue Committee did not seem willing."" As the commonwealth's budget makes its way through the Senate, time is running out for those who depend on KADAP for their medication. The following is excerpted from a statement of opinion issued by the Board of Directors of AIDS Volunteers of Lexington (AVOL): ""Given the larger financial crisis facing the Commonwealth, this may seem a specific and 'special interest' concern. The impact, however, is far reaching. Individuals with HIV/AIDS are mothers and fathers, family providers, valued employees, consumers, and citizens. Lack of access to medication will result in more work missed, a greater strain on social service organizations as families are forced into poverty and homelessness, a burden on medical facilities who must write off astronomically expensive HIV/AIDS hospital care to indigent and low income people, plus further disenfranchisement of those Kentuckians already at highest risk. Inasmuch as the commonwealth is feeling the challenges of the current economic climate, low-income individuals and families living with HIV/AIDS are losing jobs, struggling to make ends meet, and deciding whether to use their meager incomes to buy life-sustaining drugs or to pay rent and buy food for their families. AVOL sees an urgent need for action to restore KADAP. This effective program of preventative care is in the best long-term interest of the Commonwealth as well as those living with HIV/AIDS. Given the potential adverse effects and medical impact, time is of the essence."" HIV/AIDS has the most devastating impact on Kentucky's most at-risk communities, who already face significant barriers in accessing health care. KADAP is literally a lifeline for these men and women. Minority populations are disproportionately at risk for HIV/AIDS. According to statistics from the HIV/AIDS Branch of the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, African-Americans in Kentucky make 7.6% of the commonwealth's total population but account for 36% of all new HIV infections. Similarly, Latino Kentuckians make up 2.4% of the population but account for 7% of new HIV infections. AIDS organizations across the Commonwealth are expressing alarm and dismay that the budget will be passed that does not include funding for the Kentucky AIDS Drug Assistance Program. Small non-profits do not have the resources to provide a safety net for the commonwealth's shortfall in funding."
18,A Psychologist's View On MP's Expenses,politics," The fact that the scandal of MPs’ expenses rumbles on for a third week is testament to just how outraged the general public are about the revelations coming out of Westminster. Although the stereotype of politicians is not always one of utmost honesty and integrity, exploring the explanations for MPs’ behaviour from a psychological perspective is not only fascinating but, perhaps more disturbingly, it leads us to the question – when we look closely - would we, the ‘morally outraged general public,’ really behave that differently? According to equity theory, in a working environment, we seek to maintain equity between what we put into work and the outcomes we receive for it. For many, a large part of the outcome is salary. So for MPs, in terms of outcomes, their average salary, as of April 2009, is £64,7661. In terms of input, the role requires long hours, many away from home. There is also some longer term risk involved as MPs aren’t in a position to pursue a career away from politics, in preparation for the day their political star begins to wane. Back to the theory, if we feel there is imbalance between input and outputs – i.e. if we’re getting out less than we’re putting in – we need to address this and rebalance the psychological score card. For those MPs who feel they are underpaid, adding an extra £24,000 to their salary can go a long way to addressing the balance! If the mentality is ‘it’s a part of the salary that I’m entitled to’ rather than ‘it’s a fund which I can draw on, if necessary, to ensure I’m not out of pocket for doing my job’ - it then becomes fairly irrelevant what the money is actually spent on – and certainly we’ve seen some of this from some of the expense MPs thought would never see the light of day! Although MPs have had much more latitude here (that’s what happens when you make your own rules!) I would suggest that this psychological ‘equaling things up’ is something we all do. For most of us, it’s just that our options are much more limited. In organisations, some people reduce their productivity – either not engaging in discretionary behaviors, such as staying late or helping out a colleague - others may simply slide into underperformance; a small minority may equal things up by increasing their package through stealing, for example, office supplies (a recent survey reported that toilet roll is the most frequently stolen item from businesses). Have you ever slacked off a little and justified it because you’ve worked really hard previously? Have you ever ‘borrowed’ some post its and used them at home; thinking its not an issue as you’ve more than made up for it in the unpaid overtime you’ve done? The principle is the same! Before you stop reading this and shoot me down in flames, I’m neither defending MPs’ behaviour nor suggesting the British public is morally corrupt. However, this could help to explain why so many MPs have put so much effort into working the rules to ensure they claim as much as they can. For me, a particularly shocking element of this story is the prevalence across Westminster; it feels like most of the MPs are at it in some form or other, regardless of political affiliation. To help explain this, we can again look to psychological theory. The premise of social proof theory is that we look to others about how to behave, especially in situations where we are unsure. So, for MPs whose moral conscience may have got the better of them about a particular claim, they only have to look at their peer group to see that dubious claims are just part of the social norm. Again, we all do this, it’s part of the human condition – have you ever glanced across the dinner table to double check you’re using the correct piece of cutlery or, in a foreign country, looked around for clues about how to order a meal or use public transport? We all look to others to check what’s normal when we’re unsure. Don’t underestimate this phenomenon, it is a powerful one. In one famous psychological experiment, most people ignored smoke coming from beneath a door when everyone else did the same. Where people were on their own, they quickly raised the alarm. We’ll put our safety at risk before we break away from the ‘norm’. It’s all very well to explain this behaviour, but it doesn’t make it right. It may, however, help to inform how we can prevent things like this happening again. Making the rules tighter and more explicit will go some way to making the norm for expense claims more appropriate and realistic; employing an independent body to ensure this is enforced will support this process as well. The fury of the public and the openness of the Freedom of Information Act should also help harness the power of social approval, which is a part of human behaviour that all MPs should understand! However, the really thorny issue is around equity i.e. MPs getting out what they put in. Pay is central to this - should we really even consider increasing pay? Should we encourage the ‘professional politician?’ Intellectually, the argument is yes, we should certainly consider it. If, as a group, MPs truly feel that the rewards they receive from their role are not equal to the effort they put in, the risk is that they will simply find other ways to equal things up – and the problem just moves elsewhere; it may be less obvious but it will still be there. In these uncertain times, for MPs (and for the rest of us for that matter) – the value of actually having a job – even one that doesn’t give us quite what we deserve - may temporarily readdress the balance to some extent. Combined with tighter rules, this could bring MPs into line for a while, but without addressing some of the fundamentals of equity of effort and outcome, the question is not whether this is just a sticking plaster, but how long before the sticking plaster peels off?"
19,Health Care Reform - Seen through the eyes of the typical American Citizen,politics," The health care we receive here in the U.S. is bar none, among the best in the world.  So why do we insist on calling this recent government attempt at takeover of our health care system a ""Health Care Reform"".  In fact what is reform?  Well, most dictionary definitions are as follows: ""To change to a better state, form, etc.; to improve by alteration, substitution, abolition, etc."" Health care here in the United States, as we just stated, is without question among the best in the world, and this is easily identifiable simply be examining how many people from countries where there is government controlled health care, flee to the United States to receive better, more comprehensive. and more expeditious health care or treatments than they otherwise have access to in their home countries.  These include Canada and European countries, where socialized medicine is the norm. So, while the talk may be about health care reform, we submit that what the debate should be about is health care cost reform.  Additionally, to insinuate that insurance companies are solely at fault for the rising health care costs is just absurd.  Insurance is expensive because health care costs have spiraled out of control.  Insurance companies make the payments, and in many cases they get the discounts, because of their pooled purchasing power. Consequently, if we are to focus our discussions on healthcare costs, where the discussion should rightfully be focused, then we should fully examine and realize why the costs are constantly increasing, and doing so at a pace that exceeds inflation or income growth. One major reason for these ever increasing healthcare costs is the ridiculous prices doctors must pay for their required malpractice insurance.  Many want to blame the insurance companies for the high prices.  However, before we persist in this line of thinking, we would do well to consider the law, and the frequency with which doctors are sued in court with nonsensical and or frivolous lawsuits.  Most importantly, with these frivilous lawsuits comes a high price tag for their defense. Defense costs for lawsuits are borne by the insurance companies providing medical malpractice insurance.  Many people are believers in the need for legal or tort reform, so too does the author of this article believe in this need.  Many people truly believe this tort reform would significantly reduce medical malpractice insurance costs, as well as overall medical costs. Let us open up legal action against any lawyer who brings to bare a frivolous lawsuit and then let us see the real and legitimate claims which are made in courts, while frivilous suits and claims are opem to counter claims and counter suits.  Were this the case, then the number of cases would likely drop significantly and the cost of malpractice insurance would likely plummet, as would health care costs, were these frivilous suits reduced. For a minute, let us take a look at but one example of how this comes into play.  Not long ago a man had an accident.  While reaching down to remove a stick from near his lawn mower he lost two finger to the blade.  He received many (nearly 30) calls from legal professionals urging him to sue the doctors for the loss of his fingers.  The silly thing is, the doctors and hospital did their best to save his fingers from his own stupidity.  Yet even after re-attachment they were unable to help or to save the fingers.  Still, even if the case is completely frivolous, legal professionals were urging him to sue the doctors and hospital for not saving his fingers.  It was absolutely crazy, I know, the man was my father in law. When suits like this are initiated the insurance companies have to hire or pay their lawyers to defend the doctors in these law suits, and the never ending circle of legal chicanery continues in perpituity.  The lawyers have us all caught in a no win situation.  They sue doctors and file frivolous suits, then they demand that people have rights to file these suits in order to protect themselves.  Certainly no one would argue that people have such rights, in fact they do and should, but only in real cases.  Not cases initiated simply to acquire money, and argued with a paid expert, paid witnesses, paid examining physicians, and sometimes plaintiffs who are simply lying. Filing so many frivolous suits and so frequently, the legal profession has become a major contributing factor to the exceptionally high malpractice insurance fees that doctors have to pay.  Thirty years ago if I wanted to see my doctor, he would show up at my home and charge me a fair price to see me.  Now I cannot see him or her without first having insurance.  I is absurd. So we say, let's start this medical cost reform with a healthy dose of tort reform.  Let's have recourse on attorneys who file frivolous suits, let's have tort reform where doctors can sue attorneys for any lawsuit they file which the attorney loses and where the doctor was found to have committed no wrongdoing or malpractice.  Certainly if the initiated suit discredits the doctor or puts them through unnecessary legal action, then the initiating attorney should be held accountable.  Let's start there and see how dramatically these frivolous suits drop off. As for the next aspect of rising health care costs, the problem comes when the public and/or certain organizations that assist the public, abuse the system.  You may ask; How does this happen?  Let's take a look at real life example of this.  Sleep Apnea is a sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. Each episode, called an apnea, lasts long enough so that one or more breaths are missed, and such episodes occur repeatedly throughout sleep.  The standard definition of any apneic event includes a minimum 10 second interval between breaths, with either a neurological arousal (a 3-second or greater shift in EEG frequency), a blood oxygen desaturation of 3-4% or greater, or both arousal and desaturation. Sleep apnea is diagnosed with an overnight sleep test called a polysomnogram, or a ""sleep study"".  This condition can lead to high blood pressure, heart problems and conditions, and in extreme cases even death. Treatments include wearing a mask conencted to a machine (Called a CPAP machine) which blows air through the nose or nose and mouth thereby maintaining an open airway and eliminating the apnea's.  The CPAP machine, mask, and accessories can cost from a few hundred dollars to a couple thousand dollars.  When one is diagnosed with sleep apnea and a CPAP prescribed, one's insurance may cover the cost of the machine and accessories.  However, in many instances the insurance companies are forced to significanlty overpay for these devices for their insured individuals.  The reason is that many of the suppliers also sell this equipment to medicare or medicaid patients.  In doing so, they charge them the maximum allowed for a machine by those programs.  Still, the program rules are that if they sell to medicare or medicaid patients at a specific price, then they are not allowed to sell at a lower price to others, else they risk losing their ability to provide to medicare or medicaid patients. This author has sleep apnea and found a machine from a supplier for a price of $400.  But the insurance company would only pay for the prescribed machine if it were delivered through a home health care company.  Because the home health care company also provided to medicare and medicaid patients, they could not sell the machine to me or my insurance company at a fair price, they delivered the machine to me, but at a cost to my insurance company of $1200, the same as they charge their medicare or medicaid patients.  Thus my insurance company, because of regulations, laws, and government intervention into private healthcare, was forced to pay 200% more for my CPAP machine, than it could have or should have otherwise paid.  This is abuse of the system by companies that provide services to medicare and medicaid, it is not high insurance cost, it is not high medical cost, and it is not the fault of anything other than abuse of the system and government intervention into private healthcare.  It is waste, it is cheating, and it harms us all in the form of higher medical and insurance costs.  The abuse, cheating, and waste is the problem that needs to be addressed, not the insurance or the care. Next, let's examine and understand medical insurance in general.  Insurance is not meant to pay all medical bills all the time.  If we can all agree on this then we can at least begin to understand this portion of the problem.  Insurance, sold and used correctly, is for catastrophic illness or medical mishaps, not for every little medical issue that arises.  Just like auto insurance is for when you have a car accident, not to pay for your gas, oil changes, brake repair, broken headlight, muffler problems, etc... So too is health insurance for issues like cancer, heart attacks, strokes, broken bones, sever diseases, emergencies, surgeries, etc...  it is in essence the same as auto insurance or home owners insurance.  It is meant to be there when you have a major medical issues.  It is not meant to cover every office visit, cold, cut, scrape, shot, vaccine, medication, or hangnail you may encounter in life.  If you insure everything then you better expect it to cost a lot.  So why pay the extra $75 per month in premiums for an extra $1000 in office visit coverage.  Why pay the extra $500 per year to reduce the co-pay on perscriptions from $25 down to $10 or $15.  Just pay the $75 or $100 office visit charge and just take the prescription discount offered and pay for your own prescriptions at a nice discount (often 50% or more).  Chances are you will not be in the doctors office 10 times or more per year anyway and chances are the amount of prescription medication you will need will not make up for the $500 extra you pay for the coverage.  If you have issues and are in the doctors office 10 or more times per year or if you have lots of expensive prescriptions, then you likely have other more major issues that your insurance will cover.  Just insure the major things, after all, these are what insurance was originally designed for and to protect against. Finally, we should all understand that healthcare insurance or the care itself is not a right, it is a privilege of those who work hard and acquire health care or healthcare insurance for themselves and their families.  Just because you work hard, educate yourself, get a great paying job or run your own business, and you can afford to drive a Corvette, does not mean that someone else should have or be given a corvette by the government or any car for that matter at the expense of another person (ex. the taxpaying public). The same is true of health care.  A corvette is not a right, nowhere in our constitution does it state that we have the right to life liberty and a Corvette.  Nor does it state we have the right to life liberty and government provided healthcare or government healthcare insurance.  These are privileges we earn through hard work. We can probably all agree to provide for or help those who cannot care for themselves, for example those who are physically or mentally handicapped or otherwise disabled and who simply cannot provide for themselves, we may even agree as a society to provide for those who defend our freedoms and fight for us in war (ex. Military veterans), or even possibly our senior citizens to a certain extent.  Certainly, on a smaller scale states or local communities can decide to implement programs for these individuals or situations, but we do not all agree that healthcare is a right to be afforded to everyone and that should forcibly be funded at the federal level by those who work hard. In addition we do not all agree that those who work hard or earn more should give to everyone else through a government run and MANDATED programs.  This is simply absurd and not what America is all about, nor is it what made America great. In fact it is taking or taxing those who work hard or earn more to provide for others who may not is stealing.  It is akin to Robin Hood, stealing from the rich to give to the poor.  It's if justified by creating crises or playing on peoples emotions or pain points. Frankly, many people do not believe that government involvement in health care would be beneficial for individuals, health care professionals, the relationships between them, or the quality and quantity of timely care that patients would receive.  The fact remains, there is absolutely no program that the government is running, or has ever run, that has been on budget, reduces costs, and which impels us to trust the government to run or manage such a huge portion of our economy and private lives as health care. Many, if not most Americans believe that government has no business in our health care.  Many Americans recognize that government intervention will lead to rationing or procedures and care, higher taxes, potentially no cost savings, all the while leading us down a path towards socialism.  Without question it will lead to larger and larger government which is exactly what our founding fathers wanted to prevent. In conclusion, this health care debacle is nothing more than a direct usurpation of freedoms by an ever expanding and growing government.  That in itself is dangerous.  The elite would love to hand down their seats in the congress to their children and have special privileges, special insurance and medical care, and force ""we the people"" into dependency on government from cradle to grave, and into government run programs.  We urge you, don't allow it folks.  This is exactly what our founding fathers feared with a large and growing government.  It is the reason the United States of America fought for its independence to overthrow the oppressive rule of England, the high taxation without representation, and the insane policies of King George at the time of succession. We are now approaching the same type of situation that we faced when the United States declared its independence from the King of England.  The Obama administration and radical leftist politicians are about to really incite the masses here in the United States.  Beware!  You are about to awaken the sleeping giant in the form of the American people and their values.  Freedom is a powerful virtue which people do not take lightly.  When usurpation begins to infringe on freedoms  and liberties people become active.  This is why we are seeing tea parties, marches, and masses beginning to revolt.  As soon as the people recognize that some politicians are trying to infringe on their freedoms or take some away from them, they will fight to the death to save it. Health care reform may lead down a path towards revolution, and not in a good way!"
20,Thomas Jefferson and Early American Political Campaigns,politics," There was pressure on Thomas Jefferson to put together a political campaign and run for a third term as president when the election of 1808 drew closer. He was the clear leader of his party: Its goals had been shaped by his vision for the country. Jefferson's second term had not been as smooth or peaceful as his first term, however, and there was growing conflict with Great Britain. Jefferson believed that the country was now set on a course that would ensure its long-term success. He wanted to spend his remaining years at his home in Virginia. Three men vied for the Republican nomination once it became clear that Jefferson would not run a political campaign for a third term: Secretary of State James Madison, Vice President George Clinton, and James Monroe. Some people used this competition to try to persuade Jefferson to change his mind. They wanted him to seek a third term in order to prevent a split in the party he had founded. Jefferson held firm, however, and made it clear that Madison was his choice as a successor. Ultimately, George Clinton was nominated by the party as Madison's running mate for the campaign. Madison faced the same Federalist candidate who had challenged Thomas Jefferson in the political campaign of 1804: Charles Pinkney of South Carolina. Jefferson's party again triumphed. Madison won 122 electoral votes to Pinkney's 44. The party had held the presidency for eight years and ensured its transition to a new president. It was a clear demonstration that the values and positions of the party mattered as much to the voters as did the personal appeal of Thomas Jefferson. It was also a demonstration of the party's success at transmitting its message to the voters during the political campaign. After the presidential political campaign of 1808 that elected James Madison, much of the Republican Party's success moved away from the leadership offered by members of Congress as it had existed in the past. Instead, the split that had resulted in three different men running political campaigns that vied against each other for the presidency reflected a split in the Republican congressional leadership, as well. Each candidate had his own backers in Congress, and the supporters of James Monroe and George Clinton were less willing to work with Madison because he was not ""their"" candidate. For this reason, Madison began his presidency facing greater challenges than those Jefferson had encountered during his first months in office. Madison was aware of the importance of ensuring support from Congress, and as a result he tried to please various factions by appointing their nominees to gubernatorial positions, regardless of their skills or abilities. Jefferson had clearly been the party leader during his presidency. Under Madison, leadership of the party seemed more firmly held by Congress members. Conflict with Great Britain soon made it clear that war was likely; the Federalists pounced on this, proclaiming themselves to be the ""party of peace,"" whereas Madison's Republicans were described as the ""war party."" American forces were not adequately prepared for the War of 1812. In the mid-term political campaign elections, many of the older Republicans in Congress had been replaced by new, younger candidates. These younger congressmen had not experienced the Revolutionary War firsthand, so the America they knew was very different from that of men like Jefferson and Madison. Many of them were Southerners and Westerners, and they ran a political campaign and elected Henry Clay as Speaker of the House. Their focus was on expanding American territory. They had not lived through a war with Great Britain, and as a result, their expectations for the war were optimistic, even unrealistic. Thus, Congress did not act quickly when it came to building up the American Navy or raising taxes to provide funds for the military campaign."

1,Early Political Party Organizations and Political Campaigns,politics," In 1819, a year before the political campaign that would elect a new president, the Missouri Territory petitioned to join the Union as a state. At the time, America was evenly split into states that did permit slavery and those that did not, with 11 on each side. The Constitution had stated that the issue of whether or not to allow slavery was up to each individual state. Republican Congressman James Talmadge of New York, however, suggested that Missouri's petition to join the Union contain an amendment stating that no additional slaves could be brought into the state and that those that were already there would be eventually be set free. This proposal launched a fierce debate in Congress and set up an issue that would loom large in the upcoming political campaign. Southern congressmen argued that each state had the right to decide whether or not to permit slavery. The debate was finally resolved with a compromise in March 1820. Missouri could join the United States as a slave state, but Maine would also join as a free state. Additional laws were passed to ban slavery in all remaining territory acquired in the Louisiana Purchase, north of a specific line of latitude. Many political figures--including John Quincy Adams and Thomas Jefferson--saw the Missouri Compromise as a dangerous sign of division within the United States, where lines that separated slave states from free states were drawn. Today, the Missouri Compromise is viewed as a political mistake. In 1820, however, when president James Monroe was running a political campaign for reelection, his administration's policies were viewed favorably--so favorably, in fact, that the Republican members of Congress felt that it was not necessary to discuss nominations; Monroe was the clear choice as the candidate who would run the best campaign and be most likely to win on election day. Planning for the monumental political campaign of 1804 was set up early, much like the presidential races of today. Party organizations were set up in each state. By October 1801, instructions had been given out to party organizers in each town. These political campaign committees were told to make up a list of all those eligiblde to cote in their towns, especially those likely to consider themselves Republican. The committees were told to hold a private meeting with these Republicans to discuss with them the importance of ensuring that Republican principles were maintained in local government. The committees were also told to try to make sure that Republican newspapers were circulated in their towns. These early campaign organizations formed the basis of party structure at the local level. In 1804, when Thomas Jefferson sought reelection, his party reminded voters of the failures of Federalist president John Adams and provided a list of Jefferson's accomplishments during his four years in office. These included reduction of taxes, elimination of several thousand unnecessary government jobs, reduction of the national debt, maintenance of peace, and the purchase of the Louisiana territory. It is an interesting note that, apart from the Louisiana Purchase, many similar claims feature in modern presidential political campaigns. Adams and the Federalists were also linked--unfavorably--to Great Britain. The Revolutionary War was still recent history, and voters were reminded that Great Britain had been America's greatest enemy not long ago. Federalists responded by linking their party to George Washington. They organized a large public campaign celebration of George Washington's birthday and described a vote for the Federalist as a vote for the ""Washington ticket."" In the end, Jefferson was overwhelmingly successful in this political campaign bid for reelection. He won every state except for Delaware and Connecticut."
2,Democratic Political Campaigning following Thomas Jefferson,politics," The party founded by Thomas Jefferson had first come to power claiming itself as the ""party of the people"" during the political campaign. The presidents who had been elected by this party, however, owed perhaps less to the people than to a select group of men: the congressional Republican caucus (nominating committee). Presidents Jefferson, Monroe and Madison represented a distinct type--Virginians and well-educated, wealthy men who had played a role in America since its founding. With Madison, Monroe and even President John Quincy Adams, a standard had been set. A politician would spend a certain amount of time serving in a presiden'ts cabinet, then essentially be selected by that president as his successor in the next political campaign. With the election of Andrew Jackson after a political campaign in 1828, the party--and the presidency--entered a new phase. For one thing, voters played a greater role than ever before in ensuring the election of Jackson. Gradually, since 1810, the voting policies in states had been changing. In the oldest states, voting had been restricted to those who owned property of some sort or paid taxes. As new states joined the Union, this began to change, and gradually one state after another began to shift its voting policies so that the right to vote was given to all white males over the age of 21. This was an incredibly important shift. Once, presidents had been chosen based on connections and political campaign influence, but suddenly a candidate could appeal directly to the voters and voters could use their infulence to select the candidate that most appealed top them. Political campaigning for election of 1824 began two years earlier, as various candidates began to position themselves to receive their party's nominations. At one point, there were as many as 16 potential candidates for the Republican Party's nomination. Gradually, they were whittled down to 6 and then to 4: Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, the former Federalist from Massachusetts; William Crawford, the secretary of the treasury; Henry Clay, the Speaker of the House of Representatives; and Andrew Jackson, the military hero who had bee elected as a senator from Tennessee. The party that had been so disciplined in bringing Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and James Monroe to office had lost its focus. Chaos reigned as competing interests lobbied for their chosen candidates in the upcoming presidential political campaign. Without party organization supporting a particular candidate, the election campaign proved to be a mess. Voter turnout was very low, little more than 25 percent. Andrew Jackson led in both the electoral and popular votes, but by such a number that he failed to achieve the necessary majority of electoral votes. This meant that the election had to be decided in the House of Representatives. According to the Constitution, only the leading three candidates were to be considered. Clay had received the fewest electoral votes, so he was eliminated. Crawford was suffering from a serious illness, misdiagnosed as a stroke, so he, too, was not considered in the House. The contest came down to John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson. Clay was soon the focus of a different kind of political campaign: intense lobbying efforts by the backers of Adams and Jackson, who wanted his support for their candidates. Clay did not like Jackson, however, and did not think that he had the qualifications to serve as president. Clay met several times with Adams and ultimately gave his support (and his electoral votes) to Adams, who was then declared to be president."
3,Early Democratic Political Campaigns and Conventions,politics," In 1936, the Democratic Party again gathered in Baltimore for their presidential political campaign convention. Vice President Martin Van Buren, the man who had masterminded Andrew Jackson's campaign, was the party's choice for president. Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky was Jackson's choice for vice president, and the party followed his wishes. Van Buren was the son of a tavern keeper from the small village of Kinderhook, New York. He had become a leader in New York state politics in what was then the Republican Party, and although eventually ran a political campaign to be elected senator, he remained in close touch with his state organization. He understood the importance of an organized, disciplined state party, and he had helped develop this organization as the Democratic Party was formed. Van Buren had put his full effort into the political campaign that elected Jackson, and Jackson returned the favor by campaigning for Van Buren. He was an experienced politician--far more experienced than Jackson had been--and he believed deeply in the Democratic Party. He felt that the Democratic Party's principles, low taxes, no national debt, states' rights, and strict interpretation of the Constitution, should be clearly expressed to voters. His hope was that the party's political campaign convention would focus on these ideas. Instead, the convention's message to voters--the type of message that would eventually be known as the party's platform--focused on party heroes like Jefferson, Madison, Monroe and Jackson. The actual nominee was mentioned only once. Despite Jackson's support for his campaign and the backing of the organized Democratic Party structure, Van Buren barely won the popular vote, earning 50.9 percent. He did, however, receive a majority of the electoral votes and assumed the presidency in 1837. The first national political campaign conventions were held in December of 1831 for the National Republican party. Their nominee for the presidency was Henry Clay. Five months later, 334 Democrats met in Baltimore. They represented every state except Missouri, and their unanimous choice for the nomination was incumbent President Andrew Jackson, with Martin Van Buren as his running mate. This political campaign convention was an important milestone for the Democratic Party. Procedures were set up for future conventions and future nominations, ensuring that this was not Jackson's party, but a party that would endure beyond a single election or a single candidate. Majority rule dictated which candidate would be chosen. Two-thirds of the delegates needed to approve not only the presidential but also the vice-presidential nominee. Jackson easily won the political campaign and the election, and the Democratic Party was established not as a branch of the Republican Party but as a political party in its own right. Thanks to Jackson,it was identified as the party of the common man; the wealthy and the elite were labeled its opponents. The Democratic Party still retains some of this image today. Following the political campaign of 1832, Jackson challenged the national bank system, shifting federal money from the national bank to a series of state banks. The banking issue prompted a group of businessmen and opponents of Jackson's to band together to oppose the man they labeled ""King Andrew I."" They called themselves ""Whigs,"" after the British political party formed to oppose the king of England in the 1700s. Soon, they would develop into a political force, particularly in New England."
4,Political Campaign Evolution in the Early Democratic Party,politics," The Democratic Party had been shaped by President Martin Van Buren but was transformed by events in the nation and by Andrew Jackson's popularity with the voters. Whereas once congressional caucuses had played a key role in choosing the political candidate, the national convention had assumed that function, and not only national but also state politicians now played an important role in political campaigns. Under Jackson, the Democratic Party had become, in a sense, a party that had achieved success because of the president's willingness to divide Americans during the political campaign. Jackson drew a distinction between the wealthy and the poor, the laborers and the business owners, and even divided Southerners and Westerners from those in the East. Jackson's legacy was a challenging one for Van Buren who, though a seasoned politician, had none of Jackson's political campaign charisma. Van Buren was further burdened by the legacy of Jackson's economic policies. Only weeks after Van Buren took office, New York banks began to cut back on loans in an effort to bring a halt to widespread speculation. Soon, banks across the country followed suit and a panic resulted in the worst depression the nation had known. Banks and businesses closed down, and unemployment rose to record levels. Van Buren insisted on following Jackson's policies of accepting only hard currency (gold and silver) rather than paper money, refusing to charter a national bank, and taking few steps that could stem the crisis. Of course, from a political campaigning point of view, this was likely not the most prudent move that he could have made. The Whig Party, which was a staunch band of opponents, seized on the opportunity that the financial crisis offered and quickly made made a campaign issue out of it. As President James Madison's second term in office came to an end, the Republican nominating political campaign nominating committee chose James Monroe as Madison's successor. Daniel Tompkins, the former governor of New York, was chosen as his running mate for the campaign. Some Republicans grumbled about a ""Virginia dynasty""--like Madison and Jefferson, Monroe was a Virginia native--but the only serious challenger Monroe faced for Republican political campaign nomination was another Southerner, William Crawford, who had also been born in Virginia. The Republicans had hit on a winning political campaign formula: a presidential candidate from Virginia whose running mate was a former governor of New York. Monroe easily won election over his Federalist challenger, Rufus King of New York, who made no effort to campaign and won only three states (Massachusetts, Connecticut and Delaware) to Monroe's 16. The ease with with Monroe had won the political campaign election and the general disarray of the Federalists seemed to suggest that America would evolve into a single-party nation--or perhaps a nation with no political parties at all. Andrew Jackson, serving as commander of the federal army in the South, suggested to Monroe that he bring an end to the party system by ignoring party affiliation when choosing his cabinet. Monroe was not yet willing to do so; however, he did choose John Quincy Adams, son of the last Federalist president to win a political campaign, to serve as his secretary of state. Monroe began his presidency with a tour of the states; he was the first president to do so since George Washington. His tour prompted such a favorable response from the people, who relished the opportunity to see their president, that the early years of his presidency were soon described as the ""Era of Good Feelings."" The country continued to expand to the south and west, and four new states--Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, and Mississippi--joined the Union."
5,Political Campaign Debate in the Nineteenth Century,politics," By the middle of the nineteenth century, slavery was emerging as an issue of increasing political campaign focus. The question about whether or not it should be permitted was nothing new to political debate, but, by the mid-1800s more and more focus was placed on how to respond to the issue. For the political campaign of 1840, in which Martin Van Buren was defeated in his bid for reelection, a group of abolitionists formed their own political party--the Liberty Party--and nominated their own candidate for president. Although their bid for the presidency was unsuccessful, it was a sign that this was becoming an issue that presidential candidates would have to address. That issue would be particularly disastrous for the Democratic Party. From 1841 to 1845, the Whigs occupied the White House. William Henry Harrison served as president only a month before dying of pneumonia. He was the first president to die in office. John Tyler, the vice president, became president. The former Democrat struggled to work with the Whig Congress members; their disgust with his policies became so strong that the Whigs ultimately decided to expel Tyler from their political party. An impeachment resolution was introduced into the House of Representatives, but it failed to pass. When the Democratic political campaign convention was again held in Baltimore, President Tyler sent representatives to suggest that he should be nominated by the Democrats. Martin Van Buren also sought the nomination, but his outspoken position on whether or not Texas would be annexed (forcibly added) by the United States (he was opposed, fearing it would spark a war with Mexico) caused him to lose support of most delegates. Following a financial crisis during the presidency of Martin Van Buren, the Whig Party (his fierce opponents) were quick to seize on the opportunity for the upcoming political campaign. They labeled the president ""Martin Van Ruin"" and selected William Henry Harrison as their candidate in the 1840 presidential campaign. The Whigs skillfully presented Harrison as a candidate similar to Andrew Jackson--a military hero who had defeated the British at the Battle of the Thames. Harrison was given the nickname ""Old Tippecanoe"" and was presented as another self-made candidate of humble beginnings, with images of a log cabin often appearing on posters that advertised his candidacy. There was little truth in this political campaign image making. Harrison was the son of an aristocratic Virginia family and had lived on an impressive estate in the Ohio countryside. In fact, Van Buren's childhood had been far more humble than Harrison's. Nonetheless, Van Buren was depicted by the Whigs as a polished, elegantly dressed politician and contrasted with their candidate who, they claimed, liked nothing more than a swig of hard cider from a jug. Political campaign speakers suggested to voters that the choice was ""between the log cabin and the palace, between hard cider and champagne."" Harrison's running mate was John Tyler of Virginia, who had been a Democrat but left the party after disagreeing with many of Jackson's policies. The Democratic political campaign convention was held in Baltimore in May of 1840. It was at this convention that the party's name was officially changed from the Democratic-Republican Party to the Democratic Party. The party nominated Van Buren but did not name a vice-presidential candidate. The Whigs proved their mastery of the political campaign, using the symbols of the log cabin and cider jugs to promote their candidate and transform the election into entertainment. Nearly 80 percent of all those eligible to vote did so in the election. Van Buren lost. The era of Jacksonian democracy had come to an end."
6,Qualifying to be a Political Campaign Candidate,politics," The official qualifications top run a campaign for political office are usually pretty simple. In this democratic country that encourages public participation in government, it is not hard to meet the official qualifications for most local offices. The official qualifications might vary from state to state, and from office to office, but generally are the same throughout most of the United States. Basically, all that is required to run a campaign for office is that you are a registered voter and a resident of the district in which you are running. What we say here about running a campaign might not be completely accurate for your state, though. Not only does each state have its own peculiar election laws, many times the courts in each have interpreted similar election laws quite differently. Local candidates, particularly newcomers, often run afoul of the election laws or the requirements for candidates in their state. We can't list all of the state and local election campaign laws in one article, of course. You must check those requirements for yourself in your local area. You cannot rely on what some person, even some old political hand, tells you. You must check for yourself, and look at every election campaign law on the books. In talking about the official campaign qualifications, you should begin by checking out the official requirements for your office. You should also get in the habit of always checking the local election laws on any question that might come up. Although, as we said above, the basic qualifications to campaign for office are generally pretty simple, there are many local wrinkles. For example, in one state a teacher may not run for school board, but in another he may work in one school district but be eligible to run for school board, if he lives in another district. You have to check for any official requirement that may make you unqualified for an office. The basic qualifications for running for office have changed a lot in the last few hundred years, to be sure. During the Democratic political campaign convention of 1844, it took several ballots before a front runner for the presidential nominee emerged. That front runner was a man who had come to the convention hoping to be nominated as vice president instead. James K. Polk had served as Speaker of the House of Representatives and governor of Tennessee, yet he was essentially a little-known candidate--so little known, in fact, that the Whig campaign repeatedly posed the question ""Who is James K. Polk?"" Polk, though, sensing that most Americans wanted to see their country expand, spoke out during the political campaign in favor of annexing Texas and Oregon, and he had the support of the aging Andrew Jackson. Expansion became his campaign issue, and this emphasis was popular in the South and West. Slavery existed in the background of this political campaign issue: Texas's entry into the United States would tip the balance in favor of slave-holding states. Polk's tough stance against Mexico (which claimed Texas) and Great Britain (which claimed portions of Oregon) was also popular. He won the election and, shortly after his victory, Congress voted to annex Texas. Polk kept his political campaign promise of expanding the country. He signed a treaty with the British that brought Oregon in as American territory. Disputes over territory were followed by war with Mexico, but American forces were successful. In the end, Polk added not only Texas but also New Mexico and California to American territory. With this new territory, however, came the question that had haunted each American effort to expand: would slavery be allowed in these new territories?"
7,How to Run a Great Political Campaign for Elected Office,politics," If you're running a campaign as a candidate in a political election, there's a philosophical reason why you should really begin by looking up the qualifications and duties of the office you're seeking. If you do win you election, you are going to have to look things up in the code on a regular basis because your office and duties are regulated by law. You should begin by learning your way around the state code or city charter. You should want to win your election, but you should also want to be good at the job you're running for. A good official always follows the law, and always checks the code first to see what the law is. If looking things up in the code or charter seems too intimidation, ask someone in the party or an old hand if they know a friendly lawyer. Lots of lawyers are politically active and would be happy to share their election knowledge by giving you a copy of the relevant code sections if you're a good candidate. Although checking the office out in the state code for your election is not a must-do thing, we strongly recommend it. There are also other, more informal, ways to find out about the job. One of the very best is to attend the meetings of the board or office. If you plan on running in an election for city council or the school board, it in on the city council or school board meetings and listen to what goes on. Find out what is currently on the agenda, and what is likely to come up during the campaign. Talk to people who have held the job. An incumbent is not likely to give you much help if you are running in an election against him, but if you know someone who has already served in that office, ask him or her about it. Talk to the employees in that office about the work they do and how it might be improved. Talk to the people who are served by that elected office or do business with it on a regular basis. If you are running for the Housing Board, you should ask the head of the tenant's union and the president of the landlord's association what they expect from a member of the board after the election. There are plenty of specialized requirements that must be met before you can qualify as a political candidate for certain specialized offices. In one state only a licensed physician can run for coroner, only a certified peace officer can run for sheriff, and only a licensed professional engineer can be a candidate for county engineer. In another state, none of these professional licensures are required. We won't give the names of the states because it really doesn't matter what the official requirements are for being a political candidate in some other state. It only matters what they are in your state, and you have to look that up yourself. The qualifications for specific political candidates are listed in your state code, which is a compilation of the state laws. Many libraries have copies of the state code, some state offices do, and virtually every lawyer has a copy of the state code in his office, so it is fairly easy to find out about the official qualifications. You may be running for an office that is governed by a city charter, or local ordinances, so you have to check that source, but local codes are readily available in libraries and law offices, too. When you look at the qualifications to be a political candidate, also look up the section that deals with the duties of the office - the powers, functions, and areas of responsibility. There may be some duties involved in the job that you are not aware of. In public employment, like any employment, it is a good idea to look at the job description before you sign on."
8,Political Campaign Message in Local Elections,politics," When trying to decide which political office you want to run for, think of your eventual campaign message. You'll want to make sure that you go for the office you are good at. Some public offices are administrative, where your ability to handle staff and serve the public is the major criterion. Are you good at paperwork? Can you handle subordinates? Others are more legislative, like alderman or councilwoman, where the main function is to listen to competing interests and make policy choices. Are you good at listening to people? Can you make a decision and stick with it? Do you have the time to do what is involved in the office? Many offices are part time, but with all of the meetings, conferences and consultations they are quite demanding. Evaluate yourself and answer important questions about your professional qualifications. You should also think about getting a physical checkup before you decide to run a political campaign for office. Campaigning is often a grueling, exhausting effort. President Bill Clinton talked himself hoarse in the last days of his campaign in 1992 and had to cut back on speeches in 1996. Poor Bob Dole looked terrible as election day drew near. Of course they were out there campaigning every day, but the only real difference between their race and yours is that in a local contest, the distance between two campaign stops is shorter. You will be working every day too, and it is hard work to boot. When you have asked yourself the difficult questions, and found out all you can about the duties of the office, and learned about all the official and unofficial qualifications, then ask yourself: would I vote for me? If the answer is yes, then you must have some reason why. Get those reasons straight in your head. It's the first step in your campaign, but you'll get that question over and over as you campaign. If you know what you're after, and why you can do the job, then it will come across to the voters. Someone once asked Abraham Lincoln what the office of president was really like. Lincoln said the question reminded him of the story about a man who was being run out of town on a rail. He was asked what he thought of that, and looked down from the rail and said, ""Well, if it weren't for the honor of the thing, I'd rather walk."" This is still a pretty fair description of what it is like to hold elective office. There is a certain amount of honor in being chosen by your fellow citizens to manage the public's affairs, but there is also that element of subjecting yourself to the howling throng. You should consider the drawbacks, but you probably also think you can contribute to your community, that you can make a difference, that you can handle the public's affairs and do a good job of it. You also probably have some idea of what office you want to run for. The first question you need to ask yourself is the very question that is asked about any candidate: ""Is this guy qualified?"" You have to ask yourself this question because every voter is going to ask it about you. During your campaign, somebody will ask you straight out why you think you are qualified for the job. You have to be ready with a good answer, and to be ready you have to have thought about your answer, about your qualifications. There are official qualification but there are also unofficial qualifications."
9,Election Candidates and How to Win a Political Campaign,politics," The last event in an political campaign election is when they count the votes. Oddly enough, counting the votes is one of the first steps in your campaign. To win, you have to ask yourself: ""How many votes do I need?"" and, ""Where will I get them?"" You have to begin by picking the number. You have to decide how many votes it will take, probably, to give you a victory in your campaign. That number is likely to be a lot smaller than you might think at first. In analyzing election and campaign statistics there are two cardinal principals. One is that most Americans don't vote. The other is that you don't need all of the votes, or even most of the votes. You need only 50 percent of the votes, plus one. With these two principles in mind, you have to get the election results in your race for at least the last four elections, and decide how many votes it will take to win your election campaign. Let's try and example. Let's say that a woman who has been a law clerk for a court wants to run for city law director in a small city where she lives. It has a population of about 35,000. Of that 35,000, only about 64 percent of the population is registered to vote, so there are only about 22,400 voters. This is where the propensity of Americans to not vote comes in. Although there are more than 22,000 registered voters in the city, the municipal elections are likely held in off years, that is, years where there are no other major races. When there is a big statewide race, like for governor or senator, there tends to be a big voter turnout. Some people vote only when there is a presidential race, so in those years there is a substantially larger number of people going to the polls. Although who gets elected mayor probably has more effect on the average person's life than who gets elected president, in local elections there is a major fall off in voter interest. To win such a race as our law director campaign, then, fifty percent might only be about,300 votes. To ensure victory in your political campaign, the first thing you must do is ensure that you'll get 50-percent-plus-one of the vote total in your election. Ask your mother if she will vote for you. It might not be a good idea to ask your spouse. In one famous case, a candidate got only one vote: his own. His wife was quoted in the newspaper as saying she didn't think he had a good chance so she didn't vote for him. The newspaper gleefully reported this under a headline that read ""One man, one vote!"" Politics is a tough business. When you get your mother's assurance that she will vote for you in your campaign, then start thinking about the number, the other 50 percent. This number is the focus of your campaign. Just thinking about running for office can be intimidating. When you review past election statistics and realize that your only really need to win the votes of about ten percent of your city's population, though, you'll have a much better perspective on what you need to do. The number of votes you need to win a campaign is an attainable goal no matter what race you are running in. Very early on in your campaign, you'll have to pick your target number. You have to target an exact number of how many votes you will have to get in order to win. You determine that number by looking at the results in past elections and by analyzing board of elections statistics."
10,Running for Office and Analyzing Voters in Your Election,politics," Sometimes it's hard to tell exactly how many votes you might need to win your political race, even if you do have the campaign finance tools in place to raise a lot of money. Your opponent might be an incumbent who has not had any opposition in the last couple times out. If that's the case, you can look at recent election results from comparable races in nearby districts. For example, look at how many votes it took to get elected alderman in the adjoining wards when the race was contested. Try to estimate the falloff rate, the voter fatigue factor, in your race. State and national races increase voter turnout, but these part-time voters don't vote in all the races on the ballot. For example, let's look at a sample city with 22,400 voters. In this city, only 14,700 of them voted for president in 2004. There was also a race for state supreme court on the ballot, but only about 10,000 of them voted in the supreme court race. So although there were actually 14,700 people who wen to the voting booth, 4,700 of them, 32 percent, did not think the supreme court race was important enough to bother voting. If you are in an ""unimportant"" race, sometimes called a ""low profile"" race, there will be this falloff in voter interest, and you have to know approximately how big it will be. No amount of campaign finance prowess is likely to help you overcome this voter dropoff at the polls. The good news is that while there might be a probable lower turnout for your particular political campaign election, that means you will need to get fewer votes to win the race. All elections boards keep records of the results in every political campaign election going back for several years. These records are public records and can be obtained at you local elections office. The people who work in elections offices are usually pretty good about helping you find what you need. We have always found them to be polite and helpful. You should keep in mind, however, that elections offices are always in a boom or bust cycle. Shortly before the filing deadline for the primary campaign season they are very busy, so if you go in then and ask to see the statistics, they might give you short shrift. A week later, they will probably have plenty of time and be glad to help with your campaign issues. The best time is long before the filing deadline, not so much because it is easier for the elections office clerks, but because the earlier you pick your number, the sooner you will know what you have to do to win. Analyzing the campaign issues and statistics is pretty simple. You look to see how other races turned out, paying particular attention to those years where there were races similar to yours. A three-way race is a lot different than a one-on-one political campaign, and of course the winning number of votes is lower. If one year there was a hot local campaign issue, like a tax levy, it was likely to have increased voter turnout for that year and you have to take that into account when figuring out how many likely voters there will be in your particular election."
11,Campaign Strategy to Win Your Political Election,politics," Getting good, solid statistics from the last few election campaign results in the race you plan on running in lets you determine a lot of information that will help you win at the polls. With this information, you'll be able to determine which precincts are favorable to candidates from your party regardless of the individual candidate's strength. Additionally, this valuable election campaign information will let you see which precincts are unfavorable to candidates in your party, where the swing voters are located, and which have an issue that might motivate voters at the polls on election day. You can build on the base of voters who identify with you in your election campaign because your party affiliation, but you cannot presume on them. You will have to campaign to these people, but elections are won and lost by reaching the swing voters, the people who are up for grabs. A successful candidate must take his election campaign to the swing voters. Once you have determined what your base vote will be, you can see how many swing voters you will need to win. The statistics will tell you where they are. You have to go through the campaign statistics, precinct by precinct, and think to yourself, ""I can get so many votes in this precinct, but not so many in this one, and I will lose by a lot of votes in the other one"" and so forth. When you have done your precinct-by-precinct analysis, you will have a much better idea of how you can get that magic number of votes. After choosing a political campaign slogan in your race for office, your next step as a candidate should be to get your hands on elections statistics from the last two or three cycles. The election statistics will tell you the results in the last elections, the total number who voted, the number who voted in your race, the number who voted in similar races. With this information, you come up with an average number of people who are likely to vote in your race. Divide that by two, and you have you target number of votes to win your political campaign. Once you have picked your number, you have to sit down with your campaign people and decide how you are going to get to that number, precinct by precinct. If the people in Ward Three Precinct C are madder than hell about the sewers backing up, you can look to getting some votes there. If, on the other hand, they just had a testimonial dinner for the councilman at the new recreation center he had built in the ward, and 500 people showed up, you can forget about winning there. Try to locate the swing precincts, that is, the precincts with swing voters. Few people are voting a straight ticket nowadays, but party affiliation still counts to some extent. Even many who call themselves Independents still tend, all things being equal, to vote more for candidates of one party more than the other. A swing voter can be defined as one who votes for the particular candidate, but not on the basis of party affiliation."
12,How to be a Winner in an Election Campaign for Political Office,politics," If you're considering the possibility of starting a campaign to run for political office, you might think that the first place to start is with researching local election statistics or putting together a donor list. In fact, the first and most important thing you should address in your campaign is your family, which will end up being the most important factor in whether or not you win on election day. Even if you're running a political campaign for a small local office like city council or school board, your family is going to be your biggest supporters. Many stresses go along with running as a candidate in a political campaign, and your family is going to be the ones who are most affected by the hectic schedule that comes along with it. Make sure that you include your family in any decision you make about starting a political campaign. Start things off by mentioning your interest in becoming a candidate to your spouse, and ask them for their opinion. After you find out how your spouse feels, mention the possibility to your children if they are old enough to understand. Let them know all of the sacrifices you will have to make to campaign for office, and ask for their genuine opinion. In addition to the stress that running a campaign can put on your family life, you should also expect additional stresses if you get elected as a public official. Although most local offices are part-time ventures, you will still have to dedicate a lot of time and resources to being an effective elected officeholder. Regardless of what your campaigning aspirations are, always remember that your family is more important than any elected office. With their support and help, your political career can be much more fruitful and rewarding.  But it's always good to analyze past election results to get a hand up on the competition! If you're a campaign manager who is running the election efforts of a political candidate, then analyzing election statistics from past years can help you get a better grasp on exactly what it will take to win your race. When you analyze the election statistics, you will know from the beginning how the election is likely to turn out if you do nothing, and if you work like a dog. You will see that you can count on getting 350 votes in good old Democratic Ward 5, Precinct C, easily. You will also realize that you will have to work very hard to get even 150 votes in Republican Ward 5, Precinct A. So if you are going to win at all, as a campaign manager you have to get your candidate at least 250 votes from the voters in Swing Ward 5, Precinct B. By using this kind of analysis as a campaign manager, you will already have begun to focus your campaign efforts even though your candidate has not even filed to run for office yet. The whole purpose of reviewing election statistics is to break down an overwhelming task into smaller workable units. It gives you a real advantage to know at the very beginning, I can win this if I get 250 votes in Precinct 5B. One main purpose to have a competent campaign manager analyze the statistics is so that you will not be intimidated by trying to go after 35,000 people, or 22,000 voters, or even 3,500 votes. Having a workable, attainable target number for each precinct gives a candidate a tremendous psychological edge."
13,Effective Campaign Management for New Political Candidates,politics," If you've made the decision to be a political candidate in a local election, then you've probably asked yourself how to campaign in an effective way in spite of the fact that you've never run for office before. There really aren't any well-kept secrets when it comes to local campaign strategies, and most of it comes down to working hard and doing the best job you can on the campaign trail. Local elections are great opportunities for new candidates to learn the ropes of how to campaign, and you should look at your race as an exciting experience, not be intimidated by it. If you've done your research and decided that your race is winnable, then campaigning like a pro is only a matter of working as hard as you can and putting your plan into motion. In local campaigns, door-to-door efforts can be extremely effective. Although statewide and congressional campaigns take place is districts that are much too large to mount effective door-to-door efforts, a city council or school board race is entirely different. Depending upon the size of your district, it's entirely possible that you could knock on every door more than once. Remember, knowing how to campaign is different than actually doing it. You can read as many political campaigning books as you want, but if you aren't motivated enough to actually implement the strategies you learn, then it won't do your campaign any good. The best campaign is the one that wins, and as your experience improves you'll start to get a better feel for what is working and what isn't on the campaign trail. If you've never run for office before or helped with political campaigns, then mounting your own bid as a candidate can initially seem daunting. As with most big undertakings, though, campaigns become much less intimidating if you do adequate research and put together a comprehensive plan before kicking things off. Good campaign plans usually start off with listbuilding of possible supporters, donors, and volunteers. If you've been involved in your community for any amount of time, there is probably a large amount of people locally who would be glad to offer their help on the campaign trail. Starting a list of the people who you think might be a good resource is the first step. The next part of your campaign plan should be to calculate how many votes you'll need to win your chosen office. You can do this primarily by looking at election results from previous years and taking note of how many votes the winning candidates received. After you've figured out how many votes you'll need to make your campaign successful on election night, you'll need to get a grasp on how much money it will take to get your message out to the public. Ask yourself how many mailers, yard signs and other campaign materials you will likely need to fund, and calculate as closely as you can how much it will all cost. Once you have familiarized yourself with how many votes you need and how much money will be necessary, political campaigns become much less intimidating. A good plan that is calculated in advance of election season will help you be a more effective candidate and make your chances of winning office much more likely."
14,Running as a Political Candidate Against Incumbent Politicians,politics," If you're a new candidate running a political campaign for office against an incumbent, you might realize something while you are pouring over past election statistics and voter lists: that your opponent is a politician who may be unbeatable. There are many competent, popular and experienced politicians who know how to win election campaigns. Your analysis may show you that you can't win. This, too, is worth knowing because you don't want to get into a campaign against a politician who you can't beat. If the votes aren't there, they aren't there. If you have to rely on the ""heart attack strategy,"" where your only chance of winning depends on your opponent dying of a heart attack, then perhaps you shouldn't file petitions to run a political campaign. There are, on the other hand, many politicians who are jerks and who can be easily picked off by a competent political campaign. If your opponent is one who can be picked off, it will show in the election statistics. They will show you exactly where and how you can do it. If there is an open seat with no incumbent, and you're looking for the edge, the election statistics will show you where it can be found. Reviewing election statistics is a subjective kind of analysis, of course, and whether or not you win is often a very iffy question. Realistically, your analysis is most likely to indicate that you might have a chance at winning your campaign against an incumbent politician, might be able to reach that magic number if everything goes right. It won't go all go right in your political campaign, but even at that, if your analysis leads you to believe that you might win, then you should go for it. The election statistics will tell you what it takes to win, what the target number is, and where those votes are.  But you should be careful about how you circulate your petitions, and the following story should illustrate that. In April of 1992, there was an article on the op-ed page of the New York Times (not a campaign endorsement, in this case) written by Larry Rockefeller, who wanted to run in the Republican campaign primary for U.S. Senator and had circulated nominating petitions. He complained bitterly in the article that when he filed his petitions with the board of elections they used every petty defect in form to invalidate the campaign petition. If they found one bad signature, instead of not counting it, they threw out the whole petition and all the good names with it. As a result of this hanky-panky, Rockefeller did not get on the ballot or get the chance to run a political campaign. Larry Rockefeller is a scion of one of the best-known Republican political campaign families in America and a man with sufficient resources to challenge any shenanigans in court, and they still did a job on him and his nominating petitions. The saddest part is that it was all legal. Think about that. If they can do it to him, the same thing can happen to you. While there are as many variations as there are states, getting on the ballot to run a Republican campaign for office is ordinarily done by nominating petitions. A person seeking to run for an office goes to the elections office and obtains the petition forms for that office. He fills out the petition form as candidate and signs it. In some states, the candidate's signature must be notarized. Underneath the Republican campaign candidate's part of the form there are lines for people, who must be registered voters, to sign their names petitioning that the candidate's name be put on the ballot. The candidate obtains the signatures of the required number of voters on his petitions and files them with the elections office. The board checks the petition to see if the names are valid, and if the petitions contain the required number of signatures. If so, they certify the petition, and the Republican candidate's name is put on the ballot to run in the upcoming political campaign. This is how it is done, in theory. In practice, though, it can often be another matter entirely."
15,How to Campaign Ethically for Office and Win Your Election,politics," Unethical stuff from opposing parties when you're trying to get your name on the ballot in a campaign race doesn't go on everywhere. The State of Kentucky, admirably, has done away with some campaign registration nonsense by simply requiring only two or four valid signatures for many local offices. Kentucky is the exception, and states like California, New York, Ohio (and probably your state) are the rule. The rule is: even if you try to comply with the petition requirements in your campaign race, they will do everything they can to use hyper-technical interpretations to try to invalidate your petitions. In order to avoid this in your campaign race, the people who circulate your nominating petitions have to be carefully instructed about what to do and what not to do. There are some common problems that come up on nominating petitions, and you need to have some idea of what these instructions ought to include. First, the candidate's portion of the nominating petition must be completed accurately for your particular campaign race. If the candidate's portion is not correct the entire petition will be declared invalid regardless of the number of signatures you have on it. For example, if the petition form requires the candidate's home address and precinct of residence, that must be included. If the candidate's signature is required to be notarized, then it must be notarized, and so on. Keep in mind that although we use the phrase ""nominating petition,"" the petition itself is often composed of several sheets. The petition form may have spaces for ten to twenty-five signatures, so if you need fifty or one hundred names, you will have to use separate sheets. Each separate sheet is called a part petition. Each part petition must be valid by itself, and comply with all regulations. There are basically two kinds of elections, the primary election campaign and the general election campaign, and usually the candidate files petitions to get on the ballot in the primary election. The primary ballot contains the names of all the candidates who want to run for that office. Whoever wins the primary election campaign will be on the ballot as the party's candidate in the general election. The general election decides who will hold that office. In some elections, there is no primary, but nominating petitions are still used. The candidate circulates and files petitions. If he has the minimum number of signatures, his name is put on the ballot in the general election along with all the other candidates who file valid petitions. In another variation, the party candidates file petitions and run in the primary, but a nonparty candidate may file petitions for that office as an independent. The two winners of the primaries, plus the independent candidate, will be on the ballot in the general election, in a so-called three way race. In still other elections, called bedsheet ballot elections, all candidates file petitions for one seat out of several and the top vote getters win. For example, there may be three seats open on the Board of Commissioners and eight candidates who file petitions for commissioner. All eight names are on the ballot, and the voters can vote for any three names. The top three vote getters win. On the other hand, the three commissioner seats may be elected separately too. Each commissioner seat is distinguished, usually by the date term begins, e.g., commissioner, term beginning January 1; commissioner, term beginning January 2; and so on. In that case, the nominating petition in the primary election campaign has to state specifically which term the candidate is running for."
16,Political Campaign Election Laws and Circulating Petitions,politics," Once your nominating petition for becoming a candidate in a race has been properly filled out, it is time to give it to a circulator who gets people to sign it. Sometimes the candidate can be a circulator, but not everyone can be a circulator. Most local campaigning election laws have specific requirements for the person who circulates the petition, even if it is the candidate himself. On most petitions, there is a part for the circulator to fill out, also. For example, after the circulator gets the signatures, he must certify at the end of the petition the number of signatures and that he witnessed each of the voters sign. Sometimes this certification must also be notarized. If the circulator's portion is incorrect, none of the signatures on that part of the petition will be valid. Always check the requirements for circulators. Even if the political campaign candidate's and the circulator's signatures are proper, some of the individual signatures might be declared invalid. Many of the petition forms we have looked at have a space after the signer's address for the person's resident precinct. This is to help the elections people when they check because they keep the list of registered voters' names by precinct. In some areas, each part petition can only contain signatures from one precinct to make validation of the names easier. In light of the fact that many elections offices are now fully computerized and names can be checked without reference to the voting precinct, these requirements are archaic, but they are still on the books and still used to trap the unwary. Be sure to check if your state makes having the precinct mandatory, or whatever, because the signature will not be valid without it. The nominating petition system if you want to run in a Democrat campaign for office is, unfortunately, subject to a lot of abuse (or for any political party, for that matter). Reasonable regulations are adopted to promote democracy and foster efficient elections. It is not unreasonable, for example, to require that a candidate get some voters' names on his petition. After all, if he can't get a few signatures, he is not likely to get any votes and it is a waste of taxpayers' money to have his name on the ballot. Too often, however, a reasonable regulation in a Democrat campaign is subverted for political purposes. The ""Ins"" use the law to keep the ""Outs"" out. In one state, a Democrat or Republican can get on the ballot with 50 signatures on the nominating petition, but a third-party candidate or an Independent needs 250. To get on the ballot for Judge of the Civil Court of Bronx County, New York, one must obtain signatures from 1 percent of the registered voters, but that means that a Republican needs about 1,500 while a Democrat campaign needs to have about 4,000 names. Even when some of these roadblocks have been removed, the Ins have resorted to hyper-technical applications of the law to disqualify Democrat campaign candidate petitions. In one case, a candidate had 50 names, just exactly the minimum number of signatures required, but state law allowed a signer to withdraw his name from a petition even after it had been filed. The opposition got one of the signers to withdraw his name, and the candidate's petitions were declared invalid because he had only forty-nine names, one short."
17,Political Campaigning and Election Petitions,politics," All of your political campaign petitions have to be filled out by a certain date before voters cast their ballots in the election, which may be weeks or even months before the actual election day. Check your local filing date deadline. Late petitions are not accepted in any state. After you get your political campaign petitions out to the circulators, you have to get them back on time. On time means, with enough time before the filing deadline for you to go over them carefully. You should check your own petitions with the same nitpicking zeal that the elections office will use. If you find a mistake, it can be corrected. If they find a mistake, you are out and the voters will not have a chance to cast their ballot for you. When you start getting your petitions back, you may find you have more than enough voter names on the petition. However, you may find that you have only near the minimum number, or that there is a problem with one of your campaign petitions. If one of your petitions is invalidated, you may not get on the ballot. It is better to throw out the problem petition and get more names on a new one, which you know is done correctly. In order to be able to do this, of course, means that you have to plan to get the petitions out, signed and back and still leave yourself time enough to check and get even more names if you happen to need them. Not everyone can sign a petition to get a candidate on the ballot for a reelection campaign. Generally, the signer must be a registered voter, and usually must be of the same political party as the candidate, and only Independents can sign Independent candidates' petitions. In some states, however, anybody can sign regardless of party affiliation. The signer almost always has to be a resident of that voting district, i.e., live in the same ward, town, county, etc., that the candidate is running in. Illegible signatures are often not counted for the reelection campaign, not because of any nefarious politicking, but simply because the signature cannot be read. Ask the signers to write clearly. There is no end to the things that can invalidate a signature or petition, so the best thing is to get more names on the reelection campaign petition than you actually need. The general rule of thumb is three to one. If you need one hundred valid names, file petitions containing three hundred names. But even that can get you into trouble, because most states have a maximum number of names that a candidate can submit. The validators at the Board of Elections do not have the time to search through a petition with one hundred signatures to just find one or two valid names, so limiting the names or part petitions to be filed makes sense. This too is a reasonable restriction that is subverted when carried to extremes. You would think that if a candidate filed more than the maximum, they could just look at the maximum number and not look at the extra names. Instead, they invalidate the entire petition, so the rule of thumb of 3 to 1 becomes 2.9 to 1, to avoid that trap."
18,A House Divided,politics," America is a great nation. In fact, in my opinion, America is the greatest nation on planet earth. You might ask, ""What makes America so great?"" I would answer, short and straight to the point, ""The American people!"" Embodied in the very being of the American people is the endurance of generations that will not let the nation fail or give up. We have seen much turmoil and many adverse conditions have arisen against us as a nation, but the American people labored hard, fought long, and united together, to overcome all of the adversity that was meant to destroy us. In times past this togetherness has kept us strong and united, giving meaning to a nation that took pride in its name, the United States of America. But in 2010, that same America has now become a house divided, and unless we can once again unite for the common cause of attacking the nation’s problems instead of attacking each other, we will all self destruct. We are a nation that wastes too much time bickering among ourselves to be of any good to each other, and although most Americans speak unity, there are a great number of Americans who only have self-seeking motives, and will stop short of nothing to accomplish their own ends, even if it means selling out to the very things that will eventually destroy us. Racism is one enemy that has been a thorn in the side of America since the nation was founded. Yet there are those in America who would say that racism is no longer a problem. But contrary to popular belief, racism is very much alive today. There are still places in America, like Jena, LA; where near riot conditions erupted because of a ""white"" tree, where black students were not allowed to sit during the heat of the day. Can you believe that—a white tree in the 21st Century! Sounds like something out of a 1950s time capsule. Another enemy can be found hidden in America’s segregated political parties, Democrats and Republican, each having their own right wing extremists and personal agendas. To these political parties it is all about liberalism vs. conservatism, but to millions of Americans the agendas of the two divided political parties is translated into joblessness, homelessness, and hungriness. Did we not as voters elect members of the United States Senate and the Congress to represent us? But after the election did not those whom we elected adorn themselves in garments of selfishness and masks of greediness only to forget us? Yet in their lies they each coin the phrase, ""We represent the American people."" But do they represent America as a whole, or just rich America? But the biggest enemy of all in America is greed, all brought about by tax laws that favor the rich, not to mention rising medical and insurance costs. The rich are getting richer while keeping the poor in a place where they will never move out of poverty. All the while Congress is fighting a President who inherited an economy already in shambles, and it is evident in their actions that the fight is not about helping the American people. It is about a political party who act like pouting children whose only motive is to get their way, and when they do not, they rebel with their resurrected ""Tea Parties."" These Tea Baggers should all be held accountable for promoting division among Americans based on their own selfish motives. The house that once was united is now divided, and this division is built on a false pride. If we don’t unite America the outcome and the future of our beloved and great country shall be one of destruction. For it is written, ""Pride goes before the fall."""
19,What Is the Biggest Story in Politics?,politics," There are many stories that seem to be quite large in the world of politics.  We do not have to be in an election year, to have politics be the biggest stories in the news circuit.  So, it is no surprise that the biggest story in politics right now surrounds the President of the United States of America, President Barack Obama.  With the current state of the economy, whether or not this were to make the news or not, many find themselves working hard to follow the United States politics.  In addition, with the current state of our international safety, we are certainly very inclined to follow these type of stories.  Having said that, one of the biggest stories in the news right now relates to President Obama's approach to the war on terror. Just like any other story in the world of politics, as much as President Obama's approach to the war on terror is of influence to the nature of the news story, it is also just as newsworthy what the people have to say.  After all, they contribute to dictating what the approaches should be in any given political issue.  After President Obama's recent address to the nation after the attempted terrorist attack on Christmas Day, and the recent terrorist threats that have been circulating, many seem to be quite confident in President Obama handling the war on terror. One of the biggest elements to this politics news story was the fact that President Obama had officially stated that we were at war.  Many times, the politics circuits have not quoted President Obama's administration as using the word ""war.""  Nevertheless, this time around, that was the case.  Since the politics circuits have conducted a live broadcast of the President's speech, new poll numbers have been release.  The polls state that there are many more people that are confident in the way that President Obama will protect us from terrorism than there are that are not confident. In regards to this politics story, there is also talks about the recent polls that have been released in terms of being scanned at the airport.  Many  people are quite surprised as to how the people decided to vote in this matter.  First of all, the question at hand is whether or not Americans thought that full body scanners should be used in U.S. Airports.  More than 70% felt that they should be used.  This is predicted to be because many people do not feel as though mechanical full body scanners are going to present much of a health risk, and they find full body scanners to be more effective.  Seems as though protection is more important than the threat of lack of privacy in today's society."
20,My visit to Iran,politics," My visit to Iran I went to Iran, the country of my birth, in November of 2009 and stayed there for two months after being away for 30 years. I had left Iran right before 1979 revolution that overthrew the Shah. Before I left for my visit back to Iran, I was feeling very agitated and depressed about the way things are here in the USA and I felt like I needed to get away for a while. My trip to Iran was a pleasant, interesting, and eye-opening trip, but at times I felt strongly the gloomy atmosphere that was overshadowing the country of my birth. People are not happy and satisfied with the way things are, and young people especially don’t have much hope for a better and more promising future. I was constantly asked this question: ""How is it in the USA — is it any better? Is it different?"" And my reply was ""Different? Yes. Better? I am not sure,"" because I felt the same gloomy and depressing atmosphere here in the USA, and I knew people in this country are also uncertain about their future and dissatisfied and unhappy about a lot of things. At times, I felt trapped…I was hearing almost the same stories from people miles away in another continent…people not being happy with their jobs, their relationships, struggling to make ends meet, the economic hardship that they have to endure, corrupt politicians, and so on and so on…I especially felt sad for the young ones. Iran’s population is more than 70 million and 75% of them are under the age of 30. The younger generation in Iran is highly educated and most of them have university degrees. I think obtaining a higher education for many of them has become a way of life! It gives them the opportunity to be independent, to have less boundaries, less limitations in their lives…and to have a glimpse of hope that someday they might see the light at the end of the dark tunnel! I promised my new young Iranian friends (boys and girls) that I would try to stay truthful to what I heard from them and to get their message across as best as I can. Their message as one of them simply put it to me is this: ""We want to live and enjoy life and have a promising future … a lot of us don’t want to get involved in the world of politics…the world of politics is a dirty world and has nothing to do with a real change and does not leave much room for idealistic ideas!"" While I was in Iran, I lived in a girls’ dormitory (filled mostly with university students from different cities of Iran) which was near Revolution Street, the street that most of the recent demonstrations passed by. Because of where I was housed, I had the opportunity to hear and watch from the balcony of the dormitory the demonstrations that took place while I was there. During my two months of stay in Iran I got the opportunity to talk to people who participated, as well as some who were heavily involved in organizing for these demonstrations. They were students, teachers, doctors, small businessmen, and even factory workers. I came out of these conversations with the understanding that there is a degree of political maturity among Iranian people and they are very courageous people with a great sense of pride. But there is no unified plan of action for people to get out in the streets, or for what the message of the demonstrations should be. People get out in streets for different reasons to express publicly their dissatisfaction and make demands for change! And some are even willing to face the harsh and cruel consequences of their actions. In Iran, most of the people that I talked to openly expressed their anger and dissatisfaction about the current economic situation in Iran, about high inflation, about lack of jobs, lack of business opportunities, about the disastrous outcomes of economic, trade and scientific sanctions enforced on Iran by the US and European countries. (for an introduction on the history of theses sanctions Wikipedia is reasonably good place to start http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._sanctions_against_Iran) My Iranian friends were surprised to hear that except for one or two organizations most progressive groups in this country have done NOTHING so far to stop these sanctions, and they were wondering if the people of this country have already forgotten the catastrophic result of the US sanctions on the Iraqi people during 1990s ?? Furthermore, Iranian people are very frustrated by the degree of corruption among their government officials, and they feel like they are being robbed of the money that should go toward providing more social services and creating more jobs for them. Many Iranians believe that there is a cold war going on between different factions of the Iranian government,  and they believe these factions serve the interest of countries such as US, Britain, China, Russia… The degree of economic dissatisfaction is very high but so is social and cultural dissatisfaction. Iranians think they are also being robbed of their cultural heritage and in protest a lot of young Iranian especially young girls are learning how to play traditional musical instruments, learning Persian calligraphy, and studying Persian literature…there is a great concern among anthropologists about our historical monuments and places that are not really being taken care of…there is a cultural war going on in Iran. Being a proud nation with more than 2500 years of history, Iranians are determined to keep their cultural heritage alive. This sense of nationalism especially is very strong among young people . While I was in Iran I promised myself that when I returned to the USA, and was asked questions about how things are in Iran, my response would be that things are very complicated and there are many layers to any given political, social, cultural and economical issue, and there are no black and white answers to any question that we might have. But here I am back in the USA and in a conversation that I had with a dear political activist a couple weeks ago, the first question that I was asked was ""while I was in Iran, did I see any street demonstrations, and in my opinion, are these demonstrations being led by the people or are they being organized by foreign agents?"" I was very much turned off by this question and it took me back to the meaningless conversations that I had with people before I left for Iran. To ask questions such as the one above is an attempt to simplify a political and social situation that by no means is as simple as yes-or-no answer. But here in the USA we are trained to think and operate that way! There are a lot of nuances involved in shaping any political or social situation in any country and Iran is no different. I think people in general and the ones who want to be in the business of changing the world in particular should better educate themselves about the social and political movements of this country and other countries to understand better how any political, social change happens in any given country. The social and political consciousness of people in any given country has HISTORY and if we are serious about changing things we better know this history! The Islamic Republic of Iran became the governing body of Iran after the Shah was overthrown in response to the genuine dissatisfaction of Iranian people with the way things were. This dissatisfaction was less evident among the middle class and upper class people of Iran than it was among the working class people and poor sections of the country. When the Islamic Republic of Iran became the governing body of Iran and so called Islamic rules were enforced upon people, radical changes started to take place in all aspects of Iranians’ life and the country went through a social and cultural changes as well as political changes. But 30 years later, one can clearly observe (and not just in big cities but also in small towns) that these rules and restrictions on the Iranian people on how to live, dress, or conduct one’s day to day business are not being followed by many! In the past 30 years, average and ordinary Iranians gradually have changed their situation and have broken some of these rules and restrictions whenever and however it was possible for them to do so. Ultimately forcing the government officials to leave them alone in some aspects of their personal lives if not all! But when it comes to change the resistance does not always come from the ruling powers and sometimes the resistance to change comes from different groups of people within the society and as result creates tension among them. I felt this tension at times during my two months in Iran. That is why I feel like at this point, Iran is a country of opposite forces (socially, politically, culturally) coexisting side by side and pushing and pulling the country in different direction. But how long these opposite forces can continue living side by side? I am not sure. What happened right after the June 2009 presidential election on the streets of Iran was a representative of a desire among some Iranian people, especially the younger generation, for some radical changes in the political and social system of their country. What is being attacked in recent demonstrations goes beyond attacking individuals who currently represent the system. They are attacking the system itself…That is why in recent demonstrations you will hear people say: Death to the Dictator, Death to the supreme leader of Islamic Republic of Iran, and We say no to the West; we say no to the East; we want an Independent Republic of Iran. When I heard it myself in the last demonstration that took place in Iran, I could not help myself from shouting it as loud as I could from the balcony of our dormitory as demonstrators were passing by and being violently attacked by Revolutionary Guards and Basij military forces … Some of the people who I talked to think the current government should be replaced by a secular type of government. I found it very surprising that even among young practitioners of Islam, there is this strong belief in separation of religion from politics now. Some are suggesting the type of government that exists in Moslem countries such as Turkey or the type of governments that exists in countries such as Sweden or Norway. Some people are very clear as to what sort of government should replace the current government of Iran and some are not …but what is clear is that they want a democratic system that will be at the service of the people. In the past 30 years,  Iranian people in their attempt to create a more democratic and just society have made some progress through their civic organizations, their own personal resistance to rules and civil disobedience activities. Iranian people know that in their struggle for change not only they have to deal with resistance from their own government officials but also they have to deal with manipulation of their struggle by agents of foreign countries, political groups in Iran or outside of Iran. Of course, knowing that through different means of operation, superpowers always want to interfere with the affairs of Third World countries and manipulate their struggle for independence, freedom and democracy in way that it will serve their interests…does not undermine the genuine struggle of people of these countries… The bottom line is that the ruling power whether in this country or Iran have no regard for the will and needs of their people…otherwise we would live in societies that people were more content and happier with their lives and less worried about their future, the future of their children and their grandchildren. Here in this country people are losing their jobs, their homes and their livelihoods and there is still talk about sending more troops to the Middle East or other parts of the world to wage more wars. Anyone who thinks that here in the USA people are enjoying more than a superficial degree of political freedom and democracy better read the following article: Democracy in America Is a Useful Fiction by Chris Hedges http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/democracy_in_america_is_a_useful_fiction_20100124/ As I have told my new friends in Iran, people in USA have more personal freedom than people in Iran, but there is a big difference between having a personal freedom and having a political freedom which I don‘t think exists in this country. And of course, one should expect some degree of personal freedom in a country that consider itself a model for freedom and democracy for the rest of the world! So I wish American people would put more focus on their own struggle for freedom and democracy in this country and let the rest of us in other countries worry about freedom and democracy in our countries. In the past couple months, I have been thinking a lot about what pushes a society to go through some meaningful changes and how do these changes take place. How do we go about creating democratic societies that it will respond to the basic needs of ALL its citizens and in ALL aspects of their lives. How does a governing body of any society becomes a TRUE representation of ALL its citizens ? Thanks, Azi Jan 2010"

1,Lito Atienza For Manila Mayor - Making Prolife A Centerstage,politics," In the forthcoming Manila elections, a nominee with supreme pro life advocacy has indicated his desire to lead Manila to a new beginning. Lito Atienza for Manila mayor is a motto which represents a suitable chapter to the vast history of Manila. His base in Philippine politics is a soaring one, and this he shares with his family background. In the upcoming Manila elections, it would be hard to go against this man. Lito Atienza is a pious Roman Catholic, who's also President of Pro-Life Philippines. Together with his spouse, this candidate for the Manila elections gained international prominence in Rome as an official delegate in the Pontifical Council for the Family. He was honored with a standing ovation for emphasizing that the Philippines has the highest percentage of citizenry who values life, family and the elderly. Lito Atienza for Manila mayor entails pro-life in our country. Even during his former incumbency in Philippine politics in the City of Manila, he opposed all forms of contraception or abortion or sex education programs. Lito Atienza for Manila mayor would stand for an administration that will be perfectly pro-life from top to bottom. We should vote for this man during the Manila elections if we oppose abortion or those who are contrary to natural conception. The state of Philippine politics would certainly need a religious leader who has values such as him. To bolster up the Lito for Atienza for Manila mayor credentials, he constituted Rachel's Support Group, a group of volunteers who bore post abortion syndrome. This group of this amazing candidate for the Manila elections held counseling to women contemplating abortion and aimed at discouraging them from doing so. Because of his efforts in Philipine politics, thousands of women were given the right perspective and thousands of babies were saved. These are simply few of the causes why Lito Atienza for Manila mayor should be a battle cry. Lito Atienza for sure belongs to the old guard of Philippine politics. But he lies in to the honorable side of this vein of the political population. He has a strong educational background, with kin who are responsible public servants like himself. Aside from this, he has the core values of pro-life precepts which makes him a morally good potential mayor. Come voting day, these achievements of Lito Atienza are directed at the vanguard of our consciousness. We have a potential mayor who is pro-life, who is socially conscious, and who is helpful. We have a potential mayor who grew up in the city, and whose grandest ambition is to make it great. If you are a member of the electorate of the City of Manila, the most logical thing is to go for this man. This coming Manila elections, we should have a battle cry for the electorate members of the city of Manila. Lito Atienza for Manila Mayor. This is the best motto because the man is certainly prolife, religious, humble, has a strong educational background and is really intent to elevate the city. Moreover, he comes from a distinguished family who are constant public servants in Philippine politics."
2,Indian unorganized retail sector & its challenge,politics," Indian unorganized retail sector & its challenge India is the only one country having the highest shop density in the world, with 11 outlets per 1000 people (12 million retail shops for about 209 million households). Rather we can see the democratic scenario in Indian Retail (because of low level of centralization, low capital input and due to a good number of self organized retail). India started its Retail Journey since ancient time. In Ancient India there was a concept of weekly HAAT, where all the buyers & sellers gather in a big market for bartering. It takes a pretty long times to & step to shape the modern retail.  In between these two concepts (i.e. between ancient retail concept & the modern one there exist modern kirana/ mom and pop shops or Baniya ki Dukan. Still it is predominating in India So the Indian retail industry is divided into two sectors- organized and unorganized. Organized retail sector refers to the sectors undertaken by licensed retailers, that is, those who are registered for sales tax, income tax, etc. These include the corporate retail formats of the exclusive brand outlets, hypermarkets, supermarkets, departmental stores and shopping malls. Unorganized retailing, on the other hand, refers to the traditional formats of low-cost retailing, for example, hand cart and pavement vendors, & mobile vendors,  the local kirana shops, owner manned general stores, paan/beedi  shops, convenience stores, hardware shop at the corner of your street selling everything from bathroom fittings to paints and small construction tools; or the slightly more organized medical store and a host of other small retail businesses in apparel, electronics, food etc. Characteristics of unorganized retail——- Small-store (kirana) retailing has been one of the easiest ways to generate self-employment, as it requires limited investment in land, capital and labour.  It is generally family run business, lack of standardization and the retailers who are running this store they are lacking of education, experience and exposure. This is one of the reason  why productivity of this sector is approximately 4% that of the U.S. retail industry. Unorganized retail sector is still predominating over organized sector in India, unorganized retail sector constituting 98% (twelve million) of total trade, while organized trade accounts only for 2%. The reasons might be- In smaller towns and urban areas, there are many families who are traditionally using these kirana shops/ ‘mom and pop’ stores offering a wide range of merchandise mix. Generally these kirana shops are the family business of these small retailers which they are running for more than one generation. These kiran shops are having their own efficient management system and with this they are efficiently fulfilling the needs of the customer. This is one of the good reasons why the customer doesn’t want to change their old loyal kirana shop. A large number of working class in India is working as daily wage basis, at the end of the day when they get their wage, they come to this small retail shop to purchase wheat flour, rice etc for their supper. For them this the only place to have those food items because purchase quantity is so small that no big retail store would entertain this. Similarly there is another consumer class who are the seasonal worker. During their unemployment period they use to purchase from this kirana store in credit and when they get their salary they clear their dues. Now this type of credit facility is not available in corporate retail store, so this kirana stores are the only place for them to fulfill their needs. Another reason might be the proximity of the store. It is the convenience store for the customer. In every corner the street an unorganized retail shop can be found that is hardly a walking distance from the customer’s house. Many times customers prefer to shop from the nearby kirana shop rather than to drive a long distance organized retail stores. This unorganized stores are having n number of options to cut their costs. They incur little to no real-estate costs because they generally operate from their residences. Their labour cost is also low because the family members work in the store. Also they use cheap child labour at very low rates. As they are operating from their home so they can pay for their utilities at residential rates. Even they cannot pay their tax properly. Currently the value of the retail market is estimated at around $ 270 billion with a growth rate of 5.7 per cent per annum according to the Indian retail report which creates a big threat for the small unorganized retailers. The well established organized retail sector in India are Pantaloon Retail, Shoppers’ Stop, Spencers, HyperCITY, Lifestyle, Subhiksha  & newly emerging Reliance etc. Over 20,000 new retail outlets are expected to open within this segment. Major corporate retail like Wal-Mart and have started to try and take over the Indian retail sector. But in India the unorganized retail is a source foods and other necessities of millions of Indians , major link between rural and urban societies. Not only that it is also act like a convenience store for the customer offering right product at right time at right place. In a country with large numbers of people, and high levels of poverty, this model of retail democracy is the most appropriate So these unorganized retail sector need to be promoted so that they can organize & supply food to Indian consumer. Now the question is how to promote this sector- The suggestions might be- (a) Establishment of Retailer co-operatives among retailers which is highly required for the sustenance of the unorganized retail sector (b) Merger and buy-out of weak retailers by a stronger one that would give a new horizon to the small retailer (c)  Setting up of franchisee organization may also help in strengthening the position of the retailers. The franchiser can exert a tremendous control over the way retailing is done. (d) There must be good network connection between retail organizations, the suppliers and other channel members to use compatible technology so that they can build strong distribution set-up to satisfy the customers. (e) Setting up of more and more non-store retailing centers would also ensure a strong retailing organization. Non-store retailing makes implementation of modern principles easier and less costly. (d) Moreover there must be a change in the mindset of the unorganized retailer. They have to understand the pulse of the trend. They have to understand, come forward & lead this change management then only this sector not only can exist but flourish."
3,Youtube Censorship Debate: Activists announce PRUDETUBE DAY.,politics," Youtube Censorship Debate: Activists announce PRUDETUBE DAY. Every 13th. Every month. This thing is becoming viral: ""Fed up with Youtube Censorship"" a dude calling himself ""Defcon"" uploaded a WEIRD video to Youtube announcing an ""international PRUDETUBE DAY. Every 13th. Every month."", where everybody uploads content ""no puritan eye ever wanted to see"". Within hours the video had over 100000 Clicks: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG8J6v5FXvY Why is this getting so huge? Well, it´s because Defcon-dude does make a point. Many of you have probably been confronted with Youtube´s restrictive copyright and content policies in the past: If Youtube´s automatic software finds you are infringing audio or video copyrights they will immediately mute or ban your video. Now, apart from filling out the protest form youtube supplies – which will usually take weeks and months to be answered – there is a work-around: Before uploading, you pitch-shift the outlawed audio material by around two semi-tones and/or you distort the outlawed video if you´re also having problems with video copyright. Now, Youtube´s infringement software will probably leave you alone when you re-up your file. But IT IS annoying & takes hours to find the right settings. Second, if you upload material that contains anything too rude for these old puritans you don´t really have a chance against Youtube in terms of legally settling the issue. They won´t give you a reason WHY your video was banned and they won´t answer any emails to service@youtube.com. Ever. In cases like these there are three strategies to protect your work. Strategy 1: Upload your material to dozens of Youtube-accounts. When one account goes down, open another and re-up. Strategy 2: Upload your material with added censorship bars hiding the rude material from puritan eyes. This will also make a point, that Youtube is not the free community of creative exchange that it pretends to be. Strategy 3: Now, this is something that these kids from 4chan have tried. There was one dedicated day, Youtube-Porn-Day, where all users involved randomly uploaded videos containing – usually well-hidden – obscenity, giving Youtube the hassle of finding inappropriate content among millions of videos. So this does make a disruptive statement about Youtubes content policy and may be the only possibility for users to create public awareness about Youtube´s increasing harassment of users. So maybe this explains the extraordinary success of the ""Prudetube""-Video, which is still online and growing every second, becoming one of the biggest viral campaigns in internet history.

4,"Argentine president: Eat pork, spice your sex life",politics," Argentina’s president thinks eating pig meat is really sexy. Many people in this beef-loving nation reacted with surprise on Thursday after Cristina Fernandez promoted pork in a speech during which she not only said pork is better than Viagra, but suggested she’s personally proven it. ""I didn’t know that eating pork improved sexual activity,"" Fernandez said in a meeting with representatives of the swine industry late on Wednesday. ""It is much more gratifying to eat some grilled pork than to take Viagra."" She even joked that ""it was all good"" after she enjoyed some pork with her husband, former President Nestor Kirchner. ""I think they might be right,"" Fernandez said to a laughing audience. The president’s half-joking speech in which she announced subsidies for the pork industry won prominent play on television and radio stations, prompting discussions on whether Argentines should add more pork to their diet. Argentines are among the world’s biggest consumers of red meat, and most people here stubbornly reject the idea of replacing beef with chicken, pork or other meats. Despite Argentina lying along rich South Atlantic fisheries, seafood is rarely seen on dinner tables. Fernandez approved subsidies to keep the price of pork low despite inflation, and her government has also recently subsidized red meat producers after beef supplies sharply declined in the South American country. The head of the association of pork producers, Juan Luis Uccelli, supported Fernandez’s speech by saying that Denmark and Japan have a much more ""harmonious"" sexual life than the Argentines because they eat a lot of pig meat. ""In Osaka, Japan, there is a village in which the people who reached 105 years old and ate a lot of pork had a lot of sexual activity,"" he told radio Mitre. Others were skeptical. ""There is no study showing that pork meat significantly improves sexual activity,"" Amado Bechara, a specialist in sexual dysfunction, told the website of the newspaper La Nacion."
5,The Hard Lesson Which Ever Beckons,politics," Deepak Chopra once said, in one of his innumerable books, that everyone is doing the best they can, given their level of understanding. What he meant I think, was that most of the time, most people have sincere motives, no matter how deeply flawed their thinking might actually be. And, we should, he claims, honor at least the sincerity. That is of course the rub, as I survey a host of issues that have arisen in the past few days, trying very hard to wrap my brain around the thinking on the part of others that leaves me baffled and need I add angry? There’s a book out called Game Changers, and in it, among others, there are claims about John Edwards and his wife Elizabeth. They are not pretty. Elizabeth is portrayed as arrogant, and belittling to her husband and John Edwards, is portrayed, as, well, much the liar. He touted honesty, yet was having a brazen affair, one well known to his wife apparently. And it seems that he soon turned to bargaining his ""power base"" for a second shot at the VP and later still, he reduced that to Attorney General. I began to question my ability to judge character, since I had, along with the Contrarian had nothing but good things to say and think about Edwards during the campaign. We thought him a decent, honorable, honest, man who firmly ""got"" the plight of the working person in this country. And, as the  Massachusetts election takes place today, I wonder how did things come to this? How do people who are so much like me, think so very differently? How is it that we see the world in nearly opposite ways? The psychologists  and brain experts tell us that we are deeply shaped by our environment and we mostly see the world through a thick lens of personal incidents that we are not remotely aware of. We THINK we see the world as it is. The trouble is that the next guy, who votes the opposite of you thinks the same thing. We both can’t be right. The more our lives are limited I believe by lack of education past high school, lack of travel around the world, lack of moving, lack of all those disparate experiences with people of different background and history, all the lack of inquisitiveness that we so often lose in the quest to ""make a living,"" come home to haunt us when we are confronted by serious issues that affect us all. We can, it seems, only approach those issues, those conflicts, through our own lens of experience. We can only match and discard similarities and differences by the size of our bag of tricks. Those of us who have led small sheltered lives have a smaller and more personal opinion than those of us who have experienced the world in a wider way. How did we get to this polarizing place that defines the American landscape? I’m convinced it happened with our generation and what appears to be a frightening reality. Unlike virtually every previous generation, ours is the first to not improve our personal life style vis a vis our parents. We have turned back and are, if we are lucky, no worse than they, but certainly for most of us, no better. That has caused most of us to stop in full stride and ask what has gone wrong in America? We were raised on the supposition that our lives would be richer and fuller than our parents. We would have more, travel more, know more. We would have more leisure. Our lives would be easier with more time for creative pursuits and family. Instead, we are doing worse almost across the board. And when we reached that hard place of reality, we looked to why. We all saw that an extraordinary few got immeasurably richer, but the middle class lost significant ground, and the working class as much again. The poor grew. And we saw the imbalance, and we wondered why. A significant portion of us realized that unbridled corporate greed and excess were the problem, and that the rich had negotiated a tax system that favored them against all others. They were now truly ""filthy"" rich. The gap grew wider and we blamed them and their penchant for homes by the dozen and yachts and diamonds. We believed that all humans were entitled to basics of food, clothing, housing, education, health care and decent jobs, and the rich were withholding that from us to profit themselves. We saw the solution in a redistribution of wealth. We saw it as justice and equality. A significant portion of us however, saw things very differently. From a different up bringing, different location, different exposures, some came to a radically different conclusion. They concluded that it was government taxing and interference in the form of regulation that was stymieing their well being. They for reasons that are inexplicable to me, believed the words of the very people who had it all–the rich. If only government allowed the free market economy to function untouched, all would be well, as the profits would ""trickle"" down to all. Why they believe this, I have no clue, but believe it they do. And today, we can barely converse with each other. We are nearing a place of plain hatred for the other side. We are ascribing to each other evil motives, evil designs, and unadulterated greed and selfishness. We are either that, or we are Utopian foggy headed children who live in a state of perpetual flower power. I strain to see the logic of their beliefs. Some on the other side no doubt do the same as to me. But until we unscramble the presumptions we are secretly keeping, knowingly or not, we shall never grant to each other a modicum of ""sincerity."" We shall forever ascribe selfish reasons. This is not to say that each side is equally right. For indeed, one can still conclude after seeing the world view of another, that they are horridly wrong and why. But at least in understanding, we are ready to step into the breach with education and alternative experiences that can hopefully impact the thinking of those we now are poised to hate. It’s how I feel today, but depending on what happens in Massachusetts today, I may not feel like playing at all tomorrow."
6,2010 Automated Election- A Vision of Philippines fight Against Corruption,politics," We have been in the midst of poverty for a very long time. We have suffered theft, injustice and manipulation since we have mistakenly elected those clever officials, in a sense that they paid millions to dictate the ballots and to harvest billions in return. This coming 2010 election does Juan dela Cruz already has the power to utter? Are we sure that this is finally our last stand for CHANGE? Whether it is Noynoy who swore not to steal, or Manny who swam in the river of garbage, changes in our system must always comes to the understanding of every Filipino that everyone of us has the potential to choose to excel and to not suffer from poverty anymore. Seeing the trend we have been silently keeping, it makes me feel devastated to know that in every average Filipino home, if the couple has 4 children, chances are only one of the four will continue in college, what kind of future will the other 3 will have?  and to site another popular example, if the mother is a servant the greater the chances that her children will be in the same shoes too. Now the purpose of this article is to somehow impart important reminders and precaution on how to vote wisely in this coming 2010 automated election. I strongly believe that this automation is the first key to at least lessen the chances of manipulation involving our votes. We are assured that the system that will be used for this coming election is hacker proof, meaning computer hackers has no chance of invading the system hence sabotaging the election. Just to site few countries that have been using this system are USA, UK, Canada, Australia and a lot of highly industrialized countries. Second, is up to the human responsibility. Knowing your candidates is the next step. Watch debates or forums and even go out and be part of the meeting de advance of the candidates. Use your ability to think and judge whether they are saying the truth or not. Take note of what they are saying, don’t be easily swayed by their sweet words and promises, remember that the future of your children and of your country depends on your ability to criticize and scrutinize each platform. Thirdly, is be cautious of their campaign strategy, especially those who have been polluting the airwaves with their campaign ads every 4 to 5 minutes, it should be an interesting strategy of why spend millions or even billions of money for the ads in exchange what should be the price in return. I have read an article from a famous author who has been observing politician’s campaign behavior since Marcos’ regimen; he said on one of his article that the Eagerness to win may not be the same as the Eagerness to serve. That might be true, genuine service to others can be done in our simplest act everyday, now the psychology of politicians is a different story. We have been tackling this corruption issue since the day I was born, this might sound a little bit overuse now, but the liberation and fate of this country depend solely in the ability of every Filipino to think and observe. You don’t need a degree to do that, you just need a receptive ear and a just mind."
7,What the Obama Administration Can Teach You About Fundraising – 2,politics," In the previous article we looked at how Obama raised money for his campaign. With his master list of donors and campaign aids keeping in touch with them and always soliciting funds Obama was able to tap into money and easily pass the $84 million given through federal means. ""The unbelievable outspending that the Obama campaign has been able to do has just tilted the playing field enormously,"" says Josh Israel, director of the Buying of the President project at the Center for Public Integrity in Washington, D.C. This past American presidential campaign was so big that in 2004 between George W. Bush and John Kerry they raised $696 million between them. Obama spent $650 himself just on the campaign and the inauguration will cost even more. Political Fundraising Tapping Into Social Media So just how did Obama raise those massive numbers from his master list of donors? The Washington Post says of Obama, ""Along with thousands of first-time donors who sent $50 or $100 from their home computers, the report is to list scores of long time political insiders who funneled stacks of  $2,300 checks to Obama's accounts. The campaign announced earlier this month that Obama has received money from more than 100,000 people, including 50,000 Internet donors "" This could translate into a non-profit or schools fundraising campaign by letting technology help them. Use all the sources to get your cause in front of people for exposure. A lot of these new media ways are also cost effective so help to keep down your advertising expenses as well. Obama relied heavily on new technology for his win. He set up his website to accept donations, petitioned supporters through email and was well represented through his supporters on blogs and facebook. Anytime anyone said they supported Obama it was mentioned that they just donated to his campaign and how much they gave. Make The Donor Feel Vital to Success Obama is reported by some donors to make them feel like they are integral to the success of the fundraising campaign. This can be used as a great way to make people feel like they are important to the mission. Tap into their passion and speak to them how your organization helps people and changes lives. You may say that this can’t be done at the level of your organization. Maybe not at the level of success that Barak Obama generated but the tools that he used are abundantly plentiful and with the help of the new media are extremely useful and cost effective."
8,What has the Industrial Revolution Done For You?,politics," ""Truly, we are rich, far richer than we think; rich in what we already possess, richer still in the possibilities of production of our actual mechanical outfit; richest of all in what we might win from our soil, from our manufactures, from our science, from our technical knowledge, were they but applied to bringing about the well-being of all."" --Peter Kropotkin, 1892 ""The Conquest of Bread,"" Chapter 1, Part I Everything we consume today is a product of machines, technology, art, and science. From your bread to your clothing -- from the place where you live and sleep, to the place where you labor and create: everything we use today is the product of a massive industrial complex. It includes engineering designers, mathematicians, and architects as much as it requires assembly line workers, truckdrivers, and warehouse laborers. There are some cases where there is specialized labor instead of machine labor, such as in construction. But the builder who is hammering window frames into an apartment is doing it with tools made in a factory. Without them, his job would be impossible, and with primitive, hand-made tools, the task would need significantly more time. Even where manufacturing and production aren't directly involved, all industries have a dependence on them; without the tractors and combine harvestors, there would be very little food, and industry can't operate without healthy employees. And this is besides the tools, equipment, and raw material that other industries need. ""The spirit of oppression, the spirit of servility, and the spirit of fraud, these are the immediate growth of the established administration of property. They are alike hostile to intellectual improvement. The other vices of envy, malice, and revenge are their inseparable companions."" --Thomas Malthus, 1798 ""An Essay on the Principle of Population,"" Chapter 10 The industrial revolution made production and work far more efficient. One person today can produce what fifty workers could produce three or four centuries ago. But if this is true, why are we working the same amount, or in some cases, working even more? It might be considered a paradox, but as soon as productivity went up with the Industrial Revolution, working hours significantly rose. Sometimes they went as high as fifteen, sixteen, or twenty hours a day. These conditions persist even today, where Capitalism exploits underdeveloped nations. How much each hour of labor produces has increased by one hundred fold; but the hours of working have increased. In contrast this, the rate of wages and living conditions has only slowly increased compared to the rates of profits and wealth. As profits reached record highs during the boom of the 1990's, there were still hundreds of millions the world over without running water. ""This industrial government makes the real laws of the land. It determines who shall and who shall not work and how long and for what wages. That is, it has the power to say who shall live and who shall not live. It legislates as regards the amount of protection the worker shall receive while at work. It holds in its hands the powers of both the industrial and political governments. It has decreed, in order that profits may be increased, that the workers shall suffer slavery, starvation, disease and death."" --Big Bill Haywood, with Frank Bohn ""Industrial Socialism,"" Part 4: Industrial Freedom, the Growth of Socialism It's still a world where something as common as the flu takes the lives of thousands of children daily -- not because of an unwillingness to work in the parents, but because of private ownership and management of the land, which has been directed to serve the few and not the masses. It is a world where factories and manufacturing plants have poisoned the air, destroyed the atmosphere, and filled the oceans with tons of mercury. Something as simple as a children's toy can give you lead poisoning, and something as common as a car can puts cancerous toxins into your body. More than any generation, you are commonly exposed to these dangers, but healthcare isn't free -- you work more, suffer more, but you are capable of producing more. If we want to create a world where our production serves us and isn't used against us, we need to unionize as a class against Capitalism. Through a General Strike, we can cripple the Capitalist economy, and subdue our masters to our demands. And all struggles and battles of the one, great union will be preparing it for the day when it completely abolishes the Capitalist system. ""The simple fact is that industrial conditions have undergone such a complete change that now the trade union, instead of uniting the workers, divides them, incites craft jealousy, breeds dissension and promotes strife—the very things capitalists desire; for so long as the working class is divided, the capitalists will be secure in their dominion of the earth and the seas, and the millions of toilers will remain in subjection."" --Eugene Victor Debs, 1905 ""Class Unionism"" Punkerslut,"
9,You're Working Too Fast!,politics," ""Very often the idler is but a man to whom it is repugnant to make all his life the eighteenth part of a pin, or the hundredth part of a watch, while he feels he has exuberant energy which he would like to expend elsewhere. Often, too, he is a rebel who cannot submit to being fixed all his life to a work-bench in order to procure a thousand pleasures for his employer, while knowing himself to be far the less stupid of the two, and knowing his only fault to be that of having been born in hovel instead of coming into the world in a castle."" --Peter Kropotkin, ""The Conquest of Bread,"" 1892, Chapter 12, Part IV In every age, there has always been massive unemployment. There have always been teeming crowds begging for work, hoping for even the lowest paying job. Even when the economy is soaring, and profits are peaking, there are still billions without bread, millions without homes. Whether founded on imperialism or shared wealth, all social orders have had the ugly characteristic of want and poverty. Why is there so much misery? Why is it that there is so many who beg for work, when there are so many empty lands? Every age, we invent new tools to replace the old, and our ability to grow food increases. The labor of one farmer today can produce food for themselves and a hundred families. We continue to reduce the amount of time it takes to mine ore, to harvest wheat, to shape molten iron into every useful form. But why is it that there are still so many who want work, so many who are begging to cultivate the land beneath their feet? ""A panic comes, industry is paralyzed, because with machinery you can produce so much more than your paltry wage will allow you to consume. You make all things in great abundance, but you can not consume them. You can only consume that part of your product which your wage, the price of your labor power, will buy. If you cannot consume what you produce, it follows that in time there is bound to be overproduction, because the few capitalists cannot absorb the large surplus. The market is glutted, business comes to a standstill and mills and factories shut down. At such a time Chicago is hit, and hit hard; and you workingmen find yourselves out of employment, a drug on the market. Nobody wants your labor power, because it cannot be utilized at a profit to the capitalist who owns the tools, and when he cannot use your labor power at a satisfactory profit to himself he doesn't buy it."" --Eugene Victor Debs, ""Class Unionism,"" 1905 The problem is that the business owner always takes away a great profit from his possession, leaving the the worker with a pitiful wage. The destitute laborers spend almost every penny of their pay, to satisfy their necessities, and to have some luxury to forget their daily, eight-hour sacrifice. But the individual capitalist swims in wealth, and they horde it up. The workers, unable to buy all that they can produce, soon are making too much. Then, some of them are laid off, and these, too, cease to reliable and consistent consumers. Consumption falls again, the work force is decreased, this repeats, and then we have the beginning, cyclical effects of a recession. Part of the difficulty is that you are working too fast! If you didn't produce so much, they would be able to hire back the other laborers. The real essential problem is that industry is owned and organized by the wealthy class -- it is directed towards the profit and interest of the landlord and the banker. But the practical, everyday problem is that every laborer makes so much more than they personally consume. Of course, you'll get fired if you slow down... unless all workers slow down together. Our power is best realized in the one, big union! ""Only if he is willing to accept of the hazards of living by his faith or his wits can the man without money avoid living as a slave to the clock."" --George Woodcock, 1944 ""The Tyranny of the Clock"" Punkerslut,"
10,How To Get Involved In Politics,politics," Other than obvious things like voting, it is easy to get involved in politics.  It can be done in four easy steps right from your home computer.  The first step is to get to know you Congressmen in the House of Representatives and contact them; let them know how you feel.  Second, you have to get familiar with your senators in your state and contact them as well.  Third, stay on top of what the President is doing and write or call the White House.  Fourth, you have to stay current with the events in Washington D.C. 1st Step: Getting to know your Representative (Rep.) in the House Getting to know your Rep. in the house is easy, but very important.  Your Representative does just what his/her title refers: represents you and the people in you congressional district.  They are there to speak your voice to congress and the president.  A problem lies when the Americans in a particular district do not share their voice, this gives the Rep. the ability to take his/her own agenda or the agenda of the few that do contact him/her, and we both well know that is not a good thing.  To contact your Rep. ""Click Here"", type in your zip code and follow the contact links.  It is just that easy 2nd Step: Get familiar with the senators from your state. The Senate is the other side of Congress, opposite the House of Representatives and was created by our founding fathers to give each state equal representation, unlike the House, which is controlled by population.  Knowing your senators is equally as important as your Rep. in the House.  When a bill is created and is voted on by congress, it is voted on by the House and the Senate.  The bill has to have majority votes both in the Senate and the House to reach the President to be signed into law.  This is why projecting your voice to your senators is so important; they vote on bills just as the House does.  If there was a bill that has been approved in the House, then now the Senate will be debating and voting not long after.  It is very important to let your senators know how you feel.  Contacting your senators is easy, ""Click Here"", select your state, and follow the contact information. 3rd Step: Follow the actions and agenda of the President. As much as you may dislike or disagree with the President, the President will have a direct impact on your life.  The President usually sets the tone and puts forth the agendas to be voted on in congress.  The President also places a tremendous amount of pressure on congress to put together bills in his/her’s best interest.  The President also has the power to veto a bill if he/she does not agree with it.  And usually after a veto the bill dies or it takes a 2/3 votes in both the Senate and the House for the bill to become law.  With that said, it is very important to follow the President and it is easy to do, ""Click Here"" and you can get updated information on what the President is up to.  Don’t agree with it?  Let him/her know. 4th Step: Stay current with the events in Washington D.C. Staying current with what’s going on in Washington is important for obvious reasons.  You have to know what’s happening to make you voice viable.  Simply ranting to your congressmen or the president about what you father, mother or friend tells you are simply sharing your father, mother or friend’s voice; you’re still mute and trivial. And it’s easy to stay up date with current events on Capitol Hill.  Visit ""Best For The U.S."" Daily and get the latest, unbiased news.  Take that news and let your congressmen know what you think and how you feel. Using the four steps talked about above, we can all make a difference in our country.  This country was built and constructed with the idea that the American citizens would be involved and voicing their opinion.  Without our voices, we are at the mercy of those we elect.  Visit ""Best The For U.S."" and let them know that we have the authority."
11,Can the Worker's Party Help You?,politics," ""Nothing can present to our judgment, or to our imagination, a figure of greater absurdity, than that of seeing the government of a nation fall, as it frequently does, into the hands of a lad necessarily destitute of experience, and often little better than a fool. It is an insult to every man of years, of character, and of talents, in a country."" --Thomas Paine, 1795 ""Dissertations on First Principles of Government"" Poverty, homelessness, and unemployment have always been part of the details of any Capitalist system.  The many on top are always benefited by colluding, by cutting up markets, and by fixing prices.  It is always in their benefit to underproduce food where there is a famine, to underproduce coal where there is a winter.  Scarcity increases the value of a product.  This is a caused by a system where the few own the majority of land and productive wealth -- by the system of Capitalism.  But, some have tried to fight it by joining the worker's party. The Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Marxist-Leninist Party, the Revolutionary Workers Party -- there are so many titles for this type of political party.  By living in a Capitalist system, you see the want, the waste, and the exploitation that exists everywhere.  It is natural to change it.  Can the worker's party help you? A worker's party would try to make laws to improve the way we live and work.  Shorter hours, better pay, more benefits, safety equipment, compensation for injury on the job, among many other areas.  But all of these things can also be accomplished by unions.  If you want to improve the standard of living for the common masses, organizing them into labor unions is more effective. For the worker's party to be able to make any changes, it would have to get into office.  Until it reaches the critical point of 51% of the voters, it would not be able to make significant changes to society.  It would either be in a coalition with other parties, where its effects would be diluted.  Or it would lose the election. ""...there is no such thing as good government, because its very existence is based upon the submission of one class to the dictatorship of another."" --Emma Goldman with Johann Most, 1896 ""Anarchy Defended By Anarchists"" If the worker's party could achieve 40% of the vote, and it wouldn't be enough.  It would require 51% of the vote to get it into power.  But consider 40% of the people going out on strike.  This could cripple an entire economy -- the steel mills would be shut down, the trucks would stand still, and the harvests would rot. It would be enough to gain any demand from the Capitalist class or the government.  That many workers on strike could end a war, could increase minimum wage, could create employment and jobs.  There are people willing to work, willing to consume with their earnings, and then near them, empty lands.  The strike could pull that land from the grips of Capitalists, and allow the people to work it. And that's the difference between the union and the political party.  If we strike to change society, it is because we demonstrated how essential the working class is to the economy.  But if we vote for a worker's party, it will use laws to protect the workers. These laws will always be received with contempt and bitterness -- and they never cut at the direct power of the Capitalist.  But a strike makes a Capitalist helpless, and they are put in a situation where they have to negotiate and give in to our demands.  The workers' party makes the capitalist class into an aggressive enemy -- the workers' strike cuts right at the root of capitalism. From fighting discrimination to environmental protection -- from ending wars to improving your standard of living -- the union and the General Strike are the greatest tool. ""There his mistake lay. The masses, without distinction of degree of culture, religious beliefs, country and speech, had understood the language of the International when it spoke to them of their poverty, their sufferings and their slavery under the yoke of Capitalism and exploiting private ownership; they understood it when it demonstrated to them the necessity of uniting their efforts in a great solid, common struggle. But here they were being talked to about a very learned and above all very authoritarian political programme, which, in the name of their own salvation, was attempting, in that very International which was to organise their emancipation by their own efforts, to impose on them a dictatorial government, provisional, no doubt, but, meanwhile, completely arbitrary and directed by a head extraordinarily filled with brains. ""Marx's programme is a complete fabric of political and economic institutions strongly centralised and very authoritarian, sanctioned, no doubt, like all despotic institutions in modern society, by universal suffrage, but subordinate nevertheless to a very strong government..."" --Mikhail Bakunin, ~1800's ""Marxism, Freedom, and the State,"" Chapter 4 Punkerslut,"
12,Philippine Bourgeoisie can get away with murder,politics," UN experts investigating the Ampatuan Massacre in Maguindanao  said today that the Philippines should have a major reform in the country and reflect ""on the elite family-dominated manipulation of the political processes and the need to eliminate such practices in order to assure the future of democracy in the Philippines.""  They blame this bourgeoisie form of politics as one of the reasons why an incident like the Ampatuan Massacre could even happen. I say, easier said than done.  To be able to achieve this, the very culture of the Philippines will have to change.  The problem of the elite ruling and dominating the political process has so many levels that go deep into the very psyche of the people. The Underlying Feudal System What most people seem not to understand is that despite the seeming modernity of the Philippines and vaunted democracy that it practices, it still essentially follows a feudal system where the landed elite has almost full control of the region that they belong to.  Nobody can contest it because only the bourgeoisie get the best education, the best jobs, and the capacity, financially and politically, to run for office and the power and influence to supposedly impact change for the betterment of society.  And like the magnanimous landlord that they are expected to be, the constituents support their respective landlords in the hopes that they will be taken cared off properly and rise alongside the success of their patron, as long as they remain loyal and obedient. Sense of Family/Regionalism The Philippines is made up of islands each of which have their own unique identity.  As such, people who belong to the same region have a tendency to think more of their kababayans as brothers than the rest of the Philippines.  Because people coming from the same area look at each other as family, the leader of that area then serves as the parent of the whole region.  In this kind of arrangement, the trust placed on the governor of a province can almost be considered as blind loyalty to a parent.  But the same way that the people give their love to their governor like a father figure, they fear him as well, knowing full well that if the father is disobeyed they will be punished. Education and Poverty In the Philippines, it is the moneyed that has the monopoly on education and opportunity.  This being the case, those who are poor cannot afford to get a good education and thus are blocked to any opportunity to improve their lives.  It is due to this, that again they will have to trust those who supposedly know what they are doing, and who have the opportunity and the power to improve the life of society. At the same time, because of their lack of education, they are oblivious to how superficial the magnanimity their leaders have.  Those in the end, the protection and the benefits are nothing more than sugar coating to cover the corrupt activities that these politicians engage in. Apathy and Complacence On the other hand, it takes neither education nor much intelligence to see the corruption in the system.  The biggest problem lies with the apathy and complacence of the people.  They’re too used to corruption and as long as it does not affect them directly they just won’t bother changing the system.  It’s basically a philosophy of ""I already have enough problems going through life, I don’t need anymore."" With this kind of backdrop, is it really surprising that political leaders can literally get away with murder? So how does this end?  Through Marxian conflict?  It won’t even get there… unless you change the culture and the way the people think then maybe… just maybe the exclusive manipulation of the political process and that of government by elite families can end."
13,Why Should Workers be in Charge of the Workplace?,politics," ""The Industrial Workers [of the World] is essentially an educational organization—and one of the vitally important things it will teach the workers is the complete operation and control of the industry in which they are employed."" --Eugene V. Debs, 1905 ""Class Unionism"" If the workers owned the places where they worked, it would create social harmony. The majority of adult people in the social order are workers. From truck drivers to physicians to entertainers, most people work to earn their living. Those who don't work are the top elite business owners, those who make a living just by possessing property. They are a very small class compared to the group of workers. The businesses organize the economy for the few that own it, so that they can profit by it. But if we organize the economy so workers benefit from it, then everyone is given an equal opportunity. ""There is, therefore, no solution possible other than an economy directed by the workers through their organisations of control-through the workers' syndicates. In the political sense, federalism will provide us with the structure whereby each region can organise its own life according to its natural resources."" --Federica Montseny, 1937 ""Militant Anarchism and the Reality in Spain"" Those who work in their community have a sense of social responsibility. Someone has to make decisions about environmental impact, discrimination, consumer rights, and poverty. When a property-owner makes the decision, they only see dollar signs. When a worker makes the decision, they see their community. And now, workers can make a workplace that fits them perfectly, with complete control over work hours, compensation, and investment. Those who work are doing it to feed their families, to give education to their children, to give life to their communities. They have the greatest responsibility to make sure the business works, and to make sure that everyone gets paid. They'll make the most responsible decisions in organizing work, in research and development, and all business decisions. They worry about their families, not about their profits. ""As much land as a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the product of, so much is his property."" --John Locke, 1690 ""Second Treatise on Government,"" Chapter 5 If you want to end homelessness and poverty, then put the workers in charge! The workers will have the greatest interest in creating employment and inexpensive housing. If you want to end AIDS and cancer, then put the workers in charge! The common people have a greater interest in curing diseases than medical corporations. ""The railways in Catalonia are an eloquent example of what the workers would have done had they not been paralysed by the concessions made to the bourgeoisie. The three main lines which belonged to three foreign companies constantly competing with one another, were amalgamated to form one company and recently were directed by a central committee of the U.G.T. (General Workers' Union--Socialist) and C.N.T. made up of twelve comrades. There were very few engineers, for most of them were foreigners and had returned to their respective countries. Nevertheless wonderful results were achieved."" --Gaston Leval, 1945 ""Collectives in Spain"" If you want to end war and exploitation in third world countries, then put the workers in charge! The common people have no interest in sacrificing their children for some profiteering war. If you want to guarantee consumer rights and protect the environment, then put the workers in charge! Laborers live in the communities they work in, so they have an interest in a clean atmosphere and safe products for their neighbors. ""I say to the wage class: Think clearly and act quickly, or you are lost. Strike not for a few cents more an hour, because the price of living will be raised faster still, but strike for all you earn, be content with nothing less."" --Lucy Parsons, ~1800's ""The Principles of Anarchism"" Punkerslut,"
14,"Basta ya, Gloria!",politics," President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has declared her intention to run for Congress after her presidency.  As it is, she is the second longest running president of the Philippines and now will be the first to run for Congress right after a presidency. Critics all have their opinion regarding the reason behind the move – she wants immunity from lawsuits, she wants to become prime minister, she wants to nullify the power of the incoming president by becoming Speaker of the House, or if Teodoro, the administration candidate wins, then she will control Malacañang from Congress making Teodoro nothing more than a transition president. All these are reasons to fear PGMA running for Congress.  She, however, fearlessly says that she’s not ready to retire and after much soul searching had heeded the call to run for Congress by the people in her district Pampanga. This wasn’t the case when she first started. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, daughter of former President Diosdado Macapagal seemed to have been the hope of the nation. A mother of 3.  Most of us felt that as a mother, she could extend her love and compassion for her children towards the sons and daughters of the country. An educator in the most prestigious schools.  Most of us thought she could change the system and teach by example what was right and wrong putting an end to a century old system of governance filled with corruption. An economist.  Finally someone well versed in the dynamics of economics, we had hoped that she could get us out of the economic hole that we had dug ourselves in. A promising senator.  Following the footsteps of a most beloved father, she stamped down on corruption and fought for human rights, filing 400 bills and sponsoring 55 laws which included the Anti-Sexual Harassment Law, the Indigenous People's Rights Law, and the Export Development Act. Now, after 9 years of being President, everybody wants her out.  The mother is power hungry.  The educator is accused of being one of the most corrupt.  The economist is inept in solving the countries financial and economic problems.  And the promising senator is deemed a failure, as an example, as a politician and as a leader. Nine years in power is what it took to change her.  Nine years in power is what it took for the people to be disillusioned, disgruntled and far more desperate. Now she runs for Congress for her native province of Pampanga.  She claims that she had soul searched before heeding the call of the Pampangeños.  Maybe she has not soul searched hard enough because if she had she would have realized that she no longer is the same person as when she started.  The people who had trusted her no longer see any hope in her. She has had a chance in serving her country and she flubbed it.  She has a chance of serving her country best by being nothing more than a humble civilian.  Maybe as a civilian she can find herself once again and contribute to the betterment of society out of office. As they used to say during the Marcos era, ""Sobra na, tama na, palitan na!"" (Enough is enough, change her!)"
15,How Will Anarchy Help Me?,politics," ""If the individual has a right to govern himself, all external government is tyranny. Hence the necessity of abolishing the State."" --Benjamin R. Tucker, 1888 ""State Socialism and Anarchism"" The government interferes in every part of our lives. In early years, it is our educator. In later years, it is our taxer. It fulfills the role of enforcing the law and protecting property. The state has the army, the police, and an endless bureaucracy for regulations, social services, and a thousand other tasks. Is the government really a glue holding society together, or is it the cause of our problems? Does anarchy help with the protection of the our rights? Is it going to make our homes safer? Will it extend our liberties? When the community is no longer taxed, we will be able to decide for ourselves how our defense is maintained. It is those of us who live in the neighborhoods who know best how to maintain their safety. There won't be police enforcing a law. No investigations into drugs and vice when there are thousands of unsolved murders and a soaring rate of rape. There will just be a militia, organized by the community, for the defense of the community. How well they protect the people, without becoming an authority figure, is up to the community -- and who better? It is the people who will either have to deal with the lack of protection, or the tyranny of an oppressor. No one can have as much self-interest in making the right choice for the community than the community itself. ""...Anarchism, or any other social theory, making man a conscious social unit, will act as a leaven for rebellion. This is not a mere assertion, but a fact verified by all experience."" --Emma Goldman, 1911 ""The Psychology of Political Violence"" This may work well enough in a small setting, but how could it possibly work in a national setting? How could it work when highly mechanized and vast armies are marching on onto our neighborhoods? We only need to expand the size of the model. A militia is organized by a community voluntarily pooling its resources for self-defense. How would the lawless people defend against a national military? When fighting an army, many of the communities will work together in providing for their general defense. A technology program or an intelligence service is beyond the scope of just one association of residents. Working together on a federated basis, these communities can resolve other large scale problems. Besides just regional defense, communities can work together in establishing currency, diplomacy, and transportation. The people have a greater interest in defending their lives, and preserving their liberty, than any politician or political party. It is we the people who will suffer if we make a mistake, just as we are the ones benefited if we act wisely. Since the people control the militia, police brutality, misguided investigations, and corruption can be rooted out. With a similar control over military, the people can now protect themselves as they see fit. Wars of imperialism are brought on by governments, which no longer exist. All the great social ills can be removed if we, the people, are ready to organize and make the transition into anarchy. ""The government that seems the most unwise, Oft goodness to the people best supplies; That which is meddling, touching everything, Will work but ill, and disappointment bring."" --Lao Tzu, ~600 BC ""Tao Teh King,"" Part 2, Chapter 58, Section 1 Punkerslut,"
16,The War on Christmas and Christianity,politics," Here it is, Christmas again; soon we will all enjoy the marvels of Christians in action. Everywhere we turn there will be expressions of peace and joy. The air will be full of hymns and jingles and merriment. It’s also a time when secular attacks are the most vicious, the time when the war on Christianity is most apparent. Recent encounters of this viciousness have distressed me to the point where I feel a counter view must be sounded. The following is an example of the secular message currently promoted by the media, our government and schools. Please carefully read the next few paragraphs, I have taken the liberty of collecting, paraphrasing and condensing the message from several books, news paper articles, blogs, school lectures and news commentary. I have put it all in quotes to express my interpretation and understanding of this secular message. Understand that these are not my beliefs. The following are the expressions of my understanding of the ideals of a growing and powerful secular war on Christianity. ""When will we evolve past the need for gods and their ugly evils? … Soon hopefully. There is nothing more prejudice, unreasonable, insulting and despicable than a true believer. Especially when they find a pedestal from which they can lecture to the rest of us ignorant and misinformed folks. The evil existing on this earth has nothing to do with Satan or the devil. True evil in this world has always and will always manifest itself from religious zealots commanding their flock to commit atrocities against a fellow man. Ironically these atrocities go against the core beliefs the flock adheres to. The rationalization is always a ""greater good"". Of course the greater good is self serving and restricted to only those with similar beliefs. Everyone else is something less."" This particular sentiment of the war on Christianity is particularly offensive. ""The evil of religion, every religion, is absolute. Evidence of this surrounds you. Try questioning a religious belief, it does not matter which religion or which belief. The response will be impassioned and if pressed far enough it will ultimately lead to violence. If people weren’t murdered everyday by other people trying to prove why they are more virtuous, it would be humorous. Unfortunately it’s deadly serious."" This attack on Christianity is pervasive in our schools and has invaded our high schools. ""The power religion has on our psyche is as potent as it is destructive. Somewhere in our evolutionary survival the necessity to believe in a divine answer for unexplained events became crucial. The scientific method has since superseded that need. For rational beings to be crippled by religious dogma in this age is ludicrous. There is only one set of laws we must obey and there is no free will quandary whether to obey them or not. The laws of physics are the true rulers of this universe and they don’t allow for any dissent. There is no right or wrong, just how it is. Pure truth."" This is the ultimate secular war cry, and sends out the alarm that the war on Christmas is just a battle in the war on Christianity. ""It’s time to get religion out of our government once and for all! No Christmas, no Ramadan, no Hanukah… none of it. What people choose to do in their castle is one thing but it’s time to stop the saturation of the public sphere with religious evil, lies and morals. For us to truly live in peace, and to love one another, we must FORCE GOD OUT OF OUR LIVES."""
17,Using Aerial Advertising for Political Campaigns,politics," Many are turning to banner advertising as an effective way to get their message to a large group of people in a relatively short time. The banner message is first created. In seven feet tall letters, the banner could be 120 feet long or more. When that is in place, a plane with a hook on its tail flies low and snags the tow rope. As it is pulled through the sky, virtually everyone below will read the message. Billboard ads are highway billboard messages pulled behind planes. The message either contains logos, words, or photographs. They are used to advertise a product, a service, a charity, or a special event. Individuals have used banners to recognize an achievement, to congratulate someone on an honor, or even to propose marriage. Due to the nature of the United States' political system, it seems someone is virtually always running for office somewhere, especially during the summer and fall of major election years. In recent years, some candidates have used aerial ads to spread their message, and for good reason. Banner or billboard ads as described above are an ideal way of promoting a candidate. Here are some reasons why this is true. First, a banner or billboard ad can focus on just a particular constituency. Unlike printed ads that could be available to people far outside the voting district of the candidate, or TV ads that must be repeated to be sure people see them, banner ads fly over just the area of a city, county, or state of the candidate's jurisdiction. Second, the ads reach a large number of people in a short period of time. Yes, it is best to shake hands with each person in the district, but this is not always possible or practical. A billboard or banner flying over a city, sports event, political rally, or beach will put the name and slogan of the candidate before the people in a matter of minutes. Third, billboards can display a picture of the candidate. Imagine a billboard of a candidate moving from a stationary stand and flying over every person in the district! The drone of the engine grabs people's attention. The banner flying overhead demands to be read. Then, when it is time to vote, the citizens will recognize his name and, possibly, will vote for him. Yes, personal contact is best. Nothing beats getting out, meeting the people, and finding out what is important to them. The banner or billboard going before or after the visit will only reinforce this is a candidate who wants their vote. All this culminates in more votes on election day. Finally, a big advantage of banner ads is the cost. Banners are a one time expense but, if the candidate plans to run again, the banner can be stored and reused without additional production cost. This is a claim few other methods of advertising could make. Overall, it is one of the cheapest methods of getting a candidate's name before the people. Many have used it and can attest to its effectiveness."
18,Obama Birther Case Moves Forward for January 2010,politics," Executive Summary – Obama now quaking in his $600 shoes has a case in Federal Court in California regarding his eligibility to be President. He is probably walking around the White House wondering how much longer. He is wondering if he is going to go to jail. Can he just resign? Don’t let people tell you this is a racial thing, it is not. Tell them if you do not call Obama white, you will not call him black. He had the Justice Department lawyers at taxpayers expense try to get the case dismissed but the judge felt their arguments were not valid. Obama did this instead of producing his birth certificate. He is like the guy who robs a 7-11 and they have him on videotape holding the gun and he says no that isn’t me. The reason this Obama has had no major accomplishments before he got into the White House is his lack of cognitive ability. He actually thought he was going to get away with this. Someone this dumb is dangerous. The lawyer chasing Obama has a list of many social security numbers Obama has used. There are passport records showing him traveling on other passports thus establishing his foreign citizenship. They have made a request for Obama to produce documents before the trial on Jan. 26, 2010. Don’t hold your breath and wait for Obama to produce the documents and do not hold your breath for the trial to start either. Discussion – The order denying the motion to dismiss the Orly Taitz case came out on Friday Oct 23. This same day Obama signed the emergency act on the flu vaccines. Obama is sending a strong signal and that signal is before he gets embarrassed and sent to jail penniless he will shut the country down with his emergency powers as in martial law. He is probably bluffing. His handlers are probably not going to consider that much of an asset and will abandon him before they go this far. They might very well lose all if they try a premature jump into martial law when the country is so mad at the government. Lose all means they will become fugitives hunted around the world and not be able to come to the USA ever again. This is assuming they escape. They do not have that much time and money in Obama. He is going to have to take one for the team is how it looks to me. Obama Methodology – There have been many megalomaniacal rulers before Obama. He did not write the book, he read the book written by others. Saul Alinsky ""Rules for Radicals"" easily found on the web will give some insight. The ""Communist Manifesto"" is another. Obama is going after a crisis and then another crisis and then another etc. All the while he grabs more power after each crisis. The Flu vaccine was a lousy crisis but this is indicative of the people who put him in power in that Obama was a lousy choice. The flu vaccine is controversial. Many people will refuse it. Will they quarantine and put people in FEMA camps? I doubt it, not enough camps and this could be a revolution trigger similar to martial law. I mean Johnny Grab Your Gun type revolution. The government is trying to convince the people that they should go along with them because it is for the good of all. This government has zero chance of getting the trust of a consensus of their population. Any excuse to put people in any sort of camp will likely result in massive widespread civil disobedience and an organizing of the people against the government. Remember if the people having all these guns did not matter they would not be so dead bent on taking the guns away. Fear Tactics – The government wants you afraid of them. They want you to think their power is way more broad and vast than it is. This is called bluffing. They are afraid of the American people big time. Their military are patriots and are not going to go around exterminating the population because they were told to. Clinton when President spent a good deal of his time and energy trying to get the guns away from the American people. Bush sort of backed off on this instead destroyed the country economically and grabbed power with emergency acts. He also did 9/11. Not a friend of the people but his approach was one of laying groundwork. He let the people think he was pro gun so they would not see him coming as he really is. Obama lacking the polish is going straight for the guns fast and hard relentlessly. See the point is he is afraid of the people who have guns. Judge him by his actions, never judge him by what comes out of his mouth. He wants you to listen to his words and not evaluate him by his actions alone. He is an accomplished and dedicated liar. The government will never let on that they are afraid because if they did then the people would start threatening them to give up control and follow the constitution. They will keep the game face on and continue violating civil rights. They will pump up their law enforcement on all levels to push the people around more and more with no consequences. The culmination of this is that they will eventually let the police shoot and kill people for almost any reason on the scene. Now they use tasers, tomorrow they will use real bullets. This is what the Gestapo did. There will also be interrogations by law enforcement agencies in the USA with torture tactics. Police will be told this is for the overall good of the nation. The constitution and bill of rights are historical only at this point and they are conditioning the people for more harsh dictatorial controls. The government is bluffing the people and just like they made a mistake with Obama they are making a mistake with ""We the People"". It is almost as if they know they are going to lose yet plodding on anyway. Obama’s Next Moves – Well he is in a real mess. If he cooperates with the Federal Court he will be exposed. Then comes expulsion from office, criminal charges against him, his wife, Nancy Pelosi and others in the conspiracy. If it is up to Obama and his conspirators they will go down fighting to stay out of jail. I think if that is how he wants to play it so be it, he will still lose. The military is very suspicious of this black Muslim communist Kenyan minus the birth certificate and will probably not rally to his cause. What Hitler did was create the SS, which was basically an army to protect him from the regular army. They had artillery and other heavy war equipment to deter any sort of military uprising against Hitler who was getting millions of Germans killed as he went down fighting to the end destroying his country on many levels leaving half of the survivors to finish life under Soviet communism. Hitler also had the Gestapo but they were not a serious military organization, just a tough secret police with a lot of power to terrorize. Police type organizations cannot withstand large-scale attacks from a military or even a public uprising. The point is Obama has not had a chance to cement himself into office militaristically. The German military tried numerous times to kill Hitler and came very close more than once. It seems doubtful that the Vice President could be elevated into the office since he would be complicit. If they try to put the runner up McCain into office more trouble. McCain has birth certificate problems too. So curious that both of the mainline candidates have questionable birth certificates, makes one wonder if there is more to this. He is an American Citizen all right but he says he was born in some hospital, which may not in fact have ever existed. The idea was he is trying to say he was born in Panama on USA soil (in Panama). The place he says where he was born is dubious and may not be in the Canal Zone thus not USA soil. In any case being born anywhere in Panama (before 2000) may work for being a citizen but not for being the President. This will come out and to me on first cut it seems he is not eligible to be President but this would take more time and study. I doubt the elites would want to go through with McCain since the country is geared up for this sort of an election fraud. A recent survey showed 3 out of 10 adults doubt Obama is an American. That is a lot. So it looks like a new election if they get Obama out. Bush left a sour taste in many mouths and forget the democrats recovering from this Obama thing so that brings us to Ron Paul who may be the real deal. This sort of backpedaling by the power elite may be what they need to calm the people down. States are talking secession and passing states right legislation. The people running the fed may be deciding to back down and regroup. They will not back off, just come back again down the road from a different angle. The Obama machine may go. The Federal Reserve and IRS may go. There may be a cutting back on the power of the Fed. Then they will still be around to play again another day when the people go to sleep again. This of course would mean the country makes an economic recovery. There would be an asset-based money supply. There would be sensible protectionist import duties. Open immigration would be historical. The drug war would be over with legalization. Illegal immigrants would be a thing of the past. Government would be downsized a lot. Freedom would be there again. The people being supported by the government would suffer big time but they had it so good for so long the posture will be so what. Obama’s Best Move – A war with Iran. This will be able to keep him from going to court. Wartime emergency etc. The war will likely go on for a long time. Police powers will be enhanced. Maybe some real terrorism on behalf of the Iranians to provide an alibi for the police power expansion or if this is lacking some false flag terrorism. This will get the people to support the government in their war effort. It will get the people to believe the police state is for their good. The military industrial complex makes lots of money, the debt soars, the country goes into further financial oblivion, hyperinflation and so forth. This gives Obama more of a crisis to manage and grab power nationalizing businesses, banking system etc. He may be able to get the people to buy into this police state at war scenario. Problem is the blowback from Iran can be devastating. The other powers in the world will get very nervous about Obama. They know he has an eligibility problem, rest assured they know this. They are not going to like this sort of selfish game playing and may decide they better unify against the USA. The first attack will be on the USD. Next will be trade and tourism. This will be ugly but they a re not going to just around and let Obama and his sinking ship risk World War III. The other problem is Iran can launch some real terrorism on the USA at home and abroad, big time. This will be a real problem for the Muslims in the USA. They might be able to suicide bomb innocent men, women and children in other countries but try this inside of a country that has more guns owned by civilians than people and doom and gloom on the Muslims. They might ask for internment camps to be kept safe from the citizens who will see this as an act of war and retaliate voraciously. Then there will be backlash from other Muslim nations but this should not have any military significance. What to do? – Make as many people aware as possible of Obama not being eligible to hold the office of President. This is the best thing you can do for real change. You do not get to be a Federal Judge because you are an idiot. The judge sees merit in the case or else he would have dismissed it. Don’t let the imposter get away with it. Remember if he goes every piece of legislation he signed is void including the ridiculous financial bailout. All of these nationalizing of businesses can be nullified. Then comes the audit the Federal Reserve and its abolishment. The debt can be nullified. The IRS is over. You can basically turn the clock back 100 years regarding your freedoms. Beat the drum on Obama not being eligible and you might just get your freedom back. It looks like they made a mistake and hold their feet to the fire like they do to you. http://www.panamalaw.org"
19,Is the Politician Your Friend?,politics," ""For although the means of coming into power differ, still the method of ruling is practically the same; those who are elected act as if they were breaking in bullocks; those who are conquerors make the people their prey; those who are heirs plan to treat them as if they were their natural slaves."" --Étienne de La Boétie, 1548 ""Discourse on Voluntary Servitude"" To become elected, a politician needs to have many votes.  And to get that, they need funding for their election.  For all politicians, the first incentive is this: a powerful campaign that can demolish any opponent.  With the right connections to media and publications, any politician can become elected.  And this is not a question about connections, so much as it is a question about buying those connections. When a politician becomes elected, they do not see it as a victory of the people choosing them.  They see it as a victory of the wealthy supporting their campaign.  When this politician votes for a bill to become a law, they are not thinking about the people; they are thinking about who put them in office, their wealthy donors. Business elites and corporations donate millions to political campaigns.  What do they expect in return?  They expect laws to be passed that benefit them.  They expect laws that reduce fines for violating environmental regulations.  They expect laws that reduce fines for labor violations, for stock trading violations, for hiring violations, for import and export violations.  What they support is activity that benefits the company, but hurts our society.  This is the interest that props up our politicians and legislators. Laws that protect the environment will always be opposed by these Capitalists.  That is because it is cheaper to produce without the regulations that prevent ecological devastation on Earth.  Laws that protect consumers from dangerous foods and drugs, or from unhealthy products, will be opposed by the Capitalists, as well.  These regulations slow their profits. Labor laws that protect unionizing and worker organization will be opposed, too.  After attacking society at every part, the Capitalists finally support war.  The wealthy will find new markets for their investment companies and new weapons contracts for their manufacturing plants.  Environmental decay, worker exploitation, war -- these are the undeniable aspects of Capitalist rule. We live in a world where capitalists prop up a politician for their own gain.  It is no different than a world where aristocrats prop up a king for their interests.  Their efforts are to make the government look legitimate and useful for the people.  But this is just to deceive us, and to make us that the state really considers our interests.  In reality, the government only considers the interests of those who give it power. Punkerslut,"
20,The BJP on the decline,politics," •	The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) seems to be in terminal decline. •	Leadership seems to be the main reason of the party’s decline. •	After the 2009 elections its problems have become still more compounded. •	The interference of the RSS in the party’s affairs has now become more manifest. •	Some people think that the party does not have anything to offer. The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) seems to be in terminal decline. The party, in its present incarnation, first entered the fray in the year 1984 and won just two parliamentary seats, securing mere 7.4% votes. Its vote share went up to 11.4% five years later which gave the party 86 seats. Two years later, in the year 1991, the party’s performance improved further and it captured 120 seats in the Indian lower house of the Parliament (Lok Sabha) on the strength of 20.8% vote. In the year 1996, the party’s vote share declined slightly to 20.3% but because of better management of election it was able to win 161 seat. The party reached its peak in the year 1998 securing 25.6% votes and 182 seats. The decline started from there and the next year in 1999, though the number of seats remained constant at 182, its vote percentage declined to 23.8%. In the year 2004 the vote percentage further declined to 22.2% and it could win only 138 seats. In the year 2009, the decline in the party’s fortune became more clear. It could win only 116 seats on the strength of 18.8% votes. According to many, there are many reasons of the decline of the party’s fortunes. Leadership seems to be the main reason. Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee has gone off the scene as old age has caught him and his frail health does not permit him to lead the party and the nation. Mr Lal Krishna Advani, the next in line to Mr Vajpayee, could not lead the party to the victory and it lost miserably in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections. The BJP projected Mr Advani as the future Prime Minister of India. But his relentless internet and print media campaign failed to muster support of the general public. During the elections he raised frivolous issues. He raised the issue of the Indian money stashed in the Swiss banks. He led a personal attack against Prime Minister Manmohamn Singh, calling him a weak prime minister. Both these issues could elicit the desired response from the public. The general impression of the politicians of all hues among the public, sadly is that all of them are corrupt, which, of course, is not true. But the public thinks, rightly or wrongly, that all of them have tons of black money in various forms and stashed away at various places, including the foreign particularly Swiss, banks. Therefore, the protestations of Mr Advani could not strike a chord among the public. Particularly, as the BJP itself has previously been in the government with the good Mr Advani being its deputy prime minister and home minister. The second issue he raised about Mr Manmohan Singh being a weak prime minister and the one who is controlled by someone else, namely the Congress Party president Mrs Sonia Gandhi, was, in fact, in bad taste. The Congress party naturally reminded Mr Advani that it was during the BJP rule when the Indian foreign minister had taken the terrorists with him to Qandhar. It is also well known in the country that the BJP is controlled by its mentor, the Rashtriya Sewak Sangh (RSS). Moreover, the second line leadership of the party confused both the party and the nation. Mr Arun Jaitly, in his wisdom, hinted that the Gujarat Chief Minister Mr Narendra Modi, will become the next Prime Minister of India. Such statements confused everybody. Some thought that the vote for Mr Advani will, in fact, be a vote for Mr Modi, who, obviously, is not liked by many. The issues raised by the prime ministerial candidate of the party namely the Indian black money stashed in the Swiss banks and the weakness of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh shows that party lacks the issues. It is suffering from the bankruptcy of issues and has nothing to say to the public. All this led to the defeat of the party in the elections. After the elections its problems became still more compounded. It was obvious that Mr Advani , 82, has become old and can not lead the party in the next elections. But the alternative available for the party in the absence of Mr Advani is not very impressive. The second line of leadership of the BJP consists of Mr Rajnath Singh, Ms Sushma Swaraj, Mr Arun Jaitley, Mr Venkaiah Naidu, Mr Murli Manohar Joshi and Mr Narendra Modi. None of them, for various reasons, is able to inspire confidence among the public. Another issue which though was known all along but became more manifest after the elections of 2009 is the interference of the RSS in the party’s affairs, which did no go down well with the public. The election results of the assemblies of three states namely, Maharashtra, Haryana and Arunachal Pradesh show that nothing has improved for the party. If anything, its condition has worsened. Some people think that the BJP did well earlier because of the momentum of the Ram Temple movement. This movement took the party to power. But as all movements peter out after some time, this movement also lost its momentum. Today the voter is making smart choices and thinks that the party does not have anything to offer.

1,Mr. President: Are We Making Progress?,politics," So how is President Obama's administration doing the second 100 days in office?  Do you know?  Do you care?  You should care and know because this administration's actions will affect you for year's to come like no other administration in the past or future. Before reading this article, go to the link provided and review the results. As of October 10, 2009, here are the results as listed at http://reportcard.cnn.com. Letter grades in ""( )"" are from the first 100 days in office for comparison. Economy: C- (B) Health Care Reform: D (NA) Foreign Affairs: C (B+) Secretary of State Clinton: C+ (B) Vice President Biden: C- (B) Your Senators: C- (C+) Congress: D (NA) Republican Leadership: D (C-) The Media: D (NA) President Obama: C- (B) To be fair, I am a registered Republican. Not to sound ""wishy washy"" or ""non-committal"" but I like parts of both the Republican and Democratic parties. I'm more of a middle of the road politician. Some would want me to draw a line in the sand and commit to one party or the other. I say there is nothing wrong with owning one's beliefs and being non-conformist. I'd rather stand firm for the right reasons than bend with the breeze to fit in a crowd or political party. The genesis of the Democratic control we see today began some time ago.  You need to go back to the when Nancy Pelosi took the reigns as the House Speaker.  Many promises were made.  Nancy Pelosi and some of her Democratic colleagues promised to right the wrongs of the previous Republican controlled House. To date, not much has happened and in fact, Mrs. Pelosi is enjoying an all-time low approval rating that makes her the least popular member of the Democratic Party. No need to blame it all of this on Nancy. Congress, whether controlled by the Republicans or Democrats, can be an inactive group marred in greasy political pork - the kind of pork that clogs your financial arteries. After President Obama won the presidential election, clearly the Democrats were riding high on a wave of hope, reform, and change. Out with the Republicans and in with the new. Here we go again. Another ""cleaning house"" that will make our country better. Better? Better than what? Than who? This would be the time to remind everyone of the old saying ""people in glass houses should not throw stones"". Former President Bush's administration reminded me of Barnum and Bailey's circus at best.  At times, the left hand simply didn't know what the right was doing. Disjointed planning, incomplete estimates, lack of focus on the real issues. Remember, hindsight is 20/20. Any armchair politician can sit back and find plenty of Republican failures. So, back to my original question: How is the Obama administration doing after their second 100 days in office? The economy, foreign affairs, Vice President Biden, Secretary of State Clinton, and President Obama: All of these areas scored a full letter grade lower today than after the first 100 days in office. The honeymoon is over folks! Rhetoric is being replaced with proof. In other words, don't talk about it - Americans want proof. Sadly the democrats can't do it - or at least to ""our"" collective satisfaction. Give them time. Rome wasn't constructed in a day and these highly complex issues will not be resolved in 100 days, 200 days, over even 400 days. A controversial Colombian senator who has obtained the release of 16 hostages held by Marxist guerrillas is the leading candidate to receive this year's Nobel Peace Prize I think it interesting that President Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize yet there are no scores for the second 100 days that warrant such an award. I'm glad he received this honor but clearly President Obama's achievement was a surprise to most Americans and others around the world. CNN reported on Friday, October 9, that ""a controversial Colombian senator who has obtained the release of 16 hostages held by Marxist guerrillas is the leading candidate to receive this year's Nobel Peace Prize."" CNN - you might want to check that headline. I admire President Obama and his intentions. I cannot remember a more refreshing approach to the Presidency. His plain talk and commonsensical way of thinking coupled with his charisma make him a modern President poised to take on a variety of issues. The problem is we can't afford to pay for everything that needs to be fixed. America simply can't overload our butt's with eternal debt payments.  The public debt increased from $5,629 billion to $9,926 billion during the Bush presidency from 2000 to 2008. The debt is now projected to double under the Obama presidency to a level close to 97% of GDP (Gross Domestic Product). I know how to increase the Obama Administration grades for the third 100 days. President Obama, here is your step-by-step plan to higher grades and souring approval ratings.  In short, this will make my life (a voter's life) better: Find a way to end our involvement in these wars. Focus on the economy. Lower our debt and increase our GDP and exports. Focus on health care reform. Mr. President, I did not vote for you in the last election. I would gladly consider voting for you in the next election if your administration would clearly communicate your vision by priority and how I'm going to pay for it with realistic numbers without the smoke and mirrors. Friends, you see it really doesn't matter who is in office - Republican or Democrat. What matters is how government goes about doing the work of the people by fixing the problems affecting our daily lives. President Obama has the ability and desire.  How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. We can't tackle every ill affecting America.  Prioritize and finalize."
2,Jagdish Tytler:Sardar Surender Singh's Confession,politics," Sardar Surender Singh, son of Sardar Ajit Singh, was the Granthi of the Gurudwara Pul Bangash at the time of the Anti-Sikh Riots of 1984. He was a religious Priest, and was present in the Gurudwara (Temple) Pul Bangash on 1/11/1984, He was asked by certain people to stake a claim for the losses sustained by the Gurudwara Pul Bangash due to the burning and looting of the Gurudwara by the mob, to the Commission of Inquiry. Acting on this advise, Sardar Surender Singh requested certain persons to please help him by writing out an affidavit to this effect to the Commission. The so-called friends and advisors wrote an affidavit in English, and mischievously added the name of Mr. Jagdish Tytler, stating that Sardar Surender Singh had seen Mr. Tytler leading the mob which attacked the Gurudwara at 09.00 am., on the 1st November, 1984. Sardar Surender Singh had the affidavit read out to him, and received the overall impression that his Gurudwara would receive the necessary compensation for the losses sustained. However, when Sardar Surender Singh came to know the fact that this affidavit contained the allegation that he had seen Mr. Jagdish Tytler leading the mob against the Gurudwara, he immediately had another affidavit made refuting this allegation. He wrote the affidavit in Gurmukhi – his mother tongue, in which he was familiar, as he could, read, write and speak fluently- on 5th August, 2002. In this affidavit, he truthfully stated that, ""I have come to know that in front of JusticeNanavasti Commission from my side has been put blame on Shri Jagdish Tytler. I give my statement that I cannot read and write English for this I would like to state that I do not know that what has been in English in my previous statement. Dated 01/11/1984 crowd attacked an GurudwarwaPul Bangash, people were saying that attack was being led by the Congress leaders. I did not see Shri Jagdish Tytler anywhere in the crowd."" (sic English trans.) This is the clearest proof that Mr. Jagdish Tytler was not anywhere near the Gurudwara and the mob that was attacking it, on that day and at that time. Incidentally, it is to be noted that there were other people inside the Gurudwara Pul Bangash on that day. Among others, there was the father Sardar Surender Singh, Granthi – Sardar Ajit Singh; Sardar Ajit singh’s elder son and brother of Sardar Surender Singh – Sardar Jaswant Singh was present along with his father Sardar Ajit Singh; Sardar Surender Singh’s son – S. Narinder Singh; Sardar Kuljit Singh Duggal, the then Executive Member of the Gurudwara and presently its Secretary; Sardar Kundan Singh, the then Vice President of the Guru singh sabha and presently the President; were all there on that day. All of the individually have stated that they did not see Mr. Jagdish Tytler anywhere with the mob on that day. There was also a full-fledged hearing by the Hon. Sessions Court where the Police in the presence of the Hon. Court interrogated hundreds of people ; but non of them even mentioned the name of Mr. Jagdish Tytler. Sardar Surender Singh set out to correct the first affidavit submitted in English and sighed by him by lodging a second affidavit in Gurmukhi withdrawing the previous affidavit and clearing the name of Mr. Jagdish Tytler. However, the group of people with vested interests, would not leave him alone, and it is known now that he had been threatened by them to withdraw any support he was giving to Mr. Tytler. They promised him money, safety for him and his family, and asylum in some foreign country, if necessary.Sardar Surender Singh fearing for his life and his family members, became ‘double minded ‘ and succumbed to these presessures. Because of these problems, he became seriously ill, was admitted in a hospital and later died in the hospital. As death was coming to him, he wrote to people with the help of his father, brother, sons and other well-wishes seeking pardon from God and the top leaders of the nation. Before everybody, he accepted thefact that he had been forced to tell lies, against his own conscience, and that Mr. Jagdish Tytler was innocent of the charges levied against him."
3,New Party in Congress:  Republicrats!,politics," Washington, DC: A new political party has emerged from the familiar Washington landscape that has been ruled by Republicans and Democrats for over 30 years.  Effective today the Republicrats will be operating in the halls of Congress. Republicrats, if you haven't heard are a mixture of both parties but only the best ideals of both parties.  We believe in a person's right to work and paying their own way.  Government assistance is reserved for those with disabilities and other legitimate issues that prevent them from working.  We also believe in term limits and a ban on pork barrell spending. One of the nice things about the Republicrats is they subscribe to the old saying ""charity begins at home"".  If you look at the US tax dollar, you will find the majority of our tax dollar goes to the military, health, and US debt payments.  A small portion goes to energy, housing, etc.  I would love to stop all payments to other countries for 1 year and see what happens to our debt.  Do we really need to send money to overseas countries for friendship? Concerning jobs, Republicrats believe that every person has a right to work and should work if they are able.  Those able to work and don't receive no benefits after a few weeks on unemployment or job retraining.  It concerns me to see able-bodied persons not working because they don't really want to work.  However, with that said, we need to fund programs that foster job creation in every sector.  Pittsburg, PA is a case in point.  Twenty years ago, Pittsburgh was a dying city - big steel was in trouble and the local economy plummeted.  Today, Pittsburgh is experiencing a revitalization envied by others from all nations. Republicrats tend to take a isolationist view of war however when provoked due to injustices and true threats to national security, we can and will mobilize our military swiftly and decisively to win - not be lodged in a protracted war lasting several years. While all of this may seem ""fantasy"" or ""unrealistic"" given the world today, Republicrats maintain a simple view of how to run the government.  It's operated like we should do things within our homes: If we don't have the money, we do without it or defer obtaining it until such time as we can afford it. I would love to be able to print more money and tell my creditors ""I'll get back to them and pay later"" but life does not work that way in my neighborhood.  I pay my bills on time. If one tells another they will do something, then that is a commitment and you can rest assured it will happen. Be truthful in deed and word.  Do not say one thing and do  another. Realize all humans make mistakes and accept it but also require we learn from it and not repeat the same mistales more than once. Enforce the belief that one should treat others as they would want to be treated. I know.  These things I've written about will probably never happen in our lifetimes but it has to start somewhere.  Our country is of the people, by the people, and for the people.  Seems to me we should probably get back to the basics of operating our  government and fix our own country before attempting to reinvent the wheel with a new party.  I'll stay a Republican for now and give the Democrats an opportunity to fix it for a while.  It has taken years of neglect on both sides of the aisle in Congress to get the point we are at today.  I'm willing to do my share.  Are you?"
4,An Issue for President Obama's First Visit to China: China's Worry about Japan's military,politics," China and other Asian nations are beginning to assess how the recent election victory by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) will alter Japanese defense policies. Beijing is hoping for a reversal or at least a slowdown of Japan's efforts in recent years to build up its defenses against the growing military power of China, especially any joint defense efforts with the United States. Asian security issues are expected to be high on President Obama's agenda when he visits China in November. China and other Asian nations are beginning to assess how the recent election victory by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) will alter Japanese defense policies. Beijing is hoping for a reversal or at least a slowdown of Japan's efforts in recent years to build up its defenses against the growing military power of China, especially any joint defense efforts with the United States. Asian security issues are expected to be high on President Obama's agenda when he visits China in November. The DPJ's landslide victory Aug. 30 prompted calls among leaders for an ""equal U.S.-Japan relationship."" But it may be weeks before it is clear what such an equal relationship will mean. Japan's conservative newspaper Sankei Shimbun has called for continuity ""based on the alliance."" The more moderate Yomiuri Shimbun thinks the DPJ, in calling for an alliance of equals, is ""simply clinging to an abstract idea that lacks specific policies"" and it warned the DPJ to ""avoid words and actions that could weaken the alliance."" Japan's liberal newspaper Asahi Shimbun has forecast that the new policy will be revealed in two weeks when new Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama attends the U.N. General Assembly and Group of 20 summit this month. Asahi also wants ""reassurance to the Japanese people and the international community."" No one seems to know whether the DPJ really wants to renegotiate the Pentagon plans for Japan to fund the transfer of most U.S. military forces from Okinawa to Guam in the next few years. Japan's neighboring countries are also worried about major changes by the DPJ in its defense strategy. Hong Kong's center-left Sing Tao Daily warns that if Japan ""wants to ride this recovery train, its diplomacy has to tilt more toward China."" Beijing's Youth Daily says Mr. Hatoyama's stated intention not to visit the World War II Yasukuni shrine, a controversial symbol for many Asian countries, has been taken by China as a ""positive signal."" South Korean media are concerned about the DPJ approach to China, and to the six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program. South Korea's leftist Hankyoreh Shinmun describes Japan's past ""insistence on bringing up citizen abduction issues that are not directly related to the agenda"" as having a ""deleterious effect"" on the talks and now welcomes Mr. Hatoyama's openness to possible dialogue with Pyongyang. China's state-run Global Times warns that Japan should avoid seeing itself as ""the big boss in Asia."" Taiwanese commentators worry that closer relations with China could lead Japan to concede to possible requests from Beijing to push Taiwan out of the U.S.-Japan security relationship. South Korea's Chosun Ilbo argues for continuity because the U.S.-Japan alliance has been ""an axis of Northeast Asian security alongside the U.S.-Korea alliance. Why does China's media seem so alarmed about the Japanese military? Judging from Chinese comments, there are seven major developments over the past few years that Beijing is seeking to cancel or stall. Japan's army divisions deployed in western and southern areas closer to China have been left largely intact despite cuts in the north. In 2002, the 700-strong Western Army Infantry Regiment charged with amphibious operations was formed in Nagasaki prefecture and a brigade based in Okinawa. It doubled its maneuver elements and added more than 850 personnel. The F-4 air-defense squadron on Okinawa was upgraded to a squadron of F-15s. Japan discussed deploying ground forces and jet fighters on small islands located about halfway between Okinawa and Taiwan. The 2005-09 Mid-Term Defense Program established the Central Readiness Force (CRF). The CRF brings many of Japan's mobile and special units under a single command reporting directly to the defense chief. CRF units include Japan's Helicopter Brigade, Airborne Brigade, Special Operations Group (established 2004) and Chemical Defense Unit, which could play a role in against any hypothetical Chinese seizure of the Senkaku Islands. Between 1998 and 2003, the Maritime Self-Defense Forces commissioned three 14,700-ton Osumi-class ships, designated as landing ships. Four times as large as any previous Japanese landing ship, the Osumi can accommodate two large hovercraft. From 2010 to 2014, two large helicopter carriers are to be built, in this case designated as a destroyer but resembling small aircraft carriers. At 20,000 tons when fully loaded, they will be able to handle AV-8s Harriers or some versions of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Contingency plans for operations against China have been generated for the first time, and training has been adjusted accordingly. In November 2004, the Japan Defense Agency compiled plans for counteroffensive operations in the event China seized the disputed Senkaku Islands east of Taiwan, according to BBC reporting from Tokyo. The Japanese media have reported that these plans call for dispatching troops, warplanes, destroyers and submarines. During the first phases, sea- and air-reconnaissance craft would provide intelligence. Finally, units of the Western Army Infantry Regiment (Nagasaki), designated as Japan's amphibious assault force, would retake the captured islands. In February 2006, a Yamasaki exercise, a biannual joint Japan-U.S. Army command-post exercise, focused for the first time on a counteroffensive scenario against enemy forces occupying one or more small southwestern islands, according to Sankei newspaper. In June 2007, eight Japanese F-2s fighter-bombers deployed to Guam and conducted the aircraft's first-ever live-bomb runs. It was only the third time that any Japanese fighter aircraft had conducted bombing runs in the organization's 60-year history. The shift in political power in Tokyo, when combined with China's continuing lack of transparency in its military buildup, deserves close attention in the weeks and months ahead. Prior to Mr. Obama's trip to China, the United States will need to examine carefully what changes the new DPJ has in mind for China. Michael Pillsbury is a defense consultant and the former assistant undersecretary of defense for policy planning."
5,The History of Political Cartoons,politics," The political cartoon arguably dates all the way back to the time of Martin Luther. In Luther’s battle against the Catholic Church, he decided that it would be beneficial to enroll the support of the less educated masses. By illustrating the hypocrisies Luther saw in the Catholic Church, he was able to influence the political opinion of many of those who couldn’t read. Many years later, Benjamin Franklin created another famous political cartoon. The image was of a severed snake with the words, ""JOIN, or DIE"" written on the bottom. The drawing became a popular symbol in American culture that grew to mean much more than its original use. If we move forward another hundred years, we come across political cartoons in Harper’s Weekly. The publication printed the work of Thomas Nast. He was a man of impressive skill in illustration, but his cartoons’ written messages were always quite blunt. He was successful, however, in bringing attention to William Tweed. Tweed was a corrupt politician and Nast’s cartoons turned the public against Tweed who was famous for saying, ""Stop them damned pictures. I don't care so much what the papers say about me. My constituents can't read. But, damn it, they can see pictures!"" Later, a more nuanced artist came along by the name of Joseph Keppler. Keppler brought the Austrian magazine Puck to the United States and began to publish it in English. He was known more for his wit than anything, and his illustrations served to elucidate complex political issues for Puck readers. Since the time of these early pioneers, editorial cartoons have continued to be a big part of political discourse. They kept up with public sentiment through controversies over Native Americans, women’s suffrage, scandal, celebration, and intrigue. Editorial cartoons have even moved out of the realm of the newspaper and magazine. You can find cartoons on critical and patriotic gifts in the United States and around the world. You can find cartoons on critical and in the United States and around the world. patriotic gifts in the United States and around the world."
6,Can the Political Party Help You?,politics," Can the Political Party Help You? By Punkerslut ""In our time it is broadly true that political writing is bad writing. ""Where it is not true, it will generally be found that the writer is some kind of rebel, expressing his private opinions and not a ""party line."" Orthodoxy, of whatever color, seems to demand a lifeless, imitative style. The political dialects to be found in pamphlets, leading articles, manifestoes, White Papers and the speeches of under-secretaries do, of course, vary from party to party, but they are all alike in that one almost never finds in them a fresh, vivid, home-made turn of speech. When one watches some tired hack on the platform mechanically repeating the familiar phrases---bestial atrocities, iron heel, bloodstained tyranny, free peoples of the world, stand shoulder to shoulder---one often has a curious feeling that one is not watching a live human being but some kind of dummy: a feeling which suddenly becomes stronger at moments when the light catches the speaker's spectacles and turns them into blank discs which seem to have no eyes behind them."" --George Orwell, ""Politics and the English Language,"" 1946 We are all members of society.  We each have an equal right to the decision-making process for how our society is organized.  But many people who want to change society are using the political party.  Their tactics are to encourage voters and have their candidates run for election.  But does this method really help you out?  Does your candidate fulfill your hopes? If you want to change something in society, you need to have your candidate elected.  This is the option that the political party provides for you.  And you're stuck to that candidate, if they're the only one who supports your platform.  You'll have to support them in their other campaigns, in their other ideas, whether or not you're completely opposed to them.  It's the only option of the political party, if you want to have a chance to change society. In many elections, it is a close match between the two political parties, the Republicans and the Democrats.  Your candidate wants to get more votes, which means broadening the platform.  Many voters will not whole-heartedly agree with all proposals, but they'll agree with some.  To make themselves look better, the candidate will make their platform less concrete, less meaningful, and less real. By moving towards the center, politicians are making themselves look more appealing to the undecided voters.  If they're elected, they won't be enacting your vision; they'll only be enacting a heavily compromised version of it. To get the vote of enough people itself requires massive mobilization of people and organizations.  You're trying to get enough people to vote for a candidate who supports your platform.  If you can get enough voters, why not encourage those people to fulfill your platform instead? For example, if you are working for labor rights and improved standards of living, form unions.  Ten million workers on strike will do plenty to increase their wages.  Ten million voters dropping pieces of paper into a box will do virtually nothing. A thousand volunteers creating labor agencies will do much for increasing employment.  But if those same thousand voted for some law, they'll be some minority that gets overruled.  A hundred people organizing for public awareness about discrimination can change the entire social order.  But that same hundred lobbying in congress would be fighting a struggle they'd never win.  Those who want to protect the environment would be more effective at convincing workers to strike for ecology.  At least, when compared with lobbying a bunch of senators who live off of environmentally-unfriendly companies. The same number of voters, organized into associations, accomplish the same objective.  And they can do it better!  Become uninvolved with the government.  Become involved with your community. http://www.punkerslut.com Punkerslut,"
7,A Short History on Confederate Money,politics," In 1860, Christopher G. Memminger was given the task to organize the Confederate treasury. Memminger was born in Germany on January 9, 1803 and his mother and grandparents immigrated to Charleston, SC shortly after his father's death. Memminger was eventually adopted by the future governor of SC, Thomas Bennett. After studying law, Memminger entered politics and became a member of the SC state legislature in 1836. He was responsible for writing the Constitution of the Confederate States of America as a member of the Confederate Provincial Congress. Memminger became Secretary of the CSA Treasury on Feb 21, 1861 but resigned on July 18, 1864 amid criticism for the CSA's deteriorating economy. When the Confederacy occupied the federal mints at New Orleans, LA, Dahlonega, GA,and Charlotte, NC they discovered these facilities didn't have enough bullion to mint coins. They attempted to issue a half-dollar coin and produced four prototypes. The inability of the CSA to coin money was intensified by people hoarding coins and the bank failures that occurred following secession. The government began to issue paper money but this resulted in rapid inflation. Attempts by the CSA to curb inflation were unsuccessful. Their financial difficulties got worse when counterfeit Confederate notes printed in the North begin to show up in the South. As a deterrent, the Confederate government made counterfeiting a capital crime, punishable by death. Samuel C. Upham of Philadelphia is credited with being the most famous of all the counterfeiters of Confederate currency. Upham produced lithographed notes as Confederate currency facsimiles and mementos of the war. Each note was marked in the margin identifying it as a facsimile. However, purchasers of the notes begin to trim off the margin and use it as genuine currency. Eventually, Upham produced currency without the margin notes selling them for pennies on the dollar. The South issued anywhere from one to two billion dollars in paper money. This number did not include the amount issued in bonds and the currency issued by the individual states, counties, cities, companies and banks. The CSA had hoped to obtain European loans and finance the war by the sale of cotton abroad. However, the Union blockade inhibited the export of cotton. Toward the end of the war, Confederate currency became worthless. Ironically, many issues of Confederate currency are very valuable today as collectables."
8,Green Taxation?,politics," Our government is saving us from the threat of ""dangerous"" disposable products - with taxes! Recently a law in France was passed to tax plastic tableware to try to encourage consumers to buy more eco-friendly products, and Paris is planning to expand the measure to include several other items, the environment minister announced last Monday. There are similar taxes on disposable products in Malta and closer to home in Ireland; the plastic carrier bag tax of 15 Eurocents per bag was introduced in 2002. In Europe we are starting to see a variety of stores charge for bags, or only offer ""bags for life"" at checkouts or their Anya Hindmarch equivalents. Sainsburys have announced today that they will not give carrier bags away at the tills and customers must request them. There is apparently a law in Spain that states that companies serving food are required to lay a new table cover (or serve food on a wipe clean table) after each customer. Restaurants in Spain use large amounts of disposable paper table cloths as this law would require the restaurants to either have an abundance of linen table covers or serve their meals on McDonalds style wipable tables in order to meet their obligations. Not really the image most restaurants would aim for (unless you run a KFC/Burger King et al). In the UK we have some rules regarding disposable products which don't fit well with the apparent ""green"" policies of governments past and present. One such law is that recycled paper cannot be used to make items which come into direct contact with food. A sensible idea I think; you don't want to be eating your supper from a paper plate which used to be bog roll. However many companies in UK, in order to be seen to be eco-friendly and 'doing their bit' are offering plates and Catering Supplies made from recycled material. But how you ask? Surely hundreds are falling ill from horrible diseases or something? Well no, what the companies are doing is laminating the top of the paper plates with plastic so the food don't actually come into contact with the surface of the paper. Great idea?! No, bad idea. The items is now single use in the strongest sense of the word(s). These new plates cannot be recycled into anything and will need to go to landfill as the paper and plastic are fused together forever. Just because something is made from re-claimed material does not mean it is a ""green"" product, attention to how the product is made and if the product can be recycled after use is most important. Every product Event Supplies sell can be recycled and many are made from recycled paper where the law allows, and they do let you know what the goods are made from. Beware of companies cashing in on the whole green hoopla at the moment with really not very eco sound products. A common law and set of taxes for the whole of the EU could possibly be the future with regard to disposable products such as paper plates, Paper Cups and Plastic Cups. One country taxing a particular disposable product heavily could mean governments in their quest to be seen to be doing the right thing will unintentionally close disposable manufacturing companies leaving thousands out of work. I do wonder however, how taxing anything disposable will save the world. People will simply pay more and we doubt all the money in the world can stop icecaps from melting and landfill sites from overflowing. Personally I like the plastic bag tax, this one works and fewer plastic bags are being used as a result and people still get their groceries home. Some products however, you cannot simply substitute with products that are ""for life"". People need to be responsible for recycling; the onus should be on us at home and work."
9,Racial & Gender Reality in American Politics,politics," In recent years we have been fed the idea that political correctness is finally a way of life in America. Television, Hollywood, Internet and print media are all presenting this idea as fact. Ethnic entertainment stars and politicians are trotted out as examples of just how politically correct America has become. But, is the picture a true one Will it apply this election year It was not so many years ago that there was a deeply seated notion that certain ethnic groups were incapable of the intelligence required to handle a political office. And, women were seen as emotionally incapable of making political decisions based on logic rather than emotion. It took government action and the U.S. Supreme Court to force America, kicking and screaming, to accept that  all men are created equal, women as well. Yet, groups such as the Ku Klux Klan or K.K.K., while mostly underground these days, exist along with white supremacists. If you believe historians, we in the North have always been more liberal toward minorities and women. We are now told that the South, while deeply rooted in the traditions of the past, is starting to admit that black people are worthy of being called human beings. And, that blacks have intelligent ideas and solutions for improving the areas in which they live. We are asked to believe, in general, the South now recognize the equality of all people as human beings, rather than being blinded by skin color or gender. I would argue that the opposite is really the truth. Society, North or South, still has much work to do in regards to eradicating racism and gender and religious bias. On the surface it appears there have been major strides in the political arena. This year even sees a black presidential candidate and a white female presidential candidate. While the polls show each has a strong chance of becoming President, the election is many months away. The issues of race and gender will play key roles in political campaigns behind the scenes. Campaign workers will capitalize on racial and gender bias when contacting voters. They will do this in positive and negative ways depending upon the voting group being contacted. For the most part, it s true that black people and women are no longer considered to be property. Blacks are no longer forced to walk behind white people in a neighborhood, no longer forced to ride in the back of a bus, nor drink from a separate fountain or use separate lavatory facilities. However, black people are treated largely as equal to white people because it s the law of the land. Americans were forced, by law, to give women and blacks the right to vote, for example. They could no longer be denied the rights enoyed by most Americans for decades. The right to vote has given minorities and women tremendous power. Many minorities and women today are becoming the heads of major corporations many are now earning salaries equal to, if not higher, than their white counterparts, some rising to the top of their profession at an equally fast rate. This is a major step in the right direction to reduce racism and gender bias but, again, under the force of law. In addition, there are minorities and women in offices of political power across the country thanks, largely, to the right to vote laws. Minorities and women are slowly starting to take positions as politicians at the federal, state, and local levels. This is a major step forward, and a sure sign that, with time, racial and gender bias will be beaten. Some advancement is due to open minds, people who truly look past color, religion, and gender. You will find them in pockets of liberalism around the nation. Where a minority or a woman is elected, there you will find open minds, people who vote on where the candidates stand on issues. The exception, if there is one, is where the candidate represents a district that is largely populated by voters of a background similar to the candidate. In the South, there is still the Ku Klux Klan operating. Although they are significantly weaker than was the case 100, 50, or even 20 years ago, they continue to work behind the scenes to deny blacks their rightful place in America. Such groups and organizations impede progress, clinging to their hate and ignorance. But, despite their attempts blacks are making a name for themselves, and proving they are as capable of political talent as anyone else in the country. While this progress is largely because of the force of voting rights laws, we should be encouraged. With the advancements that have been forced in the last few decades, it possible we may see a President who is a minority or female in this generation. Will it be in Election 2008 I do not believe so. My reasoning for this pessimism is simple What we see publicly portrayed in Media, this idea that America is now politically correct, is not reality. Test this for yourself by raising this subject with someone. I doubt they will admit they are racially or gender biased. Most likely they will say positive things to your face but will vote just the opposite. While this is the reality in America, it is our right to vote our choices regardless of how misguided such thinking is"
10,Wear Red Shirts on Fridays - Support our Soldiers,politics," The Red Fridays Foundation of Canada is requesting that everyone wear something red each and every Friday in support of the men and women who serve our country in the military. A non-partisan organization, the RFFC was founded in 2006 by Brian Muntz in order to show fellow Canadians that ""we care and honor those who fought for our freedom, our peace, our resolve.""  They do not support any particular political agenda or the nature of a military mission, and do not operate as a charity. Rather, they are registered as a private foundation whose business activity is public awareness. The organization sells pins, badges, bumper stickers, magnets and clothing in order to help spread the word and to cover advertising costs.  As just one example of a fundraising effort, the RFFC sponsored a Repatriation Memorial Drive in 2008. Over 1,000 trucks, cars, buses and motorcycles were driven from Trenton to Toronto along the Highway of Heroes to pay tribute to current Canadian service men and women as well as veterans. Twelve thousand dollars was raised and the money donated to the Canadian Hearing Society. It will be used in their Hearing Care Counseling program that helps people adapt to their hearing loss and continue to lead independent lives. They hope to teach veterans with hearing loss the skills they need to live safely at home and to be able to communicate with family and friends. The foundation cannot make donations directly to the military and they discourage people from giving money directly to them. However, with the proceeds from the sale of the pins, badges, etc., and from sponsoring various events, they are able to send out press releases to the media, sponsor multi-media publishing and advertising, cover event costs such as permits and staffing, and continue their Web presence and electronic marketing. All of the staff serves on a volunteer basis. The Red Fridays Foundation Website, www.redfridays.ca, hopes to offer everyone who supports the movement a common portal on which to publicize their events, and they will also provide assistance in organizing them. In addition, they publish memorials on the site for all soldiers who have given their lives for Canada recently. Perhaps the Wear Red on Friday's campaign will spread to countries all over the world in an effort to support troops serving their country and to help promote world peace."
11,"Governors Palin, Sanford: The Dynamics of Workplace Priorities",politics," Introduction I listened to chatter over the airwaves. Talkshow host Armstrong William led a merry discussion on South Carolina’s Governor Mark Sanford.  Armstrong could not contain himself: ""How does Governor Sanford get rid of his Love Jones?"" It was a question that was not easily answered. Listeners from South Carolina appeared irritated with this line of questioning. Many felt the governor had abandoned his wife, children, and the people of South Carolina. At the same time, Governor Sarah Palin was busy steering clear of another ethics charge in her own state. Some people may view these circumstances as petty politics. However, the governors’ situations have turned the spotlight on the difficulty of managing work ambition with one’s own family priorities. Therefore, a deeper inspection will reveal how work priorities can bear down on an individual’s personal and family life. Background On June 24th, Governor Sanford arranged a press conference where he confessed a year-long affair with an Argentine woman. He was missing for more than six days from his office. At his press conference, political pundits argued Governor Sanford was attempting to save his job, not his family life. He is married and has four sons. Instead of a low-profile strategy, Governor Sanford actively engaged the media, describing his mistress as his ""soul mate.""  Clearly, he had lost his mind. His wife Jenny stated, ""I believe enduring love is primarily a commitment and an act of will, and for a marriage to be successful, that commitment must be reciprocal."" On July 3, 2009, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin surprised America as she announced her resignation as governor in July. This news created a shockwave in political circles. Was Palin run off or plotting a crafty strategy for the White House in 2012?  Regardless of her specific motivation, a reasonable person could understand the priorities issues that Governor Palin faced as a wife, mother, and political figure. Many political analysts view her as a politically ambitious person. Alaska columnist Michael Carey noted the popularity of Governor Palin as a media juggernaut: ""She’s gone from being our governor or a public figure in Alaska to being a national celebrity.""  However, her political savvy has left her family exposed to public ridicule. Her family has endured through vicious rumors and negative press. When the stakes gets higher for these public figures in their professional life, it challenges the rest of their life. The Major Issue Many individuals in their careers fail to recognize the impacts of their work obligations on the priorities of their overall life. Making these priority decisions is difficult for most working adults. Yes, some people appear to handle this reality better than others. Many people believe that they can have it both ways - get what they want without giving up anything that matters to them. Bill Kemp, author of Peter’s Boat, notes, ""Driven by the satisfaction of doing ‘the right thing,’ we enter these mazes that do not offer us a places to consider our personal needs or reflect on what appropriate limits we should place o our behavior."" Therefore, there needs to be a tradeoff between ""living for today"" and ""living for tomorrow"" if individuals are to achieve family balance.  In fact, we cannot be truly satisfied as long as we have our souls torn in different places. Biblically speaking, this reality is summed up by the verse, ""No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other . . ."" Some folks appear to be happy on the outside yet torn to pieces on the inside by the demons of competing priorities. Consequently, the long-term effects of some tradeoffs can impact your health, marriage, and other relationships. Conclusion Living a life in the spotlight is difficult, and America has witnessed this fact play out in the lives of many famous people such as Governors Sanford and Palin. This article demonstrates how individuals need to consider the consequences of their work life on their personal and family life. As in the case of these public figures, the pressures of life can offer many distractions. Consequently, it is important during the rat race to keep priorities in order lest one finds himself spinning in circles. Working adults should not cave in to the external pressures of others and squander precious time and opportunity. The concept of priorities involves making the appropriate choices on how the family spends its resources (especially time). Failing to accomplish this task will continue to produce confusion, misunderstanding, and lack of communication in your families. You don’t have to settle for anything less than the best. Let’s hope that it is not too late."
12,Why Civil Unrest and Revolutions are Two Very Different Things,politics," Introduction – In many countries (one in particular) people are poor, homeless, without health care, without jobs, fearful of criminals, and mad at their governments. Things will happen when things reach this stage and are worsening. We explain why Civil Unrest (riots, demonstrations) are possible and even starting to happen in some places around the civilized world now but a revolution is something most unlikely to occur. Civil Unrest in the Past – People gathered in an urban area are likely to demonstrate and even riot as the economy declines. Let us set the stage in detail. They are faced with foreclosure or eviction. They have been out of work. Savings are depleted. The Internet and cable TV are already disconnected for non-payment of bills. The phones may be off. The bill collectors are calling and sending letters. The car may be parked in a friend’s house to avoid repossession. There is no health care insurance anymore; it went away when the job was lost. The wait to be seen at an emergency room or free clinic is many hours and this is the only affordable source of health care. Trips to the supermarket must be planned so as to economize on the amount of expensive gas to be used. Groceries are being bought on sale. The dented can stores are sold out more often. Every month things get worse and worse. Job prospects are so bad the people are not even trying to get work anymore. There is no end to the depression in sight. Crime rates are soaring. Police are disrespectful and offer little protection. Taser use is widespread by the police. The jails are packed to way above capacity. Then a demonstration starts. Can be spontaneous or planned. It may be hot and humid. Most riots are on the hot summer days, right about now. Things get loud fast. People are drinking beer or hard stuff. The police get scared. They get riot gear on. The crowd grows. The crowd knows that if they let things go out of control the police may just contain them and let them loot and burn the retailers in the area. Historically this happens. They could then grab some booze, steaks, electrical appliances get stinking drunk and then it is over. Almost no one goes to jail. Rioters are filmed but nothing happens. Sometimes it grows and they attack motorists unfortunate enough to be in the area. Usually the police try to contain the riot into a specific area. It is always going to start in a poor area. Sometimes local merchants arm themselves heavily and defend their property from the roof and from inside with rifles and shotguns shooting looters. Sometimes the police ignore this, other times they may prosecute the merchants. The scenario can go for a few hours or even a few days. The police will cut off water and electricity in the section at times although this can make things worse. These riots always wind down in the past, as the crowd gets tired, hung over and full of liberated goods from the retailers they looted. Future Civil Unrest – Today the civil unrest may be different. The police may not be able to contain the crowds. There are so many unemployed and homeless people that the crowd can grow to an alarming size. The police will not be able to stop them. If they start shooting into the crowd with lethal or non-lethal munitions the crowd may rush them and kill the police. A lot of police will be afraid to shoot into the crowd for fear of being charged with murder after it is over. The press and private citizens will be filming the entire event. Cell phone cameras changed the rules of the game. Many police will not have the stomach to murder the rioting people. So now the crowd gets wild. They loot the local retailers and then they start wandering into the more affluent areas. Imagine them swarm into a gated golf course community going house to house looting, beating, raping, killing and stealing. The more affluent areas will have firearms in the home. Rifles and shotguns will soon be trained on the rioters and a blood bath will ensue. The rioters will capture arms and it will be of epic proportions. Many dead. The rioters will ultimately be repelled away from these areas but only after heavy losses. Wounded and dead will be in the houses and in the streets. The police will be worried about their own houses and families. Many will abandon their posts to go home or just stand back at a safe distance ready to flee. Police are used to being the force in control. If they lose control and cannot regain it, they will retreat or outright run away. They are not a highly trained military unit, trained to fight against overwhelming odds. They suffer from divisions, racial and religious discrimination amongst their ranks and to them it is just a job. Dick Tracy, Rambo, Batman are nothing but myths. Eventually the riots will dissipate. Things will never be the same again. The poor will hate and resent the wealthy for shooting them when all they wanted to do was break into their house and rob, rape and kill them. The rich will now arm themselves to the teeth (already happening). They will fortify their houses. Watch committees will be formed with locals patrolling their neighborhoods armed with guns, walkie talkies and cell phones. The police will try to put this down but after their retreats this will not go over too well. The governments will hate this since the people are not longer relying on them for protection. Still the governments will be in control, just like before. Nothing substantial will change. What Riots Do – They wreck property, and kill. They do not overthrow the government. The government is not very fearful of riots. In a bad one they can deploy tanks and helicopters and take control anytime. The facilities the government considers to be vital are heavily fortified and will never be over run by a mob. For this one would need an army with air superiority. Riots chip away at a government but do little else. Rich people getting their communities attacked and ravaged is something the government can deal with. The rich people have no recourse. The super rich are not going to be in such a situation. They live far away from areas where rioting will break out. They can easily leave an area by helicopter at any time. They have many houses and condos and can easily take the loss of one urban condo due to rioting. The super rich live in estates far away from ghettos. They have many armed security guards and bodyguards on each shift. Think a dozen per shift or more. They have roving patrols, electronic surveillance with sensors, dogs and hard to access compounds where the rich live. Rioting mobs are no threat. If a threat emerged they would escape by helicopter leaving their security forces to shoot it out with the invaders while awaiting a helicopter airlift from the security company with backup security forces. These people are out of the risk matrix. What A Revolution Requires – Since we are on the subject we will get into it just as a theoretical information purposes, only an intellectual discourse. There is a lot of mention on the Internet and on websites about revolution brewing. I think it is absurd to think this can occur. First what is needed is a leader. Who would that be? Ron Paul? Last I heard he was sitting in the House of Representatives, operating as one of the establishment. Trying to change things from within the system is never going to work and that is what he does. How’s he doing anyway? He gets support, makes people think there is hope and nothing else. The courts are never going to rule against those that give them paychecks. There is no identifiable leader running around that can be identified. If there was I doubt he would be around for long, instead be imprisoned or worse. Supporting A Revolutionary Force – Next, we can discuss how would a revolutionary force survive? Where would they live? Who would support them? Would you mind supporting them? What if they came to your house and said hey it is time to pay your dues. We need meat, tuna, milk, Tylenol, alcohol, soap etc. If you give it to them you can get 50 years in jail for aiding and abetting, conspiracy to commit treason etc. If you do not give it to them they may loot your house. See how it goes. Study Vietnam. If the villagers helped the VC the Americans burned their village down. If they did not help the VC, the VC killed and tortured them. Imagine that, no neutral ground. In the American war of independence only 15% of the people actually fought against the British. The rest tried to stay neutral. This means 85% of these people did nothing brave, courageous or anything else to protect their freedom and rights. So much for fighting for freedom. There was no media or Internet for the British to control. There was no dumbing down of the masses with vaccines, fast food etc. The people just flat out would not stand up and fight. Today would be no different in that the vast vast majority of the people will do nothing while their rights evaporate. Oh sure they will go vote but look how much good that has done. Any idiot can run for office promising the have nots a handout from the haves. This is of course not sustainable but if the politicians get a few years out of it they are rewarded and the rest of the people suffer. Division – There is generally great division amongst the groups calling for a ""change"". There is no unity. This means the groups would fight each other for control sooner or later. Divide and defeat. They are divided. The republican and democrats only fight about minor things. Anyone of them actually investigating the Federal Reserve or changing it into a constitutional money system? See any reduction in war with republicans or democrats? See any restoration of freedoms with republicans or democrats? They stick together on the important issues and fight about things that are of no threat to their power base. Methodology – A revolution is a bloody affair. Small forces have to resort to tactics that will offend a certain amount of people thus destroying support in some areas. The powers in control will start false revolutionary movements to lure people away to a faction that will be loud vocally and do nothing. The unity will be missing. Having a common enemy is not enough. How to deal with this common enemy (tactics) is also important. The forces in control will be quick to do false flag operations to give the revolutionary forces a black eye or two turning the peoples support away from them. It is a long way to taking control away from the forces in control. What Good Would a Revolutionary Force Do – Not much militaristically? Revolutionary forces cannot engage the enemy openly. This was tried in Vietnam and they took massive losses until they stopped this and went underground as a terrorist force. The forces in power are capable of fortifying their important strategic locations. They have air superiority. They have missiles, tanks, naval vessels etc. Revolutionary forces would be little more than harassment to them. The French underground hurt the occupying Nazis a lot, but remember the Nazis were at war on multiple fronts. The resistance had foreign armies and governments supporting them in everyway. They had training, communications, intel, supplies, military advisors, forged documents, etc. Since there is no active major war on their borders the French underground model is irrelevant to today. The Vietnam model is more relevant. They were able to harass and undermine the ""invading force"" until they left. In this case there is no leaving, they are already there, where are they going to retreat to? So forget this as a model too. Basically they would accomplish nothing strategically. They would eventually get caught and killed. They would damage the government a little. Owning assault rifles, shotguns etc are the type of weaponry that is useful for an underground force to harass an invading army that is stretched thin because they are at war. The troop morale in the battlefield can be lowered by this a lot with snipers, destroying food and water, medical supplies, taking the soldiers hostage etc. In the absence of a major war this is going to be futile. These weapons are not of any military significance. One attack helicopter could destroy what 3000 people with assault rifles in three minutes. What about twenty such helicopters and ten fighter jets and bombers. They could wipe out 25,000 troops with tanks, armored cars etc in moments. The people who have these weapons are not hardened troops; Most have never been in combat. They are not used to sleeping in the woods. They are not trained to fight as a unit. Some may know how to shoot the guns but what about intelligence gathering, communications, supply, medical, roads, buildings, bridges, organization, chain of command etc. See how futile it is to imagine them taking control. What Could an Armed Population Do – They could resist the government by ignoring it and its laws. The government would not be able to function as it has been doing. They would not want to go house to house and play round up arresting people or summarily executing the people on the spot. A certain amount of people would engage the government forces be they military or police, in armed combat defending their homes until the end. This is making martyrs and martyrs are a scary thing for a police state. Small groups would form. The people would be talking of concentration camps, death camps, torture, true or just based on fears. Local governments would be destroyed, taken over etc. Small police agencies would be powerless. They live in the community and would need to avoid these people who could visit them at home in an aggressive manner. The forces in control would need to back track, be patient and try to get the guns away using their legislatures and courts to do so in a way that the people can be deceived into complying with. This has not worked. It has even backfired recently with more guns and ammo being sold and stock piled. They would regroup and try to get the guns away from different angles and legal viewpoints. Sound familiar. Their big mistake would be to go house-to-house and lock people up and take guns away. This is something they cannot do because it will scare the people. Their own troops and police will not like getting shot at by non-criminals who have as sophisticated guns as they do with basic shooting skills. This will be dangerous for the police. They will also have to start Nazi like internal security measure to guard against sympathizers amongst their own ranks of military and police. This will not be liked at all by their own enforcers. If they swarm in groups of fifty on a single house with armored cars, helicopters, etc the people may go down fighting and thus make it worse for them. They need to operate under color of law until they get the guns away or they could lose it. If 50% of the households decided to go on the armed aggressive and end the control of the forces in power they would be able to accomplish it. Probably 20% would have a flying chance of accomplishing it. The military and police would abandon their positions and then it is over. In the aggressive setting with house to house searches and arrests people may rise up and seek out the police and attack their homes so police forces will need to be housed in secure areas. Thus they and their families are segregated from the community. They would suffer from sniper attacks, car bombs etc. See this is a path the powers that be will not go down. I think widespread raiding people’s houses and taking them and or their guns away is an urban myth. They may keep trying to pass laws to this affect for propaganda value only to create fear. A Stalemate – What we really have is the government trying to convince many millions of people to disarm themselves using laws and the courts for an alibi. This has recently caused a stockpiling of guns and ammo in the civilian sector. People are distrusting of the fed and are suspicious of them. Training schools for shooting and tactics have sprung up all over the place. There are even roving schools coming to cities teaching the people to escape from handcuffs, plastic tie handcuffs and duct tape. The handcuffs they pick with concealed paper clips and the like. Before you get too excited there are ways to lock handcuffs by pressing the key into the lock. There are also handcuffs with more sophisticated pick resistant locks. If the one capturing you is stupid just conceal handcuff keys of different types where you can get them if cuffed behind or in front, which is no harder than concealing bobby pins or paper clips and in reality both will assist your escape. The duct tape, plastic tie escape works if hands are bound in front. The drill is to thrust your elbows back at an angle to pass around on your ribs hard and fast. Karate students will understand as a double elbow strike to the rear. It helps to tighten the tie or duct tape as much as possible before doing this. Numerous attempts may be needed. If the hands are tied behind the back it will not work. Bulletproof vests are sold in large numbers. Fifty caliber guns have soared in sales. It is close to impossible to protect against a fifty caliber round short of using heavily armored tanks and military vehicles. If one encountered an armored vehicle with a window, the window might sustain a few fifty-caliber rounds but if several rounds were fired into the same window it would fail. Same for armored car doors, just keep firing many rounds at a door until it fails. If the fifty caliber rounds are made out of molybdenum, then armoring against the round is way more difficult. A fifty caliber round is usually 750 grains at about 3500 fps (as an average figure). One can get a sabot round which is a smaller bullet housed in a plastic container placed inside of the standard shell casing. This can propel the lighter round at speeds of 5000+ fps, which makes the round incredibly hard to armor against. Explosive tank armor would work. Velocity defeats armor is the rule of thumb. The thing to bear in mind is that the states like Montana and Tennessee are starting with laws concerning regular guns being exempt if made in the state and not sold out of the state. The next phase will be large caliber weapons like 20mm guns, antitank rifles, etc. Such weapons would make the use of anything short of a heavily armored battalion futile against them. Several 20mm rounds hitting a police car would flip it over. The cost of such weapons is not prohibitive either since they would be freely available and one would not have to buy an already registered one. These weapons are available now but require all sorts of special licenses and the amount of these guns available is very small so prices are high. So why are the people buying these weapons in record numbers. Surely they are not trying to blow Bambi or Yogi Bear into small pieces. They think it will curtail the government from taking their freedoms and money away. It is causing the forces in control to alter their tactics and try different approaches is all. This is the stalemate. The government is not as smart as they think or as smart as most people think they are. Look how good their economy is. Look how well they do in wars. Look at their popular support. They want popular support; just do not know how to get it. In the past they found that citizens would tolerate registration of guns. They then only let people without criminal records have guns. Then they stopped people from carrying them concealed. Then they restricted greatly any machine guns, large caliber guns and silencers. The people even let them impose waiting periods to take possession of a newly purchased gun. Then the movement turned the other way as the people realized they were being deceived and the whole thrust of these gun laws was confiscation and gun laws got more liberal. The citizens are stockpiling arms and guns and trying to loosen the gun laws more constantly. The government is trying to tighten the gun laws and confiscate guns. Both sides are afraid to push the other side towards outright violence. The government tries new legislation constantly and so do the people. The people keep stockpiling arms and munitions and the government keeps expanding it police forces. There is a stalemate and both sides are trying to break it, but neither one is prepared to resort to outright violence at this time. What Will break the Stalemate – One way or the other states rights seems destined to break the stalemate. It is a no brainer that the states have the constitution and the law on their side. A tenth grader could figure this out. What is the first test going to be? Guns! Tennessee and Montana passed laws saying if a gun or ammo is manufactured in their state to be sold or used in their state, it is exempt from federal laws, registration etc. The fed is of course saying no. What happens next is critical. If the states go to court and wait five years, then consider the movement dead and possibly a ruse to make people think there was hope while they tighten their grip further. If they proceed to make the guns and sell them defying the fed, then the movement will have legs. This is being done with medical marijuana so do not think this is not going to happen. If the fed comes in and locks the violators up it could get interesting. The fed will come with large numbers, probably in the hundreds of armed agents, tanks and helicopters to conduct the raid. The people being arrested may engage in a full battle but you never really can be all that certain. The feds would call in hundreds of additional agents fast until they got the upper hand. Now comes martyrs, retaliation, an underground network that is emotionally charged, armed etc will emerge. There are more states passing such laws and they are also going after the new absurd health care reform being forced on them using the same tenth amendment to get out from under it. An unregistered gun scares the fed badly and that is what the states are trying to do. If a state says no we can do it and the fed says no, it demonizes the fed. This gets people emotionally charged and mad. Now there is a population with guns made under the new state laws and the feds do not know who they are. The next generation of guns they make will most likely be full house military weapons and that makes things much harder for the fed especially if these are unlicensed or licensed in such a way that the fed cannot access the records. So do not think the fed is doing so good, they are not having things go their way at all. In foreign affairs the current administration is failing miserably on all fronts. North Korea insults them with regularity. The Middle East is a mess. They have next to no influence in Latin America, Russia insults them, and China is trying hard to undermine their currency along with Russia, India, Brazil and many other nations. Back to the States Rights and Secession - If the states get the first and second generation of weapons to be made without fed interference then they are basically positioning themselves for secession. They will have a massive amount of military small arms (not just assault rifles), which will complicate an invasion a la Abraham Lincoln to crush secession unconstitutionally. If one or two states secede millions will rush in to join bringing whatever assets they have. As more assets and business people, skilled people, educated people leave the welfare states, their problems for the fed multiply big time. Who are they going to tax to keep their socialized system going? Nonproductive government jobs cannot support a country unless you have massive natural resources to sell which is not the case. The states will learn that the less and less they have to do with the fed the better off they are. If the fed lets them invoke the tenth amendment the states will stay in the union but opt out of a lot of programs. They will eventually reduce the amount of income tax they are willing to pay since they a re drawing down on fewer services form the fed. That will be the last straw for the fed. See it has to end badly. More on States Rights and Secession – If the states see the futility of relying on the federal courts to set themselves free, then things will happen. If the fed corrupts the leaders of the states to be in their pocket then it will go nowhere except to the courts for years. This is the thing to be on guard against. The states can secede without the permission of the fed. If two or three of them decide to do so, the fed will be helpless practically speaking. Attacking them militarily is out. The citizens will organize and resist with weapons. Invaders will be captured and go to jail, executed for crimes against the state, war crimes etc. This would break the morale of the invaders. Millions of those not happy with the fed will migrate into these states and fight by joining a military or Para-military unit. Resistance groups of underground fighters (relatives of those killed by the invaders) would mobilize in the enemy territory taking the fight to them as terrorists. Remember now there would be training, communication, support, financing, documents etc. The model is Iran supporting the resistance in Iraq. Bottom line for the fed would be end game for life, as they know it today if the states secede. Attacking with a military is their stupidest move politically. They will suck it up and try to act like they are at peace with the new nations while they try to undermine them, cause revolt, ruin their economy and eventually put their own puppet leaders into office. This would be their intent; I did not say they would be successful. This is what they do around the world on a daily basis. If the new nations set up systems like the Swiss have where the voters can vote down any new law they will be far better off. Another way to do it is with a vote of no confidence where the ruling party in parliament can be challenged and if they cannot summon enough votes for a majority there is a new election. If they go to a government that can do whatever they want after being elected including broken promises their new nation will soon be a mess like the country is today. They need to cling to the constitution closely and no electronic voting machines. Lets watch and see how it progresses. http://www.panamalaw.org"
13,Where Does Society's Wealth Come From?,politics," Where Does Society's Wealth Come From? By Punkerslut ""All that man values is created by his industry..."" --J.C.L. Simonde de Sismondi, ""Political Economy,"" 1815, Chapter 2 ""...wealth never can come in but by the produce of labour going out..."" --James Steuart, ""The Principles of Political Economy,"" 1767, Book 1, Chapter 14 ""... the strongest and most industrious majority, which supports the whole society."" --Leo Tolstoy, ""To the Tsar and His Assistants,"" 1901. ""Every thing in the world is purchased by labour..."" --David Hume, ""Of Commerce,"" 1752. All wealth is the product of labor.  But we are living in a world where the laborers do not own the wealth they create.  Instead, we are living on a planet where the few, idle Capitalists own the majority of wealth. We the workers are responsible for all wealth.  But we are completely excluded from owning or managing this wealth.  We aren't allowed to direct how the means of production are organized, or what they're organized for.  We aren't allowed to receive the whole product of our labor, since a Capitalist exploits us to support their opulent luxury.  From the hours we work to the products available on the market -- nobody consults the creators of wealth on how productive property should be organized and directed. There are some who argue that workers alone aren't responsible for all wealth.  They'll say that workers need machinery and land, provided by the Capitalist, to labor and create wealth.  These people forget that the machinery was made by the workers -- and the land, itself, was made useful by the workers.  These aren't things ""added"" by the Capitalist; they are things exploited out of their natural creators -- the working class.  It is similar with innovation, where companies steal technologies created by their employees -- from the earliest machinery to Nikola Tesla's automobile engine. Everything is society is created by the workers.  Why, then, is it that the workers are the least benefitted from this wealth?  It is because of the Capitalist system!  If workers were to manage the businesses themselves, they could organize the industries for the benefit of all.  Instead, we are living in society where businesses are managed by the few -- so, they only benefit the few. http://www.punkerslut.com Punkerslut,"
14,California Political Issues,politics," Reporting from Sacramento -- Efforts by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders to reach agreement on a package to wipe out the state's $26.3-billion deficit stalled Wednesday night. Despite earlier consensus on how to close most of the gap, some nagging final issues stopped them from completing their work. They ended talks just after 10 p.m. ""I hate to describe it as a setback,"" said Assembly Speaker Karen Bass (D-Los Angeles), referring to the talks, ""but it is definitely a stall."" Among the issues still unresolved are how to tweak voter-approved school funding formulas so the state can cut from education the billions of dollars it needs to balance the budget.""When times are better and we can afford it,"" said state Senate leader Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento), ""we want education to be paid back."" Other sticking points are changes to the structure of state government that the governor is demanding as part of any final deal. Schwarzenegger says the changes would produce long-term savings by making various programs more efficient. One contentious proposal would change the state welfare program to increase penalties for participants who do not meet minimum federal work requirements. Currently, emergency cash is available for children of parents in that category; those grants could be eliminated under Schwarzenegger's plan. . Participants in the discussions had expressed optimism before Wednesday's talks began. ""There is no nastiness in the discussions -- no blowups, chairs flying and what usually are the routines -- there's none of that,"" Schwarzenegger said at a morning news conference. ""So I think that we have a good shot of getting the budget done today. But there are still, I have to just caution, there are still some very important things that are not resolved."" Against the backdrop of goodwill, however, political bickering persisted. The powerful California Teachers Assn. continues running advertisements attacking the governor for his plan to cut money from schools. And the governor is running advertisements that Democrats say wrongly accuse them of trying to sneak tax hikes into the budget. The California Democratic Party filed a complaint Wednesday with the state's ethics agency, seeking to force the governor's spots off the air. The ads, the party says, are paid for with funds that may be spent only to promote initiatives and referendums. The governor's campaign team called the complaint a baseless ""political attack."""
15,Sarah Palin - Who is She and What is Her Purpose?,politics," She was the first woman to be nominated Vice President by the Republican Party for the 2008 election and is soon to be the ex-Governor of Alaska. Astrology shows she was destined for worldwide recognition. Let’s look at what an Aquarian’s life purpose is, and specifically, that of Sarah Palin.  Aquarians’ are known to be on the cutting edge of all things new.  They often work in careers that are unusual in some way, especially to gender.  To them, tradition is worth striving for, but in new and unique ways. Born February 11, 1964, this Aquarian continues to live a life of many unusual or unique events.  Here are her astrological influences, based on her date of birth.  By the way, the reason these influences are so important is because they show the blueprint of the lessons a soul was born to learn. Sun: Aquarius Moon: Capricorn Mercury: Aquarius Venus: Aries Mars: Aquarius Jupiter: Aries Saturn: Aquarius Uranus: Virgo Neptune: Scorpio Pluto: Virgo SUN AQUARIUS: She was born to see the world as one and to unite people for the good of all.  Sarah Palin is independent, brilliant and cares very much about social issues.  She’ll work hard through her input into organizations, rather than as a lone wolf.  She teaches new ideas and while she would love to be liked by everyone, her ""cause"" for others is even more important than her likability.  Interesting, since in 1983 she won the Miss Congeniality award during the Miss Alaska pageant. MOON CAPRICORN: Fortunately Sarah has an earthy Moon in Capricorn which makes her personality much more down to earth than the typical quirky Aquarian.  Aquarians have a reputation of being a little ""Pie in the Sky"" quirky with tons of ideas but no practical application.  Not so with Sarah Palin because she puts a lot of emotional energy behind her goals of achievement.  In fact, when most people would be tired and worn out, she finds the energy from deep within to keep going.  Her emotion may be anything from anger to integrity, but like the Energizer Bunny, she keeps going and going until she reaches her current goal.  Because of her Aquarian energy, show knows when to stop an unproductive direction and switch gears, all the while keeping her direction on achievement & success. MERCURY AQUARIUS: A bit of a psychologist, she’s excellent at finding what motivates others and using it for the betterment of the masses.  She really is destined to use her mind and thinking to make important changes for the world.  Had she been born a Gemini, I would have said she was supposed to help those in her immediate community.  But with Mercury in Aquarius, her impact will be worldwide.  She sees things as they ""should"" be and that motivates her to set goals. VENUS ARIES: It’s her ideas and her concern for action that causes Sarah Palin to push and motivate and cheerlead people into action.  This part of her personality is another bonus to make it possible for her to take a goal out of the idea stage and into the action that is required.  If you want to know if she’s telling the truth, watch her eyes. They speak volumes.  She’s probably not a very good poker player because her face reads like a book.  With her, she lives the belief that what you see is what you get. MARS AQUARIUS: Sarah Palin is a steel fist in a velvet glove.  She’s great at shmoozing, pushing, insisting and fighting for what she believes, all with a friendly smile on her face.  People like her.  They don’t see her as a threat to their security, unless they dislike change.  Wherever she goes, she’ll bring change.  Her anger stems from injustice to the downtrodden as well as toward those who cannot see the rightness of her change-driven ideas.  She presents (pushes) her ideas in a public way and becomes impatient with those who do not catch on right away.  She’s no dummy and has no respect for those who are too slow to change. JUPITER ARIES: She is single-minded in her educational goals.  She knows what will best serve her ideals and, information junkie that she is, focuses almost exclusively on whatever her current needs for knowledge require.  This is a woman with laser-like abilities when it comes to higher thoughts.  She has an inborn knack for interstate and international commerce and we may find her looking for energy solutions in the thermodynamics (heat/energy) field.  You can expect her to write an autobiography, as this is part of her Soul’s blueprint. NEPTUNE SCORPIO: Palin came into this life with a finely tuned intuition, especially as it pertains to healing.  Whether it’s the healing of a nation or a member of her family, she has a surprising amount of psychic ability.  She can walk into a room and ""pick up"" the vibes just as easily as breathing.  With this astrological combination she needs to use caution in several areas.  One, is the propensity to become addicted, whether it is alcohol, drugs or religion.  The other is that she could be so wide open psychically that she becomes exhausted by absorbing other people’s negative energy.  She would do well to learn how to empty, through meditation, the polluted junk she picks up from others. PLUTO VIRGO: With this combination it would not surprise me at all if Sarah Palin were to one day have an epitaph that read, ""I demolished the non useful and rebuilt upon the ashes with systems that do work.  I made the health care system more efficient and I worked tirelessly every day of my life to not just destroy, but to rebuild.""  She will find at some time during her life that her day to day work habits will dissolve, only to be replaced by ones that are more efficient, more true to course with her goals and more helpful to others.  She may have a limited view of power and all that implies.  She learned this lesson in 1996 when she was considering the use of her Mayoral powers to remove certain books from the library which she religiously found offensive.  It didn’t happen. Astrology is an interesting tool that discloses the blueprint of your soul.  Because of free will, your personality can follow it’s goals or ignore them.  But keep in mind, you chose your lessons as well as your gifts.  It’s entirely up to you as to whether you want to make the most of them.  I hope you will."
16,Judge Sonia Sotomayor - What is Her Purpose?,politics," The people who serve our country are no different than you or I.  We all have a purpose to contribute to life, based on the qualities we were born with. I watched on TV the Day 1 confirmation hearings for Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court.  As I watched and listened, I began to wonder, ""Who is this woman?  What does she stand for and what are her life lessons?""  If elected as the newest Supreme Court member, she will hold a very formidable position in our country. So, as any excellent astrologer would do :), I looked her up astrologically.  Let me share with you what I found. Born June 25, 1954, Judge Sotomayor is, astrologically speaking, a Cancer.  Family is important to her and her roots extend all the way back to Spain where an ancestor traveled by ship in the 1500's to Central America, adopting Puerto Rico as his new home.  She, of course, was born in The Bronx, New York, centuries later. Here are the astrological influences of her personality.  I'll tell you what they mean in just a moment, as far as her ""Purpose"" is concerned. Sun:  Cancer Moon:  Aries Mercury:  Cancer Venus:  Leo Mars:  Capricorn Jupiter:  Cancer Saturn:  Scorpio Uranus:  Cancer Neptune:  Libra Pluto:  Leo Sun in Cancer: indicates that she is a patriotic woman with mothering instincts, who, interestingly enough, never had children. Unusual for a sun sign Cancer. However, there are alternatives for every sun sign, and she chose politics - very Cancer of her, instead of motherhood.  She sees herself as mother & protector to a nation.  Part of her purpose, having chosen this alternative, is to protect its people through her office. Just as a mother would do for her children at home. Moon in Aries: She hides a personality that is subconsciously motivated by what's best for her.  Hmmm.  This may be a character flaw that will have to be addressed so that, if elected, she remembers that she serves the nation and it's constitution, not her own ideas and wants. Mercury in Cancer:  Her thought process and mind set are very quiet and internal.  This woman is brilliant, in that she never forgets a thing.  She might even have a photographic memory.  As long as she keeps her mind on what's best for the country and follows the Constitution, she will always do the right thing. Venus in Leo: Judge Sotomayor adores the spotlight and wants to be appreciated for her role in leadership.  Because most Supreme Court judges keep a low profile, she may find it difficult to not be the center of attention regularly.  Don't be surprised if she becomes a political author to keep her name in front of the public.  Hey, come to think of it, she is authoring when she hands down a Supreme Court decision.  OK, scratch that.  Her Venus in Leo is resolved. Mars in Capricorn:  She was destined to a position of authority and most, if not all, of her energy has gone toward the achievement of that goal.  I wonder if that's why she and her husband divorced in 1983. She's no slouch when it comes to her work and works long and hard to increase her levels of authority.  Her best efforts pay off later in life. Jupiter in Cancer:  Again, substituting politics for motherhood, the Judge makes a great political advocate or advisor.  Hopefully she will not misdirect this into setting policy for the nation, instead of interpreting the constitution. That's the job of a Supreme Court Justice.  By the way, did you know that the U.S. is, astrologically, a Cancer nation?  Independence Day, July 4, 1776 is the day the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence from England. Our nation was born during the time the sun was passing through the constellation of Cancer. Saturn in Cancer:  She may see herself as responsible for both the mothering and fathering of our nation.  She's likely to nurture in a disciplined way and may have a soft spot for those less fortunate.  The danger here is exactly what opponents have been saying, and that is that she will hand down policy, based on sentiment, rather than the constitution.  Her job is not to make law, but to define and uphold the existing laws of our Constitution; definitely a part of her purpose with Saturn in Cancer. Uranus in Cancer:  Ah, here's the dilemma.  Cancer wants security and tried & true results, but Uranus wants to throw it all out and start over new.  Judge Sotomayor wants and needs a sense of security, based on all her Cancer planets, but Uranus is her monkey wrench.  The secret for her is to start over with a new, non traditional method for something meaningful, without risking her sense of security, or the nation's.  Can she make major changes at work?  Should she do this at work?  A better solution might be to keep change out of her profession in the Supreme Court and use it to, for example, to change laws to protect children. Much safer for the nation. Pluto in Leo:  The planet Pluto is the ultimate search and destroy energy of the zodiac.  In Leo, it means that part of the Judge's life purpose is to search out and destroy her Leo-like ego. This combination could make up the personality of a control freak, dictator or someone whose ego refuses to allow them to answer to anyone other than themselves.  A better solution would be to apply healthy standards of power and control in a leadership position.  There's an old saying by British Lord Acton who said, ""Power tends to corrupt and absolute power absolutely corrupts.""  Sotomayor needs to use caution and take steps toward handling power in a responsible way and for the good of her nation. It will be interesting to see how her hearings proceed.  Will she obtain the position of Justice of the Supreme Court?  Will she follow her Life's Work and bring the positive personality traits she was born with into the service of her country?  Only time will tell."
17,California political campaigns,politics," One cannot deny the fact that political campaigns do leave an impact on the election results. In fact, in majority of the cases, the political campaigns actually decide the fate of different parties. No matter what the political parties say to highlight their performance and to critics their oppositions, the electorate understand their intentions very well. One of the largest states in the western part of United States of America, California is a place which has a long history of political campaigns that have hit the headlines of newspapers in different times. Though a quite well developed state, California has always been a place of political melodrama. There are various issues that always lead to hard battles between the ruling party and the others that aim the throne. Though candidates filing nominations include lot of things in their campaign speech their main focus always remain on the major issues like uneven distribution of water in Northern and Southern California, land dispute, unemployment and criminal activities. People of California are familiar in watching the ruling and opposition party and the governor and governor nominated pointing fingers at each other blaming for the failure to solve these issues. Political campaigns in California take shapes of events prior to the election. The campaign grounds get thickly crowded with people, candidates give fiery speeches, attack oppositions brutally with words and open sack of promises. But ultimately nothing happens. Problems remain with the people of California and they keep on struggling with them. However, in the recent times, California political campaigns have made major impacts on the election results and that is evident from the positive decisions that the Governor of the state is taking. Serious initiatives have been taken to reduce unemployment and the governor has announced plans to increase women empowerment. Besides, steps are being taken to solve issues that have been major reasons behind the sufferings of billions of inhabitants of the state. These days, apart from the Presidential and Gubernational elections, strong impact of California political campaigns have  been noticed in the general elections which is held in all the counties. As the rate of sufferings in the urban and semi urban areas are more, people living their have been giving strong mandates, sometimes in favor and sometimes against the ruling parties."
18,Are you Secure in America?,politics," Introduction - This information is widely available on the Internet. Many of you may not be aware of it. Since the USA is in the midst of a financial meltdown you should perhaps familiarize yourself with some of these things. If civil unrest sets in like riots, protests demonstrations, states trying to enforce some of their states rights not just talking about it you may see some or all of these measure enacted. Doom and Gloom would be the descriptive words. The constitution appears to be irrelevant to the government. Executive Orders Allowing the Government to Take Control Over Everything. EXECUTIVE ORDER 10990 - This authorizes the federal government to control completely any and all means of transport of products or people, all waterways and roads. Looks like this one is in place already. Been to airport or seaport lately. EXECUTIVE ORDER 10995 - This authorizes the federal government take over the communications media companies. Hard to say this has not been done with the large media companies anyway. EXECUTIVE ORDER 10997 – This grants the power for the federal government to control entirely all energy including utility companies, water companies, oil production or refining etc. EXECUTIVE ORDER 10998 – This authorizes the federal government to confiscate all modes of transportation, including railroad cars, boats, planes, motorcycles, cars, and trucks. They also get control over all roads, ports, rivers, lakes etc. EXECUTIVE ORDER 10999 – This is an especially scary one. It lets the federal government control all food resources and food production facilities. Think this one over. Does this include paying people to not grow food? Do you like Genetically Modified Food as much as the government does? The guys who said Viox is safe get to control your food. Great. EXECUTIVE ORDER 11000 - This authorizes the federal government to put civilians constituents into labor forces under government supervision and control. Imagine this one. EXECUTIVE ORDER 11001 - This authorizes the federal government to control all health, education and welfare functions. Looks like past tense here. EXECUTIVE ORDER 11002 – This authorizes the Postmaster General to create a national registry for all people. Now that would be efficient. EXECUTIVE ORDER 11003 – This authorizes the federal government to completely control any and all airports, landing strips and airplanes private or commercial. We think the control over airports is historical, been to one lately? EXECUTIVE ORDER 11004 – This particularly potentially nasty order allows the Housing and Finance Authority to relocate entire communities, which could be whole cities, towns or villages. Where and how is of course a good question? They could also be able to build new housing with public funds (what funds), designate areas to be abandoned (scary – if an area or region becomes rebellious they could declare it abandoned and make it illegal for anyone to be there), and provide new housing locations for residents. Innocently this could be used in time of war if a city was bombed out. Sadly it has other uses. If they moved you it would not be into a white picket fence home with a yard. Think tents or military barracks. How long would one be there? Would there be work assignments? Would you get paid? Would there be good food and medical? Would you be able to leave the facility? EXECUTIVE ORDER 11005 – This allows the government to take control over railroads, which may include muni railroads and subways, inland waterways, which could be rivers and lakes, and public storage facilities, which could be storage lockers, safe deposit boxes, and warehouses. EXECUTIVE ORDER 11051 – This empowers the Office of Emergency Planning and gives authority to put all Executive Orders into play in times of tense international relations or when there is an economic crisis. Sounds like today? EXECUTIVE ORDER 1131 – This order authorizes the Department of Justice to enforce the various Executive Orders on a private and governmental level. It grants them control over all aliens and prisons of all sorts on any level. EXECUTIVE ORDER 11049 - This is a consolidative order facilitating the implementation of 21 executive orders issued over 15 years EXECUTIVE ORDER 11921 - This allows the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency to control any and all aspects of the USA economy including cash, salaries, savings, credit cards, credit, money supply, wages, financial institutions like banks, stock brokers, and even energy resources and production capabilities etc. If the President calls for a state of emergency Congress cannot even do anything at all for six months. This is a suspension of congress if you haven’t picked up on this yet. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is an extremely dangerous agency. The National Security Act of 1947 – This act makes it possible for the government to relocate according to their needs any and all private industries or governmental agencies according to their needs or perceived needs. The Defense Production Act of 1950 – This act gives the President sweeping powers over the entire economy. The Act of August 29, 1916- This act authorizes the Secretary of the Army, in war time, to take possession of any transportation system for purposes of providing transportation for military troops, materials, or any other purpose related to the emergency. International Emergency Economic Powers Act – This act enables the President of the USA to take any property of any foreign country or foreign national. These powers were eventually transferred to FEMA super agency effective in 1979. FEMA does operate under the President. Summary – Anyone ever study European History say from the late 1930’s to the mid 1940’s focusing on Warsaw Poland for instance. How about the Japanese internment camps in California during WW11. This much power in the hands of a very few people can be truly scary. The good news is if you do not approve of politics you are still free to vote with your feet and leave the country. This is a right that may or may not be available for ever. This could just be innocent orders designed to allow the government to stay in power, maintain order and provide for the people in the event of a war attack or a disaster. We can reference what happened in New Orleans with Hurricane Katrina and we all know how well that went. Will your friendly military and law enforcement officers not wanting to be in your shoes go along with these directives or not if there was no good reason for them to be enacted? What about Blackwater or their equivalent? Again go back to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Here you are the judge and jury and have to decide yourself how to interpret these orders and what implications if any they hold for you. -Aurelia Masterson, an associate of www.panamalaw.org"
19,Over One Million Guns Sold in USA in April 2009,politics," Executive Summary – The USA citizens are not secure and something has then concerned about the safety and security of their life and property. Guess what? For the month of April there were 1.2 million Fbi Criminal Background Checks performed at the request of licensed gun dealers regarding a firearms sale. If a person were buying 12 guns there would only be one check. This means the figure could represent more than 1.2 million guns sold for the month. There is also the possibility that the person was turned down and thus no gun was sold, just a check performed. In the previous year for the month of April 2008 940,000 checks were performed. This is a 30% increase. How about next year? Discussion – The people are scared. Ammo sales are also soaring creating shortages in ammo. We all know it’s their own government the people are fearful of. How long can a country last with a worthless currency, failed businesses, high unemployment, millions of homeless people, and to top it off a President who cannot prove he is qualified to hold the office as a person born in the USA? Not long and the people seem to be aware of this. Seems like they a re waiting for a trigger before it all breaks loose. Why Guns – A government cannot occupy a country if the general population is armed. The USA is acutely aware of this. During the German occupation of France the USA was dropping firearms into France and the Philippines for the use of the resistance fighters and anyone else who wished to use the guns against the occupying army. This is of course terrorism but since the USA did it, it is never called that. Here is a picture of the gun called the Liberator that was made by the USA. Tens of thousands of these were made and airdropped into enemy held territory by the US Army during WW11. The USA made over one million of these nifty little pistols at a cost of $2.10 each adjusted to the USD today it was probably $150.00 each. The pistols were single shot and came with I believe ten rounds of ammo. They shot the heavy hitting, slow moving .45 ACP with full jacket ball ammo. The gun was perfect for someone to walk up on a German or Japanese soldier and execute them with a round through the head. The rounds would penetrate the helmets used at the time. They were smooth bore, free of serial numbers (shocking) short barreled and good for no more than 20 feet in distance, but more realistically 3-5 feet would be the practical range. These guns scared the enemy big time. They had to view every person as a potential threat. The psychological value of these guns was important. It put the occupying troops on edge. They would not be safe wondering around the towns drunk doing their occupying army thing. The gun came with instructions called comic book instructions. Now lets jump forward to the Vietnam era. The CIA wanted something similar to be used in Vietnam. They developed a similar but a bit more sophisticated gun called the ""Deer Gun"". The US government knows that a country cannot easily be occupied if the population is armed. They also knew extremely simple ""Saturday Night Special"" type guns were enough to thwart the occupying army big time. Now mind you the people in the USA do not have junk pot metal liberator guns that look like Mattel Toy Company made them. They have sophisticated guns in many cases better than what the military has except for maybe the crack units like Navy Seals. The people in the USA also know how to use these guns. Why An Occupying Army Would Fear the USA Gun Owners – An armed society is a polite society and a free society. Total occupation and enslavement becomes difficult, not impossible just a lot more difficult. The challenges facing an occupying Army from civilian owned sophisticated guns are deep and complex. I will go into some of them. We will cover types of guns and applications. Pistols – These are not considered a significant military weapon. They are easily concealed which make them threatening. The military helmets and body armor of today defeat the bullets from handguns quite well. One would need to go into illegally hand loading very light, and fast bullets to penetrate body armor. Modern armies on the other hand do have available armor piercing ammo to defeat body armor with their handguns. Handguns have limited practical ranges. Most people cannot use them effectively over 21 feet. If you try to engage a target at longer distances the time required to acquire a good front sight picture and squeeze off a round increases. Some people can train themselves to shoot a handgun effectively out to 50 feet. I know you can shoot out further but if you get into variables like the target is moving, bad light, taking cover, the target is hooting back etc you realize quickly these are short range weapons. I do understand that there are hunting handguns that can be used to shoot out at long distances even 200 yards but these are also bulky heavy weapons hard to conceal. Handguns can be used to ambush or bushwhack soldiers as was done in France and the Philippines with these throw away guns. This makes every pedestrian within 20 feet of a soldier a serious threat. The soldiers have to stay alert and watch their back all the time. Hard to do with long hours and troops stretched thin. Drop your guard and thump you are dead. Now come vehicle stops. If the population is armed you have big problems with checkpoints. Two soldiers cannot work a checkpoint. Numerous personnel need to be deployed. Some need to be behind barriers so as to make an ambush seem futile. It is very easy to shoot a policeman or soldier in their unprotected face when they come to the driver window to ask for papers. Just ask any highway patrolman how nervous they get when they walk up on a car at night full of people when they cannot see their hands. So now checkpoints need to be sophisticated with numerous personnel, think 8-12. This drains resources of the occupier’s big time. They love checkpoints to enforce requirements that the populace register and carry papers always. To get the populace in compliance they need their checkpoints. Now these become burdensome. Also they like roving patrols say two soldiers or police to stop pedestrians and ask for papers. With an armed population this can be dangerous and they need 8 man patrols. When the populace in France would see a single solider they could easily walk behind him and shoot him when a truck goes by to cover noise. They drag the body away a bit and discard the pistol. Under other circumstances they can upgrade their junk gun for a good rifle and handgun by shooting the soldier. So now soldiers have to travel about armed and in pairs when off duty as a minimum, to avoid execution by the people they are occupying. This is a big psychological stress on the soldiers. It is one thing to know they are not wanted, it is another matter to know the people will take every opportunity to kill them and have the guns to do it with. For an army to be effective the soldiers must be in agreement with the officers who must be in agreement with the generals who must be in agreement with the political leaders. If any piece is missing, it does not work. Look at the USA in Vietnam as a model of a breakdown and a lack of agreement. The USA soldiers were constantly encountering armed citizens conducting terrorism against them. Morale was bad. Soldiers become poorly motivated; drug and alcohol use was high. Soldiers were killing their officers in the field, often called fragging although they shot them as well. The USA lost and abandoned the occupation. A determined armed population will make life miserable for an occupying army. Shotguns – These are deadly close quarter weapons. The most popular is the 12 gauge which fires 9-12 balls of lead generally about the size of a .32 caliber pistol bullet. Shotgun slugs are also available which is perhaps more useful for hunting large animals. The armor of soldiers does stop buckshot. Problem is the buckshot spreads in a pattern and hits places of the body not covered by armor like extremities. Shotguns are effective for most shooters out to 75 feet. Good hits from a shotgun are hard to survive. There are a lot of semi-automatic shotguns that will fire 8 rounds of shotgun ammo in perhaps 3 seconds or less. That is 100 balls of buckshot flying at your target. If you do the math this is very comparable to full automatic fire, even better. These are effective weapons for ambush and counter ambush. They were so used in Vietnam although there in pump mode which resists dirt more but makes firing multiple rounds slower. There are many thousands of semi-automatic shotguns in the USA in private hands with countless rounds of ammo. Shotguns are also effective in stopping groups of people from entering your premises. One would get behind cover and start throwing lead at the intruders trying to come through a door or window. It is hard to advance into such a barrage even with armor. Semi-auto and pump shotguns owned by civilians that an army is trying to occupy and control are not something any military wishes to encounter. I would say in the USA they are at least a few hundred thousand pump and semi-automatic shotguns. Then there are double barrel shotguns, bolt-action shotguns and single barrel shotguns. There are a lot of trained professionals who will think nothing about engaging an adversary with a full auto assault rifle if they have a pump or semi-auto shotgun. Some experienced urban police will fire the 12 gauge into the concrete a few feet in front of the adversary so that the buckshot with bounce off the cement into the feet and legs of the adversary causing them acute pain and impairing their ability to walk. This disables them enough for you to finish them off while they are screaming, limping or rolling on the ground or else you can capture them. Curiously the same can be done with a 9 MM full auto assault rifle. Shotguns can be fitted with special chokes to tighten their grouping out to 100 yards bringing the shotgun into a militarily significant range weapon. There are other chokes often referred to as duck bill chokes that will horizontally spread the buck shot out so as to enable one to shoot two or even three adversaries with one shot of 00 buckshot. This turns the shotgun into an even more deadly ambush and counter ambush weapon. One can also get specialty shotgun ammo. This can be illegal in places. They have two large pieces of buckshot with a 12-inch piece of piano wire welded to each ball. This can cause the piano wire to cut a person badly when the balls spread especially their internal organs. Body armor would not work reliably on this ammo. Other ammo causes the shotgun to turn into a flamethrower for about 2-3 seconds throwing fire out for about 40 feet. Imagine trying to breech a doorway and running into a wall of fire. There are slugs made of very soft lead that mushroom a lot to cause massive wound channels. There is ammo with spikes loaded into it. We could keep going the list is long for specialty shotgun ammo. Shotguns are a real headache for an occupying army. Regular Hunting Rifles – This is a serious threat to an occupying army. Hunting rifles are effective at ranges out to 500 yards especially with high power scopes. The person shooting them needs to have some skills of course but most hunters do. There are many millions of so equipped hunters in the USA. The hunters also have the bush craft skills enabling them to move about in the wilderness quietly. And undetected. They have camouflage clothes. The regular military rifles issued to a soldier are usually not very useful past 100 yards by most of the soldiers. Maybe some could use the weapon out 200 yards and a few to even 300 yards. The point is a hunting rifle like a common Remington bolt action 30-06 can work well out to 300 yards and for some even out to 500 yards with a good scope. The soldier can be outgunned by sniper activity. Snipers do not always have to hit live targets. They can hit refrigerators, radiators of cars, motor blocks, generators, air conditioners, water tanks, tires, radios, heaters, fuel supplies, transformers, telephone equipment, and so forth. Snipers can also target moving or parked vehicles. and the same for aircraft and marine vessels. This torments the soldiers when moving about. Hunting rifle bullets are hard to stop with armor. If the hunter uses serious bullets not hollow points, things like core lok Remington bullets designed to stay together after impact, then the armor becomes less effective. These bullets can rip through engine blocks. When you get into the heavier hunting caliber bullets armor becomes less and less effective. Body armor usually will not stop hunting bullets, especially the heavier calibers. Hollywood portrays snipers as those killing humans but a lot of what they do is to destroy equipment of the enemy. This number one keeps the enemy undercover for minutes to hours after the shot(s) are fired. The enemy is on edge for days afterward. The destroyed equipment can destroy the will and comfort of the enemy. Their will to fight then starts to diminish. I do know that many thousands of gun owners in the USA are familiar with sniper techniques. All you need to do is go any gun show and you too will know this. They have shooting schools in the USA for the last 25 years that have been teaching sniper methods to civilians. Hunting and sniping is not so different anyway. So a country with millions of so equipped hunters is a major big time headache to an occupying army. High Powered Rifles – There are numerous rifle calibers that are all considered high power in the USA. These guns deliver a heavy bullet at high velocities. These bullets will penetrate a lot of material and armor. These rifles are also effective out to 1000 yards with some training and practice. This is a major nightmare for an occupying army. The sniper can get them and the chances of them getting the sniper are close to zero. There are a massive amount of such rifles with high-powered scopes in the USA with countless rounds of ammo. .50 Caliber Rifles – In the last twenty years many people have started to buy .50 caliber rifles. This is not a hunting gun unless you hunt dinosaurs. The round is a 750-grain bullet. A 30-06 is usually a 150 to 180 grain bullet for comparison. This round usually travels in excess of 3000 feet per second. Stopping this round with a armor in its normal configuration usually requires explosive armor usually found on tanks or heavy armored military vehicles, which is only good for one shot. Forget body armor or light vehicle armor. Now the custom loaders in the USA have improved this round. One way to get there is to use a sabot. This is a plastic insert, which allows the .50 caliber case to expel a much lighter bullet, think 250 grains. This bullet would now move at over 5000 feet per second. This is also done with lesser rounds like the .308 and 30-06 for instance. Forget anything but explosive armor stopping these high-speed rounds. There is a lot of this ammo floating around in the USA. Another way is to use molybdenum metal in the bullet. This metal is extremely hard and rips through obstacles like sheet metal, armor plating etc. The bullet weight can be the same or one could use a sabot with the molybdenum bullet and I doubt anything short of explosive armor on tanks would work against it. They have been selling molybdenum .50 cal bullets for 15 years now. Have no idea how many there are in the USA. One with some training and practice can hit a melon at distances of up to a mile with a .50 caliber rifle and a good scope. The military has been using them for years. The sniping value is amazing. Three or four people with these rifles can terrorize a military base with 5000 troops. Think what 3 or 4 people with 50’s can do with another 12 people with regular hunting rifles. The troops would sit inside and crawl around when they had to move or else go about in armored vehicles. Then comes the destruction of heaters in winter, electrical generators, water supplies, refrigeration for food, gas supplies, vehicles, and aircraft on the ground, air conditioners in summer, and so forth. See an armed country cannot easily be occupied and if it is occupied the army will often give up and leave. The Russians in Afghanistan. The USA in Vietnam are examples of this. They leave a lot of death and destruction in their path but they eventually leave. Assault Rifles – The people of the US have a massive mount of assault rifles. Most are in semi-auto mode. They can engage a military on equal small arms footing. Not a pleasant thought for an enemy. The first priority of an occupier would be to round up the guns. Better yet get the guns before they go in. Night Optics – The people in the US have been buying night vision devices for about 25 years now. They have night vision rifles, scopes, and night vision glasses and binoculars. This is a real headache for an army trying to occupy it. They better equip all their occupying troops with these devices. Body Armor – Countless people in the USA have been buying body armor for 25 years. Most can only stop handgun ammo with their armor. A smaller amount of people has armor that will stop assault rifle rounds. Very few people have armor that will stop armor piercing ammo. Enemy soldiers would be confused and bewildered by a population that is not only heavily armed but also has body armor. Armor Piercing Ammo – In the USA it is legal to own armor piercing ammo in rifle calibers. There are millions and millions of rounds of such ammo being stored in the USA. Of course this is a major headache for an occupying army. Imagine when their troops realize the civilians can defeat their armor, even their heavy-duty armor. Summary – This should illustrate why the USA presently would be a nightmare to occupy for an Army. Why the US government wants take the guns away from the people has no good answer, does it? -Aurelia Masterson, www.panamalaw.org"
20,Sarah Palin has a Morton's Toe!,politics," According to the website eeemusings.com, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska has a Morton's Toe.  In a clearly seen photo posted on their site, on June 11, 2009 Sarah extra long 2nd toe can easily be seen.   In a week where many people questioned her  ""over the top""  reaction to David Letterman's  bad joke about her daughter,  the  verification of Palin having  a Morton's Toe  may answer some questions about why she did have this reaction. Dr. Burton S. Schuler,  leading expert on the Morton's Toe  and it complications  and author of the book Why You Really Hurt: It All Starts In The Foot, the story of the Morton's Toe, feels  that it is possible that  Gov. Palin  response may be caused by her Morton's Toe . Dr. Schuler said "" it has been well documented,  in numerous medical journals, and textbooks,  for over 80 years,    that a Morton's Toe  can cause many painful  conditions  of  not only the foot  but the whole body. The larger question is  can the pain and suffering  caused by a Morton's Toe  be so severe  that it causes a person to temporary loose perspective.   Dr. Schuler went on to say ""this is important,  maybe  we can find some grant money to study the true psychology effect the Morton's Toe  has on certain people"" In the 1920's and 1930""s Dr. Dudley J. Morton of Yale Medical School and Columbia Medical School wrote that a problem with the 1st metatarsal bone, known as a Morton's Toe could be the reason for most foot problems. Dr. Janet Travel, White House physician to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, and Professor Emeritus of Medicine at George Washington University took this concept further by writing and teaching that the Morton's Toe could cause pain all over your body. She wrote and taught for four decades that a ""Morton's Toe could cause, back, hip, knee, leg foot and ankles problems"

1,"The 4th of July - Co-opted?, Preempted?, Sold Out? A Set Up?, Probably.....",politics," by Chylon on Jun.13, 2009, The effect the Tea Parties on April 15th, last, was phenomenal.  There were many people (1000's) from all parties involved in agreement about what is happening in our Country today.  It was a peaceful demonstration of United States of American Citizens who were disgusted with what is happening in Politics, with our Political Leaders, and our Government.  Everyone involved knew that only Fox News reported the events with any semblance of accuracy.  Most reporting was a damned lie and those who were there, knew it! It is a good thing that the disgust and contempt for what is being perpetrated wasn't only for a day.  The momentum is continuing to build and grow as it needs and MUST do.  People are passionate about what's happening and want to continue to do something about our government forcing Socialism down our throats! That said, these 4th of July events have already been preempted by State and Local Governments, Big Business, and Socialist Media because they have control of the facilities, speakers, the audience and they have all the necessary resources and money to maintain control.  They are prepared to deal with all eventualities because they see them coming.  They are not going to get 'stung' like they did on the 15th of April.  They didn't have enough information then to deal with it in totality and foreclose on the Citizens involved.  They do now! Socialist Media coverage will choose to focus on people coming for a 4th of July Holiday party rather than pay attention to the Tea Party efforts.  At best, it will be a ten to one ratio against the Tea Party efforts; at worst, a total mockery!  The historical significance of July 4th and the Tea Party efforts will generally be ignored and treated as though those involved were a nuisance or the instigators of violence. What little coverage the Socialist Media will accord the Tea Parties will spare no effort to find and film those few who are the easiest to discredit - whether by appearance, lack of presentation skills, or misinformation.  This Socialist misinformation campaign will be the type of coverage for each and every Government-recognized/sponsored holiday into the foreseeable future. Don't be surprised if due to the funding of these events from Government, with Big Business sponsorship, combined with the all powerful eye of Socialist Media, there will be planted inciters to deliberately foment violence.  The media coverage of such will further discredit the protests/protesters and we'll have more laws enacted against the Citizenry to prevent the Citizenry from engaging in the future.  The average person ignorant of these Socialist endeavors will be deliberately manipulated into siding with the Socialist Government against the Citizenry because of the Lies that will be spewed about any activity.  Good Citizens are going to suffer all manner of suffering.  Rest assured, any and all such provoked episodes will be prime coverage AGAINST Good Citizens, Tea Party Members or not, labeled as Tea Partyists come the 2010 mid-term elections to further manipulate results! So, if any choose to go to this 4th of July Celebration or any event, be on your guard with an ever watchful eye.  If you go, learn from this to prevent future losses.  In addition to keeping an ever-vigilant eye on the Constitution and what it takes to restore it, learn the art of warfare and incorporate the techniques.  Read Sun Tsu's (sometimes spelled Tzu) The Art of War and other warfare strategies and incorporate them.  Pay attention to and learn from the Veterans, and in particular the ones who have been on the front lines, they are experienced.  They've been there; done that! While this might be devastating news/information to some people because so many resources have already been expended on the 4th of July endeavors, learn from The Art of War - be unpredictable!  This event was too predictable.  The Socialist enemy is fully capable of taking advantage of the predictability and they will again in the future each and every time! reposted with permission: http://chylon.theakurians.com/blog/ ""We should BOYCOTT ALL GOVERNMENT FUNDED 4th of July ""rhetoric"" Celebrations!!! Let the hypocrites set up the firework displays and have no one show up to wow them. The government is for the people and by the people & not the other way around!"" http://www.1tell2.com"
2,"Linux, Libertarianism and America",politics," Roughly ten years ago I obtained and installed my first copy of Red Hat Fedora Linux. It was during that same time-frame that I officially became a Libertarian. Since then I have read many opinion pieces comparing Linux to both Libertarianism and Communism. In a way, I think it is both. First let’s consider the origins of Linux. Back in the early 1980’s a long-time Unix programmer named Richard Stallman left MIT and began the GNU project and later the Free Software Foundation. He and his team began compiling (pun intended) the various software components of an operating system. The impetus behind their work was the belief that software source code should be freely available to all users so that they may make alterations to suit their specific needs. These changes would then be freely published so that others could benefit and possibly further refine the system. In the early 1990’s, a Finnish graduate student named Linus Torvalds decided that he wanted to program a Unix/Minix like operating system for his Intel based 386 IBM PC. By this time, the aforementioned GNU project had assembled many of the components necessary, however, they were still lacking a working kernel. Torvalds set about this programing task. He plopped his kernel in the midst of the GNU components, and voila. Linux was born. Since then, both Stallman and Torvalds have remained active in the development community as many, many others have joined as well. Today, we have many different distributions (i.e. flavors) of Linux from which to choose. Distributions that run on everything from personal computers and servers, to cellphones, routers and just about everything in between. On top of Linux has sprouted hundreds of software projects aimed at providing applications to users that follow these same principles. FOSS, or Free & Open Source Software is the acronym used to describe this model of development and distribution. So what revelations regarding Libertarianism and Communism can be gleaned from the examination of the Linux community? Before we can proceed with that analysis, there is one entrenched political teaching of which we must dispose. This is the notion that the political spectrum is a straight line with reactionary fascism on the right and radical communism on the left. Using this school of thought, there should be dramatic differences between the likes of Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler. However, I think most people would agree that the two were essentially totalitarian dictators that tended to have more in common than not. If the traditional left/right spectrum is a flawed, then what is a better representation? I think a circle is better suited to political analysis. The top of the circle being a state of highly decentralized government and the bottom being one of highly centralized government. The very top of the circle is the embodiment of what people like Thomas Jefferson envisioned for the United States. Like a circus elephant balancing itself on top of a giant ball, this approach takes great individual effort keep from losing ones balance and falling off, or in this case, sliding down to the bottom. The trip to the bottom of the circle is easy. There will always be people looking to grab your rights and property in exchange for the security or service they are offering. It doesn’t matter if these people are from the right or left or whether they’re Communist, Fascist or Socialist. The end result is always the same. Residence at the bottom of the circle under a highly centralized, oppressive totalitarian regime. Now as we consider the nature of Linux, I think it is fairly easy to see that it is a highly decentralized approach to a common goal. But how can it have communist tendencies at the same time? I found the answer in a statement made by Walter Block of the Ludwig von Mises Institute. Dr. Block recalled meeting a young lady who proudly announced to him that she was a Socialist. He responded to her statement with a simple question. ""Are you a coercive or voluntary socialist?"" In that answer lies the explanation of Linux’s communist roots. All of the various software projects being developed within the FOSS movement are being done so in voluntary communities. Think of the the old notion of northern California hippie communes as opposed to the traditional coercive Soviet style regime. Any developer of a given application (commune) is not only free to leave a project, they are also free to ""fork"" a project. This is where they use the same code being developed by the first project to form their own second project and take it in another direction. Every person has the freedom to move from commune to commune, or even start their own, since no one person or group owns the source code. This is what we should be pursuing as a political philosophy in the United States. Instead of putting all of our eggs into the single basket of the federal government and hoping that it has the smartest people in the world who are capable of running entire economies; we should be putting our hopes in the American people scattered all over the nation. Let state and local governments experiment with what’s best for them in their specific circumstances. I can guarantee you that what works best in Manhattan, NY will not work best in Manhattan, MT. Eric Raymond is an open source developer who wrote an essay in the late 1990’s entitled, ""The Cathedral and the Bazaar."" In that treatise he coined what he calls ""Linus’ Law."" It states: ""Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."" This is the true power behind Linux and FOSS. But in government today we have a mere 600 representatives cloistered in the ""closed"" cathedrals of Washington writing and interpreting verbose unintelligible laws that are fraught with unintended consequences and corruption. Our only hope is to open up the system and decentralize the solutions. Richard Stallman is famous for describing free software as being ""free as in freedom, not free as in beer."" In a time when our government is fiscally broke and rapidly becoming more centralized, we could all do with a little more free as freedom and a little less free as in handouts, bailouts and benefits.

3,Moves to Disqualify Obama as President,politics," Executive Summary – There have been issues regarding where Obama was born. When asked Obama says he was born in Hawaii but cites two different hospitals. He presents a certificate of live birth form which is not an actual birth certificate signed by a doctor from the hospital where the birth took place. This is some document that one was able to obtain in Hawaii as sort of an after the fact birth document. It does not necessarily mean that the person was born there. The one that Obama presented has no mention of any other former name, which is in great conflict with his other records. Hawaii became a state in 1959 and these certificates were available to document islanders and others who were in Hawaii without documents so they could get into the system and pay taxes, go to schools, healthcare, passports etc. Hawaii was in transition and things regarding records were sloppy for some years after their statehood. Obama’s grandmother says she attended his birth in Kenya. The Kenyan government claims they have the birthing records of Obama and the birthing delivery records of his mother. They did however seal these records due to the election. Perhaps when they released these records they were zealous and proud of a Kenyan Becoming president of the USA and also ignorant of the prohibitions against a naturalized citizen becoming president. One must be a natural born citizen, not naturalized. After they let the cat out of the bag they probably got under severe pressure to shut it down so they sealed the records. People have been filing lawsuits to get Obama to release his birth records. The courts generally throw the cases out of court. There are some cases on appeal to the Supreme Court and other cases still pending. It is most odd that as the President of the USA he will not release his birth records. Latest Smoking Gun – A group called Americans for Freedom of Information has released copies of Obama’s college transcripts from Occidental College. This was pursuant to a suit brought by the group in California. The transcript shows that Obama (Barry Sotero) got a fellowship for foreign students from the Fulbright Scholarship program. To get this a person must have a non-USA citizenship. This is the smoking gun according to many showing Obama is not qualified to the President of the USA by reason of birth. When this exploded Obama was in London meeting with Brown, and refused comment. Britain Daily Mail Newspaper (a big one) carried this story on their front page. Of course if Obama lied in writing on official college financial documents this too is a grave matter unbecoming for a President. It also appears that Obama is not a natural born citizen and thus not eligible to be President. This should not make Biden the President but should result in a new election. Biden was elected on a ticket with Obama who was ineligible to serve thus negating the election. People voted for an ineligible candidate thus there was election fraud. This gives Hillary another shot at the office as well as Ron Paul. Interesting. Maybe this will wake the people up enough to depart from the republicans and democrats altogether but I doubt it. It also could nullify any bill that Congress passed that Obama signed into law. Thus the entire economic stimulus package would be illegal. Most of it has not gone into effect anyway. Another consideration is that Obama will have to be brought to trial on criminal charges – election fraud, perjury amongst others. Criminal cases are public record. Obama may be mad if he gets kicked out of office even though he may have done these things. He could start giving all sorts of interesting testimony on the witness stand implicating many others in his election fraud including his financial backers. In the event Obama gets the boot the media will do their thing, block out any libertarian candidate and put another stooge for the banks into office. It would be fun to see Obama get booted but I am not expecting much change with or without him unless the states secede. The US Supreme Court – They have decided to hear arguments concerning Obama's eligibility. This is based on a lawsuit filed by a Leo Donofrio. They did not give a date. One would think if they really cared they would hear this in a few days so an ineligible President does not start a nuclear war or declare martial law. So it looks like they are trying to find an answer acceptable to them and the people who put this junior senator into office. The country may need to brace for street demonstrations from people who supported Obama. They also need to get ready to put an interim government in place while a new election is held to preserve order. So the act of delay can have several interpretations, some indicating Obama is as good as gone; others can say that they may keep trying to keep the cat in the bag. Of course the most make sense way to deal with it is to have Obama come clean with some sort of an admission, resign and then there is an orderly new election with no prosecution. Obama goes off into the sunset and is not in the public eye anymore. The US Attorney General – Gary Kreep of the United States Justice Foundation has released the results of their investigation on Obama campaign spending. They claim Obama has spent over $950,000 with eleven law firms in 12 states to block disclosure of any of his personal records. Kreep said he will release the finds to the US Attorney General, Eric Holder. Mr. Holder has refused to comment on the matter, which is the correct answer at this point in the situation. Discussion – I think the Obama mess is no longer to be kept swept under the rug. The 800-pound gorilla has become a 2400-pound gorilla and there might not be a rug big enough to contain it. Court cases will continue to pour in. More and more people will be afraid to partake in the cover-up. There will be too many court orders sealing this and that to make it look real. It appears that someone did a bad job packaging Obama and now it is unraveling. If they stonewall everyone it will look funnier yet. So they may just decide to put a new stooge in play, no big deal. I do think Obama was the absolutely perfect President to provoke states rights to the point where states seceded from the union. Shame he may not be with us long enough for this to happen. As I understand the election fraud situation, a new election should be required which means forget about Biden. Biden was voted in along with a fraudulent candidate, thus his whole party ticket was a fraud including Biden. Forget the Democratic Party going to jail too. Biden will also fall under suspicion due to association with Obama. They may try to have Obama resign for other reasons like health and then it goes to Biden. This way they do not have to nullify all the bills Obama signed including the financial stimulus package and since he is no longer president the embarrassing court cases would be dismissed as moot. They would not be moot since some bills he signed became law, but this is how I expect they would play it. I would not expect much from Biden if he gets it. He would be a more experienced player than Obama and may not run down the socialism trail as much as Obama but don’t expect any change. Biden is not going to audit and tax the Federal reserve Bank like Ron Paul would. So we wait and watch this show with zeal and enthusiasm while Obama walks around the White House thinking how much more time do I have left and where do I go. If he goes away in the manner prescribed by his handlers he will have sufficient funds to retire comfortably forever and never see a single day in prison. -Aurelia Masterson, www.panamalaw.org"
4,Texas and Alaska Proposes Bills to Opt Out of Federal Firearms Laws,politics," Executive Summary – There are now bills in the Texas and Alaska legislatures to exempt from Federal regulation firearms made and sold inside the respective states. The bills would not apply to firearms not made in the state or made in the state and sold outside of the state. These bills are very similar to the bill voted and signed into law in Montana. They are also similar to the bill proposed recently by Tennessee. Texas Bill – This bill exempts from federal regulation firearms, accessories and ammunition made in the state of Texas intended for sale within Texas. This bill requires the State of Texas to pay for the defense of the Texas citizens if prosecuted by the Fed for firearms violations that this bill allows for. This means the State of Texas would throw the book at the Fed with a barrage of lawyers and seek a ruling that was favorable. It is really impossible for Texas to lose unless the Federal judges throw the case illegally. The constitution has no provision for Federal gun control and to the contrary provides for gun ownership rights. These rights are specifically intended for military weapons, not hunting guns as one can glean from the use of the term ""militia"". Militia is not a word used to describe foxhunts. If Texas got their favorable ruling they would attempt to use this to recover legal fees from the Fed. The decision would also be used to cookie cutter more favorable judgments. When other states saw this they too would pass similar laws. It is more likely the Fed would pick a case and jurisdiction where they could rely on the judge to throw the case their way. This of course sets the stage for secession. Texas would have to blatantly accept an insulting and illegal ruling or just throw in the towel and secede. The constitution specifically grants certain rights to the fed and any other rights are reserved to the states. The fed can jump in and try to control firearm sales by screaming it is interstate commerce. This is a fact. Now when the guns are made and sold in Texas only there is no legal basis for the fed to step in and try to regulate them. A line has been drawn in the sand. Alaska Firearms Freedom Act – This great piece of legislation was passed by the Alaska house 32 to 7 and now moves on the their senate for passage. The outlook is encouraging. This bill basically charges the Federal government with using the Interstate Commerce Clause and US Code 18 USC 922 as an excuse for them to regulate firearms that are involved in interstate commerce. We all know the goal of gun control is to confiscate privately owned guns. This bill calls for the State of Alaska Attorney General to defend any firearms manufacturer located inside of Alaska that is charged by the Fed when they a re compliant with the soon to be new Alaska law. The Anti-Gun Fed Marches On - A member of the US house of Representative, Peter King of NY, has sponsored H.R. 219. The name of this bill is ""The Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2009"". This absurd bill wishes to deny transfers of a firearm to any known or suspected dangerous terrorist. This is basically a way for the fed to stop anyone they want from getting a new gun by treating them as suspected terrorists. This can be anyone opposed to Obama, a pro-gun rights person, etc. It does not call for confiscation of existing firearms. This would be like the much abused no fly list. If any bureaucrat wishes you to be on the list, that is that. They never tell you that you are on the list. Because of nonsense like this the states rights firearms laws are needed or they will eventually get the guns. Discussion – Well I always said Obama is the perfect President for secession. The states gun rights bills are a line in the sand. The Fed cannot safely move on to their next level of control unless they get the guns out of private hands. Obama causes a flurry of gun and ammo sales. Seems like people do not trust this junior inexperienced senator with birth certificate problems. Someone with a lot of money thrust this inexperienced guy at the public. He played well. He talked well. He has a personality. He slung a good line of promises, which he promptly broke. He magnified the money supply by a lot. He basically did nothing to even stop the freefall in the economy. In a word he is a joke and he is there because he played well at the polls. Obama may not be with us much longer. His college transcripts at Occidental College showed his application for a Fulbright Scholarship, which is only available to a foreigner. His Grandmother says she witnessed his birth in Kenya. The Kenya government said his birthplace was going to be a monument in Kenya. Then someone told them a naturalized person cannot be President of the USA and then the birth records became classified as secret. The Supreme Court has finally agreed to review one of the cases on appeal regarding Obama not being qualified to be President by nature of his birth. Obama is going to have a lot of trouble remaining in office and this is a shame. He is like the perfect storm, something that rarely ever occurs. Just what we needed to spur secession of the states from the union. He is insecure. He is buried with massive problems and running scared from the threat of riots. He is going to have a tendency to not deal with states rights. People in glass houses should not throw stones. He has a lot of problems even hanging onto his Presidency so the last thing he needs is for the states to bring his flaky citizenship issues into the legal fight over states rights thus magnifying the problems to the point where they make it to the headlines in the major papers. Another possibility is Obama will resign. He would not be prosecuted and then they would not have to void all of the bills he signed. Then there would be a transition government and probably a new election. This would be another wonderful time for more states rights bills and of course secession. If the states get the fed out of their guns then the concept could be expanded. States could coin lawful silver and gold money. States could prohibit Federal Reserve notes. States could attack the federal debt as fraudulent and deny it. Stop income taxes. All sorts of wonderful possibilities. The media says the states right gun laws are a legal challenge to the fed. This is a lie. What it is simply a way to defend themselves against a government saying they are empowered by the constitution and then not agreeing to abide by what rights the constitution grants them and to the individual states. Usurping power illegally is the term. The federal government does not want private citizens to have guns but they a re sure fond of them and spend fortunes on getting the latest and greatest weaponry. It is guns they respect and fear. -Aurelia Masterson, www.panamalaw.org"
5,California public policy,politics," Located in its western part, California is among the largest and most populous states in United States of America. Divided mainly in two parts, North and South, California is also among the most developed states in the country but at the same time it is a state which remains disturbed with various political issues almost throughout the country. many governments have ruled the state over the last 50 years but none has succeeded in solving the problems and that’s a major reason why the political environment of the state get heated up quite often even now. However, with the improved California state policy, people of the state are likely to get some relief from these complexities even if they don’t get rid of them completely. Like all other states in the country, California’s state policy focuses on various sectors like education, health, economic development and most importantly, unemployment. Being a part of the country, which is going through the worst ever economic condition, people of California are quite worried about the possibility of job losses. In the recent times, the state government has taken serious initiatives to create employment opportunities. As education is directly related to employment opportunities, the local government has stressed on the improvement of the educational infrastructure of the state. With the new President Mr Barrack Obama’s decision to emphasise on the improvement of the educational sector, people of California are likely to be benefited very soon. In the recent times, there has been significant improvement in the health sector of the state too, thanks to the well formulated California public policy. Price rise of land has always been a major issue in California, but the local government has mostly succeeded in tackling it to develop new health centers, that have not only improved the condition of the health care industry but has also helped lot of youths to get some jobs. some online communities that continuously monitor the political scenario California and offer a platform to people who are interested in the politics of the state, like to discuss the major political issues and want to take part in discussions and interactions with others. being a major part of California’s politics, the public policy of the state is also a subject that those online communities monitor very closely. If you are interested in Clifornia’s politics an issues that the state has been dealing with, then browse through online communities on politics today."
6,Property taxes a theft in Canada & the United States!,politics," What gives the government the right to tax people on their property? Think about it. What gives them the right to make bad decisions that one has to pay for?
When we make a mistake we have to pay for it from our own pockets.
Then why do these governmental persons not take the losses from out of their wages and pensions? They are the ones who made the mistakes. They are the one telling us what we should and shouldn't do.
EG,
Does a company usually take responsibility for the actions of an employee?
The employees seem to be the bossy ones. Why should people pay for something they don't want and don't need? That has been implemented by incompetent representatives of the public? Just because a few persons want something, If just one person does not want something.Then why should another have to pay for what someone else wants?
Since when does your neighbour eat at your table telling you what you should and shouldn't do? Why is it you can have a very distasteful person representing a government, pushing the public around without any recourse? Why is it a fact that assessments to property taxes go up when they see another persons property be sold at a higher price then what they or you are willing to or payed for it? No one told these public employees you wanted to sell your property to gain a profit.
No one told anyone that just because a neighbour has bought or sold a piece of property that you were in the ruining to make a profit off the sale of you house or property. Let alone theirs! You had nothing to do with someone Else's decisions. Better still, how is it you seem like your facing a firing squad when you want to dispute a tax assessment.
Here's the main point.
Your supposed to be in a court.
Out here they say you have to pay us first. [some don't have the funds to dispute] before you even get in front of the firing squad. Now they make you feel like your guilty even before you start.
You have a judge,
A secretary to take notes,
A couple of board members,
Then a few assistant judges, in most cases.
All facing you the plantif! These are all legally trained in their fields. Not us! You already got the odds against you by about 5 or 6 to one.
They demeanor you from the start. By out numbering you.
psychologically they got you pegged from the start.
They have gone threw this many times and know just how to off balance you so you don't have a chance. Take the selling of a house a goodly distance away from your place.
They use this and compare tit for tat.
You lost. But still what gives them the right to compare an apple from an orange. And who gave them the right to say and compare values just to raise property taxes? Who said you or anyone else had plans to sell or move. Why can't they just leave you alone? They are not living in your house. Your house should be your domain of residence without abnormalities. Just because someone else sold and made a profit. Why should what someone else has done include you? They are not at your eating table or in your house. Then comes the biggest stickler of all. This is a valid statement to the point: Ask how is it anyone can sell, tax or resell property any part of any ones property when it supposedly does not belong to them?
If that is true, then is it a fact they would be guilty of a crime?
We believe the answer would be yes. Therefore one should not have to pay taxes to any governmental office for no matter what they say. Now can we prove this?
YES we can. This will apply in Canada and including the United States. [thought you fellows would get away with this one hey?] Now we will start with Canada, Because this is much easier to explain, as most of you won't believe this. In Canada they call public land as Crown land. Which was representative of and from the queen.
Big problem with this. The queen does not own the so called crown land [nor does she own her crown!] Fact. If you don't believe me. Then we'll suggest you do a study on crown land and include the papacy! Oh Oh! Can of worms! This is what gets me up tight and really dislodged ones madness!
The papacy has stated awhile back that they had claimed everything from the north pole to the south pole.  And it is a fact this can be found in documentations. Why do you think the queen sucks up to the POPE? Just to explain a little more. Have you noticed how the queen and others are not allowed to wear white cloths when they approach the vicar of Christ, the pope? Even she bows to this?? Well lets just not say. Even in the word of God he said NOT to bow to any man or object on this earth. Take this reference up with DR Walter Veith [and the documentation of the papacy,] He's got an excellent video about the secret society, Where we believe he explains this in more detail then we have time. Now if you don't believe me. Sorry can't help you, It's also true for the United States and for you real God loving people, and  we hope we made you realise the truth. Why pay property taxes to a group of people who really don't own  the land your on? Or represent the truth. You better wake up before it's to late! Now what really stumps us, The question rises, How can any government or group of people say you owe them money for taxes when they by rights did not pay one cent for that property you own, and paid for. They didn't work for it. They don't do the maintenance,
Yes they may have provided a few external services now and then. Then comes another stickler. How can these government officials and employees give themselves raises without your permission? If they are supposed to represent you. Why are they allowed to say and take as much for pensions without public input? Was it to be taxes were only supposed to be temporary?
By rights they should have to ask if we comply and Not be forced to pay taxes, by bulling tactics. You will see this truth will all come out sooner or later.  When the beast rears his ugly head!"
7,Should You Talk to Law Enforcement Officials?,politics," Introduction – This is written as a result of dealing with people around the world who get questioned by the police officials regarding various events. Whether or not these people are guilty is not the point of this writing. The point is to show how foolish it is to talk to the law enforcement officials in most countries where there is still something left of a constitution or justice system. Why Do the Police Want to Talk to You? – To convict you and/or someone else. They do not come to talk in order to exonerate people. The prosecutors in the USA have no legal need to make any efforts to collect evidence that would exonerate you of any guilt. This they call exculpatory evidence. They do have a legal requirement to make the defense aware of any evidence that they did get possession of that would exonerate the accused, but they do not have to go out and see if they can collect evidence to show that the accused is innocent. They are there to convict the accused and that is the long and short of it. Do not be confused with the morality of not convicting the innocent so the law continues to look for the guilty. I never heard of any law enforcement official promoted for proving the innocent to be innocent. They do get promoted for convictions. A conviction is a conviction, is a conviction, period. Martha Stewart – She went to jail for lying to a Federal Officer. She was not convicted of what the police went to discuss with her. If you erroneously make an incorrect statement to a Federal Officer then you are guilty of the felony of lying to Federal Law Enforcement Officer. It is incumbent on you to prove in court if charged, that this error was made as an innocent mistake. This would be after tens of thousands of legal bills and months if not years of being in the criminal justice system. Now if you refuse to talk to the law enforcement officers then you have removed yourself from any chance of being arrested for lying to a Federal Officer. Right here you have sufficient grounds to never talk to them. Martha Stewart tried to talk her way out of it. The police are not there to see if you are guilty or innocent. They are there to ""clear cases"" or get convictions. All they care about is what they can convict you of. You need to understand this. If there is no questioning (you refuse to talk to them) then there is no going somewhere else with their investigation as a result of you really things not beneficial to you that they would have otherwise been unaware of. If Martha Stewart just said ""No"" to their questioning she would not have gone to jail. Police Tactics – If the police had a case against you with evidence, they really have to arrest you. To not do so is unusual, irregular and can cause problems for the police later on. Lets say you repeat the crime while they delayed arresting you and it gets out that they were stalling. They would be in trouble and possibly sued by the subsequent victims. To not arrest you can be construed as corruption, obstruction of justice, dereliction of duty amongst other things. The point of this is if the police had evidence of you being guilty of a crime they would not come and chat about it with you. They would arrest you, read you your rights, take you into custody and then they would start working on you from a position of strength in that you are in custody. Even if you do get arrested never ever talk to them. Just keep asking for your lawyer. Admit to nothing, deny nothing, have no conversations about anything. Just shut up and wait for your lawyer. No police person is your friend and they are not trying to help you in any way. Many times the police think they have a case, make an arrest and the prosecutor kicks it out later. They may have enough probable cause for an arrest but yet at the same time lack the evidence to prove you guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. So they try to arrest you and then scare you into talking knowing their charges are garbage. Ok so if the police are coming to chat with you, discuss documents, motives, allegations, money matters, etc it is ONLY to gain more evidence against you. They are not trying to exonerate you. They very well may be trying to find out if you had any conspirators and then charge several people collectively with the crime plus conspiracy. They love multiple defendants so they can get them to pleas bargain against each other for lesser sentences. This is their main modus operandi. Law enforcement agencies are conviction driven agencies. No one counts how many times they cleared an innocent person and this is not what promotions are based on. When they developed DNA tests many people got out of jail because it was proven by DNA testing they did not do the crime. Many of these people were sitting in jail for decades. Police will railroad people lots of times simply because they can. When the police come to talk to you they are trying to get more evidence or more probable cause for subpoenas, search warrants, depositions of yourself and/or others etc. This will assist them in building a case. If they seem to not understand say a financial transaction they have a record of, do not explain it even if you think you are innocent of what they suspect and can explain it. You may unknowingly be guilty of something else you do not even know is a crime. Do not talk to them. Do say let me call my lawyer. Say I do not wish to talk to you at all. Do not be intimidated by their threats of arrest etc. If they could arrest you they would have already done so. Understanding the financial transaction is their problem, not yours. They have nothing or they would have arrested you. Do not assist them. When the police arrest you they know you are going to be represented by counsel and their games are over at that point. If they have evidence they do not care and will arrest you. Your explanation will not be of interest if they have hard evidence. Tell it to the judge is what they will say. What If I Can Convince the Police I am Innocent? – Let’s say you do convince the police of this, it could happen, anything is possible. The police cannot come into court and testify that you said so and so and they believe you are innocent. This would be excluded as hear say evidence by the prosecution. Even if you got the police won over the prosecutor would not allow this into court. Forget trying to get the police to be your ally. Financial Crimes – These are the rage now due to failing real estate markets and stock markets. The charge is usually fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering. They seem to be based on loan applications in general. The person walks away from the real estate and the bank takes a hit. Then the bank reviews the credit application and sees things it does not like. Can be what they perceive to be overstated income, understated operating expenses, overstated assets, and overstated appraisals whatever. They try to create a criminal case and file complaints under city, county, state or federal laws. Next you find out your business associates, friends, neighbors and relatives are being contacted by law enforcement officers discussing you and your business dealings. You see bank and financial records get subpoenaed. Eventually they come and talk to you. Never talk to them. They are talking to you because they do not have enough to arrest you and are fishing for more. Ignore them 100%. Do not give them any documents at all. They will charge you if they get enough evidence. Do assist them by talking to them or giving them anything. If they are talking to your friends, relatives and business associates then rest assured there is a good chance you will be indicted. If you think you may have overstated something or understate something regarding loan applications then get ready for a criminal case based on current trends (April 2009). Go start interviewing criminal lawyers right away. Do not wait to see what happens, go right now and start getting expert advice. What Will Happen If You Get Indicted – You will be formally arrested. The authorities will probably not be polite and not ask you to come in for booking, you might flee. They will view you the same as an armed robber or thief. You will be booked. Possibly you will be released on your own recognizance. You may need to post bond. If it is Federal crime expect your passport to be taken. Your real estate will have the title clouded by liens. Your banks accounts will be have liens as well. You will have to report to something like a probation officer until the trial is over. You will have to ask for permission to access your money and they will control how much you can get to spend. They are not going to let you spend your money on lawyers; they want your money to cover their prosecution expenses. You will not be allowed to leave the USA. You will see that you are guilty until proven innocent. The Federal system is designed to get you to plead guilty and take a plea with some jail time. State, City and County prosecutions tend to be easier to deal with. Local law enforcement agencies and local prosecutors do not have the budgets that the Federal Government has. They need to watch their expenses. All prosecutors like to pursue cases where there is a reasonable chance of recovering money to cover their costs of the prosecution. How Federal White Collar Criminal Cases Are Made – This is a trend we have seen in recent years. The investigation times tend to be in the two-year range from the time the person first learns of the investigation until criminal charges are filed. Usually it starts with subpoenas being filed for financial institution records and computers. Then people will be calling telling how they were interviewed about you. If there is hard evidence against you, you may be charged as the only defendant. We see a whole lot of cases where there are a number of people charged at the same time. Can be up to dozens. After a few months what you will see is defendants pleading guilty in a plea bargain. After they plead they go to a debriefing hearing with the prosecutors and criminal investigators. They tell all they know about the case and the other defendants. If they lie or fail to be open and tell all they know, the plea bargain gets rescinded. The ones to plead first get the shortest sentences. Generally they keep the jail time to at least 2 years. Then later on you see a few more people plead getting slightly longer sentences. Then the ones left have to deal with several people offering testimony about their guilt. Yes the witnesses are also co-defendants and plead guilty for a lesser sentence but this is a nightmare to deal with in court for your lawyer. The idea is to lay out enough charges for the person to die in jail if they get convicted of all charges. This makes fighting the charges sort of frightening. The alternative is to take 4 or so years in jail for a guilty plea. You can still have a life again; only it will be as a convicted felon. After a few months you find out your criminal attorney who was so positive in the beginning will be encouraging you to plea. He bilked you good for fees and he does not want to bother with the hard work of trial preparation and a trial. If you appeal a conviction the appellate lawyer may see that he did shabby work and this exposes the criminal lawyer for a civil action from you for the fees you gave him. This will adversely affect his malpractice insurance. So he tries to get a reasonable amount of money from you and not expose himself by encouraging you to plea. Your situation takes a second place to his. Your lawyer doesn’t care about you as much as he or she should, and the prosecutor doesn’t care about you, your family, your situation or the morality of what they are doing to do at all. What fun. Can You Leave the USA After You Are Indicted in Federal Court – No! Your passport will be taken away. How can you leave? You now need a passport to exit the USA. Sure you could try and sneak out and then this would be another charge they would charge you with if they caught you. Bad idea. How good are you at traveling internationally without documents when there are warrants out for you, Interpol alerts etc. ill advised. You could sneak out in a go fast boat and risk getting shot at when you refused to stop. People ask us about this all too often. They say can you send me a passport by mail? We say of course not. Only fake passports are sold this way. They would not work on exit since you have no entry visa in the passport and in the computer system. You would be questioned, fingerprinted, and then charged with unlawful flight, violating terms of release and whatever else they threw at you. If you get indicted start thinking about a plea right away so you can be first with a shorter sentence if this is your intention or think about beating them in court. These are your two choices. The Federal Courts have an 87% conviction rate counting the plea bargains of course. There are people who win criminal cases in Federal courts. Today winning or getting convicted has little to do with whether or not you are guilty. The law you are charged with breaking could be unconstitutional. The way evidence was obtained could be unconstitutional. The confessions of others could have been obtained in violation of law and ethics. What About Vehicle Stops? – Ok here there needs to be some talking to the Police. They need to see if you are coherent or drunk. Keep the discussions to a minimum. Do not give permission to the police to search your vehicle or you for any reason. If they threaten to bring drug dogs, get a telephonic search warrant etc; tell them you do not want them to search the vehicle. Do not get into discussions as to destination, residence, work, etc. If the police run on ask them if the stop is over and if you can leave. When you get stopped roll down the window slightly so talking can he heard and you can hand them the license and registration. No matter what no permission to search for any reason. If the police ask you if there is anything in the car he should know about answer NO. Do not say more than this just let him talk. Getting him to talk means you have control over the police person. Why should they need to know about anything in your personal property? The police may give you a ticket. Fine. If you hire a traffic ticket lawyer you will have say a 75% chance of beating the ticket in court and this costs a few hundred dollars at most. So there is not much of a downside to being uncooperative to the police. If the police tell you to get out of the car, try to do so and lock the car right behind you. They may force you to open it or force you to give them the keys, but would be unlikely. Police now will taser you for any infraction of not doing what they say to do. They may tolerate some brief questions from you but will soon threaten the taser. You can say I am not giving you permission to open my car. Make sure you speak for the dashboard camera and microphone many police cars now have. See I said it for the camera is a nice thing to say to the officer. In a police state you have to tolerate the police bullying you in the name of the war on drugs, terror or crime. So keep your mouth shut, comply with requests like sit here, stand here, and be quiet. Sign the ticket since they will arrest you if you do not. And it will soon be over. Keep asking him if the traffic stop is over every time he stops doing anything or talking to you. A traffic stop legally is like an arrest. You are lawfully detained and cannot leave until the traffic stop is over. Make a point of very obviously looking at his badge, nameplate and car number. Burn this into your memory. Address him by name or badge number. Basically the goal is to get out of there as fast as possible with or without a ticket. Tickets are generally easy to beat in a trial. Generally 50% of the time the officer will not show up. So right there if he does not show up in court you win and there is a 50% chance of this. When he does appear your lawyer if any good will win 50% of the time. So you have a 75% chance of winning. You have an excellent chance of beating the ticket. If it is a driving under influence there are expert witnesses that can help a good traffic lawyer beat these offenses with very good odds as well. These expert witnesses are often pharmacologists with Doctorate Degrees and can really destroy the alcohol tests the police administered in a court. They are not cheap but they are effective. So do not get into hoping for leniency by allowing searches or by participating in extensive lines of questioning. Getting out of any sort of traffic violation is far less complicated and less threatening than getting out of a serious criminal case. What About At The Airport – If you live in or travel to a police state there are no rights. Answer questions about what you have, where you have been, purpose of trip etc. Keep the answers brief and direct. Stand there and stare blankly awaiting the next question. The idea is to wait until the official gets bored and gives up. Do not lie. Do not possess anything that is illegal. What can they do to you? Make you open luggage. Big deal. Again when you have a police state this is what you get. How Simple Airport and Border Interrogations Work – Do not think that by understanding some simple interrogation techniques you are an expert. You are not practiced, never rehearsed; never saw yourself on video etc. This is just a little insight into their tactics. In these types of settings the government officials are trying to move a large amount of travelers through as rapidly as possible. They have little time to spend on random interrogations. When you go to a booth and present your passport they will do a swipe of the passport. They will then look at a computer monitor. They are probably looking to see if you are on a manifest of some arriving flights if an airport. They may be looking at your picture. They may be looking at very little information at all, depends on the computer system and the country. They will usually ask you something to get you talking. They want to see if you are nervous and hear your accent. These people are generally not well trained. If they get a signal of something being out of the ordinary they turn it over to a more experienced person. These people are at least 75% clerks even if they have badges and guns. Their guns may be unloaded or they might not be allowed to carry the gun with a round in the chamber. They may have to leave their guns at the workplace in the evening along with their badges. They are low-level law enforcement officers, mostly performing clerical duties. They do not want you to know this. The more serious law enforcement types at an airport may decide to talk to you. Never ever approach any law enforcement person at any airport to ask them anything. Try to refrain from this. Asking them anything triggers the pushing of a 'lets do more scrutiny on these people' button. Remember this. Best advice is to ask no one any questions. You are on camera and people are watching you and if they see anything they will have you questioned. So be a dumb traveler shuffling his feet in the line acting bored, a little irritated only and resigned to waiting to get through the line. The interrogation technique often employed in airports, ports or land border crossings is simple. Not every country is exactly like this but you will be surprised at how similar it is when you know what to look for. You are asked a few simple questions that can easily be verified like by looking at your ticket and passport so you would be unlikely to lie or be deceptive about such answers especially since they are not incriminating questions to answer. Things like where did you come from, what airline, what flight, how long were you gone, who are you traveling with, etc. This is to get a reading on you. They are watching your face for signs like squinting, raising eyebrows, snarling, listening to your voice for fluctuations, studying your speed of speech, time to answer, where you look when answering and your body language like rubbing hands, shuffling feet etc. After the investigator gets a feel for how you will answer a question truthfully he sends in a heavy question like – how much money do you have on you, do you have any drugs or illegal medicines on you, etc. Then he watches to see if when you answer everything is the same or if he hit a nerve and you answer the heavy question differently than the easy simple questions. Of course an intelligence agent or professional criminal would practice these techniques on video from several angles to get polished at it. An intelligence agent would also have experience in questioning people, which helps a lot. This is not anything to do with serious interrogation techniques that take a long time to learn and deploy. There is no getting the confidence, fear, trust etc. of the subject since time is so short. You can easily research this on the Internet and there are books that deal with this subject. It is always going to be learning common sense techniques, never a silver bullet. Telephone Calls from Police – Hang up immediately. How do you know who they are? There is no reason to provide any information at all to a phone caller. If the police are going to arrest you or question you regarding something serious they will not call before coming. They need the element of surprise on their side. Suspicious Police and Impersonators – There are all sorts of counterfeit police credentials floating around. No law enforcement agency is exempt. Do you know what different law enforcement agency credentials look like? Try finding examples on the Internet. You can’t. How do you know they are real? Do you know if badges from a certain department all have numbers on them even for the high-ranking officials or not? How many law enforcement agencies does your country have, do you know all their names and what their badges and ID cards look like? Tell the person who says he is an official you want to call the law enforcement agency from the phone number listed in the phone book to see if they really are who they say they are. A lot of experienced law enforcement agents will tell you what page in the phone book to go to in order to find their agency phone number. If possible do this from behind a closed door. If they come to your house and show you credentials look at them through the peephole and get their name and phone the agency to see if they have someone with that name in the department and if he is supposed to be at your house now. The law enforcement officers always will radio in that they are going to your address before getting out of the car for their own protection. If the dispatcher does not hear from them after a while they will know the last place they went on foot and start looking for them at that location. People can go to jail for a long time for impersonating a police officer so if you phone in an impersonator they are going to freak out. Best if you are behind a closed door. They will not have a lot of time to get away and will probably not want to start bashing doors down, favoring escape instead. You can also call the police if you suspect a person is impersonating a police officer. Tell the police he has a badge that looks like he bought it in a toy store and is making you very scared. They will come fast. Police hate police impersonators perhaps more than child molesters. You can try calling a law enforcement agency different than the one they are presenting badge or credentials for. Never believe anyone who just shows a badge. They all should have impressive looking ID cards with photos. You can tell the suspicious officer you called the police or not. If you think the police are real like you verified them by calling their department then say you do not want to talk to them. Never open doors. If they had a warrant for search or arrest they would probably be pointing guns at you and pounding down the door. The street scene would be full of marked vehicles with lights and radios. Forget all this babbling about we can get a warrant open the door. Ignore it. People impersonating police officers in various countries have been known to use these false credentials to commit rapes, robberies, kidnappings and murders. Take people impersonating police very seriously and get help from law enforcement immediately. Never let them tell you that you will be in trouble for verifying that they are authentic officers of the law. No real law enforcement officer would ever prevent you from verifying their identity. If they surround your house and say they are conducting a raid come out now with your hands up look outside to see what is going on. If you see a lot of marked police cars with the lights on and radios cackling it is probably a legitimate raid. If you see only unmarked cars I would say that you should not cooperate until you call the police to verify their authenticity. If they pushed it I would just shine them on and use a cell phone to call the local police and report it as a home invasion by a gang with guns threatening you if you do not open the door. If you get a phone call saying it is a real police raid, disregard it. This can be the bad guys. Do not open the door until you get verification. They will be trying to roust you to open before you make the call. Best to just make the call without telling them you are doing so. Buy time by like talking in a language foreign to the region. Say in the local lingo you do not speak the language. This will confuse them briefly. In some regions of the world this is the way kidnappers and robbers work. It is also the way dishonest police work. Be careful. Retreat to a safe area and get the police there and fast. After you have called the police if they are acting like they are going to break in tell them you are armed and will shoot and the real police are on the way. Real police will consider waiting for their friends to show up. The best choice for impersonators under these circumstances is to retreat at this point. The chances of a good crime scene for them are really over and they know this and will opt to be free to rob again another day. Police impersonators are a serious threat. Sometimes it can be a retired law enforcement officer working as a private detective trying to get information only. They may be using their retired credentials or false credentials relying on their ability to control an interview professionally. This sort is not very dangerous but treat the threat as dangerous anyway. Lie Detectors – In a word these do not work. Voice stress analyzers also do not work. They have never been proved to work. They are only an interrogation tool designed to intimidate people into confessing during an interrogation. The course of training for a lie detector operator is about 12 weeks. You could learn how to operate the machine in hours. It is a course in interrogation. Never take a lie detector test for any reason, period. Results can be rigged. Governments use them because the deception gets confessions and admissions. It is also a fear tactic to keep the employees in line. These stupid tactics ruin people’s lives. There is a web site that explains the stupidity of these various lie detectors, studies that have debunked them repeatedly with consistency as well as the various easy to learn methods of defeating them. http://antipolygraph.org/ Governments have taken to using drugs for interrogations with and without lie detectors many years ago. Never agree to be drug interrogated. These drugs get people to lapse into comas and worse. If you cannot drive under drugs how the heck can you answer questions accurately? Again more intimidation and scare tactics."
8,USA Gun Control,politics," Introduction – What we are going to do is politically discuss the issues related to gun control. Does Gun Control Reduce Crime? – Emphatically no. Never once did it ever do that. Below are several studies that can be researched on the Internet yourself that document the fact that gun control never reduces crime. New Jersey – In 1996 New Jersey passed what was considered to be the most stringent gun laws in the USA. Two years later their murder rate went up 46% and their robbery rate about doubled. Hawaii – In 1968 Hawaii passed harsh gun laws. At the time of the legislation their murder rate was 2.4 per 100,000 per year. Nine years later their murder rate had tripled to 7.2 per 100,000. Washington, D.C. – In 1976 they passed a major gun control law. They even stopped people from owning guns in their homes. Their murder rate went up 134% while the USA rate for murder dropped 2%. New York City – They have some of the most restrictive gun control laws in the world. All sales of any sort of gun are restricted and tightly controlled. 20% of all armed robberies in the USA are committed in New York City and they do not have anywhere close to 20% of the population. This is what happens when the criminals know a certain population is unlikely to be unable to defend themselves. Chicago, New York City, Detroit and Washington, D.C.- Each of these cities has accomplished a virtual ban on the private ownership of guns. The Washington D.C laws are being fought out in the appellate courts at present. These four cities have 20% of the homicides in the USA yet they only make up 6% of the USA population. This means that restrictive gun control leads to a tripling of the homicide rate. Some one is going to say wait the population in these areas is why the murder rate is so high. Fine we can look at Arlington, Virginia which is a city right across the Potomac River from Washington D.C with sensible gun control laws so the population base should not be that different. Their murder rate is 10% of Washington D.C. (7.0 murders per 100,000 people versus 77.8 murders per 100,000 people in Washington D.C). We can also look to Virginia Beach, Va. a nearby city of 400,000. They have sensible gun laws allowing for easy access to firearms and their murder rate is 4.1 per 100,000. Other Effects Non-Restrictive Gun Laws have on Crime – In the USA in a given year law abiding citizens kills 2,000 to 3,000 criminals. They also wound another 9,000 to 17,000 criminals a year. This is a reduction in the load of violent crimes the government must arrest, detain, prosecute and imprison. It also sends a strong signal to the other would be criminals. Criminals worry far more about an encounter with an armed law abiding citizen than a policeman. Police are most likely going to be polite about asking the criminal to drop their weapon and submit. The citizen in fear of protecting himself and his family is going to be much more prone to firing his weapon than a police officer. Criminals’ greatest fear is running into an armed victim when committing a crime. This was based on a study of 1874 felons from 10 states. In this study 38% of these felons said at least one time they had been scared off, shot at or wounded by an armed victim. Only 1% of the time do criminals take a gun away from a victim, yet 10% of the police officers that are shot, are shot with their own guns. Police officers are slow to shoot and the criminals know this and thus are more fearful of an armed citizen. Private citizens kill three times as many criminals as police do. Remember if someone is assaulting you or robbing you or your house the police will likely only be taking a report not encountering the criminals. It is the citizen who needs all the help and assistance of weapons to survive the criminal encounter. Why Do Governments Seek Gun Control? – Fear! They are afraid of losing control over the population. The prefect state of affairs for a police state is the confiscation of all privately owned firearms. Then the possibility of an overthrow of the government goes down by about 99.9%. They never want partial gun controls like only machine guns or ""assault type weapons"" to be banned. They want all the privately owned guns gone. The partial gun control is the Salami theory. You keep cutting a slice away until there is nothing left. The only reason for gun control is to make room for a totalitarian government, nothing else. Sometime there are people ignorantly confused who support gun control thinking it will do something to make the world a safer place to live. Play with these people and say when the government disarms then you will. Tell them to chase the government and tell them to have the government give up their guns for police leaving only the military armed. Use the British Bobbies who used to be unarmed as an example. Tell them the Cayman Island and Nassau police are unarmed. Have them call for the disarming of the police. Play with them. Have fun. Every time the police shoot someone accidentally tell them to call for the disarming of the police. How Would Gun Control Happen – Well Obama showed it to you recently. They were starting to introduce gun control bills again. We do not know how aggressively they will push them this time. Nothing in these bills will do any practical good in terms of reducing crime, not a single thing. They also increase the penalties each time. So if it would happen what would it look like. OK there would be a bill that say banned all assault weapons. The bill would say the attorney General can add any gun to the list he wanted. Over time he would keep adding guns to test the public response. The banned guns would be prohibited from being sold at first. They would leave .22 caliber single shot rifles and single shot shotguns until the end to satisfy the call for hunting guns. Then the banned guns would become illegal to own even if they were grandfathered in, registered whatever. This would be something like turn them in or face 20 years in prison for each gun plus a $100,000 fine for each gun. I am serious on the penalties. No one would be coming to anyone’s house to collect the guns for a long time. They would wait for someone to get shot with a .22 caliber gun and then say these too need to be banned. They always love to call for new restrictive laws after a shooting crime. Do that back to them. Every time you see the police abuse a person with a taser call for them to be banned and not used by the police. They will soon stop when their own tactics gets turned on them. Now the people have their guns and they can run around quoting Charleston Heston and his out of my cold dead hands slogan. The next stage is anytime the local police get into a house like to respond to a burglary, a domestic abuse call, a noisy party anything and they see the guns then someone gets to go to jail for a long time. The word soon gets out. If you think the people that own guns are going to like get together, carry guns and march on Washington D.C. armed to the teeth to demand gun laws be repealed you need to get some counseling. You will never see this. If anything like this were ever going to happen it would have happened in 1968 with the first serious federal gun control law. This came on the heels of the Kennedy assassination. What did that have to do with gun control laws anyway? I am going to say some things about how it used to be. If any of you find this too wild to be true verify it. Find old issues of Guns and Ammo magazines and read the ads. You were able to buy guns mail order across state lines before 1968. There were a few states that prohibited this but that was it. You were able to buy machine guns fairly easily. You were able to freely buy what they call destructive devices. Boys ant-tank rifles (Boys was a manufacturers name) were being sold for $99.00 with bipods and all. The ads used to say for the jackrabbit that got away. This rifle fires a .51 caliber round that is effective on lightly armored tanks. Bazookas were a mail order item as were mortars. Armor piercing ammo was freely available until the late 1970’s or early 1980’s. They had lovely armor piercing fully jacketed .45 auto rounds that would pierce engine blocks, let alone bullet resistant vests. Guns were not registered except for a few states and cities that did this. Those yellow forms came along with the 1968 gun control law. This was when guns were fairly well available and by mail order. An armed society is a polite society. Criminals are not polite. Response To New Restrictive Gun Control Laws - We will now address how the people will be likely to respond. This is hypothetical and based on speculation only. No one can predict what the people will do with any accuracy including the government. There are many mitigating circumstances that will come to bear on the hearts and minds of those affected. In this hypothetical scenario the people in our opinion are going to not physically resist new guns laws instead just sort of go with the flow and verbally oppose them only, for the most part. They will bury their guns and ammo in the woods. They will hide them inside the walls, under the floorboards etc. They will say things like well when the time comes etc. Eventually the local police will start arresting people when they discover the guns in vehicles, in houses, informants (the maid, the plumber, the cable TV guy, the alarm company guy) tell them about them and so forth. These people will be arrested and get probably 10 years for each gun plus massive fines like $100,000 for each gun. There will be calls for amnesty asking people to just turn the guns in and walk away free. Many will do this out of fear. There will be no revolutionary forces to join and resist. After a year or two there will be raids on houses. They will use devices to see images behind the sheetrock. They will use metal detectors in the yards and land. When they find a gun after the owner does not turn it over when they show up they will throw the book at the person. They will take his family as accomplices. All will be in jail for many years. The fines will cause them to lose their homes, cars and assets. They will be destroyed completely. Only thing worse would be to kill them. Those with guns hidden in the woods will be questioned as to where their guns are. They will probably be charged with some crime for not reporting a stolen gun within 72 hours, which is found in HR 45 the latest gun control bill (not law yet). So when they say the guns were lost or stolen they get charged with the crime of not reporting this and get serious jail time for each gun. Gun registration is the prelude to the confiscation, nothing else. The reporting the lost and stolen guns in 72 hours is the fix against you saying you lost the guns when they come to take them away. Those with unregistered guns will be able to hide them in the woods. There are many ways to do this securely and preserve the firearm. If the weapon is wiped free of prints and any blood like from getting pinched by the slide (think DNA) then this person should be safe if the weapons are found and not traceable to him in any way. What good is it doing them to have the guns buried in the woods? It is just a psychological game they are playing with themselves. Once a man came to Confucius and said I had a jar full of money buried in the woods. I went to dig it up to check on it and the money was gone. What should I do? Confucius said put rocks in the jar, bury it again and make believe the money is still there. It would be very dangerous for these people to even go and check on their weapons and they probably never will. I do not think there will be any rising up of gun owners. They are not going to engage the police in active firefights to keep their guns. The guns will just go away and the police state will be in full swing. What the Police Are Missing – Police do not see their role in the police state correctly or even close to it. They miss the bigger picture. To them it is a status job, the pay is good and the perks are big. Police and their families get out from traffic tickets. Ask any law enforcement officer you may know well. This includes spouses, children, brothers, sisters, and parents. In many departments they even have little gold and silver courtesy badges they give their relatives. The police and their families get favorable treatment with accident reports, ouch if you are the other driver. They have a lot of favorable treatment letting them get away with things regular people do not get away with. They usually cannot get away with major crimes. Police carry guns all over the USA without a carry permit. They can carry on airplanes if they are Federal Officers. They can carry guns in government buildings, in stadiums, schools etc. If they are in their own jurisdiction they can get away with anything short of major felonies with victims. Police like this treatment. It gives them status and pride. It teaches them there are only three classes of people. The ruling class to them is not the Federal Reserve Bank; they would not know what that is. It is the senators, congressmen, mayors, supervisors, judges etc. They know these people can exert their power and influence and make their life miserable in many ways. They leave these people alone. Then there are police, which they always leave alone. Then come you the citizen. You pay their salary and they have no respect for you. You do not matter in that you have no power to do anything against them and you cannot retaliate. They are there to control you. The Taser is the latest police state tactic to be adopted. If a person doe not verbally snap to and respond to a verbal command of a police officer like get out of the car, stand here, sit down, move here etc they taser them. The police do not know they are conditioning the populace to respond to the police blindly without thinking or face painful consequences. I do not really know what they think. I guess they think it is proper to demand such respect and control over those they are supposed to protect. Most people that get tasered are involved in a victimless non-violent crime. This makes it worse. The police are not aware of any of this. They are in their own little world. They do not worry too much about the financial crisis in that they think there will always be work for them. Wait until the layoffs sink in later this year. Their attitude will change for the worse. They will do anything their handlers ask to keep their jobs. The police do not think they are there to protect and serve. They are there to control the populace and protect the ruling class and each other. Can you remember when police had nice government service looking uniforms, revolvers, long wooden sticks and helped people change flat tires. Now they look like storm troopers, wear black uniforms and masks, never help anyone with anything, have high tech weapons and strike fear and terror into the hearts of those that have contact with them. This is not being done by chance it is planned to strike fear into you of the police who used to be there to serve you. The police used to be hard on armed robbers, rapists, burglars, muggers and real criminals. Now most of the people in the prisons are there for crimes that are victimless. A government statue is not a victim. When the Police State Flourishes What Is It Like For The Police? – Well this is something they do not consider. Let us say gun control has been accomplished and private ownership of guns is historical. So the people are no longer a threat. Who will the paranoid rulers fear next? They are always paranoid because they do not rule by popular support. Ever see the army of bodyguards they have now, this is nothing. You got it, the police and military is what they will fear the most. They have the weapons, the access, the association potential to organize etc. Imagine police leaving their guns in their lockers when going off shift. This is how it will be. No private guns for police anymore. Internal security investigations will become a lifestyle. There will not be any more lawsuits against the government. The Internal Security Forces will be super cops trained to resent the police, take advantage of them and rule them by fear and harshness. What the police do the population now, is what the internal security forces will do to the police then only worse since there will not be any consequences for their actions. There will be mandatory polygraph exams. Long interrogations. Police homes and cars being searched. Their phones and email being tapped. They will be followed. Other police constantly being questioned about their colleagues. The role model is the SS Hitler had. Remember who tried to kill Hitler, the military on several occasions. The military will also be handled harshly but they are much more easily controlled due to the nature of the military but their internal security forces will constantly be engaged in a war of terror against them. The internal security forces will have to get results or else they will be considered ineffective so one way or another they will be discovering sedition, spying, attempts to revolt, steal, commit criminal acts etc. The police will be policed very harshly. They will in turn be harsh towards the population. The police do not see any of this coming. The Federal Police are in the same boat as the local police. They will become more and more entrusted to police the police and protect the state as time goes on. There will not be much point in protecting the state from an unarmed populace so guess who they will focus on – the others who can have access to guns – the military and police. The internal security forces the federal police have will rein terror on them as well. They will have to uncover plots to keep their jobs and show they serve a purpose. Doom and gloom. Will This Scenario Be Likely? – In our opinion no. We ascribe to the breaking up of the USA due to financial collapse similar to the USSR in the 1980’s. It looks like Obama is afraid to push forward with gun control legislation just now. This can be a ruse while they work hard to get it passed quietly without opposition until it is too late but unlikely. Obama has to maintain order in the face of the financial collapse, which is already happened, and getting worse by the day. New opposition from 25 million gun owners is not something him and Billary need right now. The countries in the world do not trust the US and their dollar and they are working fast to replace the dollar as the world reserve currency. Anything like this will hurt the USA and throw them into hyperinflation. The USA will have to start buying foreign currency to make purchases abroad and the exchange rate will be bad for the USD. Gun control is a slow freight train that takes years to effect even from where they are today. The USA Government is really fighting for its continued existence and hoping to keep its role as a superpower and the world’s policeman. I would say they have two chances – slim and none. They destroyed themselves with their idiotic greedy monetary practices. The descriptive term should be – Dead Country Walking."
9,Who in the Police State Gets Extralegal Exemptions?,politics," Executive Summary – The purpose of this article is to show you the special privileges certain people and their spouses and children have in the USA with a special emphasis on those in law enforcement and politics. This is how the police state grooms law enforcement to step into the role of a police state with all its associated lawlessness and brutality. These people are basically immune from traffic law enforcement, vehicle codes, and other minor and not so minor violations of the law. In police states it is common to extend these privileges to the groups of people listed below. As the police state grows into its fullness the paranoia on the part of the leaders grows and they begin policing the police and government officials with extreme vigor and prejudice. The internal affairs police become all-powerful. Hitler referred to them as the Gestapo. They ruined careers and terrorized ordinary police. Government officials and the military. As they eliminate the private ownership of guns, freedom of movement, international travel etc then their threat risk assessment of those in power, shifts to those with the guns and in control of various aspects of governing the people. Then the police state evolves into a full-fledged paranoid madhouse, which is the path they all seem to go down. The leaders know they are criminals violating the laws of the land. They know the people hate them with a passion. They generally leave the country in shambles. They fear execution and an overthrow every minute of every day. They have no peace. They do not eat or sleep well. Their health deteriorates. The leaders sleep in different houses each night, bodyguards sleep in their bedrooms, alcoholism and drug use with the leaders becomes widespread, insomnia is common, persecution fantasies abound, trials for treason, sedition, espionage with summary executions abound amongst the ranks of the police, military and government officials. The law enforcement and low-level government officials get sucked into serving these police states by the government extending certain privileges to them, often not formally codified but just put into practice. They often pay these police out of proportion wages not in sync with the state of the economy. Today there are tens of thousands of police and corrections officers making over $100,000 a year who never attended college. Federal law enforcement agents can easily hit $140,000 a year. Then comes their early retirement, medical, dental, vacations and so forth. The police state wants them happy and proud to have these jobs. The police state is teaching them the advantages to turning a blind eye towards all the injustices. They get used to using the taser and pepper spray on anyone who talks back to them. They get to carry weapons practically anywhere and in some cases even on airplanes. People get long prison sentences for victimless crimes (all they did was break a statue no identifiable persons were victims). They become a tool of the elite and thus acquire certain privileges. Who Are the People Granted Official and Unofficial Exemptions from Laws – City and State Police Officers County Sheriffs Correction Officers, City, County, State, and Federal Parole Officers, City, County, State, and Federal Probation Officers, City, County, State, and Federal State Troopers Highway Patrol Animal Enforcement Officers Alcoholic Beverage Police Weights and Measures Police Lottery Police Labor Police Child and Family Services Police Tax Collection Police City, County, State, and Federal Building Inspectors Food Inspectors Health Inspectors Traffic Enforcement Officers Federal Law Enforcement Agents – There are over 100 such agencies City and County Commissioners Mayors and Deputy Mayors City, County, State and Federal members of legislatures Judges on all levels Governors and Deputy Governors Attorney Generals District Attorneys Prosecutors called by other titles Ambulance Drivers Paramedics Firemen Animal Control Officers Court Clerks To the above you could add in the spouses, children and parents of these people to who various exemptions from the law are also granted informally as a professional courtesy. So as you can see the so-called Thin Blue Line is a lot wider than what one might think. Traffic Enforcement Police will tell you that a tremendous amount of those they stop are part of this list. The protocol is that the person stopped in a traffic stop presents themselves as one of the privileged few before they show any driver license or registration. If one presents the driver license and registration to the officer they generally will just take it to the cruiser and check their status and then return with a ticket written out. The idea is to explain who you are with or without documentation before the license is shown so it never gets to the ticket stage. There are no bulletproof rules as to one cop not giving another cop a ticket. Generally it is not done. Police departments do get into ticket wars with other cops and start handing out tickets to members of other departments freely. Usually the high-ranking officials settle this quickly before someone gets arrested. Police will often ask a federal agent if they are working when stopped. Federal agents say yes because they are on 24/7. They generally are let go. Sometimes they get a ticket and then they have their office phone the traffic court and have the judge cancel it. The general rule is that these privileged few look out for each other. If the offense is bad and will result in a big investigation only the very highest of the privileged can expect to get the extra-legal assistance and this can and has extended all the way up to murder. What Are the Types of Exemptions Offered to these people: Traffic – These people even have courtesy badges and ID cards that they give to friends and relatives so that other police will not give them traffic tickets. There are probably one million such people running around in the USA. This explains the people who speed incessantly and run red lights and make illegal turns you see all the time and wonder about. They are exempt from citations, not like you. Just discuss this with any law enforcement officer or ex law enforcement officer, who trusts you, to see that it is true. Remember these privileged violators also get good driver rates when they are not really good drivers. Drunk Driving – This is not always covered but often is. Depends on how drunk they are, where and who they are. They often will have another officer take the car to a safe place and drive the person home so as to keep them off the road. They would rarely just tell the person it’s okay continue driving dead drunk even if it is a judge. Drunken judges are common, as are police officers and legislators. This is a sensitive one but the police will usually try not to cite and arrest the privileged. If it is one of their own and he is not safe to drive they will often call the supervisor of the officer to come get him. This way the department informally knows he is drinking and riving but they avoid exposing one of their own to the justice system that applies to regular people. This is often done as well for bad traffic violations like going 130 mph in a corvette. His supervisor knows about it but the officer is spared the consequences of the law. Hmmm can someone say get out of jail free card. Traffic Accidents – Here is a courtesy not known by many. The police throw the accident report in favor of the privileged one. The other driver gets a ticket and their insurance rates suffer. The other party has no idea this is going on until he reads the accident report. How many would ever think to investigate the other party to see if they are a police officer and few would complain to the internal affairs department of the law enforcement agency involved. Truck Driving – A lot of police officers drive over the road trucks off duty. They do not generally have to follow the rules like regular truck drivers. This enables them to make more money than regular drivers. They can exceed weight limits, drive excessive hours, have messed up logbooks, equipment violations etc. A little known but all too common occurrence. Ever see a truck driver barreling down on you speeding like crazy and not caring about getting caught. Now you know why. Fights – The police will rarely ever arrest one of the privileged if a regular fight broke out over an argument even if they were drunk. If someone is seriously hurt or killed then it tends to go more by the book, but not always. Sometimes they might complain to the cops’ supervisor. Drugs – One of the privileged caught with personal quantities of drugs would normally get out of it with being arrested. They might not even have the drugs confiscated. Searches of Vehicles – The privileged are pretty much search free. This means they can carry drugs, illegal weapons, and open alcohol containers without much worry. Expired License Tags, Driver Licenses etc – This sort of thing is generally overlooked. Loud Parties – These complaints tend to be played down for the privileged. The police come and say it was phoned in. If the person has a lot of juice the police will not respond to any more disturbance calls at that address. If they do not have a lot of juice they will be told to tone it down nicely so they do not have to come back. Threatening Violent Harm on People – The privileged can threaten those who get in their way with little fear of retaliation from law enforcement. Domestic Violence – The privileged few can often get away with this. Depends a lot on who they are and what they did. Doom and gloom on their spouses. Building Code Violations – The privileged can often get away with a lot here. They just build. The inspectors will look the other way when it comes to those that can retaliate against them. Alcoholic Beverage Violations – The privileged can serve minors, open after hours; break maximum occupancy codes, etc. with no consequences. Fire Code Violations – The privileged can generally get extreme leniency from the fire department on enforcing violations. Special Jobs – The law enforcement people can get high paying jobs off duty that they are not supposed to have in many instances. A lot of these opportunities open up to the retired law enforcement people since it is known that the courtesies will still be extended to those retired. Some of these are: Bar Bouncers (the police report will almost always show them always innocent) Security Guards (special gun privileges are valuable to the rich and famous) Body Guards (They can speed and drive illegally for their wealthy clients) Private Detectives (they get private information easily like unlisted phones, addresses) Summary – This should open your eyes to some of the lower level corruption going on which no one even talks about stopping. Those that can stop it are the partakers. This gives them an elitist mentally. They think the law only applies to the regular people not them. They soon stop caring about the constitution and civil rights since they have plenty of rights; it’s the other people who lose their rights. As the police state rolls on, police brutality and violence continues unchecked. Police are allowed to kill for just about any reason. Their arrogance reaches a sickening level. The police and the privileged further disassociate from identifying with the common folk. The police state wants the police and privileged to not identify with ""We the People"" so they can accomplish their agenda. When the people have no guns, no travel privileges, no rights to a fair and speedy trial by their peers, no freedom of speech and expression, can no longer gather in an orderly fashion, the constitution becomes a historical document at best, then the police state is in its fullness as the rules change. In the final stage of the police state before it falls apart like they always do, the leaders feel threatened by the police and turn on them with a paranoid eye. They will have set up internal police control forces and an super elite group of paramilitary police that would be the only ones trusted and their powers would be extremely broad. They would be focused on enemies of the state only, leaving routine law enforcement for the police forces. The police reap what they sow before it is over and it falls apart. Right now they are in the dark and are too busy enjoying their riot gear, tasers, full automatic weapons, exercising extra constitutional powers over the people to really take the time to understand where it is heading. Like the people they generally wake up when it is too late. Idea – Try to get the gun control people after these abuses of justice. Their energy would be better spent this way. Write letters to the anti-gun legislators suggesting they can get a lot of publicity and votes by leading a campaign after these injustices. Use their greed for power and votes against the evil system. You’d be shocked at how easy this is to effect. Also try diverting the high tax legislators into this arena. Remind them that scandals lead to public hearing and make for excellent publicity. Think of it – you are on CNN cleaning up the ranks of the judicial system. It will work but you will only be changing one lousy politician for another lousy politician. You will be rocking the apple cart and apples will fall off. Set your mind to have fun and enjoy yourself. Divide and defeat is the tactics they use on ""We the People"" so use it back on them."
10,Tennessee Proposes New Gun Law Similar to Montana Gun Law,politics," Introduction - Tennessee legislators have started a bill that would exempt all firearms made in Tennessee from federal gun laws if the weapons were intended to remain in Tennessee. This is extremely similar to the new gun law already signed into law in Montana. Utah and other states intend to follow with a similar bill. This is a way to stop the Federal government from doing any more gun control. Implications – The media is saying this is a challenge for the Federal Supreme Court to get involved. Think this is the media intending to soft peddle it. This type of legislation is intended to severely limit the powers of the Federal government. So the media would have us believe that the Supreme Court will say sorry states you can’t do this and the states will say ok come take our guns away. Childish attempt on the part of the media to deceive us. The states would tell the Supreme Court what powers the constitution allows for the Fed and then go to secession if the court tries to expand these powers contrary to the constitution. The states joined the union many years ago based on the powers the constitution affords to the Fed and all the other powers belong to the states. This was the contract and it had no specific expiration date after which the Fed could do what it wanted. The Fed according to the constitution has no power to regulate firearms; the contrary is the case in that the right to bear arms is guaranteed. The Fed can regulate interstate commerce that crosses state lines but has no power to control commerce within a state. These powers are quite cut and dried and above and beyond some judges twisted deceitful interpretation that meets their goals. Obama and States Rights– Obama is the dream President when it comes to this sort of legislation. He is quite inexperienced. He was a junior Senator for two years. Junior Senators are on no relevant committees and get to do not much. Some big money thrust him into the Presidency but that does not mean he knows what he is doing. He is indecisive, scared, has a mountain of problems and is hoping the country does not go into civil unrest. This guy can’t even come up with a birth certificate showing he is an American. His plans to fix things economically are idiotic. His advisors have backgrounds with the organizations that caused all the economic trouble to start with. Borrowing caused the trouble and he is trying to fix it with more borrowing. Obama is good for something and Montana has figured out what he is good for and that would be the states taking back their rights and limiting the Federal government powers according to the constitution. Wait until some state says he has no authority over them because he has no birth certificate to show he is an American. Military members are refusing to follow his orders based on this now. Obama trying to ignore this birth certificate issue hoping it will go away is just another manifestation of him being the right guy to have in the White House for states rights movements. He has little popular support now and wait another six months to see how really unpopular he becomes. He breaks campaign promises like the best of them. He is accused of being a muslim and a non-American citizen. Hillary hates him and is just using him to get a shot at the presidency next election, so he has enemies within his ranks and this is not the sharpest pencil in the box to start with. He is going around yelling at the tax havens that accounted for about 1% of the economic damage that happened in the USA. Gosh he wants a scapegoat real bad. Shame he can’t even pick a viable scapegoat. So it looks like Obama is doomed to failure. Let’s hope a lot of states can intensify his failure by severely limiting the power of the Fed and/or seceding. This the bankers and his handlers do not want. What About Secession – If the Federal courts try to void out the states right concerning firearms or otherwise, the states will resort to secession. At some point the states may have to grab a gun to enforce their rights. The Federal government is always out there first with guns offering a violent unilateral solution to problems. Try telling them to practice gun control and see how many guns they point at you fast. I would say Montana would be right there armed and ready to stick up for their rights. Obama is not one to stand up to those standing up to him. Montana will win hands down if they as the saying goes ""stick to their Guns"". Obama would never do what Lincoln did and attack those states seceding from the Union. The states that secede will probably join together making new nations, eventually. So the states are finally holding the feet of the federal government to the fire. Either the fed quits and behaves constitutionally (only in your dreams will this ever happen), or they ignore the states and let them do as they please (most probable outcome) or they go nuts like Lincoln and show their war monger nature and attack using police and/or military to force compliance upon the states trying to free themselves. The last alternative is very unlikely. This would let the cat out of the bag and people would see how evil they can get when they want something. The people in the USA would never forgive this and the military would probably never fight such a fight. Very unlikely. Secession is also what the states are relying on the counter martial law. Martial law would basically shut down the state legislatures and government. They do not want to be irrelevant. The states rights legislation allows for them to declare the federal government illegal and irrelevant in the event of martial law. They would then reorganize themselves and/or the other states under the constitution thus seceding. This could be accomplished in a few days unless the feds sent agents to prevent the legislature from meeting. This of course moves the USA into a full illegal dictatorship role, which I doubt they would want to assume. Again look to them to do nothing since they do not have any good options. Let’s Talk Taxes and Secession – How this would play is interesting. If the states secede for sure they are not going to assume their portion of the debt to the private bankers called the Federal Reserve Bank. This means the Federal Reserve Bank loses face. Their debt would be considered to be illegal gains as a result of their ponzi scheme called the Federal Reserve Bank, which is also a tax haven as well. The states that secede will of course start banks and rest assured there will be bank secrecy and numbered accounts. Further believe they will not share information with the USA who will probably be trying to collect back taxes from their constituents. More fun and games. New secret banking system and of course a new currency. You think that Obama and Hillary can deal with this? Name one thing that they were right about so far? See what I mean. Other Things to Look For Money - The states will start to ""coin"" their own money in Gold and Silver. This is constitutional money. This is another fight the fed will not want because it will illuminate the unconstitutional nature of their money and of course its worthlessness. Obama will look the other way on this. He is a supporter of fiat money and as long as the states do not go to fiat money he will not care. Drugs – States will begin to legalize drugs. The legalization will vary from state to state. Generally expect personal use of ""soft"" drugs only. The Fed will not like this. Fights will ensue similar to California and their legal medical marijuana. Health Care – States will assert their right to alternative health care and begin to license all sorts of alternative health care providers. Much more than what is seen today. Banks – States will begin to open banks that do not have FDIC and are not subject to any Federal rules and regulations."
11,Where are the States' Rights Going?,politics," Introduction – A number of states have passed states right legislation affirming the rights that the federal government has and those that the states have according to the constitution. The federal government has been tremendously over stepping their constitutional boundaries for many years. The states are scared. The last infringement on states rights is a declaration of martial law. If there is ever such a declaration of martial law the states government will become suspended. The chances of martial law ever being repealed once in effect are about as good as the patriot act ever being repealed. None in other words. The states are not clean. They are operating illegally at times themselves. They practice stupid high tax practices. They eliminate productive jobs in favor of non-productive jobs (government). Their politicians run and get elected on handout tickets that destroy any country. The states are afraid of being done away with altogether through the fed invoking martial law thus they are trying to do something about it. Analysis – First off we always need to consider the concept of the states setting the people up. They pass these states rights laws and do nothing other than that. This is where we are right now. Then the Fed takes the states to their own federal courts. We can expect a three-year wait. Then who knows what the federal courts do? Planning on the federal courts protecting the rights of the states when they get a paycheck from the federal government is of course a stretch at best. So this could be a ruse to get the people to think all will be well just sit back and wait a few years for the courts to decide. Then a few years later the fed has tightened its grip to such an extent the cases never get heard and well you know the rest. I say this based on the new Montana Gun Law. I have no idea why Montana wants to take the fed to task in the federal courts. This is almost as silly as asking the federal government for the right to secede. They should start building and selling guns. Then if the fed steps in arrest the agents and the judge who issued the warrant and charge them under Montana law. No federal agent has the right to go around breaking state laws or illegally enforcing federal laws. This would get things decided by the federal courts fast, don’t you think. Maybe three days instead of three years. The way this is playing is very suspicious. The other side of the coin is that we are in uncharted water here and it may be the states really do not know what to do and they are trying take a safe position. This is typical for a government. Another position is the states are just trying to scare the federal government into a restoration of a constitutional government. Good luck with that. So be careful before you run around thinking oh boy we are getting this mess fixed up with states rights legislation. You may be on the way to it but it also maybe a ruse. At this point I am think it is a ruse or a warning shot across the bow of the fed which they will tend to ignore. My gosh they are ignoring a President without a birth certificate, this is small compared to that. Implications of States Rights – We are seeing states saying they have the right to sell guns inside their state with no federal controls or reportage. I think they do have this right. The argument is the fed has only the right to control interstate commerce, not intrastate commerce. The constitution grants no specific rights to the fed to control guns. There was similar case in the federal courts. A guy was growing wheat or corn. He was operating contrary to some federal law about growing too much wheat. He went to court and argued he was only growing for his own use, not selling it and certainly not selling it across state lines thus immune from the fed. The fed court said that his growing of the crop could affect supply and demand, prices etc in a way that would affect markets outside of his state. He lost. The ruling coming from a federal court was as absurd as it could be. No country can survive when courts rule this way, none. And these people are waiting for the same federal courts to rule on the states rights to make guns and not sell across state lines. Want the ruling most probable to come down, here we go. Dear Montana you have no way to control the guns leaving the state thus it needs to be under federal control lest you become complicit in violating the gun laws in numerous states and of course the federal laws these states have agreed to abide by. You will also be affecting interstate markets for gun sales, production, supply, demand, prices etc. You also will be allowing people to buy guns who may not clear the federal background check thus equipping undesirables with firearms, which can be moved out of the state. Got the idea yet. Do you think the fed will say Oh yeah well it is the second amendment that we cannot infringe. Come on look how much infringement they have come up with already. Does this emphatically mean these states are operating in a ruse? No. They can be innocent enough and afraid of getting prosecuted for conspiracy to violate federal gun control laws by passing such a law so they timidly want to try a federal court ruling. It scares the fed, it gets votes and it does nothing, which is the all time favorite position of politicians. In any event when you see the state saying they are going to challenge the fed in a federal court, come on wake up and get real. This is a dead end. If the states had any guts and took action after passing these laws it would be a different thing. Expect the fed to ignore these things and the federal courts to set them aside and life goes on while the police state grows against the constitution. Having the federal court rule on a case where the fed is a defendant is what is called a ""conflict of interest"". Sure it is done everyday but that does not stop it from being a conflict of interest. A fair system would appoint a lawyer or group of lawyers specially qualified to hear the case. Those judging the case would need to not be employed by the defendant to have anything resembling a fair system especially when you are trying to prove the fed is overstepping its bounds. Where It All Hits the Fan - The debt to the Federal Reserve. Numerous states are passing laws calling for the states to pay their debts in gold or silver. They are also saying the people can bank in gold and silver. So now we will need to get banks in these states out of the federal system and into a state only system. Goodbye to the FDIC. Eventually they will say no to the Federal Reserve debt. First the guns. Next the gold and silver honest constitutional money. Then dismiss the federal debt as a Ponzi scheme, illegal etc. Now what. The fed then gets popular support from all their tax consumers by telling them that say Montana is avoiding its obligation to the taxes that enable you to stay home and live in a nice house and get free medical because you are on disability since you are a crazy drug addict, or it will cause you to lose your cushy job for $90,000 in some idiotic government agency pushing papers. Now the fed can stir the pot for support from their tax consuming dependents that just want all the hard working people to go on and keep supporting them until they are bankrupt (like today). These tax consumers are of course not going to do anything except complain or maybe burn their own cities in a drunken outrage. But they would support a military action on the part of the fed to sanction these states. See the problem. States rights eventually culminate with either listening to the federal courts or just laughing at them and going to secession, which is a state legislature event independent of any federal court. Then assumptively once one state has the guts to do it, several follow suit and join into a new nation free of tax consumers. The newly formed governments would be probably 20% of what you see now. The amount of crimes for which one goes to jail would probably be 25 or less. The economies would be booming since there would be no partnership with the Federal Reserve Bank. So we wait and watch very cautiously. Be careful not to be deceived and just trust these people in the state legislatures touting states rights. They have done nothing except pass legislation, which they take zero action on. Numerous states have passed states right bills into law. The fed still abuses its authority and these states do nothing. Be careful not to be deceived. We hope it is real but we are losing confidence daily."
12,When the People Fight Back,politics," Executive Summary – First we have a video of a soccer game, not in USA. A guy runs across the field. Ok so they should take him into custody, throw him out of stadium, bar him from returning or maybe write him a citation for this event. What the security forces did was tackle him and then when he was pinned down they started to hit him in the head with their clubs. Watch the one on his right nearest the head. The fans ran out of the stands and began to beat the police. The police ran. One was left behind and got quite a beating from the angry crowd. I expect he was the one clubbing the guy in the head. After the soccer game video there is another video and some commentaries on this subject matter: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws-mn3M23dc Police Brutalizing Captured Suspect - The next video shows the police chasing a stolen car suspect. The suspect eventually abandons the car and runs on foot. He eventually realizes he is going to be caught so he lies down on the ground spread-eagled showing he has no weapons in his hand etc. The first officer on the scene runs over to him on the ground and kicks the suspect strongly in the head. Yes and he gets captured on film by the helicopter crew. The inside facts are the police are sending a signal to the criminals to not resist or they will be brutalized. Imagine what they did to this kid in the squad car and in the police station. ""Resistance is Futile"". The point here is that when the police can violate the rights of the people when they have already submitted, they lose respect for the constitution, their badge and the people. It is one very short step until the police start stealing from the people. After that comes blackmail, extortion, rape and murder all behind the cover of the badge. America welcome to the third world it is just around the corner. In case you were wondering the police department justified the officers actions. Something about him being allowed to use distracting actions when apprehending and cuffing the suspect. See how bad it is getting. How bad will it be in three months? Violence Against Police – A revolutionary writer once wrote some years ago that the revolution in the USA would start with people fed up with the government suddenly and unexpectedly unleashing violence against authority figures. A guy out of work, broke, having his car ready to be repossessed gets pulled over for expired license tags. The police can care less about his tales of woe and write him a ticket anyway. He goes crazy and attacks the police. What the writer described was a pressure cooker that the people just cannot take anymore. We are starting to see this now. Much of it will be twisted by the mainstream media so as to disguise what is happening. Here we describe two such events. Lovelle Mixon in Oakland, Ca. – Mixon was a criminal. Remember 1 in 31 people in the USA are in the penal system. He was on probation. He kept showing up for meetings with his probation office, which the probation officer kept canceling. One time he does not go to the scheduled meeting and the probation officer issues a warrant for his arrest. Eventually he gets pulled over for some traffic infraction. Exploding at the insanity of the situation he is facing with the warrant for his arrest from not showing for a meeting he expected to be cancelled he decides to fight back. He brains with a pistol two cops who pull him over. Killing them. Lets not lose sight of the fact that this guy was not wrapped too tightly to start with. He saw the probation officer playing with him by making him take time to show for meetings that never happen. Then he gets conditioned to the meetings never happening and becomes a no show. This results in his arrest warrant being issued. A wiser person would realize if he were a no show there would be consequences. Not everyone is all that smart in the USA, one in 31 in the system now. Add in millions of others who were in the system over the years. Ok so what does Mixon do? He goes and hides in his sister’s apartment. The police find out and decide to use a swat team to attack. They enter and Mixon hiding in a closet kills two more cops. Four dead cops. Was Mixon commando trained or were the cops not so good. The latter, more on this later. If the probation officer treated Mixon like a human would this have happened? No! It is his fault in a sense. He could have called Mixon and asked what was up or gone to visit him. Treat people like animals and animals is what you get. Richard Pop Poplawski – Here we have a guy who gets into a heated argument with his mom over a dog urinating on a rug. He feared an arrest would ensue over the dispute, which would be categorized as a domestic dispute. If he went to jail on this his gun rights could be revoked. He knew this. The mom phones it in. He feared the government as a bunch of gun grabbers. They are gun grabbers. He snapped. Domestic dispute laws are idiotic and unconstitutional. If a man or woman complains to the courts in most states that they fear for their life or fear harm for themselves and/or children the courts issue an ex-parte restraining order throwing the other party out of the house for ten days or longer with no evidence, proof or hearing. There is no chance to be tried by a jury or accuse your accuser. The police show up and then and there evict you allowing a suitcase to go with you. The other spouse gets a good laugh while you stay in a hotel or with friends. If this goes into a hearing and the judge finds against you for the purposes of a serious longer term restraining order your gun rights can be revoked as well. This guy knew this. He knew the constitution does not allow for such revocation of gun rights. He put on some body armor and grabbed his AK-47. He managed to kill three police officer, wounded two fairly badly and all while he himself was wounded. Was he trained to do this or did he just outgun the ones that were supposed to be trained. The latter. He had heart, determination and purpose. He also had a fine rifle and armor. Did he do anything really wrong? No. He snapped. He had more than he could take of the government. Where Are We Headed – This is what homeland security fears. Independent freelancer terrorists they call them. They are people who just can’t take it anymore. You will see more of this, a lot more of this. The law enforcement agencies will take bad losses. Morale will suffer. They will not explain that the officers must be more understanding and softer. They will get them better armor, better equipment and train them more to instill false sense of confidence in law enforcement officers encouraging them to engage these citizens with more vigor and determination. Won’t work. One day they will approach a car on a traffic stop for an equipment violation. The guy lost his mandatory insurance since he is out of work and no more savings or credit. He does not want to get citations, go to court, lose his license, lose his car, etc. He knows the police have no mercy. He waits for the officers to approach and shoots one with a pistol hidden from sight in the face. Then he goes after the other officer. The sheriff comes to the house to serve an eviction or foreclosure notice. The occupants have no money, no job, no savings, no police record and kids. The cop is hard nosed. It is his job and he wants his family to not suffer like the family he is going to evict. The citizen does not want to see his family homeless while his tax dollars bail out the banks and big corporations. He thinks Obama is right in that it is time for change. The tenant shoots the sheriff deputies. The law enforcement officer sees a person who defended himself against street criminals and they try to arrest him. He freaks out. He shoots the police. Law enforcement cannot defend themselves from this sort of person - They are in no movements, no groups, nothing to profile them. If they suspect every out of work person facing foreclosure or eviction they would have 10 million suspects at least. The mainstream media will distort these events in the future so as to not inspire anyone else to partake in such behavior. This will not help. A Word on the Law Enforcement Officers – They are being duped into serving a police state. They have little idea what is going on for the most part. Some do understand but they like the weekly paycheck and rationalize what they do by saying they are going to be the good cops. They are still partakers in an unconstitutional system turning into a full-blown police state. This is just rationalizations. The small amount of good they can do is greatly offset by serving the unconstitutional government. Law Enforcement Officers are not motivated like these two guys were. They go to work everyday. In any department there are a very small amount of commando types, most are not even into guns. They hate taking chances. They are used to working with overwhelming odds. The idea is to make it seem like resistance is futile. If there is resistance on the part of well-armed people who are determined the result is dead law enforcement officers. The large amount of officers present usually results in the citizen resisting not being able to make good his escape away from the scene. He kills some of them but does not get away. Wait until the police go after some guy who spent a few tours in Afghanistan who is well armed. One knowledgeable in ambush tactics. The death toll for law enforcement will be high. What about a few veterans living together. In Miami in the 1980’s there was a bunch of ex vets who decided to rob banks. So for starters these two were not the brightest lights in the harbor. No society can thrive allowing jerk behavior like this to go unchecked. They had excellent guns, lots of them and knew tactics. Eventually after a number of robberies the FBI profiled them and actually got them on the street in their car. There were numerous FBI agents involved. These two bank robbers killed all but one FBI agent who was wounded. They died in their car shooting it out. The FBI needed an alibi story. They decided to change the handguns they used. They were using .357 revolvers with .38 special +p ammo in a four-inch barrel. Actually a respectable load in competent hands. Some people say the FBI are excellent shots, other say they use a .38 caliber pencil when retrieving their targets at the range. So they went to a 9mm handgun with more rounds for the pray and spray effect. Didn’t work out for them. Then they went to a more potent .40 caliber Glock pistol that is what they use today. The most potent handgun round used in conventional police guns was the 125 grain .357 semi-jacketed hollow point with the scalloped edge (Remington). This was best used in at least a four-inch barrel gun. The effect of hitting someone with this round was like hitting them with lightning. The problem was it took a good-sized man to shoot it. Smaller people and women would have serious trouble rapid firing this weapon. Anyway the FBI decided to say their guns were anemic. The bureau agents had hit the bank robbers and they did not just die. People that watch TV will have tendency to behave like a TV character and fall down after being shot. Street thugs and military people who have seen a lot of shootings first hand know this is nonsense and one had better keep on fighting after being hit, and of course they know this is possible even after multiple hits. Of course one will sometimes fall down after being shot no matter what, most of the time this is not the case. These bank robbers knew this and they killed their assailants, which were the FBI even though they were seriously wounded. When the law enforcement agencies conduct a raid against one or two possibly armed suspects in a house they will usually have at least 15 officers armed to the teeth. They are not interested in shootouts. They want surrender. If the suspect decides to put on armor and engage the police with good weapons he is going to hurt or kill some of them. Then they call for swat assistance, which generally does better, but they get killed too. Imagine four veterans with battle experience with good weapons and armor engaging the police in a raid to confiscate weapons or something. I expect most of the police would get killed or injured. What if the veterans captured some of the police injured or not and started playing the hostage game as skilled negotiators in a combat zone resorting to brutality to get the heck out of there alive. We are talking about throwing hostage body parts at the police to make them understand the urgency of them complying with the requests of the hostage takers. I think the police will seriously believe the threats of the hostage takers and break all the rule books in submitting and allowing an escape of some sort to save the life and limbs of the other side. They are not going to sit there and watch their fellow officers fingers and toes get thrown at them every minute. They are not going to storm the house knowing the hostages will surely die plus some of them. They are going to wait for help but the hostage takers will immediately remove time as something they can bargain for using hostage dismemberment to get what they want. This is the difference between military experience and police experience. Again most bank robbers that take hostages resort to Hollywood for ideas as to how they should play it, not the battlefield. You will see things like this very soon. The government is very worried about patriotic veterans returning to see the constitution being tread upon and getting very upset. Veterans refer to this as watering the freedom tree with blood. There are a lot of rumors that the military is registering all the privately owned weapons of their military and in some cases asking them to store the guns on the base under the control of the base commander. Bad sign."
13,"USA Debt Now At $546,688 per Household",politics," Executive Summary - This data comes from USA today, not out of thin air. In the last year the USA took on 6.8 trillion dollars in more debt. The total is now 63.8 trillion dollars. This figure is four times what the average household in the USA owes on all their debts including mortgages, credit cards, student loans, car loans, etc. The amount of debt owed per household if we add in estimated debts other than what is owed to the fed we get an estimate of $682,000. If we run the interest on this at say 5%, which is a low estimate for sure, we get $34,000 a year and this is interest only with no repayment of principal. If we ran the repayment of each household debt like a mortgage, say 30 years fully amortized at 5% we would get a monthly payment of $3661.12 which is $43,933.44 per year. After this the people need money for food, clothing, medical, transportation electric, heat, phones, education, etc. The point is there is no way that the people in the USA are ever going to pay this amount of indebtedness back without hyperinflation. Also bear in mind using a 5% interest figure is very low, a more real aggressive calculation would use a higher interest rate. So the stage is set for some form of economic disaster. Discussion - There is no real way out of this mess for the USA. Borrowing and more spending is only going to drag it out for a very brief period of time. The world leaders know the USD is worthless. When the leaders of the world stop using and accepting the USD and want to get paid in other currencies then the US will have to convert their US dollars to other currencies. As they print more dollars, the exchange value of the dollar drops accordingly. Then hyperinflation sets in. This can mean gas is $12 a gallon, bread $8 a loaf. When the hyperinflation really gets going then gas can be $45 a gallon. Savings get wiped out. More and more money gets printed. The federal debt gets repaid with cheaper money. Wages never keep up with inflation, never ever. This balances the books on paper. Now the USA would be in full third world status. The gov’t would impose currency controls and Americans would not be allowed to hold, pay or accept foreign currency in the USA. USA real estate would become a steal for foreigners if they did not mind living in a police state. Foreigners could come to the US and hire Americans paying them with cheap USD and then exporting the products for harder currencies. Remember social security, retirement etc will be paid with these cheap dollars so USA people will be desperate fro work. Many of the non-productive government jobs will be gone altogether. The laid off workers who never really ever had to work in a productive job will be going crazy. The message from the police state will be work or starve. This is another reason why the police state must have a tight grip. People would still have their pensions and would be lucky if they could eat at a fast food burger joint a few times a month due to hyperinflation. Medical care will be a mess. Why? Did you ever consider the doctors leaving for greener pastures? Same for computer programmers, engineers, pharmacists, nurses, skilled and licensed medical equipment operators like MRI, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, architects, professional athletes, scientists, pilots, and other people who have transferable skills able to find work in other nations. Those that worked for government in nonproductive jobs as bureaucrats are going to find that no one has need of them. The window for this to happen is not going to remain open much longer. The USA is so close to locking down their borders now, they could close the nation in hours, not days. Remember that once the USA locks down many Americans are going to overstay their tourist visas in other lands not wanting to return. The other nations will very shortly start requiring formal visas for Americans to visit. To shut the border all they have to do is impose exit visa requirements on the people leaving. This seems to be just right around the corner. One would need to file an exit visa application before leaving the USA. You would have to state the purpose of your trip. They would want assurances that you would be returning. This would be showing things like you own a house, land, businesses; you are leaving spouse and children behind etc. The USSR did this. The USA does this in reverse for people seeking a visa to visit the USA so they are really quite good at it. If you cannot show a lot of reasons why you would return then you would not get the visa to leave. Before an exit visa system has any teeth the borders must first be locked down for exit and entrance. This they have already down. They even have checkpoints 100 miles inside the country near the borders. I do not know how 100 miles can be near a border. It should take one at least an hour and a half to drive 100 miles. If the USA does not shut down the country tight when the dollar starts to really drop then all their resources will leave. All the highly trained and educated people will be heading out. This will make it hard to find suitable skilled labor to run businesses on the soon coming greatly reduced wages. Remember foreigners coming to the USA to start business and inject hard currency capital into the USA are not going to want to hear about equal opportunity employer, OSHA, Workmen’s compensation, discrimination for sex, race, religion age etc. These things have to go or the businesses won’t come. They will want to make money or will go elsewhere. If they do not go to exit visas people will depart from the USA with their cars (to Mexico and Canada), their boats, their airplanes, their precious metals and jewelry and of course their cash. None of this is in the best interest for the government so they will put a tight lid on this. The USA will have to change. People will not like the changes, thus the police state. Now there are other variables that might screw up the plans of the USA. Name one thing they have done right in the last 50 years? See what I mean. These would be their plans. What they actually accomplish will never be what they want. In any event when the USD drops the government will become more radical in their actions as a police state. This writer thinks there is a maximum of 12 months or so. Nations like China, Russia, Brazil, India and others are converting their USD holdings into productive resources. When this is over (12 months or so) there will not be a lot of demand for USD anymore. That is when the real trouble will start for the USD, this is nothing compared with what is to come. Summary – The dollar has a doomed future. It is not going to make any real recoveries. Get out of it now while it is still worth something. It is 100% impossible to spend your way out of a recession caused by excessive debt like Obama is trying. Never happen. As you can see Obama has still not yet even got the falling of the economy to stop yet and this is because his approach is incorrect and the plunge may continue for some time, before it goes into free fall. The window to leave the USA with what you have is still open, take advantage of it. Countries converting to police states leave the exit door open for a while as they are tightening their grip. They encourage educated politically minded people to leave. This is done subtly, not openly. They don’t want you there. They are dumbing down the future labor force and do not want dissidents around. The business environment goes bad first (already there). More and more non-productive jobs are created as the businesses fail and their productive jobs disappear (already there). Business owners get disgusted and fed up with regulations, taxes, increasing lawsuits, increasing bankruptcies, judges becoming more irrational, and police powers expanding (we are already here but not in the fullness yet). These educated aware people start to leave (we are already here but not yet in the fullness). Socialism increases thus driving out more of those who understand what is going on because they know socialism never works and always results in a police state (already here). The last push comes from crime. The government starts to go easy on criminals. All the federal agents are protecting the government from you, not you from criminals. The agents run around putting people in jail for breaking regulatory statues, not for crimes against person or property where there is a real victim (already here). The criminals tend to not waste a lot of time and energy with the lower classes instead focusing on those with some assets (not yet here but crime will rise as the economy fails, always does). The very wealthy are either part of the police state or gone by this point in time. Wealthy people travel internationally a lot. They are used to foreign cultures. It is easiest for them to go. People that stay in the USA are going to be more like the frog boiling in water, while those familiar with foreign lands will have a broad perspective and see the changes for what they really represent. Soon you will see criminals victimize you and are by and large not really brought to justice. Police just take reports, no efforts at apprehension. If you are seeing this you waited too long to get out. Now you might be able to still get out but your assets are probably not going with you. The next step is a full third world corrupt law enforcement community as the enforcement arm of a full-blown corrupt and dishonest police state. The USA may never get this far. It may fall apart before which is the consensus from numerous experts. If it falls apart the Federal Reserve debt will be defaulted on. The banks will be gone. People will just own their homes. What happens to renters is a good question. Under these circumstances the USD will go the route of the confederate dollar after the south lost the war, completely worthless, as were their bonds. The stock market will also crash completely since the Federal Reserve drives it. Law and disorder is likely to prevail as states join together to form new nations. The unproductive sector of the economy will not have a home. The welfare state will be gone for many decades if not centuries. There is going to be a lot of gangs, and crime. Think the breakup of the USSR. People will be poor. Healthcare will be minimal if at all present. Expect some years of this. The USA will bounce back much faster and stronger than the USSR since capitalism was foreign to the USSR and they had to figure it out on the fly. The problem is no one knows how hard the police state is going to fight to retain control when things get bad. I would say they would fight all the way, no limits. In any event the potential for some ugly years that are so bad people will suppress the memories for the rest of their life, are on the way. States rights and secession will only be a painless exit if the fed does not fight tooth and nail to retain control. Remember they never accept any blame for anything. They never make mistakes. Do you think Obama will just let the states go ahead and leave? Source: www.panamalaw.org"
14,A Strategy to Exit Afghanistan,politics," By Jerome Grossman On May 22, President Barack Obama addressed the graduating class of United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. He drew cheers when he proclaimed, "" As long as I am your commander-in-chief, I will only send you into harm's way when it is absolutely necessary, and with the strategy and the well defined goals, the equipment and the support that you need to get the job done."" Bravo. But I wish he had applied those sentiments to the United States invasion of Afghanistan. The President has dramatically increased the number of U. S. military forces there, has promised even more next year, and has warned of a multi-year commitment to a war already almost 8 years in duration. • Is this war ""absolutely necessary?"" • Do we have a ""strategy"" for fighting it? • Do we have ""well defined"" goals? • Do we have an exit strategy? As recently as May 10, Hamad Karzai, the elected head the Afghan government, said, ""Al Qaeda is no longer in Afghanistan."" When this was relayed to General David Petraeus, the American and NATO military Commander, he replied,"" I would agree with that."" Obama's National Security Advisor Jim Jones said,"" I am not sure if Osama bin Laden is alive or dead."" Prime Minister of Pakistan Zardari:, stated flatly,"" Osama is dead."" On May 17, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates told Katie Couric of CBS that it will take at least two to four years before Afghan forces begin to take the lead in fighting, leaving unsaid when U.S. troops will leave. Moreover, Karzai and Zardari have complained bitterly about U.S. military tactics, especially the use of air power resulting in the unnecessary killing of civilians and the consequent increase in anti-American sentiment in Afghanistan and Pakistan. What is victory in Afghanistan? Will it prevent another brutal tragedy like September 11? We should remember that this attack was made by 19 people, not one of them Afghans, armed with credit cards and box cutters. It is difficult to understand how the conquest of Afghanistan could prevent another group of nineteen from performing a similar criminal act. Defense of the U.S. mainland begins at home with effective police and immigration procedures. U.S. wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, even Pakistan, coupled with our all-out support for Israel, might motivate some Muslims and citizens of those countries to irrational revenge, what the CIA calls ""Blowback"", the unintended consequences of military action and especially of foreign military occupation. President Obama, give us the answers to our questions. If you don't have them, at least separate yourself from the Afghan policies of George W. Bush and give us an exit strategy so that we can help these nations change their policies through diplomacy, economic help and our soft power while saving American lives and resources."

16,The Only Way,politics," Every year in October the Stock Market has a setback called Black Monday. The reason for this is the pricing has inflated over the past year and all of a sudden the market gets a slap in the face and the pricing goes down to a more realistic value. The economy is now going through a black Monday cycle which has escalated into a giant chain reaction.. Twenty years ago I could buy a Nissan Sentra for only $6,700 but in 2009 you cannot buy one for less than $15,000. A 150% price increase during the last two decades. Pricing over the last 20 years has inflated and people no longer will pay these prices. The only businesses that will survive are the ones that are able to bring their pricing down and yet stay in business. The reason all the car manufacturers are suffering is because rather than re price their models they want everybody to bail them out yet they want to keep their pricing the same. Look at Ford, if you buy one of their cars and for some reason lose your income then for the next year you will not have to make any payments. Other manufacturers are doing similar things. Twenty years ago I could attend a small college and pay only about $5000 for a complete 2 year program. In 2009 my wife is attending a small school and it now costs over $20,000 for a 2 year program as a medical assistant. By the time she graduates she will owe over $15,000 just in Student Loans. A lot of manufacturers are now giving away their products to students and the unemployed. Adobe will give the unemployed free software. This is software they normally charge over a thoiusand dollars fort. Microsoft will give up to a 90% discount to students. Sun will give away training to students. Restaurants that have a dollar menu will be the only ones that will survive the current economic conditions. Starbucks is closing hundred of stores because their pricing remains the same as when the economy was good. The reason Dunkin Donut's and McDonalds is able to survive is because they offer alternatives to people on a budget. Our current crunch is a slap in the face. No more do people want to pay the pricing. The only other way for our world to overcome the current situation is the elimination of money altogether.. If we cannot survive in our own world how can we hope to go beyond our current boundaries and see life on other worlds? The one who makes the most money wins the game needs to be eliminated. We need to refocus. We need to pursue making the world a better place. We need to eliminate crime, money, poverty, homelessness and suffering. Unemployment in 2009 is at an all time high. At no other time in our history has the unemployment rate been as high as it is today. In the middle East unemployment reach’s about 45%. In the US some cities have reached an unemployment of almost 23% If we eliminated money would the unemployment rate still be this high? Two books that show you everything that is now happening and what needs to be done are ""Atlas Shrugged"" by Ayn Rand and Star Trek The Next Generation. I strongly believe that Gene Roddenbery had a message for us all and he portrayed this message in his creation of Star Trek."
17,Is Jon Stewart Just for Laughs?,politics," By Jerome Grossman Peter Orszag is President Obama's Director the Office of Management and Budget.  Only 40 years old, he is the youngest member of the Obama Cabinet assigned the responsibility of developing and promoting the president's budget. In the rescue of the U.S. financial system, Orszag, Timothy Geithner, Secretary of the Treasury, and Lawrence Summers, the Director of the National Economic Council, are the most influential in determining policy. Of the three, Orszag may have the most liberal sensitivity. Orszag recently appeared on ""The Daily Show"", the television program that offers the public Jon Stewart's version of raucous commentary, invoking laughter by skewering public figures and public policy, albeit in a non-confrontational style.In the warm-up Green Room before the program, Stewart, feigning innocence and ignorance of detail, asked Orszag, according to the New Yorker magazine: ""This has nothing to do with the budget - it's this thing that I can't get out of my head.  With all that bailout stuff, why are they bailing out the banks?  Why not the borrowers?  These mortgages went bad, and then they were securitized and blah, blah, blah.  So why not fix the mortgages, not the securities?""  When Stewart asked Orszag why the government didn't just bailout borrowers who have defaulted, Orszag replied, ""The problem is, if you just focused on the people who defaulted you create this huge incentive to default.""  Stewart looked at Orszag in astonishment, pointing out that the government is creating an equally huge incentive to default by bailing out the financial firms. Behind all the complexities was a very simple fact. Monthly mortgage payments by millions of homeowners were what provided the money for the banks and financial institutions that bought mortgages from the banks and the Wall Street firms that created sophisticated securities based on these mortgages.  Bailing out those who took out the mortgages would save millions of families from being foreclosed, would save entire neighborhoods, would eliminate the need for the bank bailout money, would revive the credit of the banks, would save the big bonuses paid to bankers, etc.. Why wasn’t this approach seriously considered? Politically and morally one would expect the Democratic Party officeholders to help the masses ahead of Wall Street.  Are bailouts the special province of big business, highly paid executives, major donors to politicians and political parties?  Is John Stewart right or is he just for laughs?"
18,So What If Texas Secedes?,politics," By Jerome Grossman Most politicians, analysts, and media are giving President Barack Obama good grades for his first one hundred days in office. With the general public Obama seems more popular than ever as measured by his standing in the opinion polls. And, in spite of the deepening recession, more than 50% of Americans think the country is headed in the right direction. A notable exception is Governor Rick Perry of Texas who objects to Obama's policies so deeply that he has suggested that Texas might end its association with the United States of America and strike out on its own. Perry insists on the right of Texas to secede from the Union, violating the core principle of the first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln. So far Perry has not fired on Fort Sumter or any U.S. military installation in Texas but we should be prepared. His primary objection to federal policy is the stimulus package designed to energize the economy but it appears that he will still take the money for his state. At the same time, Perry is trying to persuade other Republican governors to talk of secession as a political tactic to rally the depressed conservative base. So what if Texas actually secedes? We would still visit there, of course, and would be friendly, not as friendly as with Canada, but somewhat warmer than with Cuba and Venezuela. Would independent Texas give up NASA and the next voyage to the moon? In what league would the Dallas Cowboys play? Would they still be ""America's team?"" Governor Perry points out that Texas has the right to split into five separate states, each with its own president, enough for every member of the Bush family. And the two Bush ex-presidents of U.S.A. could cap their careers by running for president of an independent Texas. Then each could build second presidential libraries, at least one of them featuring mementos of torture. Texas as an independent country would give the U.S. several tempting options. We could build a fence on the border to discourage immigration from Texas. We could invade Texas for oil or to change the regime there. And George W. Bush would be the last Texan to be president of the United States."
19,Doctors Already Responding to Obama's Call to Make Offices Paperless,politics," Physicians seek to take advantage of $17.2 billion in stimulus money while switching to digital record-keeping. Peter Naismith called his physician in his Akron office thirty-seven times during a five-day span to retrieve his medical records. ""I needed them to get an MRI,"" the 53-year-old Naismith asserts. ""The receptionist kept putting me off because my doctor still has paper files,"" he says, ""It's my contention that they couldn't find them. I suspect that my records were lost somewhere in their office."" Naismith works as a police officer and is familiar with electronic record-keeping. ""All of our criminal files are computerized and easy to find. Why couldn't they have done that with my medical records? I told my doctor to get rid of the paper files and he just tried to laugh it off. I wasn't in the mood for laughing as I might have a tumor, and without my records, the hospital won't do the MRI.'' While Naismith's predicament isn't that unusual, fortunately it's becoming less common. A dramatic transition to EMR software packages is already occurring in physician's offices all across America in anticipation of the U.S. Congress spending $17.2 billion in stimulus monies devoted to the now mandated move to paperless. Naismith's physician still scribbles prescriptions on tiny scrip sheets that can easily get lost and are difficult to read because, according to Naismith, ""The guy writes like a first-grader who needs to get his knuckles rapped."" Other patients unwilling to be quoted publicly mention forgetting to tell the doctor about past conditions and therefore getting the wrong medication, or filling out medical forms until their fingers ache. But as the ghost of the Christmas future once said pointedly in the pages of A Christmas Carol -- ""It doesn't have to be this way, my dear Mr. Scrooge."" Indubitably it doesn't. Even a recent survey published in The New England Journal of Medicine reported that doctors who control patient management electronically attest that such record-keeping helps improve the quality and the timeliness of care. Besides improving care, going paperless also reduces errors and is playing an increasing role in cost containment – the very object of Obama's health care reform in the first place. But there's also a financial incentive. According to the mandate now in place, physicians in compliance by January 1, 2011 (well before the 2014 cut-off date) are eligible for reimbursement for purchases of EMR software packages if they purchase a federally certified package, and can establish 80% usage in their practices. Considering that there's a three to six month learning curve in the transition (unless the physician is also a computer whiz) the rush to buy compliant packages is already on. The digital world of record-keeping beckons."
20,President Obama's Georgetown Speech Offers Hope,politics," One of Obama's ""five pillars"" is health care reform. A pillar of health care reform could be said to be EMR software in every physician's office – a surefire cost-saving measure. On Tuesday, April 14 2009, President Barack Obama offered a message of hope at Georgetown University. He did warn of a period of future economic hardship for Americans, but also praised ""signs of hope"" in the national economy which were the result, in large measure, of his administration's $787-billion economic stimulus legislation, which has already ""spurred consumer demand"" and partially restored the flow of credit so crucial to businesses. ""By no means are we out of the woods just yet. But from where we stand, for the very first time, we are beginning to see glimmers of hope,"" Obama said, ""And beyond that, way off in the distance, we can see a vision of America's future that is far different than our troubled economic past."" Obama's vision won't be established on the shifting sands of Clinton & Bush-era deregulatory fiscal policies, but instead be anchored on something firmer. He alluded to Jesus and the deity's Sermon on the Mount, found in the Bible. ""We cannot rebuild this economy on the same pile of sand. We must build our house upon a rock,"" Obama said, and he wasn't necessarily referring to the first Pope. The rock-buttressed foundation the President referred to will have ""five pillars."" One of them is especially pertinent: Enacting his health care reforms to lower costs for families and businesses. U.S. health care remains beset with problems. Spiraling costs have removed the safety net of health insurance from forty-eight million Americans, while millions more are left in a gray category of ""under-insured,"" a precarious predicament that leaves patients in sometimes equally dire straits. Those who are insured may receive care, but it's often compromised. Inefficient and potentially lethal in itself, without the reassuring presence of state-of-the-art EMR software systems, antiquated systems of record-keeping and data collection hold sway – likely placing additional millions at risk while contributing mightily to cost increases that seem to never quit. President Obama's health care reform package promises big changes for the better in its mandate: U.S. physicians must begin using EMR systems to process their patient data by 2014. In fact, January 1, 2011, is the day essential and long-overdue reform truly begins – as stimulus reimbursement for EMR package purchases kicks off on that super day. But the timing is urgent. It's now, in 2009, that proactive physicians and hospitals will begin the ""gold rush"" toward cost savings and efficiency in ever increasing numbers, despite a persistent recession. There's also the 80% usage rate to consider, and it's prudent to remember that the mandate calls for this viable percentage to be a fixture and to be in effect – learning curve windows on EMR packages are conservatively 3-6 months. So yes, as another Easter passes there is hope for the U.S. health care industry – perhaps more than a mere glimmer."

1,Obama's Hundred Days,politics," April 29 isn't a date that would normally stand out on the calendar.  This year it falls on a Wednesday, almost but not quite marking the end of the month.  We suspect that most years, April 29 would slip by without most of us taking any particular notice of it. But this year, perhaps for the only time ever, April 29 will be received with great fanfare.  This year, April 29 will have its day in the sun, temporarily rivaling more famous dates like July 4 or October 31.  Why?  Because this April 29 is the 100th day of Barack Obama's presidency.  It marks the end of Obama's Hundred Days, CNN plans hours upon hours of special marathon coverage, modeled after its Election Day mediapalooza.  No doubt every columnist at every newspaper in the country (or those that haven't gone out of business yet, anyway) will use the occasion to opine on the meaning of it all.  Hundred Days' report cards will be issued; Obama's performance will be weighed against our expectations of him. So why do we attach so much importance to the president's First Hundred Days? (So much importance that we capitalize First Hundred Days!)  Mainly it's Franklin Roosevelt's fault.  One of the most influential and important presidents in US history, Roosevelt used the first hundred days of his presidency to push a staggering package of legislation through Congress – fifteen separate bills that together formed the basis of the New Deal, revolutionizing modern American society.  After passing those fifteen bills, Congress adjourned on June 16, 1933 – exactly 100 days after it began.  Ever since, the beginning of every president's term has been judged against FDR's standard.  And just about every president has failed to stack up. But is that standard really fair?  Roosevelt took office at the height of the Great Depression; of all American presidents, only Lincoln entered the White House facing a graver crisis.  The depth of the crisis confronting the country in 1933 gave Roosevelt a tremendous mandate; a battered Congress was prone to give him anything and everything he wanted.  Of course, Obama too entered the presidency at a moment of great crisis, promising great change.  But we're still not facing a situation nearly as dire as the or Civil War; politics continues to operate more or less as normal, with congresspeople of both parties more than willing to obstruct Obama's objectives.  Still, Obama has managed to pass a significant chunk of his agenda; only time will tell whether it pays dividends for the United States.  One hundred days is surely too soon to judge."
2,Now the Obama Administration is proposing big changes,politics," Ambition is a wonderful thing when it pays off. How many times have we watched a slugger walk up to the plate, look the pitcher in the eye, and lift an arm to point where the ball is going to land somewhere in the next state, only to strike out? Well, the new President has just stepped up to the plate. We have the TARP bailout plan carried over from the last Administration. The new Stimulus Package has been passed. Now comes the budget. Anyone doing the math will find the number of zeros adding on to the deficit reaching epidemic proportions. It seems the country is proposing to plunge even deeper into debt when it’s already in a recession, fighting two wars - one in Iraq and the other in Afghanistan - and facing a meltdown in the banking and car industries. Unemployment is at historic highs and, if the trend continues, the amount of tax collected will fall. Yet, the President is proposing major reform of the health care service. Is he biting off more than he can chew? According to the latest figures, there are around 306 million people in the US and nearly 15%, that’s about 45 million, do not have any kind of medical insurance. What do they do? Well, when they fall ill, they crowd into the emergency rooms and seek help from the underfunded public hospital system. There are two results. The first is that people wait too long before they go to hospital and, when they get there, receive an inadequate level of care. The second is that it places a serious financial burden on everyone. The emergency room in a conventional hospital has to cover its costs but, when the uninsured patients have no money, the only option is to increase the charges to the insured patients. This burden has been particularly hard on the employers’ health plans and, to offset the increased premiums, employers have been passing some of the cost on to their employees - a forced pay cut. The public hospitals must beg for increased funding from local, state and federal bodies where budgets are already in deficit. There is a new mood in government to do something about health insurance. In effect, the ideal plan would be to move to a single-payer plan which is the norm in the rest of the world, but that would upset too many vested interests. So the current plan is to go for a major safety net for all currently uninsured. There is already a plan for uninsured children. The Administration is proposing an element in the new budget to move all uninsured adults on to a national plan. If this can pass through into law, which is not certain given the opposition of the Republican party, it will provide a bolt hole for all currently insured. If the premiums on private health insurance continue to rise, more will move on to the national plan which, over time, could produce a single-payer system in the US. Now that would be an interesting social experiment."
3,I Spoke Forgetting About Brooklyn,politics," The other day I came across a few of my articles about Jews. While there were a few nice comments, the bulk of the articles were nothing but one negative word after another. I didn't name any particular Jew; I just dumped the entire race in my little boat and started paddling. As I was reading one of the more degrading articles, my mind went back forty years to a time when I was living in Brooklyn. I was walking up Livonia Street to the small apartment where I was staying. Some guys in big felt hats, expensive overcoats and polished shoes started coming out of buildings, alley ways and getting out of big sedans and walking with me. Since it was in the middle of the day and I could see golfers as they passed by my place, I knew I was day dreaming and I wasn't really back in Brooklyn; nevertheless, the sights, sounds and smells of Livonia Street were just as real as the Inverrary Country Club where I now live. The problem wasn't being back in Brooklyn walking up Livonia Street; it was the fellows who had decided to join me. They were all Jews, dead Jews. Some had died or been killed before I was born; but I knew about them, and I was hoping that these Jews had never heard of me or the Internet. I would sooner slap a hunger tiger than piss off Abraham Reles or his pal Martin Buggsy Goldstein. I didn't have to ponder the Internet question very long. A guy behind me said, ""Hey, Buggsy. Is this the rat who wrote that Jews were natural born cowards?"" I stopped walking and turned to see who was asking Goldstein this question and ended up almost nose to nose with Harry Strauss, who to my knowledge wasn't related to Levi. A fellow who knows he's dreaming shouldn't be scared. He most certainly shouldn't be scared of men he knew were dead, but I was scared. There was even a guy I had known and done business with, Joey Gallo, who had joined the parade, but Joey wasn't going to cause me no pain, he was just there to say I told you so you redneck piece of shit. The thing that made Joey so special was he caused you to rethink your opinion of guys like Tony Spilotro. In comparison, Tony was an easy going prince of a guy. Then there were the uptown Jews like Arnold Rothstein and Meyer Lansky who had joined us, but they wouldn't chance getting my blood on their silk scarves to teach me a lesson in manners, they'd let Strauss handle it if Reles or Goldstein didn't want to do it just for kicks. In the event you'd enjoy meeting Jews who guys like me didn't call Jews, we called them Mr. because they killed guys like me just to stay in practice, I suggest you read Tough Jews by Rich Cohen. Regardless of your opinion of the Jewish race, I assure you this little book will alter that opinion to some extent. This I can guarantee, the next time I call a Jew a coward, I'll name that Jew, I'll try not to let my mouth take on more territory than my ass can handle. It's sad that there are people like me who love to hate. There's no reason for me to hate. I can count on one hand all the people who I have a right to hate and none of those people are Jews. A couple of Jews have given me a job when no one else would, but for some reason I can't grab hold of that. But every article that has an anti-Jewish slant pulls at me like a giant magnet. I guess the bottom line is, if you simply must hate a race, hate the Jews because they're better equipped mentally to deal with hate than most other races, and you just might live long enough to get some help."
4,Politic in Some Different Views for Society Education,politics," Many people in the world especially they who have never felt higher education than elementary school, even have never gone to school consider that politic is always dirty, not good, and not useful. Precisely it’s not only because of education level, but sometimes also social condition in each nation. Because of that reason, they become an apathetic in political news, opinion, or other events related to the government such as the election, the most events that each country holds in the world. Since politic definition is known with wrong meaning, it’s necessary for us to know what politic is. So, for good knowledge, I’ll take its definition from different views among the famous figure in some countries. According to Aristotle, one of the western philosophers, the definition of politic is everything in its character can apply the kindness in the society. This definition includes all of society’s matter such as the government, liberty, justice, property, rights, law and the enforcement of a legal code which can bring prosperity for everyone in society. If we adopt an idea from Al-Banna, one of the Middle East reformers, he said that politic is everything used to think about internal and external society’s matter. Political internal is to manage government matter, to explain its functions, to elaborate upon the obligation and rights, to do the monitoring for government, if they do the kindness, it should be submissive, and criticism for the mistake. While political external is to keep independence and nation freedom, bring it to reach the goal that can give it position in the midst of other countries, and free it from suppression and intervention other parties in it matters. Both of them noted politic as a way of getting kindness. Is there anything wrong with all definition? The answer is no. Politic is like a knife, you can use it for kindness or badness, it’s depend much on executor’s hands, but basically, politic is absolutely a mean for kindness. The election, as the biggest event on each country, needs a good political knowledge of all people. U.S is an example country which has the biggest number of citizens who care about the election. Another example is Palestine. There are a lot of citizens who care about the leader of their nation. Both of U.S and Palestine have different background on what reason causes the citizen care about the election. U.S with a big numbers of educated people and Palestine with their country’s condition besides good education too. But there is more country that still can’t apply the political education for its citizen and become apathetic. Some choose abstention while others make worst case. This is a good time for us to learn more about politic, so that we can do more kindness for our society to become better nation. Although there are other opinions about politic definition from different view, but we can use only two ideas above because most of definitions also give a kindness purpose for politic explanation. Understanding the politic and you will get better knowledge."
5,"Political Campaign, Between Idealist and Reality",politics," Politics, as the process of groups of people make decisions. The common term is applied to behavior within civil governments, but actually politics has been observed in all human group interactions, including corporate, academic, and religious institutions. It consists of ""social relations involving authority or power"" and refers to the regulation of a political unit. Also for the methods and tactics used to formulate and apply policy. In democracies, political campaigns often refer to electoral campaigns, wherein representatives are chosen or referenda are decided. Political campaigns also include organized efforts to alter policy within any institution or organization. The message of the campaign is what ideas that the candidate wants to share with the voters. The message often consists of several talking points about policy issues. The points summarize the main ideas of the campaign and are repeated frequently in order to create a lasting impression with the voters. In many elections, the opposition party will try to get the candidate ""off message"" by bringing up policy or personal questions that are not related to the talking points. Most campaigns prefer to keep the message broad in order to attract the most potential voters. A message that is too narrow can alienate voters or slow the candidate down with explaining details. Modern political campaigns have set new standards for how successful campaigns are conducted day-to-day. The campaign is conducted in what would seem to the public like pseudo-military style, with a strict chain of command, zero tolerance for certain prohibited actions, and an extended daily schedule that starts early and ends much later than most ""day jobs."" An informational campaign is also applied to raise public awareness and support for the positions of a candidate (or his party). It is more intense than a paper campaign, which consists of little more than filing the necessary papers to get on the ballot, but is less intense than a competitive campaign, which aims to actually win election to the office. An informational campaign typically focuses on low-cost outreach such as news releases, getting interviewed in the paper, making a brochure for door to door distribution, organizing poll workers, etc. Political campaign as the way for telling people about vision and program of the election contestant has an idealist concept. For example, in the Indonesia Election of 2009 since this moment is a campaign issue, most of party candidates speak loud about peace. That’s the idealist. In fact, most of supporters or the voters don’t keep this side like they said before. They bring disturbance and even crime. Political campaigns have existed as long as there have been informed citizens to campaign amongst. Often mass campaigns are started by the less privileged or anti-establishment viewpoints. Not all democratic elections involve political campaigning. Indeed, some democratic elections specifically rule out campaigning on the grounds that campaigning may compromise the democratic character of the elections perhaps because of campaigns' susceptibility to the influence of money, or to the influence of special interest groups. Perhaps, this time is a hard work to find the best political campaign concept."
6,Understanding the Election in Indonesia for Good,politics," An election is a decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold formal office. This is the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy fills offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local government. This process is also used in many other private and business organizations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations. The politics of Indonesia takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Indonesia is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two People's Representative Councils. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The 1945 constitution provided for a limited separation of executive, legislative, and judicial power. The governmental system has been described as ""presidential with parliamentary characteristics."" Following the Indonesian 1998 Revolution and the resignation of President Suharto, several political reforms were set in motion. Elections in Indonesia have taken place since 1955. At a national level, Indonesian people elect a head of state – the president – and a legislature. The president is elected for a five-year term, as are the 550-member People's Representative Council (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat, DPR) and the 128-seat Regional Representatives Council (Dewan Perwakilan Daerah). A constitutional reform process has been underway since 1999, and has already produced several important changes. Among these are term limits of up to two five-year terms for the President and Vice President, and measures to institute checks and balances. The highest state institution is the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), whose functions included electing the president and vice president (since 2004 the president is elected directly by the people), establishing broad guidelines of state policy, and amending the constitution. The 695-member MPR includes all 550 members of the People's Representative Council (DPR) (the House of Representatives) plus 130 ""regional representatives"" elected by the twenty-six provincial parliaments and sixty-five appointed members from societal groups. The DPR, which is the premier legislative institution, originally included 462 members elected through a mixed proportional/district representational system and thirty-eight appointed members of the armed forces (TNI) and police (POLRI). TNI/POLRI representation in the DPR was ended before the general election in 2004 and will end in the MPR in 2009. Societal group representation in the MPR was eliminated in 2004 through further constitutional change. Military domination of regional administration is gradually breaking down, with new regulations prohibiting active-duty officers from holding political office. Having served as rubberstamp bodies in the past, the DPR and MPR have gained considerable power and are increasingly assertive in oversight of the executive branch. Under constitutional changes in 2004, the MPR became a bicameral legislature, with the creation of the Dewan Perwakilan Daerah (DPD), in which each province is represented by four members, although its legislative powers are more limited than those of the DPR. Through his appointed cabinet, the president retains the authority to conduct the administration of the government."
7,Obama's Strategy on Afghanistan,politics," Obama's Strategy on Afghanistan By Jerome Grossman It is difficult, even impossible, to accept President Obama’s ""New strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan"" as described by him in a formal speech on March 27. It fails by imperial and non-imperial standards. First the imperial: Chalmers Johnson, a former CIA agent, reports in his book Nemesis: ""The Carter administration deliberately provoked the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan….. In his 1996 memoir, former CIA Director Robert Gates acknowledges that the American intelligence services began to aid the anti-Soviet mujahideen guerillas not after the Russian invasion but six months before it…. President Carter's purpose was to provoke a full-scale Soviet military intervention……….. to tie…….down the USSR."" Will an expanded military effort in Afghanistan tie down the U.S. as it did the USSR? Obama plans a U.S. military effort in Afghanistan lasting at least five years in a country 50% larger than Iraq in area and population. The NATO allied forces are token in size and commitment and rarely leave their base camps. A serious U.S. military effort will require at least 250,000 troops tied down in Afghanistan/Pakistan. Will America be unable to react to other challenges as they arise especially its obligations, to protect Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, to deter Iran from a nuclear program, to support Pakistan from collapse; etc.. The invasion of Iraq could be justified on imperial grounds because it is strategically situated in the heart of the largest concentration of oil in the world. Afghanistan has no comparable resource, one of the poorest countries, no industry, little farming, rugged terrain, a land of banditry and bribery. The adventure fails from a non- imperial perspective. Obama says ""That country will again be a base for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they possibly can."" None of the 19 people who perpetrated the September 11 criminal tragedy were Afghan or Taliban. Fifteen of them were Saudi. There are no Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan any longer. Osama bin Laden and what is left of his crew is in hiding somewhere in the wilderness of Pakistan. The Al Qaeda operation is scattered and disorganized. Yes, another 19 thugs could infiltrate the U.S. and kill Americans, but sending an army into Afghanistan is not going to prevent another such criminal act. In fact, the hyped war in Afghanistan is more likely to divert us from protecting ourselves against another September 11."
8,Power - What Good Is It?,politics," We all want power, although not everyone freely admits it. It is common to think what one would do if he or she was a king or the president. We imagine that we would do good things; better than what is being done now. We think of power in personal terms too, as when we imagine that enough money or control over others would enable us to solve most of our problems. The latter may be partly true. With enough money you probably could solve many of the problems you have now. But it's also likely that you would have even more new problems. As for our ""if I was emperor"" fantasies, what makes us think that all the presidents and kings of the world haven't shared our thoughts? They too undoubtedly planned to use their power for good. And in their position we would be subject to the same corrupting influences as them. How, then, do we arrive at a power which is good and useful? We'll get back to that in a moment. First, let's look at some of the specific tools of power. The Tools Of Power Money is an obvious one. It is easy to imagine what could be done with large amounts of it. On the other hand, I have seen money come into peoples lives and wreak havoc. Not only did it not bring the beneficial changes they anticipated, but it put them further in debt and more stressed out. I have also seen people try to help others with money, only to make matters worse. Having money without proper knowledge and understanding is like having a car without a steering wheel - it's a wreck waiting to happen. Suppose you study subliminal influence over others, and learn powerful techniques. Then what? You use your secret techniques to win the love of a woman or man, but perhaps the relationship adds only pain to your life. Or you use your mind power to get a job, and learn years later that you not only hate it, but you passed up a career you would have enjoyed. Isn't it common to find that our best-laid plans often get us not what we want, but more trouble? There are other tools of power. Political connections, knowledge, and charisma come to mind. But they all have the same limitations that are hinted at above. Obtaining them is like putting more guns and knives in the hands of an infant - as long as we are in some ways like that child. This gets us to the real source of a good and useful power. Self Knowledge You cannot be powerful in a good sense without a high degree of self knowledge. You have to first exercise a kind of personal power to observe yourself honestly and come to understand who you are, what you need, and the nature of your relationship to the rest of the world. This is easy to understand intellectually if we use a simple example, like a man who has the power to build a kingdom - but not the wisdom to see that it is really a personal hell. One definition of power is ""The ability or capacity to perform or act effectively."" This view sees that the ""engine"" of a car is meaningless without a steering wheel and good driver. It raises the natural question, ""effective for what?"" In other words, we have to truly know what our highest values are, or the specific manifestations of power become self-destructive and destructive of others as well. To return to the metaphor of the infant with a knife: He does not understand his own body, or the danger of a knife to that body and others, or how to use it and for what purposes. He has to grow and learn more before it is appropriate for him to have a knife. We are always that infant in some sense, because we too can have the tools of power put in our hands before we are ready to safely and wisely use them. If what money you have now is not used wisely, why would having more change that? If what influence you have over others has not brought about great results, why would more be better for you or them? If the knowledge you have has not been very helpful in bettering the life of yourself or others, why would knowing even more of these things improve the odds? The personal power to understand and be in charge of oneself is where we have to begin. Getting tools we are not ready for will only cause more harm. Seeking a better understanding of ourselves and the world is the path to true power."
9,Would The Government Printing Money Cause Inflation?,politics," We’re in a recession. A recession occurs when there is a shortage of money circulating in the economy. Money gets a bit too scarce for people to be able to buy all the goods that industry wants to sell them and all the ""services"" government wants to force them to pay for (through the process of extortion known as "" tax""). The obvious, simple solution then is for government to print more money and spend it into circulation. We’re told the economy is, say, $50 billion short of dollars. Okay, so the logical answer is for the government to print $50 billion and spend it into circulation, for example by paying pensions, financing roads, schools, hospitals, grants for industry and reducing income tax at the same time. ""Oh, you can’t do that!"" we are told. ""Why not?"" We ask. ""Because of INFLATION!"" Comes the reply, inflation being this demonic thing that magically heaves up from the bowels of hell the moment anyone dares whisper the notion of government printing some money. Well, let’s take a look at that. Inflation is a situation in which TOO MUCH MONEY has been printed and put into circulation. Simplify this a bit and imagine an economy in which there are a billion items for sale. If there are a billion dollars in circulation in that economy, the average cost of every item will be a dollar. If you suddenly increase the number of dollars in circulation to 2 billion but the number of items produced and offered for sale remains a billion (there is no increase in production to match the increase in circulating money), the average price of each item will increase to 2 dollars. The value, the SPENDING POWER of your dollar will have halved. Okay, in essence, that’s inflation. It comes about not because government prints money but because government prints TOO MUCH MONEY. We can also see that rising prices and a fall in the buying power of the dollar are signs that we have inflation and too much money is being circulated. Therefore all government has to do when it prints money is monitor the economy and work towards KEEPING THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE DOLLAR STABLE. If some inflation starts to show up, the government holds off on printing money and works to get more production going until the purchasing power of money stabilizes. It is not beyond the wit of Man, or even government, to do this. Currently we ""control inflation"" using the crude mechanism of interest rates and we’ve had nothing BUT inflation! Evidently the hit-and-miss guesswork of tinkering with the cost of borrowing is okay but direct control of money supply by a government answerable to the electorate isn’t (and nobody asks: 'what on earth does the cost of borrowing have to do with money supply?')! Once all of us understand these simple principles we can all keep an eye on things and make sure the government is behaving itself. This of course would require something of a change of operating basis as we are presently kept in the dark and PREVENTED from understanding simple principles so that nobody can tell what government is up to. Truth of the matter is that SOMEONE has to print money and get it into circulation. The only way to get it into circulation is to LEND it to people (a VERY bad idea, if you read my free books you will understand why) GIVE it to people (can be good if done in the form of grants and effective measure to increase production) or PAYING PEOPLE to produce things such as building roads, bridges, space ships, whatever the society needs and wants. Of course, as my free books will tell you, this is not how things are done at present. At present, government does not print our money, which is a massive goof on the part of government. Instead it gives the banks the privilege of printing it – an even bigger goof. The banks get it into circulation by lending it to government, industry and thee and me – a whopping great howler for which somebody should be shot because it has caused generations of utter misery. The INFLATION bogeyman is trotted out every time someone suggests government could quite easily end the recession and bring on a boom by printing some money and CAREFULLY spending it into the economy. It is trotted out in order to put us off the whole idea – so that the privilege of money creation can remain with the banking cartels and they can go on milking the entire planet of its wealth."
10,Recession – what should be done?,politics," One thing you can be sure about is that you will NEVER fully understand a situation if you rely on the press for your information. Helping you understand things is not the role of the press. The role of the press, one of its roles at any rate (another, by way of example, is to drive business down on the mental health industry by freaking everybody out), is to confuse and demoralize the citizenry by spreading alarm and dismay. That much is self evident because one can observe that that is what it does day in and day out. If someone does something day in and day out, it is fair to conclude that that is its purpose, is it not? So you will never for instance fully understand the recession and our current economic plight by reading newspapers or watching television, just as you will never get a clear picture, to cite a couple of examples, of exactly why we wage war on the people of Afghanistan or Iraq or why people being treated for depression with anti-depressant drugs get depressed and kill themselves and other people. The press just ain’t gonna give you the straight dope. Apart from anything else it doesn’t HAVE the straight dope usually. However, we can at least get a vague idea that something is going on even though the causes of it, those responsible, its exact extent and consequences are not going to be truthfully, accurately or thoroughly communicated. Thus we can conclude that we are in a recession and this is a Bad Thing and this somehow is related to interest rates, which is the cost of borrowing and somehow the cost of borrowing from the bank relates to money supply. This Bad Thing somehow means we’re all a bit strapped and businesses will go bust. Suddenly the press is full of alarming horror stories of businesses going bust and every business that goes bust blames this mysterious invisible SATANIC FORCE called the Recession even when, one suspects, in some cases the cause might actually be bad business management. We conclude too that for some reason the economy is very short of money – about £500 billion, apparently, for the British economy alone! This has some connection with the CREDIT CRUNCH, another Satanic Force that came about when the banks for some reason decided to stop lending the rest of us money because we had ""borrowed too much."" All this appears to be out of anybody’s control. Presumably money comes to us through an Act of God and not, as we suspected, because human being print it. If it were a simple matter of a human being printing it, then the solution would be a simple one: have human beings print some more and get it into circulation FAST while we still have any industry left. Evidently though, it’s not that simple: the whole thing is shrouded in a MYSTERY only comprehensible to a priesthood known as EXPERTS who comprehend the impenetrable script and sacred tongue of a quasi-science known as economics and it isn’t under anybody’s control in any case actually. The recession just sort of happened because some bankers, whose names we’ve already forgotten, did something or other confusing with some bank accounts and that evidently threatens to bring down global civilization. Well how did we get into a situation where the greed of a few bank managers on one side of the planet can cause some honest Joe to lose his job or have his business repossessed on the other side of the planet? How come a private business which is supposed, we are told, to look after people’s money, has so much influence on our fortunes, more apparently than our own government. We would think it pretty strange if some other part of the private sector, such as greengrocers could affect everyone’s fortunes by mucking about with the price of vegetables. We would think it even stranger if government then devoted itself at our expense to making sure that, at all costs, the greengrocers were looked after even if it meant a few of us going hungry. What’s going on? Well. Check out my blogs and I’ll tell you!"
11,Does Religion Cause War? Part Three.,politics," How does a group founded with the goal to do good works wind up as a vehicle for murder and pillage? To sum it up in a nutshell, it goes like this: A group is founded with some good intention or other and a policy built around that good intention. The basic purpose and policy drive its actions. It’s a good group, people of good will like it and join it. It’s quite well run so it prospers and gains influence. The vast majority of human being are sane (i.e., honest and constructive in motivation). They tend to get along and where they form the policy-making bodies of groups or set the group agenda, such groups tend to stay more or less on the rails of their original good intentions. A small minority of human beings are not sane.They are destructive in intent, even though that intent is often masked. By ""masked"" I mean that there is a disparity between what they SAY and what they DO and they will claim the most noble motives while committing the most heinous acts.This confuses honest men of good will who, being of good will, are naturally generous in their opinion of their fellows and assume all their fellows are of good will also. They are consequently often slow to twig what they are actually looking at when they see criminals at work (dead bodies in the streets, cities on fire, children with limbs blown off, little things like that.). The insane minority are a liability to have around and overtly or covertly tend to mess things up for the sane majority. They are, in other words, criminal. The criminal minority, being criminal, do not baulk at deceit, or theft or worse. They too assume that others are of similar inclination to themselves and conceive of their fellows as untrustworthy and dangerous. When an honest group prospers and gains influence, the criminal is attracted to it for the opportunities it presents to carry out criminal works such as  a.) get rich without the inconvenience of having to earn it b.) become powerful; c.) inhibit, restrict or destroy others. That group might be a religion, a political group, a government, police force and so forth. If devious and clever enough, the criminal can pull off his primary objective: the achievement of a powerful and influential position within the group. He then has the resources and channels of influence of the group at his disposal for the achievement of his own nefarious goals. This does not mean that all men in powerful positions are criminals, the majority are not. However, those positions are flames to a moth and where a criminal personality does get himself into such a position, the rest of humanity is in trouble. The Spanish Inquisition is one primary example. I’m sure you can think of plenty of contemporary examples. Once in influential positions, the criminal can strengthen his own position and weaken those of more decently motivated men. He is not hampered by qualms about Truth, Honesty or the need to respect the rights of others. When a criminal or group of criminals gain control of the executive body of a group and are able to alter or reinterpret its policies (""What Jesus really meant when he said love thy neighbor was……"") and dictate its actions, the group will then act as a criminal group. The group becomes a criminal group even though the majority of its members are sane men and NOT criminal. The criminals that have seized control of the group’s agenda engage in all manner of deceit, false reports, and reinterpretations of original policy to justify whatever criminal enterprise they now wish the group to engage in, such as the murder of ""unbelievers"" and seizure of their property, the invasion of a foreign country to nick its gold/ food/women/oil etc. Original policy and the original founding spirit of the group become reinterpreted, explained away, edited out of the scriptures, obscured by gobbledygook, taken out of context and what-have-you. The sane members of the group become very confused and start to feel a bit batty themselves. The sane man finds himself, without quite ever understanding how it ended up that way, in a war where he is expected to kill other human beings he has never met in the name of a god who told him repeatedly (or so he thought) not to kill. Summary Where a group has moved away from its original ethos and towards a more violent, covetous or morally lax position, you know that criminals have moved in on and suborned its policy-making, agenda-setting bodies. A handful of criminals can thus wind up controlling a nation of millions of honest people. Such a nation will engage in criminal acts such as murder and mayhem that are normally anathema to the basic social instincts, mores and customs of the majority of its members. Thus a group can act insane when the vast majority of its members are sane. It can act criminal even though most of its members are honest people. It can engage in mass slaughter even though the majority of its people would not so much as kick a dog. Thus humanity as a whole can appear insane even while the vast majority of human beings are sane. Having found themselves party to acts they know are wrong, good men begin to feel degraded. The nation or race loses pride in itself and begins to decay. Humanity is not bestial, savage or criminal. But a small minority of its members are. Man’s weakness lies in his inability to detect and keep from power that small minority. And herein lies an answer to war and to the instability and short-lived nature of civilizations"
12,Does Religion Cause War? Part Two,politics," In part one of this discussion, we established that many of the wars of the past century were not religious in nature and their motivation was in fact about as non-religious as one could get. Religion is not the common denominator of all war. Nor, for that matter is atheism. We should really extend our original question to ""does religion also cause terrorism, torture or indeed any acts that violate the life, liberty and human rights of the individual?"" Recent history tells us pretty emphatically that while religion has often been used as an excuse for barbaric conduct, men inclined towards act of barbarism have found other justifications as well as religion to make their slaughter of their fellow human beings appear perfectly reasonable or ""unavoidable."" Hitler’s ethnic cleansing, for example, actually had ""science"" as its excuse - the bogus science of Eugenics. The fact that religion is used as an EXCUSE for an atrocity is no more a reason to condemn religion than the use by the unscrupulous of science as their excuse should prompt us to abandon science. What men need to knock off is buying the ""reasons"" put forth by some loony for common assault, grievous bodily harm, murder, arson, extortion and mugging. All this nevertheless begs the question as to what is happening when a religion apparently becomes the driving, motivating, justifying force behind the collective move of one large human group to do violence to another large human group. How does a religious group wind up pursuing policies and actions completely contrary to the original teachings of its founder and, indeed, the instincts of its members? Very few religions were built upon a message of violence. Almost all began life and achieved broad popular acceptance on the basis of ""maybe we should all try to treat one another better."" If you look closely at the original ""horse’s mouth"" words of religious founders, you’ll find this to be the case. This corruption of a group purpose occurs not only in the field of religion. Many groups, despite being founded upon high ideals and good intentions, operate a million miles distant from that original intent. Democratic governments for example, frequently wind up bludgeoning their own electorate with truncheons and refine all manner of covert ways to chip away at their citizenry. Socialist governments wind up standing the workers before firing squads; revolutions intended to liberate the people require revolutions to liberate the people from the revolutionary government; resistance groups formed to defend the people against an oppressive power, descend into extortion, gangsterism and the knee-capping of teenagers, with the people they were formed to protect as their primary victims; ….. and so on. What happens to a group that drives it off the rails and along a route it never intended to take? A group founded by sane personalities, men of goodwill, and run by men of good will, remains a group of good will as long as men of good will have control of its policy-making, agenda-setting apparatus, whatever form that apparatus may take. Its intent will not be destructive and its conduct will not be criminal. Its degree of success or error will depend upon the intelligence of the people making its dynamic decisions but its INTENT and motivation will, like any sane person’s, remain social and it will try to correct antisocial conduct made in error. But how does a group turn actively criminal? How does a religion founded upon a renunciation of worldly baubles become a money grubbing corporation? How does a creed whose basic tenets are non-violent find justification for torture, carpet-bombing, terrorism and other acts of sadism in the ""well, what He really meant by thou shalt not kill was thou shalt not kill Believers…"" of its re-interpreted scriptures? We’ll answer that question in Part Three."
13,Does Religion Cause War? Part One,politics," One often hears the lazy argument that ""Religion"" is responsible for Man’s wars, the implication being that if we got rid of religion, all would be peace and harmony. Presumably then, if all men abandoned the notion that they are spirits inhabiting a material body and conceived of themselves as mere animals fashioned by chance from mud our troubles would be over and we’d all be a lot happier. This is of course untrue and does not correspond with an observation of history, nor of present reality. It also displays a degree of fogginess about what one means by the word ""religion"" Religions vary considerably. There are pantheisms (the belief in many gods) monotheisms (the belief in one God who created all) and religions that worship no gods at all, such as Buddhism or modern Scientology. At the far end of the spectrum there are even religions that do not conceive man to be an immortal soul even while life is considered to be nevertheless spiritual in essence. Some religions such as Christianity stress faith, while faith has no place at all in others –Scientology and Buddhism being cases in point. One should note too, while one is discussing paradigms based on Faith, that  materialism remains unable to produce conclusive evidence for its basic assumption. That spirituality does not exist is a matter of belief, not evidence. One can of course produce evidence that the material universe exists and one can establish and prove its laws but this is not proof that that the material universe is all there is. The assertion that the material universe is all there is is neither scientific nor logical and is actually a statement of faith. Alright, so this vague undefined variable known as ""religion"" or ""faith"" is responsible for Man’s wars. Is it true? Well, I can think of a few recent conflicts or humanitarian cataclysms whose driving force was anything but religious. Hitler’s massacre of ethnic minorities, for instance: religions were often the victim of Nazi psychosis but they were not responsible for it. In fact it is now a matter of record that the drive behind Nazi mass slaughter came from German Psychiatry, the arch-champion of the man-is-mud hypothesis. The drive behind the Russian revolution and the Stalinist slaughter that followed it was anything but religious, deriving again from the materialism of communism and psychiatry. Ditto the civil war and ethnic cleansing in Yugoslavia. Ditto the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, with materialistic psychiatry the hidden motivator again. The Chinese invasion of Korea in1950 and the Korean War that followed also had little or nothing to do with religious issues. One had materialistic communist China on the one hand and the largely atheistic commercial imperialism of western nations on the other. The US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq were commerce-driven regardless of what justifications are concocted for it, while in the war in Vietnam, religion figured neither in the motivation nor rhetoric of either side. Not all war therefore is ""caused"" by ""religion."" Religious groups are however often the victim or target of it but not exclusively and not always. There is no evidence that by ""getting rid of religion"" one would ""get rid of war"" any more than there is evidence that by outlawing atheism or abandoning commerce there would be peace on Earth. Nor is there any evidence that an abandonment of spirituality would make society happier. On the contrary, our western society has become unhappier and more demoralized as it has become materialistic. You will probably find that the epidemic spread of drug abuse and crime on the one hand and the decline in man’s spirituality and even his sense of right and wrong follow commensurate curves. In the midst of material abundance, which theoretically should have made Man happier, we live out our days in an increasingly miserable Gomorrah of lost souls. Of course ""religion"" is a factor in the war in the Middle East and in justifications for their actions put forward by terrorist groups. And religion has been a factor in many a human conflict. It is true too that religious societies have not necessarily been happy ones either. In fact, a look at human history tells one that whether spiritual in outlook or materialistic in outlook, Man tends to have a hard time. From this one can conclude that humanity is still evolving its social forms and does not yet have all the answers. This is no reason to get apathetic about the whole thing and to abandon the effort to reason in favour of generalized, unworkable slogans. Indeed, we have every incentive to go on trying to get better at these things called society and civilization, if only through a sense of responsibility to our children who will inherit whatever dog’s breakfast we bequeath them. Getting better at managing human affairs requires that we knock off subscribing to broad, untrue, generalities such as ""religion is the cause of war"" or some such nonsense. Let’s look this thing over more carefully and see if we can get a bit more accurate about what exactly is getting us into trouble. Perhaps, if we do, we might as a species manage to comport ourselves with more dignity and kick the habit of following every psycho who seeks to persuade us to burn the skin off the children of people we have never met. I will continue this effort to apply reason to the matter of religion and war in the next essay in this series."
14,Exclusionary Rule? Get Rid Of It!,politics," The exclusionary rule need to be thrown out! This body of law basically says that evidence obtained illegally cannot be used in a criminal prosecution. The idea is that this will prevent the police and the justice system in general from illegally searching our homes and otherwise violating our rights, since they won't be able to use any evidence obtained in these ways. Unfortunately, in reality it prevents the truth from being presented in court. There is a better way. By the way, before thinking this is from some political slant, you should know that I have been labeled a ""right-winger,"" a ""bleeding heart liberal"" and more. Forget the labels. This is about what works! Why We Should Get Rid Of The Exclusionary Rule We understand the motivation for excluding evidence obtained through illegal searches. In a free society we want to  protect all people's rights, including those accused of breaking a law. It is also easy to imagine the following scenario: There is a murder, the killer has the gun, with the victims blood on it, as well as photos of the victim and more evidence - all in his house. This evidence is seized by police who decide to ignore the need for a search warrant. Thus it cannot be used as evidence in court, so the killer goes free. I have a question about this very realistic situation: Why can't the truth be the truth just because of how it was obtained? Anything that is evidence should always be allowed in a prosecution (and a defense). Why penalize the truth for the actions of an officer? Naturally we are concerned about the rights of people who are subjected to illegal searches. This is a violation of their rights, after all. But why not penalize the violators, rather than the truth and the public which needs to be protected. It's a simple solution, but I think if we regularly put police officers in jail for such violations of rights, they might reconsider such action. In fact, we might be better protected from such violations, Consider a  real-life scenario that sometimes happens now. Frustrated (or just bad) police officers break open a suspect's door and find good evidence of a crime. An officer waits with the criminal and evidence while another goes to get a warrant. They then produce a story that makes it all seem legal. The police don't have the right to commit crimes, even if they do it from a desire to catch criminals. However, under the current system, if such a plan is discovered, they'll often get suspensions, while the criminal goes free because under the exclusionary rule the evidence can't be used. And just a suspension for the offending officers? A better system is one that puts police who do such things in jail! Then officers will rarely commit such crimes. In the meantime, we this system wouldn't exclude evidence and ignore the truth in the case of the criminal - let him go to jail too! Let ALL who commit crimes be held fully responsible and we can safely get rid of the exclusionary rule."
15,Economic Stimulus Package For Your Personal Economy and Mental Mind Set!,politics," Economy, Weak Economy, Recession, Economic Stimulus Plan, Stimulus Package, Obama's Stimulus Package, Government Stimulus, Government Bail Out, Bank Bailout, and Auto Industry Bailout! Wait! Stop! Enough! My brain is being overwhelmed by these terms...
Are any of these words or phrases the focus of your daily conversations? This is just about all I hear from the moment I wake up until I go to bed and it's still ringing in my head while I sleep... I turn on the TV and what do you think I see and hear? I turn on the radio; chances are they are talking about the economy. Whenever I am engaged in a conversation it seems something about the economy usually comes up. GEEEEEZ already! Well I guess these are the times we are living in. It's likely that most of you reading this article have been directly or indirectly affected by the Economic Meltdown, some more than others... And yes, there are always Vultures out there taking advantage of other people's misfortune. What can you do about this overabundance mind numbing negative information about our economy? Well you can start by training your mind on the positives. First off, you need to stop talking about the economy in your daily conversations. Yes, the issues are real and you do have to deal with the reality of the effects. I will get into more on that later. Second, how is all this really affecting you and your family? Third, what are you doing to stimulate your own Personal Economy because waiting for the Governments helping hand is not the answer? First let's deal with the mind set we are in. You can't help but feel the world you live in is crumbling around you, that is of course if you're constantly tuned into, listening or reading the national media channels. Basically, most of what is broadcast is negative any-ways. That's what they call News, so there is a big problem! You may already be having a difficult time with life's issues as it stands, without the need to exacerbate your problems by having to hear about how bad the economy is morning, noon, night, and for some of us while we sleep(economic nightmares). For me personally this indication was very troubling until I came across an article Economic Stimulus Hypnosis by Wendy N. Lapidus-Saltz. She gives about ten quality practical things you can do today to improve your personal economy and ease your mind. You can start by: ""What to Tell Yourself in a Weak Economy?"" ""Start by getting rid of the words ""weak economy."" Replace them with: new economy, modern economy, or an economy that's re-building, re-starting, resurging, re-growing, refreshing, refocusing, and recharging itself."" Read more here on how to to recharge your economy and mind from the link below. In addition share this practice with your family, friends and people you associate with. They undoubtedly need a recharge of their personal economy and mind set too. Because the reality of the economy is there, that is, the stock market down day after day, foreclosures are mounting driving housing values down more and more each month, more business's are closing and reports of more job cuts are frequent. Another thing you can do is don't listen to any news for a few days or try to limit your current exposure dramatically. Give yourself a break from the news and see what this does for your frame of mind. Once you have your mental state back in order, you can focus clearly on more practical ways to stimulate your Economy in a pure monetary fashion. That's what you ultimately want to do right? Remember, you are the one in control of your ultimate financial destiny, not the government! So, continue to exercise with these suggestions and you will be ready for the next step in no time. In my next article, I will discuss ways you can start to improve your financial situation no matter how bleak it may seem. And no, I will not be talking about some get rich quick scheme. I am sure you have already come across hundred's of those that just wasted your time and actually ended up costing you money when they were supposed to make you money. So, until next time you have a Great Day and may your Personal Economy be prosperous for you and your family."
16,The Afghan Cemetery,politics," President Obama indicated through his press secretary that his administration would review its policy toward Afghanistan before making a decision about sending additional troops to fight in that country. Richard Holbrooke, his envoy, was in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region talking with leaders about how best to address the military and political situation. Obama also met with advisers at the Pentagon and the State Department. As recently as February 15, it was reported that Obama ""is refusing to be rushed into his first decision to send troops into combat…… questioning the time table, the mission and even the composition of the new forces."" However, Obama changed his mind on February 17, authorizing 17,000 additional soldiers and Marines for Afghanistan in what he described as an urgent bid to stabilize a deteriorating and neglected country, joining the 30,000 U.S. troops already there. Obama will be sending more troops to Afghanistan before he has begun to fulfill a promised rapid withdrawal of troops from Iraq. His order leaves crucial questions of strategy and tactics in Afghanistan unanswered until the strategy review is completed in April. Antiwar groups criticized Obama’s decision. Tom Andrews, director of Win Without War said, ""The president is committing these troops before he's determined what the mission is….. We need to avoid the slippery slope of military escalation."" The hasty decision ignored the many negative comments about the prospects for a U.S. victory. General David Petraeus has called Afghanistan ""the graveyard of empires"". Holbrooke reported ""a purely military victory is not achievable."" British historians furnish the details of their three failed military attempts to pacify the country. Twenty years after the troops of the Soviet Union pulled out of Afghanistan in defeat, the last Russian general to command them said on Feb 13 that the Soviets’ devastating experience, losing more than 15,000 troops in Afghanistan battling guerrillas ""is a dismal omen for the U.S."" Supporters of expanded U.S. military operations in Afghanistan cite the successes of the American military against the Taliban in October and November, 2001, immediately after the tragedy of September 11. However, that victory was accomplished by air power and bribery. Airpower prevented Taliban military operations. Hundred dollar bills bought warlord allies in this corrupt country whose main product is opium. Can we do it again, bribing our way through the drug lords? Perhaps. But history shows that Afghans don't stay bought and that the guerrillas motivated by rebellion and nationalism will fight the invaders for hundreds of years, making a bandit's living out of their tactics as they have done for time immemorial. Don’t think that General Petraeus does not know how to use money as a weapon. While he was installing the ""Surge"" in Iraq adding 30,000 fresh troops with great fanfare, he was quietly bribing the insurgent Sunnis with $20 dollar bills and rifles, paying 100,000 warriors to stop fighting the Americans."
17,President Barack Obama – What Does it Mean?,politics," This January, Barack Obama became the President of the United States. It was truly a remarkably moment in our history, for a wide variety of reasons. Obama’s inauguration marked a dramatic reversal in our national politics, likely ending a generation of conservative Republican domination in Washington. It brought a successful conclusion to a new kind of campaign, one based in savvy use of the internet for political fundraising and organizing. It captured the collective imagination of a whole generation of young Americans, inspiring youth political engagement in ways not seen in this country since the era of John F. Kennedy half a century ago. But more than anything, Barack Obama’s inaugural was remarkable—amazing, astounding, almost unbelievable, considering the long arc of American history—because a black man just became the President of the United States. The sheer enormity of the moment almost dwarfed the particulars of the day—the words of Obama’s excellent speech, the pageantry of the inaugural spectacle, even the immense numbers of people who turned out in Washington to watch the event in person. The sheer enormity of the moment was borne of the long and difficult history of race in this country. That story, of course, is much bigger than Barack Obama. Much movement toward racial progress occurred before Obama ever arrived on the scene, and much more remains to be made in the future. But it’s hard not to wonder whether what happened this year changed the meaning of race in America, forever. The youngest of Obama’s voters, those in their late teens and early twenties, may be the least surprised about what happened this year. They grew up in a world in which the rigid racial boundaries of our past were just that—a part of our past - something that they primarily learned about in school while studying the teachings of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. or experiencing the segregated South through the eyes of children in To Kill a Mockingbird. (Not to say that they didn’t confront vexing racial issues of their own, but the lines weren’t drawn quite as sharply as they were in earlier eras.) But we don’t have to look too far into our nation’s past to begin to see the dark racial legacy that made Obama’s election such a stunning revelation to anyone older than about 35. As recently as the 1990s, hip-hop icon Tupac Shakur rhymed, without generating much controversy, that ""although it seems heaven sent / we ain’t ready to see a black president""; the country divided bitterly along racial lines when a jury found former football star OJ Simpson not guilty of murdering his white wife. As recently as the 1970s and 1980s, white citizens rioted over school desegregation in supposedly liberal northern cities like Boston, while widespread demonization of black people loomed large in public debates over welfare, crime, and affirmative action. As recently as the 1960s, it was illegal, in many southern states, for whites and blacks to marry each other, to share the same hotels or restaurants, to use the same bathrooms or water fountains. Before 1965, black people who tried to vote in many parts of this country faced violent intimidation or even death. All of this in Barack Obama’s own lifetime. All of this, without even mentioning the even deeper past of slavery - a debate which helped spark The Civil War - and abolition, Reconstruction and Jim Crow, the three-fifths compromise and the ""twenty negars"" sold into servitude in Virginia in 1619—that’s one year before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock. And yet, despite all this—or perhaps, in a strange way, because of it—a black man named Barack Obama this year became our president. This year, perhaps, American history changed."
18,Obama’s Speech: How Does it Stack Up to History?,politics," In January, Barack Obama became the 44th President of the United States, taking his oath of office on the steps of the Capitol before what is believed to be the largest crowd ever to witness a presidential inaugural in person. Following the swearing in ceremony—which was conducted on Abraham Lincoln’s bible—Obama gave a powerful speech, promising the American people that they could and would unite to overcome the economic and military difficulties facing the nation. ""Our challenges may be new,"" the president said. ""The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends—honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism—these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility—a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task. This is the price and the promise of citizenship."" Instant reviews of Obama’s speech from the TV talking heads were quite positive, and the huge crowds along the Washington Mall roared their approval. But will Obama’s inaugural address stand the test of time? How will Obama’s speech go down in history? Only time will tell. But truth be told, the historical bar against Obama’s words will be judged is actually pretty low. Yes, a few presidents’ inaugurals have gone down as great moments in our history. Those were all, without a doubt, successful inaugural speeches. (And perhaps not coincidentally, those were all successful presidents.) But what about the other 39 presidents and the other 50 inaugural addresses? They mostly fall somewhere on a spectrum ranging from forgettably mediocre to memorably awful. But the worst inaugural address in American history, without a doubt, belonged to William Henry Harrison. For his 1841 inauguration, Harrison penned a monumental 8,500-word treatise, much of it devoted to explaining—for reasons that remain baffling even today—obscure lessons from ancient Roman history. Undeterred by a ferocious blizzard on inauguration day, Harrison refused to wear his overcoat and insisted on plowing through the entire two-hour speech, bitter cold be damned. Then he caught a wicked case of pneumonia and died 31 days later. To this day, William Henry Harrison holds the all-time records for both the longest inaugural speech and the shortest presidency. At Shmoop, we hope that neither record will ever be broken. If we can be fairly certain that no incoming president’s inaugural address will ever beat William Henry Harrison for length, we can be equally sure that none will ever beat George Washington for brevity. Washington’s second inaugural, delivered in 1793, was exactly four sentences long—less than 150 words. While no one made a recording of the speech, for obvious reasons, our best guess is that the address lasted two or maybe three minutes. And that, friends and countrymen, is why George Washington is on the dollar bill and William Henry Harrison is… dead of pneumonia. Obama’s speech, delivered on another cold winter’s day in Washington, clocked in at about 17 minutes, which is just about average for modern times; every inaugural since 1980 has lasted between 14 and 22 minutes. While it’s too soon to say whether Obama’s words will go down in history alongside the great speeches from Lincoln, Roosevelt, Kennedy et al, there is no question that Obama's inaugural was historic in nature. Apart from the obvious—yet still remarkable—fact that Barack Obama just became our nation’s first black president, his inaugural itself was unlike any that ever came before. More people crowded into Washington, DC, to see January’s events in person than for any previous presidential inauguration. That crowd—which reflected the Obama campaign organization in its unusual size, diversity, and enthusiasm—may well end up being the feature of Obama's inauguration best remembered by history. That crowd reflected the feeling that something special happened, that Obama’s inauguration into the White House marked the renewal of America’s democratic spirit. Like most eruptions of democratic enthusiasm, Obama's inaugural festivities had both their positive and negative aspects. On the one hand, it was hard not to be moved by images of American flags waving over hundreds of thousands of happy faces, all wide smiles and tears of joy, their voices filling the Mall with chants and cheers of jubilation. On the other hand, the same crowd greeted outgoing president George W. Bush with widespread booing and even a taunting song of ""Nah nah nah nah, hey hey hey, goodbye!"" Not too classy… but still not nearly as bad as the crowd of Andrew Jackson supporters who trashed the White House in 1829, breaking antique furniture and tracking mud all over the place, or the mob of Abraham Lincoln fans who ran off with the White House silverware in 1865. Will Barack Obama’s presidency live up to the phenomenal excitement of his inauguration day? History will be the judge of that."
19,American History in Obama’s Inauguration Speech,politics," As anyone who saw a campaign poster in 2008 could surely tell you, Barack Obama is all about change. Change in the White House, most profoundly in the simple, yet stunning, fact that we now have our first black president. Change in the tenor of politics, in an effort to step back from the ferocious partisanship of the past decade. And change in the direction of the country, in the form of a dramatic shift in the priorities and policies of the government. Yet change, Obama also knows, can be frightening. Too much change can seem radical, threatening, dangerous. During the campaign, Obama had to overcome the deep-seated fears of many Americans that his particular brand of change would only mean change for the worse. So Obama has always made a conscious effort to balance his calls for change with equal references to the timeless continuities of American history, seeking to cast his own political movement as nothing more than the culmination of the work of Lincoln, Roosevelt, Jefferson, Kennedy, and the other great leaders of our past. (Obama deliberately began his campaign, for example, in the same place that Lincoln began his own run for the White House, and ended it by taking the oath of office on Lincoln’s bible.) Obama’s best speeches have all been peppered with historical allusions and quotations. Over the course of the campaign, Obama breathed fresh life into some of the most moving phrases offered in the past by Lincoln (""a new birth of freedom""), Martin Luther King (""the fierce urgency of now""), and Cesar Chavez (""yes we can""). This morning’s inaugural was no exception to Obama’s tradition of using the past to frame the present, as the inaugural address was full of historical allusions—some obvious, some not so obvious. So what exactly was Obama referring to with each of his invocations of the past? Let Shmoop be your guide…
Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers, and true to our founding documents. Actually, only 43 presidents have taken the oath. (Grover Cleveland, who won the presidency in 1884, lost it in 1888, and won it back again in 1892, counts as both President #22 and President #24… so while there have been 44 distinct presidencies, there have only been 43 different presidents.) Aside from that bit of random trivia, the new president’s point here is to emphasize the continuity of the presidential transfer of power, in times good and bad, as prescribed in the Constitution (that’s what Obama’s invoking in his references to ""We The People"" and ""our founding documents""). Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted—for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things—some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom. For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life. For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.
For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn. Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction. Here Obama invokes the experiences of a wide variety of Americans, from all walks of life, in triumphing over adversity. Those who ""packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life"" would include both the first European settlers of America—the rugged colonists of Jamestown and the Puritan refugees of Plymouth Rock—but also the later generations of immigrants who poured into the country through most of the 19th and 20th centuries. Those who ""toiled in sweatshops and settled the West"" were the factory workers of America’s industrial revolution and the pioneers of Manifest Destiny. The ""the lash of the whip"" is both an obvious reference to slavery and, perhaps, a sly reference to a line in Abraham Lincoln’s second inaugural (""every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword""). Concord and Gettysburg and Normandy and Khe Sanh were momentous battles of the Revolutionary War, The Civil War, World War II , and Vietnam War, respectively. …As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals. Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Obama’s reference to a false ""choice between our safety and our ideals"" is almost certainly meant to echo Benjamin Franklin’s famous dictum that those who ""give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."" The main peril faced by our Founding Fathers—Franklin among them, of course—was defeat and punishment at the hands of the British. The ""charter"" they drafted, the ""charter expanded by the blood of generations"" throughout American history, is the Constitution of the United States. …Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Here Obama refers to American victories in World War 2 (over fascism) and the Cold War (over communism), both of which were achieved not only through force of arms but also through effective diplomacy—the Grand Alliance with Britain, the Soviet Union, China and France in World War 2, and the NATO alliance of Western powers against the Soviet bloc in the Cold War. …This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed—why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath. These words were perhaps Obama’s most direct (yet still fairly subtle) reference to the profound racial significance of his election as President of the United States. Throughout the Jim Crow era, Washington, DC was essentially a Southern city—which is to say a segregated city. As late as the early 1960s, when Martin Luther King came to the city leading the March on Washington, the most admired black man in America was still only able to stay and eat in certain establishments inside the city’s African-American districts. …So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled. In the year of America’s birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood. At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people:
""Let it be told to the future world…that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive…that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it]."" America. In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children’s children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God’s grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations. Obama closed his speech by invoking the bitter winter of 1776, which George Washington and his soldiers spent in camp at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. American prospects in the Revolutionary War at the time looked bleak, as Washington’s men shivered and starved through the long winter knowing that they would soon have to go into battle against a fearsome British Army that regarded each and every one of them as a traitor to the crown. The most famous quotation to emerge from the ordeal at Valley Forge was, interestingly, one that Obama chose not to use—Thomas Paine’s declaration that ""These are the times that try men’s souls: The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands it NOW, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman."" While our own predicament as Americans facing difficult circumstances in early 2009 can hardly compare to the hardships endured at Valley Forge, Obama’s choice to end his inauguration by invoking the nation-making struggles of our forebears was almost certainly offered in the hopes of restoring a sense of national unity and purpose similar to that fostered by George Washington two centuries ago. If Obama succeeds in that, he will surely join Washington in the pantheon of great American presidents."
20,Embryos Leftover from in vitro Fertilization Efforts: Are They Trash or Research Material?,politics," There's a big buzz in the scientific community because President-elect Barack Obama plans to issue an executive order allowing federal funding for new embryonic stem cell research. In an article by Reuters on February 15, 2009, a reporter indicated that stem cells come from cells that must be extracted from human embryos. That implies that these cells are being taken from the womb, and this is simply not true. I wish the media would clarify that these cells are being cultivated and stored in a laboratory, not a woman's body. Federal funding will not destroy any embryos. The cells used by scientists come from blastocysts leftover from in vitro fertilization. Those cells would have been disposed of anyway, unless they are adopted by another couple!  The freezer life of these cells are not eternal, so while we are waiting for a reversal, a decision is being made. We have decided that these cells are better off in the trash than they would be if used for research that could help millions of living human beings. A sad commentary for all of us—especially conservatives who consider themselves as pro-life. Allowing sick and injured people to die does not save babies or blastocysts. The Bush Administration did not ban research on all blastocyst cells. In 2001, President George Bush hampered stem cell research by restricting government funding on embryonic stem cell research to the stem cell lines created prior to April 2001.  Therefore, Bush is not a hero for saving poor little embryos that were on the chopping block. Those cells are still being discarded. Instead, he delayed research that could have advanced science to a point where we could have seen cures for many illnesses by now. Blastocysts created prior to 2001 used old technology cultivated with mouse feeder cells and only represent a limited cross-section of the population. Newer technology without mouse cells is easier to work with and represents better diversity. Obama's reversal of Bush's veto will still mean we are eight years behind schedule, and that people have had to suffer (and die) for a religious cause based on a misinformed opinion rather than scientific fact. I wrote a book about stem cell research that explains the details regarding the science of stem cell research, the politics behind it, and the manner in which religion has interfered with good government and the will of the people. You will find up-to-date information and a song about stem cell research at www.right2recover.com ."

1,"CPSIA - If ever there were a time to ask questions, the time is NOW.",politics," As things stand with CPSIA  now in effect, there is no time to waste - ALL citizens should be interested to learn how this law impacts WE the PEOPLE and our children (and their future) in America. Others are writing with focus on specific aspects of the law, politics, economic impact, and social / cultural losses associated with CPSIA.  I highly recommend the writings of Walter Olson, Rick Woldenberg and Kathleen Fasanella.  These are critical writings for those seeking to gain a real understanding of all of the ins-and-outs of CPSIA.  From these and other sources, my unique concern has only grown. From the moment I first found out about CPSIA, my focus has remained on an even deeper, underlying concern - a concern of such critical consequence that it has brought me to action beyond my comfort zones (let's just say, my homepage is currently host to a rather bold statement).  I realize some may wonder at my ""activist"" choice - all I can say is that I believe that there are times in our lives when none of us can afford to think simply of ourselves - when we are absolutely compelled to think bigger. The implications of CPSIA are clearly bigger than me / my business.  In fact, they are bigger than ALL of our small businesses uniquely impacted by this law - and, yes, even bigger still than the significant economic backlash the combined losses all of our small businesses are sure to have on our economy, at a time in our nation’s economic history that is (I’m sure you’ll agree) most inconvenient. As a mom who, ironically, cares a great deal about the environment and what we leave our children to inherit, I believe that, while CPSIA may be a well-intended law, a well-intended law does not automatically equal a well-written law (i.e. a law that is good for we the people and our children). As I understand it, CPSIA strikes at the very heart of our rights and freedoms, effectively removing WE THE PEOPLE from our rightful authority over our government and replacing our authority with that of an ever-growing Big Brother.  More alarming, voices in our industry have been raised - indeed, voices across America are getting louder by the day - and still there is this insistence (by all but a few - thank you Senator DeMint, for listening) to turn a deaf ear.  If this doesn’t concern us ALL, we’re headed up the proverbial creek in a bullet train, folks. Question - if this law has taken WE THE PEOPLE by such surprise, how can it possibly have been born of our own will? Unless our laws are shaped by the will of WE THE PEOPLE, then our government ceases to be one defined by our authority.  When such a thing occurs, we fall into something other than democratic rule.  To me, the rule of CPSIA marks a critical shift of our power in America. Question - if our government’s job is to inform the people, how is it we ordinary citizens heard so little about this law and its impact on our everyday lives via our media, prior to February 10, 2009?  How is it we are being taken by alarm and surprise - that we react in such disbelief? Kathleen Fasanella of Fashion Incubator claims to have been the first to bring it to the attention of retailers in our industry.  It passed in August of last year and, as with many others in manufacturing / retailing, news only got around to my small business just before CPSIA went into full effect (and, from my experience, others of us still remain unaware).  I think one of the best examples of just how unaware / uninvolved we the people have been re: CPSIA can be found in Walter Olson’s February 13th post at overlawyered.com.  In that feature, there is a quote about a thrift store very quietly removing books so as not to cause a ""panic,"" which I find very telling (i.e. if people had known, they would NOT have liked it and most likely would not have voted for it!). The fact is, CPSIA impacts you, me and every other ""average Joe"" in America in a VERY REAL way – yet, who has taken pains to bring this home to WE the people? I, for one, am particularly disturbed with the implications of CPSIA and I believe NOW is the most critical time to learn all we can, before it’s too late, on behalf of OUR children.  We parents ought to be asking questions, not sitting back and waiting to be informed (by government or media both) or practicing other dangerous activities such as keeping silent (head-in-sand? fear?), standing in the sidelines, as others roll up their sleeves to work on this issue ""on our behalf."" What should we be asking?  Just one example of a great question WE should be asking was asked last week, by an NPR reporter - given phalates are being banned, what are companies replacing this chemical with, in making ALL NEW TOYS.  Answer - other chemicals, including one that apparently known to cause kidney damage in rats!!  What a boon for mass produced products in our industry, that we are forced to bring all now ‘uncertified’ products to a landfill so they can produce these ""better"" alternatives ""for our own good"" - am I wrong here? Are we citizens REALLY so eager to trade in our good common sense and parental authority for that of our growing Big Brother?  Unless we seek information ourselves (get educated!), ask critical questions and take measures to ensure our voices get heard on CPSIA, we risk further damaging ourselves, our country and the future for OUR children. Honestly, I have scratched my head in wonder about the fact that our public servants have not yet responded to the loud and growing voice of those who did not participate in the shaping of this law that is taking our nation by such alarm.  Could it be that some assume we are just too busy to care - or that they really are doing what’s in our best interests (we just don’t really know what’s good for us) - or, worse, that we’re all just lazy, stupid, uninformed sheep that will fall for anything as long as it’s ""marketed"" to us well?  Could it be this dark - could it really be that this is what we have become? I don’t know about you, but the majority of parents I know really do, in fact, CARE.  They really are capable of exercising their own, functioning brains.  And they really are willing to take on the burden of meaningful public outcry when/if the matter is enough of a potential threat to their well-being and the future well being of their children.  It may be my observations are not shared by our public servants - or else they’re just being very much overlooked and underestimated.  It will be interesting to see, when the real impact of CPSIA is more fully understood by moms and dads in their everyday lives out there (green or not - how it diminishes our choices, undermines our authority, fails to serve small business at this critical economic time, etc.), just what truth comes to the surface. In closing, I leave two bits of food for thought. First, truth always comes out - as so richly put by Ralph Waldo Emerson, ""Character is always known. Thefts never enrich; alms never impoverish; murder will speak out of stone walls."" Second, challenging our government is NOT un-American - it is the EPITOMY of being a GOOD AMERICAN.   Anyone who dares dictate otherwise is a wolf in sheep’s clothing.  Truly, if ever there were a time to speak up, the time is now."
2,How Vice President Joe Biden Dealt With Grief,politics," On November 7, 1972 a relatively unknown lawyer named Joe Biden pulled off a big political upset. By just over 3,000 votes he defeated two-term incumbent U.S. Senator J. Caleb Boggs and, at age 30, became the sixth youngest Senator in U.S. history. Despite the amazing victory, he almost never took the oath of office. On December 18, 1972 while Biden was in Washington D.C. looking at his new office, his wife, Neilia, took their three children shopping for a Christmas tree. They were involved in a fatal automobile accident. Neilia and his infant daughter, Naomi, were killed. His two sons, Hunter and Beau, were critically injured. His life suddenly and unexpectedly changed, Biden suddenly found himself as a 30-year-old widower and single father. He also found himself filled with anger and doubt. In his memoir Promises to Keep Biden wrote, ""I began to understand how despair led people to just cash it in; how suicide wasn’t just an option but a rational option … I felt God had played a horrible trick on me, and I was angry."" A career in the U.S. Senate suddenly didn’t seem that important as being there for his two sons. He considered resigning before even taking the oath of office. Beau recalled his father saying, ""Delaware can get another senator, but my boys can’t get another father."" Eventually other U.S. Senators like Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy convinced Biden to take the job the people of Delaware elected him to do. In January of 1973 he took the oath of office at his sons’ hospital bedside. However, because he still wanted to be there for his sons, he gave up his the home he and his late wife were planning to buy in Washington D.C. and commuted by train to and from his home - a practice he still continues. Still, life wasn’t easy for the young Senator. At first he did the least amount of work required for his job. ""My future was telescoped into putting one foot in front of the other … Washington, politics, the Senate had no hold on me,"" Biden wrote. Senate staffers began placing bets on how long Biden would last. No one would have blamed Biden for quitting. After all, he has lost half his family. But Biden didn’t quit. Despite his grief, Biden he hung on and slowly began rebuilding his shattered life. It wasn’t until 1975, however, when Biden met Jill Jacobs that the pieces really fell into place. Falling in love again renewed Biden’s interest in life and politics. ""It had given me the permission to be me again,"" Biden wrote in his memoir. Two years later they married. With his renewed passion, Biden continued what was to become a successful political career. He was re-elected five times to the Senate. He served as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1987-1995 and currently serves as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. In 2008, after a second failed attempt to become the Democrat’s presidential nominee, he was asked to be Sen. Barack Obama’s Vice Presidential running mate. ""Failure at some point in your life is inevitable but giving up is unforgivable,"" Biden said during his Vice Presidential acceptance speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. It’s impossible to say what would have happened to Biden if he had decided to give up. But he didn’t. For those who have lost a spouse, Joe Biden’s story is one of hope. If you continue to put one foot in front of the other, no matter how difficult it may be, there are better days ahead. Despite the challenges and obstacles he faced as a 30-year-old widower, Biden rebuilt his life and his family. Each day we make the decision to push forward or give up. Each day that decision will bring us closer to rebuilding our lives or falling back into darkness. Though difficult, Biden chose to live again and reaped the rewards of his efforts."
3,Internet and Peace Political Campaign,politics," In the past, political figures relied upon the news in the form of television stations and even newspapers to release information to the public, example direct to the electorate.  Now with the invention of the internet, more political figures are releasing their own information.  How does this affect the release of information?  Does this add to the impact of law and government on society, or is this merely a direct root to brainwashing the public.  Furthermore, is it good to use political figures time releasing information when they should be enacting change?  In this article we will look at the relationship between the internet and politics, and whether the move towards more accessibility and greater personal accounting is beneficial to democracy and government. The correct answers are never easy to find, however with some work, analysis and thought it is possible to come up with the right answer.  The right answer is there is no answer - isn't that horrific.  Each politician has different means of how comfortable they are on the internet.  Using the internet has allowed some to maintain a closer proximity to the people they represent, while others have used it as a means to avoid personal contact with the people.  Either way, the Internet is obviously a powerful campaigning tool, and most politicians seemed to have realized and utilized this within their own campaigns. Even internet becomes a facility which allows them to have peace campaign, different with direct campaign that is very sensitive in disturbance. Many politicians are taking the internet and using it as a means of keeping a continuous stream of contact with the media, the people they represent, and everyone else.  The internet has allowed the political figures who use it the ability to quickly communicate with everyone whenever important information is available.  This makes them more accessible to the ordinary man in the street, which has never been possible through any other medium in the past. Using the internet to communicate directly with people has improved the accuracy of the information that comes down in the political reigns.  Being assured of accurate information is why many prefer to receive the information directly from the lawmakers whom they elected.  Many times, it is possible to find the information in more detail online, and with less hassle and false facts. Couple the increased communication with the fact that each day, millions log onto the internet and it makes it the perfect place for candidates to hone their campaign skills to help increase their visual image in the public eye.  Most voters want a political figure they can find easily so they are able to do research to find the candidate that they truly believe in without spending hours doing research.  Furthermore, the internet allows politicians to point their campaigns directly at a completely new demographic that had never before been tapped into.  This is unleashing a whole new generation of voters eager to make the difference, which is working wonders for the politicians involve, and of course their savvy communications managers. Many voters have embraced the idea of being able to show support for their political parties from the comforts of their home over the internet.  Politicians are also enjoying the ability to quickly communicate and using various social websites as well as the websites for their offices to keep a good flow of communication open with voters.  With everything compiled it is a wonderful age, where the internet is able to bring politicians and voters much closer together, while still allowing the politicians to be in Washington, or where their office is performing their job. An example we can see is in Indonesia. Indonesia will hold the election in 2009 few next month. Most of politicians also use internet as campaign media which is called ""Kampanye Damai Pemilu Indonesia 2009"". With the ease of the internet, politicians are able to communicate with the public from anywhere, giving them more time to communicate greater amounts of information to the public, as well as be able to gather feedback from the public in regards to the wishes of the majority.  Overall, it is a wonderful time and a wonderful addition to the political world since the invention of the internet."
4,The Obama Effect,politics," During a recent segment on an ESPN sports show, Andre Iguodala of the Philadelphia 76ers was being interviewed by one of the show's reporters. As the hour wound down, the in-studio host asked Mr. Iguodala, ""Why did you do the interview outside? It's so cold, and you're not even wearing a hat."" Iguodala replied, ""Hey that's how President Obama did it -- in the cold with no hat. I have to step it up."" Iguodala then went on to mention how excited he was about President Obama, and that in his hometown (ironically, Springfield, Illinois), the test scores for Black males have gone up since President Obama was appointed to office. The ad hoc interview responses of a Black athlete are far from a testament of Barack Obama's impact on the Black Community. They do, however, point to a state of mind -- at least in some sections. For instance, I've gotten a significant number of emails from people recapping their Inauguration Day experiences. All were upbeat and ranged from how proud they were to be Americans, to this occasion being the first time they'd ever seen their father cry. In the same vain, barbershops are reporting a resurgence of the ""caesar"" cut that Obama wears, although now it's being called an 'Obama'. There is even a humorous comic strip making the rounds that speculates 5 years from now, the first day of school in the Black Community will have scores of children with names like 'Obamalita Jackson' and 'Obama Taylor', to name a few. I'm clearly stating the obvious by saying the emergence on President Obama has had a positive impact on the mood in the Black Community. A cynic could legitimately say that good feelings can only get you so far, but I think the cynic would be missing the point. One of the major issues in the Black Community is the negative and stereotypical reporting of the news. I'm not a big news watcher, but whenever I sample it there is a preponderance of my people being reported as criminals or crime victims. Every now and then there are ""feel good""stories, but those stories are far outweighed by the ruinous and painful stories I mentioned. Without fear of contradiction, I can say that Barack Obama's Presidency has changed the texture of the nightly news for the next four (hopefully eight) years. Night after night, the news will report on a Black man who also happens to be the most influential and powerful person in the world. In tracking the impact this will have, the closest thing I can think of is the impact Muhammad Ali had on young Black boys like myself in the 1970's. Ali stood tall, and spoke without any equivocation. He was Black, he was proud; but more importantly he was a man of his time. Now Barack Obama is not the outspoken, pull no punches man that Ali was, but he doesn't need to be; he is THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. When he speaks, no matter the amplitude or intensity, people have no choice but to listen. Just as Ali impacted people like me to be proud of who I am and to pull no punches, President Obama casts an image of dignity and grace under pressure. He too is a man of his time, for in these boisterous days, seeing a Black man exude a quiet strength, day after day, and night after night will over time bring civility and decorum into sharper focus in our communities. Seeing a Black man express his anger with dignity and without ""cursing people out"" in the most pressurized of situations is a positive that I look forward to seeing. Again, the cynics will see little to no value in any of this. But the parent raising a child in the inner-city or the burbs knows this value implicitly. The school official that sees young Black children being heckled at assemblies after being given awards for excellent academic achievement knows the intrinsic value of President and First Lady Obama. Now this is not to say that the cynics don't have a point to make. There is a good deal of blind hero-worship of President Obama; and the fact that he is the President of all America by definition means that some of his decisions may not be pleasing to us. When the going gets particularly tough and he needs to raise approval points, he may even decide to take the ""Bill Cosby"" stance of blaming low-income Black people for some of the problems that confront them. When Obama is wrong or we disagree with him, we have to voice it. There's no denying that fact. Being President of the United States is the toughest job in the world. But like most jobs, the proof is in the pudding. If President Barack Obama is able to turn the American Economy around and loosen the grip of partisan politics, he will be viewed as an excellent president. A Black man demonstrating excellence on a daily basis, in the highest office in the land, will bolster our ambitions; and equally important, it will soften the stereotypes of black people that still infect much of American society. If a cynic can't see that bolstered ambitions and the erosion of stereotypes are a major impact on the Black Community, then I only have one question: What impact would a McCain Presidency have had on our community?

5,Obama’s Administration to impact the World,politics," Ever since his nomination, many people all over the world expressed a sigh of relief to their problems, why? After his inauguration many people had expectations and many viewed him as the messiah and expected him to start acting on them soon. What the world expects from him: Obama’s impact on Iraq Send USA Troops Home.  Obama will immediately begin to remove troops from Iraq as a way of cutting down on government’s spending. Impact on Iraqis Two million Iraqis are refugees; two million more are displaced inside their own country. They expect that an international working group to address this crisis will be formed. The Iraqis are hoping that President Obama will provide funds to expand services to Iraqi refugees in neighboring countries, and ensure that they can find a safe haven inside their own country. Impact on Iran Iran has sought nuclear weapons, supports militias inside Iraq and terror across the region, and its leaders threaten Israel and deny the Holocaust. Iran will hope that negotiations on their nuclear program will be allowed without preconditions unlike in the past. World leaders Obama is willing to meet with the leaders of all nations, friend and enemies. He will do necessary preparations, and come to the table and tackle challenges like terrorism, and Iran and North Korea's nuclear programs. Fight poverty in Africa African citizens are hoping that America will double its aid funding to African countries, In order to build healthy and educated communities, reduce poverty, develop markets, and generate wealth. Peace He will negotiate with Middle East and some of Africa countries to bring lasting peace. Palestine and Israel believe that both countries will be given a chance to be heard and decisions concerning both of them will be made fairly. ‘Terrorists’ Those accused unfairly {Muslims} believe that a fair chance of defending oneself will be given and that they will not be discriminated and suspected every time an attack is launched in a certain place. Race With Barrack Obama having roots from the African continent many blacks believe that for once black people will be respected and seen as people with potential. They will now be given fair opportunity to participate in decision making of government’s policies. His victory as President will also change the minds of black voters in America where by relations between black s and whites will improve. Sports Owners and athletes will be taxed to how to help Chicago land the 2016 Olympic Games; many youths especially in Africa are looking forward to get funding in their clubs and even be given that opportunity to be signed as international players. Young generation As a young leader Barrack Obama will give inspiration to many youths. They will believe in themselves and realize that they can make their dreams a reality. Corruption Most African countries are faced with corruption charges. Many people believe that Obama’s presidency will help fight corruption and will not let those involved go scot free. Health African countries are looking upon America to help them fight its common diseases like malaria which is a national disaster in many countries. They believe President Obama will increase the budget allocated to them."
6,"Oil, Chávez, War and Terror",politics," A half century ago, Juan Pablo Perez Alfonso, the Venezuelan who started OPEC, said, ""Ten years from now, twenty years from now, you will see: oil will bring us ruin . . . Oil is the Devil's excrement."" Hugo Chávez, who was an infant when those words were spoken, is now learning their truth. When Chávez took over Venezuela in 1999, the oil price was under $10 a barrel, which he was able to help spike to $147 by July, 2008, a rise coincident with his oil hegemony in Latin America and political alliances with Iran and Russia to oppose ""the evil empire"" of America and its ""Devil"" President George W. Bush. But by the first days of 2009, the Devil's excrement has hit the fan, so to speak, as oil dipped to $30 a barrel in Caracas, where it must be $90 to balance the budget. Consequently, the power of Chávez has been visibly shaken but it would be a huge miscalculation to count him out. Often underestimated as a foolish showboat, Chávez has monopolized Venezuela's oil, money, and power for ten years running. His oil price strategy was effective until only a few months ago and it might work again in 2009 -- to short the market of oil supplies, while spurring prices with theatrical threats of war or oil cut-offs. Since 1999, Chávez has personally shorted the market by over 2 million barrels per day. Instead of increasing Venezuelan production from 3.6mbd in 1998 to the planned 5mbd for today, he reduced production to 2.4mbd, which reduced world oil supply just as China and India were coming on line with new demand. By getting Ali Rodriguez, his co-conspirator in a 1992 coup attempt, appointed president of OPEC, Chávez pushed oil producers into his price-gouging strategy and soon had OPEC also shorting the market (Previous to Chávez, Saudi Arabia had tamped down the price hawks in OPEC). But his most astounding achievement was spiking the ìpolitical risk premiumî paid for oil through threats of war, which can be found by searching for the words ""Chávez + War + U.S."" in Google, where no less than 7,300,000 stories pop up for review. When oil approached $70 a barrel in 2006, Saudi Energy Minister Ali al-Naimi opined that the war talk accounted for 40% of the oil price. The price of oil has little to do with supply and demand, as al-Naimi saw it. Wall Street doubts about al-Naimi's analysis shattered as the oil price soared over $100 in March of 2008 coincident with threats from Iran about developing nuclear weapons, wiping Israel off the map and closing the Gulf of Hormuz (where 15mbd are shipped every day); plus threats from Venezuela about cutting off U.S. deliveries, buying $4 billion of Russian weapons to thwart an imagined U.S. invasion, and threatening war against U.S. anti-drug activities in Colombia or if the U.S. did anything provocative toward Bolivia, Nicaragua, Cuba, Iran or Hamas. In May, 2008, the oil guru Arjun N. Murti of Goldman Sachs predicted a ""super spike"" where oil would pierce $200. In July, when oil hit $147, Wall Street thought he was right. But he was not. When a Commodity Futures Trading Commission report showed in September, 2008, that speculative bets by index funds didn't push oil prices up, the power of Chávez's oil price gouging strategy was clear but ignored: Wall Street and Washington had already turned toward a much larger looming crisis with the banks and the worst recession since the 1930s. The global recession of economic activity cut the legs out of the oil price which sank $100 in 100 days to about $40 a barrel by the turn of the year. This put Chávez in a huge quandary. He's got to get the price up to the $80 level or suffer huge consequences in Venezuela where he employs every other person in the country. If Chávez loses the referendum in March that allows him to run for president for life, things could get dicey for him in Venezuela. Barack Obama, who has other things on his mind, is all Chávez is thinking about. Obama, Chávez says, is the same as Bush, so the war to destroy capitalism and U.S. power must go on. Chávez, who is more heavily armed than anyone outside the Pentagon on this hemisphere, wants a confrontation with Obama to build his support back home -- the same trick Fidel Castro has worked with ten American presidents in a row. When Israel began bombing the Gaza strip, Chávez joined his strategic partner, Iran's Ahmadinejad, in defending Hamas and condemning Israel and its supporter, the U.S.  But this time, the threat to cut off oil flowing through the Gulf of Hormuz and oil flowing from Venezuela to the U.S., upped the price by only a few dollars a barrel and only for one day. The unknown factor is whether the one unused weapon in the arsenal of Ahmadinejad and Chávez will be used before they are ousted. That is the weapon Fidel Castro invited to Cuba in 1962 and which almost caused a nuclear war. Can Obama deal as effectively with Ahmadinejad and Chávez as Kennedy dealt with Khrushchev and Castro in 1962? That, as Joe Biden predicted in the campaign, may be the ""test"" Obama will face from Chávez. ©2008 Michael Rowan Author Bio Michael Rowan, a political consultant and writer, lived in Caracas from 1993 to 2006.

7,Obama's Test From Chávez,politics," Of all the foreign policy messes George W. Bush is handing off to President-elect Barack Obama, Venezuela's Hugo Chávez is the worst. On the two tests where Chávez is the key -- shaping a respectful long-term relationship with Latin America and the short-term terrorist threat from Venezuela -- Bush scored an F. Obama's got real work carved out for him. With 200 of its 550 million people living on $2 or less per day, Latin America suffers from a long-term inability to develop a win-win relationship with the economic colossus to the north, where the GDP per capita is seven times greater than below the Rio Grande. The success of 45 million Hispanic Americans, who on a per capita basis earn three times what their relatives do back home, dramatizes the long-term solution. The modern system of lawful wealth creation is inefficacious in Latin America, which consequently has not developed as rapidly as Asia or much of Africa, and that in turn has spurred immigration to the states including 12 million illegally. The solution was supposed to be the Washington Consensus policies -- budget balancing, more taxes, fiscal austerity, free trade, fighting government corruption and privatization of state enterprises -- which became loan qualifications for IMF, World Bank and US aid. But these stern policies -- which Washington rarely applied to itself -- failed to reduce poverty and backfired especially against the Latin American political leaders who had the courage to apply them. That backfire gave rise to the virulent strain of anti-Americanism that produced Chávez. In 1989, there were riots against the Washington Consensus reforms imposed on President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, which were followed in 1992 by a coup attempt launched by Chávez against Perez, who was impeached shortly afterward. Then Chávez rose from the ashes of prison to win the presidency in 1998. He has been savaging American capitalism and power ever since while being subsidized by American gasoline buyers. A few years later, similar riots against Washington's rules ousted President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of Bolivia, whose request for a $50 million loan to President Bush was dismissed in the Oval Office with the crack ""Who am I, Santa Claus?"" The upshot in 2005 was the election of the indigenous leader Evo Morales to Bolivia's presidency, who gladly took Chávez's money and imitated his savage anti-American discourse. Argentina, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Dominica, and Honduras then fell like dominoes into the oil-funded anti-American camp of Chávez, who had simultaneously aligned fifty billion dollars worth of business with the FARC narco-terrorists in Colombia, OPEC, Iran, Syria, Hamas, Hezbollah, China, Russia, Belarus, North Korea, and anyone who would trash Bush -- who ignored it all, pretending everything was OK. Bush is thus handing off to Obama a Latin America that is deeply suspicious of America; where Iranian, Russian and Chinese weapons and businesses are found everywhere in the Chávez circle of countries; where the growing threats of nuclear weapons proliferation, terrorism, money-laundering, human and narcotics trafficking have become the norm; where two US ambassadors were kicked out of Venezuela and Bolivia; and where a global recession that is blamed on U.S. profligacy will worsen immigration, poverty, violence and instability in the whole region. More than any of his predecessors since World War II, President Obama needs a dramatic change in the relationship with Latin America. To attack poverty, the underlying problem, Obama needs to get the tools of wealth creation -- education, private property, enterprises, and cheap credit -- to the 200 million Latin Americans who live on $2 per day. He could use a Marshall Plan involving the public and private sectors of the rich democracies to interact with Latin America on the ground in the barrios and directly with poor people. The ""community organizer"" Obama once was in Chicago is precisely what the Latin American poor need in their corner today. As for Chávez's short term terrorist threat, Obama has to move fast. Even though the recession has cut Chávez's oil income by more than half, he still has the largest and best-equipped standing army in Latin America, Russian submarines and fighter jets, Iranian missiles, uranium mines, Hezbollah and FARC training and rest camps, and a cocaine and money-laundering operation that makes Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme look like tiddlywinks. Chávez is armed, scared, trapped and dangerous. He's scared of being prosecuted for crimes against humanity if he's removed from office. He's trapped by falling oil income that props up his personal army, a huge bureaucracy, and half the payrolls in Venezuela. A paranoid sociopath, Chávez has lost his bugaboo -- Bush -- and is facing a cool, intelligent black replacement. In such circumstances, he may fabricate a crisis so he can declare martial law and wage war against the U.S. as Fidel Castro did in Cuba 50 years ago. Expect Iran, Russia and maybe China to be denying involvement in it. To counter Chávez, Obama should eliminate U.S. dependence on Venezuela's oil and thus stop subsidizing Chávez's state sponsorship of terrorism. This is not as difficult a task as Bush thought, because Venezuela's fuels are not needed in a recession. But without U.S. revenues to subsidize his megalomaniacal fanaticism, Chávez will face new enemies among the military closest to him, including thousands of Cubans loyal to Chávez's money not his dreams of grandeur. By protecting America, Obama could really help the suppressed democracy of Venezuela. ©2008 Michael Rowan Author Bio Michael Rowan, a political consultant and writer, lived in Caracas from 1993 to 2006.

8,"Obama is GREAT! But, he isn’t going to change your world.",politics," Hi Guys, I hope you all were able to see Obama’s Inauguration speech the other day. I truly felt that it was great, but yet for some reason the thought of him being unable to change our lives kept on coming into this head of mine. I pondered upon this for a long long long time and came to realise that it was so true. I don’t rant very often, but with all the Inauguration madness and ""Obama Mania"" flooding the airways and media, I feel left out, so here’s what I have to say… Let me tell you why Obama is NOT going to change your life. If you wish to disagree, agree or post your comments on my rant. This one should get the blood boiling so get onto the edge of your chair. OBAMA IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE YOUR WORLD. Obama is not going to change or save THE world. Obama is not a ""savior."" Obama is not a ""miracle worker."" Obama is not your ""government."" Obama is not going to fix your life. I know this might rock your boat and I know that you may believe (I know I am generalizing and I know you may completely agree with what I am about to say) but I know that you may be thinking that on January 20th, when Obama got sworn into office, that he is going to change the world and that everything is going to be different. Yes, Obama is America’s new leader.  Yes, he is here with a new game plan and an excellent agenda that I hope he follows through on.  Yes, he is here to change our attitude and others attitude towards the United States. I hope he will do a great job. But I got news for you.  Obama is not going to fix your world. He is not going to change your life. The only way you are going to change your own life is by changing your own life.  The only way you are going to fix your current situation is by fixing your current situation. Change requires working on yourself harder than anyone else.  So if you are under the belief that Obama is going to change your life today or when he gets sworn in, you’re sadly mistaken and 100% wrong. You need to BE your own president. You need to BE your own government. You need to BE your own office. You need to BE your own company. You need to BE your own country. Am I making sense? TODAY is the day that you DECIDE that you are going to change your life. You have the ability to earn all the money to create your dream lifestyle. You have the ability to be a ""rock star"" father, mother, grandpa, grandma, aunt, uncle, brother, sister or friend. You have the ability to TRANSFORM your life. Today, YOU are going to ELECT yourself to be president of your life.  If you don’t then I just did :)  I just elected YOU to be the president for your company.  I just elected you to be the CEO of your company. So, now that you are president of your life, how are YOU going to make changes?   Share your comments on the blog and read what others are saying. No hard feelings! J Until my next post people… Cheers! GC"
9,A Brief History of Martin Luther King Day,politics," Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. was an African-American minister, activist and prominent leader in the American civil rights movement during the 1950s-1960s. Today he is a human rights icon and the U.S. along with a few other nations celebrate his birthday, observed on the third Monday in January of each year. In the U.S. this observance is a federal holiday. King was born on January 15, 1929 in Atlanta, Ga. He graduated from Morehouse College in 1948, from Crozer Theological Seminary in 1951 and Boston University in 1955 with a Doctor of Philosophy. King married Coretta Scott in 1953 and the couple raised four children. King’s chief stance was that of a nonviolent civil rights movement, which successfully protested racial discrimination in federal and state law. In 1955 King led the Montgomery Bus Boycott. In 1957 he co-founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. In 1963 King’s efforts led to the 1963 March on Washington, in which he delivered his now-famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech, one of the greatest speeches in American history. King is the youngest person to receive the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize. He received the award in 1964 for his work to end racial segregation and racial discrimination through non-violent means. King also worked on ending poverty and opposing the Vietnam War. Read more about King’s philosophies, work and influence in magazines like Vibe, Essence, American Legacy and Atlanta Tribune: The Magazine. On March 29, 1968 King was in Memphis, Tenn. to attend a rally for black sanitation workers represented by AFSCME who had been on strike for better wages and treatment. King spoke at the rally on April 3 with his ""I’ve Been to the Mountaintop"" speech, which would be the last of his career. The next evening King was shot while he stood on the balcony of the Loraine Motel; he died an hour later at St. Joseph’s Hospital after emergency surgery was performed. In response to King’s assassination many riots took place in more than 100 cities. Presidential nominee Robert Kennedy pleaded with King supporters to continue the late activist’s lead by adhering to non-violence. In 1969 James Earl Ray pleaded guilty to murdering King but after being sentenced to a 99-year sentence recanted and spent the rest of his life trying to get a trial. There have been many conspiracy theories on the murder of King. Read more about the many conspiracy theories in magazines like Time and The Economist. King was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2004. Though a campaign for a federal holiday in King’s honor began shortly after his assassination, it wasn’t until 1983 that President Ronald Regan signed the holiday into law; the holiday was first observed in 1986. It was another 20 years, in 2006, before all 50 states officially observed the holiday for the first time."
10,Why Pakistan,politics," Why was Pakistan created? What was its genesis and what ideology was driving the Pakistan movement? Why did a vast majority of Muslims support the idea of Pakistan and why did a majority of the Islamic scholars (Ulema) oppose it? These are the questions which have been debated ever since Pakistan came into existence. In this 50th anniversary of Pakistan, while celebrating its golden jubilee, it is equally important to look back and give some thought and reflect upon these questions. In recent years, many have even started to question the wisdom and the vision of the country’s founding leaders. (Traditionally, there have always been opponents of Pakistan trying to wreck the very house that provides them shelter and sustenance). In answering these questions, we will first explain the positions of those who opposed the idea of Pakistan, and then present the arguments which Allama Iqbal and Quaid-e-Azam put forth in its favor. Why were the British and the Hindus against the idea of creating a separate country for Muslims? Because the British (as Mountbatten mentioned many times) wanted to leave behind their legacy, and history of their rule and accomplishments on a united India. They did not want to create a fracture in the country which had served them so well that it was called the jewel in the British crown. The Hindus, on the other hand, did not want to rule over only a part of India - especially after being ruled by Muslim kings and the British for so many centuries. This was their only chance in history to rule over all of India, and they did not want to miss this opportunity. Thus, both the British and the Hindus had their own reasons and self interests to oppose the permanent partition of India. Consequently, such a behavior on their part was perfectly understandable and quite logical. But what about the Muslims’ role in this equation? Unlike the British and the Hindus who were each united in their opposition to the idea of Pakistan, Muslims were not united in favor of Pakistan (as always—history bears ample testimony to this disunity amongst Muslims) even on this fundamental issue of extreme historical importance. Although a vast majority of Muslims supported the idea of Pakistan, many prominent Muslims, especially the Islamic scholars (called ""Ulema"") were against it and vehemently opposed its creation—the most prominent amongst them were Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Maulana Hussain Ahmad Madani and Maulana Abul A’la Maududi, etc. Why did they oppose this idea while a vast majority of Muslims supported it? In order to understand this apparent paradox, we have to go to the very root of the question. Let us begin our journey. It was Allama Iqbal who for the first time gave the idea of Pakistan. He had a deep understanding of the Quran and devoted almost all his life for propagating its pure message in his God given unique style. He said: ""If you wish to live the life of a Muslim, then it is not possible except to live by the Quran."" This couplet of Iqbal is a poetic rendering of verses 7:3 and 33:2 of the Quran. Iqbal suggested this because of his deep understanding of Islam, its political process and its history. Iqbal suggests that Muslims have to guide their lives collectively and create a social order based on the Quran because: ""Allah who has created all the objects in the universe, has also undertaken to make them aware of their goal and guide them towards it"" (20:50) The principles of the Quran were gradually implemented as a living force and a living miracle in the society by Prophet Muhammad (S) which sent tremors into the very hearts of the Byzantine and the Persian empires. This took complete shape as a social order during the period of Caliph Umar (R). [Both the Byzantine empire of the Romans and the Sassanid empire of the Persians were defeated, and the social order established during Caliph Umar (R) stretched from north Africa in the west to the Arabian Sea and Persia in the east.] In this social order, the three institutions of human exploitation—kingships, religious priesthood, and capitalism—were eliminated. Thus, people were enjoying universal human rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Quran and were completely free from any political, religious or economic suppression and exploitation because it was based on the Quranic principle that: ""It is not allowed for a man that Allah should give him the book, power to judge, and even prophethood, and he should say to his fellow beings to obey his orders rather than those of Allah…"" (3:79) Now let us return to the basic question of why Pakistan was created. Dear reader, the best way to understand the genesis and ideology of Pakistan is to go to the main source directly- Allama Iqbal and Quaid-e-Azam. Iqbal, because he was the originator of the idea of Pakistan and presented the ideology for its movement. And Quaid-e-Azam because he was the implementer of the idea of Pakistan and provided the requisite leadership for the political impetus needed for its eventual realization as a country."

12,Expansion Plans For Disneyland,politics," Managing director Andrew Kam Min-ho said yesterday that Hong Kong Disneyland would bolster its size by more than one-third and would cost half the price of the cruise terminal which is to be built in Kai tak. The approximate cost of the terminal, made by the government is about HK$ 7.2 billion, which means that the park- expansion bill would be about HK$ 3 billion to HK$4 billion. Mr. Kam also said that three ""lands"" with a new theme would be occupying  about 12 hectares of the 20- plus hectares of land available for development at the theme-park site. Main Street USA, Fantasyland, Tomorrowland and the largest Adventureland in the world are the current prime features of Hong Kong Disneyland. Disney is amenable for financial help for the current expansion plans and is negotiating with the government as its joint- venture partner in times ahead. The government hold a stake of 57% in the theme park and according to Mr. Kam, the administration would remain the majority shareholder and the only languish would be a slight decrease in its stake if the taxpayer’s funds were not used in to pay for the expansion. It is quite understood that the government’s failings to inject proportionate funds for expansion plans would lead to a dilution in its majority stake. The debate lies in the decision of the government whether it is willing to pool in funds or is ready to accept a smaller stake. Bill Ernest, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts president and managing director for Asia, said that the talks have been on for a while and would be an ongoing process. The fact that different financing arrangements would alter the capital structure of the theme- park joint venture was reiterated by a spokesman for the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau. He said the government needed to consider the interest of the public and return on its investment yet had declined to put a deadline on the talks. According to Mr. Kam, both sides had implicit knowledge about the urgency of the negotiations in a time of financial downturn as the expansion plan would help creating thousands of jobs, propping up the economy  and would help taking advantage of falling commodity prices and labour costs. Estimated time for this construction would be about two to three years, he said. As per their observed statistics, 50% of visitors to the theme park are people in their 20s. Hence, Hong Kong Disneyland is trying to entice the young- adult market and increase their profitability."
13,Beijing Playing The Economic Card?,politics," Beijing acted as a ladder to lift Taiwan for economic support like it did for Hong Kong earlier.  The fourth cross-strait economic forum was being attended conjointly by the Communist party and Taiwan’s ruling Kuomintang. The apparent reason seemed to be the global financial bedlam yet the agreement seemed to be getting the matter of getting the mainland and the island closer, into the forefront. The steps were welcome- albeit not by all Taiwanese. Some of these were less keen for close links between the two sides than the others. Probably the plague affecting the Taiwanese stock markets is mainly due to the depleting of European and North American markets. Factuality stares into the face with Taiwan’s mainland-based companies taking the downturn. The forum offered measures such as tax breaks, involvement in the mainland’s economic boost and made a stupendous offer of 130 billion yuan (HK $148 billion) in support, for three years. The mainland lands a helping hand due to its controlled markets which has a buffer for economic downswings. Regardless of the political circumstances, it is its duty to always be ready to assist the Chinese families in critical situations. Ever since Kuomintang Ma Ying-jeou took over the president in May from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's Chen Shui-bian, ties have become more affable. For the first time, in six decades, last Monday witnessed direct daily passenger flights. Postal links and new shipping routes were also opened by the sides. The head of the mainland’s Taiwan Affairs Office, Wang Yi, interjected the issue of politics by supporting Kuomintang vice-chairman Tseng Yung-chuan in his opinion that the island's pro-independence political opposition should be included in the annual gathering. The mainland’s move can be fully accepted for the eventual reconciling, only when there are no lingering traces of opposition from the Taiwanese society. Kuomintang followers alone are not enough to make get this goal into fruition. Politics being the main arrest, trade has given impetus for better relations and the financial descent has provided a conjuncture for Beijing to play the economic card. Although there is quite a lot of resilience from the Taiwanese in Mr. Ma moving close with his friendly demeanor, it has been an obvious boost. These efforts have to be taken with futuristic goals and with much needed sensitivity. There is dubiousness with Beijing’s attempts to sway the political scenario with generous economic grants. Obfuscation might flourish at the margins yet such thoughts could be dispelled by having fewer trade restrictions. The greatest feats of progress can be achieved with the mainland truly opening up to the rest of China with a proper free-trade policy."
14,Politician to Undergo Background Checks for White House Appointment,politics," Background check has become an everyday process in any HR office in the land. Every time an applicant comes for an interview, background check is always expected to be conducted. For quite some years now, background checking has become an important tool for many companies to determine the credibility and capability of their prospect employees. The same procedure is what helps many businesses in awarding promotions to their employees. In schools, background check is an important tool to determine if a student has no derogatory record that might in one way or another affect the environment he/she is trying to join. All the more this process has become a government’s aide in choosing appointees for critical positions in the White House and other departments. Many people depended on background check as the presidential campaign was on the go. Many searches have been recorded in Google’s analytic tools which, Obama and McCain topped as keywords. This is no longer surprising as the internet provides much information of people, places, things, and situation which can let one think decisively according to the facts and figures he/she has just read. It has not been made a practice before but these days, background screening of politicians is simply taking wide acclaim. After the election of Sen. Obama to the highest office of the land, came followed the appointment of cabinet officials and other positions in the executive branch. The process is not so easy that until now, the line up of Obama’s team is not yet completed. There had been already some positions that have been filled up such as the White House Chief of Staff and the Secretary of State, but other positions as secretaries of the different positions are yet to be filled up. Representative Artur Davis of Alabama is among the many politicians and Democrats eyed by the Obama Transition Team that will hold a position in White House. But before he can be appointed extensive background check is going to be conducted on him. Though Davis did not in any way confirm the appointment he continues to dismiss the idea of joining the Obama team because of his plan to run as governor of Alabama. With his wide background and circle of friends, even the FBI is having second thoughts because the agency houses many friends of Davis. But, considering his history of service to the House and his constituents, chances are that if he accepts the nomination to be a secretary for Obama cabinet, background checks will never be a hindrance. Today, background search is not just a tool for ordinary employee but as well as to big politicians and celebrities aiming for a position in the government. As background search can give one an idea of the possibilities of fraud and other similar problems that might be done by the nominee, public service competence can be secured and that better administration is well assured. As of the moment, the Departments of Education, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and Transportation has not yet filled in. Other’s departments are still moot and will undergo several processes still. Background check is mandatory process that is done to all nominees and candidates for any position in the cabinet before they can be appointed to the position."
15,The American Cinderella and her Ugly Sisters,politics," The following paper was written on June, 2003, and published in my book Unveiling The War Against Terror, on May, 2004. It'srepublished here hoping that the readers of  The Global Journal will find it to be of some interest. By Con George-Kotzabasis Once upon a time, the curiosity, intrepidity, and adventurous spiritof the descendants of a cosmopolitan civilization of Judeo-Greco-Romanorigins, discovered a new continent that would grow in time, on the""downside"" of Eden, economically, politically, culturally, andmorally, into the most beautiful and fairest of her sex. But like allcreatures who are made 'in the prodigality of nature', she wouldineluctably attract, and be victim to, the jealousy, envy, and hate ofthe  ""ugly"" world. Thus, the American Cinderella, at the peak andbloom of her economic, political, military, and cultural power, woulddraw upon herself the wrath and jealousy of her ugly sisters. This isin short the story, of the vicissitudes and the fate of the American Cinderella in a hostile, enviable, and unequal world. It is a stupendous fallacy, and tendentious to believe, that America is hated for its so - called economically exploitative policies, and its arrogant foreign policy, both of which, according to its critics,obstruct and prevent nascent nations from also basking under the sun of economic prosperity and political freedom. On the contrary, the main cause for this resentment against America by these nations, as well as by those with pretensions of global power, such as Russia,France, and Germany, which no longer perch on the top branch of thetree of political power, is the overwhelming and unassailable power that America exercises in the economic, political, military, cultural,and scientific spheres, over the rest of the world. It is for this reason therefore wrong to premise, that only by changing these so called reprehensible and objectionable policies toward the less privileged nations and turbulent spots of the world,will America be able to stop the waves of hate from crashing againstits shores. That ostensibly the emollient to hatred lies in benignactions. Such analysis of the situation, however, is monstrously superficial and deeply faulted. The hatred against America has its roots in the curse of envy. As America's conspicuous eminence in the above named spheres, like Veblen's conspicuous consumption, gives rise to envy among all peoples and nations, who cannot at this stage emulate it. There is nothing unique or unprecedented throughout all history, that strong civilizations have always distended and expanded their dominance by battering old and opening new frontiers. All dominant powers exercised and demonstrated this dominance in vigorous and often violent ways.  Not only in their unquenchable desire to conquer new lands, but also, when they had to defend their vital interests and their domain from the threatening incursions and forays of potential deadly enemies. And just as often this violent action, or resort to arms by these powers, was unilateral and preemptive. The Greek historian Thucydides, in his depiction of the dialogue between the Athenians and the Melians, gives a tour de force instruction about the reality of political and military power, i.e., the weak must submit and pay tribute to the strong, because if the weak were in the sameposition as the strong, they would have also done the same thing. It is the softening of the brain, and not of the heart, that will not concede and accept this reality of power. Moreover, no civilization or nation which possesses such power but is squeamish in using it, will be able to prevail against its competitors or enemies and eventually,like a lion who is no longer capable to roar, will lose this power and will cease to be preeminent among nations. And there is no example in history, that a civilization or nation that possessed such power voluntarily abdicated it. It could only lose it in a clash with a stronger civilization or nation than itself. In the present historical juncture with the rise of fundamentalist Islam and its terrorist death squads which threaten the stability, if not the viability, of the nations of Western civilization, especially of America, which is the embodiment, the ""cosmopolis"" of this civilization, the latter as a strong nation, inevitably has to take up the cudgels and defend itself and the world from this deadly menace.No nation or civilization, imbued with a modicum of amour propre and pride for its achievements, would allow itself to succumb, without fighting back with all its vigor and might, to a dangerous thrust of a horde of barbarians. And one must be reminded, that only America,among all other nations, has the technological wherewithal, the military power, and will, to confront and defeat terrorism and its state sponsors on a global scale. Furthermore, the defeat of global terrorism is pivotal on a war on two fronts. Whose critics, among which are Simon Crean and Kevin Rudd of the Labor Opposition, so simplistically and lamentably fail to see or acknowledge. One cannot decisively defeat terrorism without simultaneously fighting and defeating its state sponsors. Both, the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan and against Saddam in Iraq, had this strategic aim.Which regrettably, was not spelled out lucidly and publicly, either by the Pentagon or the White House. And the destruction of the regimes of the Taliban and of Saddam, were, also, part of a quintessential process of 'creative destruction', to use the immortal phrase of the great Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, for the countries' future economic and political development.The war against terrorism however, is not solely the responsibility of America. Because apparently it seems the latter is the main target of the terrorists. It is just as well the responsibility of all the free nations of the world. To replicate the American isolationism of the 1930s, during which the ominous dark clouds of Nazism hovered all over Europe, as the Labor Opposition has done by its statements that Australia should concentrate its forces in the region, when the terrorists have only one region in their deadly sight, i.e., the free world, is to 'have learnt nothing and forgotten nothing', to quote Talleyrand. Labor's stand on this grave issue is totally out of joint. While it is in full agreement that Australia must fight global terrorism, it is calling at the same time that its armed forces should stay within the bounds of the region. Apparently, political senilitis the disease that is decrepitating the Opposition on this vital issue. Thus by definition, making it completely unqualified to govern the country in these critical times. As for the calophonous, cheerful cries, of the not so intelligent cosmopolitan liberal intelligentsia, to make love not war, they unimaginatively forget that only because America has fought and is fighting necessary wars, that it is by the ""grace of America"", that the peace-loving of the world can indulge in their predilection for the gratifications and pleasures of the boudoir. Moreover, they conveniently forget, that it was ""peccant"" America that saved the world from the twin miasma of Nazism and Communism, which threatened to intern and engulf the world in its monstrous death camps and gulag archipelagos. America as the sole super-power has the moral, political, and historical responsibility to defend the institutions and mores of Western civilization from this mortal threat posed by Muslim fanaticism. As the American political commentator Robert Kagan has brilliantly argued, in the 'anarchic Hobbesian world where international laws and rules are unreliable', Immanuel Kant's 'Perpetual Peace', can only be achieved by America decisively and relentlessly exercising its mighty power against these deadly foes of life, peace, and freedom. And whilst in such exercise, it is wise to have allies from both old and new Europe, to win this war not only in the battlefield, but, also, in the interlocutory of diplomacy, at the same time, America must not allow itself to be trapped in the power plays and procrastinations of its fickle allies, as are played out in the security council of the United Nations. To quote another political theorist Michael Glennon, 'states pursue security by pursuing power. Legalistic institutions that manage that pursuit maladroitly are ultimately swept away '. (Foreign Affairs May/June 2003.)The security of the free world which is presently threatened by the baneful and atrocious attacks of al Qaeda and its affiliate bodies spread all over the globe, can only be accomplished by America using its military power preemptively and unilaterally, if that is necessary, against these mortal foes.  America, as the embodiment and protector of Western civilization and freedom, has no other alternative but to respond to this challenge of terrorism with all its might. The ghastly specter of fanatic terrorism will not be exorcised by saintly incantations nor by sprinkling with oil its stormy waters. And as no great nation can escape its own destiny, America has no choice but to exercise its military power against this reign of terror, with the wisdom that applies in a Hobbesian world of bellum omnium contra omnes."
16,Africa Could Bring Cuba and Obama Closer,politics," Obama’s election has opened a window of hope in the world. In Cuba, the hope is for a semblance of normalization in US-Cuba relations. The task is formidable with five decades of inertia propping up an outmoded policy of hostility and blockade. Finding a common ground to get beyond the animosity could be a key step towards easing tensions. Attention will be focused come January on the Obama campaign promise to allow Cuban-Americans to travel freely to the island and send remittances to their relatives; many analysts feel that these will become reality during his first months in office. Not far behind will be the growing demand of US citizen’s rights groups to scrap the travel ban on Cuba all together and the plea from business people to loosen trade sanctions and provide opportunities for US farmers and exporters. Those Congress people and citizen groups seeking broader change in US-Cuba policy, with an eye on totally eliminating the US blockade, will be measuring their strength in the new legislature and proceeding accordingly. One factor that makes any decisions a little easier for Obama is that he won the state of Florida, and would still have taken the presidency without it. This fact will lessen the influence of the old guard Miami - Cuban crowd that has wielded disproportionate clout in shaping US foreign policy. On the other hand, Barack Obama needs to kick start a US economy heading into the throes of recession. He says that creating jobs is top priority and there probably is no quicker way to do so in Florida than by lifting the blockade against Cuba. Travel agencies, food and building material companies, the entertainment industry, convention centers, shipping companies, importers etc. would be some of the areas where long-term jobs could be created in a relatively short period. FIGHTING HIV/AIDS COULD UNITE RIVALS Far from the Congressional arena, another strategy for improving longstanding poor relations could be found many thousands of miles away on the African continent. It’s logical to think that Africa will receive far greater attention under the Obama presidency than it has under previous administrations, which generally assigned the continent a very low priority. Likewise, there is no other country in the Western Hemisphere that dedicates more resources to assisting impoverished African nations than, yes, surprise, Cuba, which has been providing doctors, educators, scholarships and sports trainers for decades. HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention is one of the areas where the Cubans have helped out, but the scope of the problem is beyond their capacity to go it alone. Speaking at the United Nations on June 25, 2001, Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage, publicly offered to send 4,000 Cuban doctors and health personnel to create the necessary infrastructure to treat millions of persons and to train a large number of local specialists in HIV/AIDS, including nurses and health technicians. Cuba also offered to provide sufficient professors to establish 20 medical schools, with a staff of Cuban teachers, selected from among the doctors working in those countries. The island was ready to provide diagnostic equipment and kits necessary for basic prevention programs and follow up and anti-retroviral treatment for 30,000 patients. The only hitch was obtaining what Cuba doesn’t possess and couldn’t buy. ""All it would take is for the international community to provide the raw materials for the medicines, the equipment and material resources for these products and services. Cuba would not obtain any profits, and would pay salaries in its national currency, thus taking on the most expensive part for international health agencies, as well as the most difficult part, which is to ensure that the professionals are prepared and ready to begin their work,"" Lage told the UN. What could have been an amazing humanitarian undertaking never took place. The Cuban offer went unanswered because of the blockade and uncaring politics. Now with Barack Obama in the White House, and an ear predictably more sensitive to Africa and African-Americans, the offer should be restated and reconsidered. If the deal gelled a lot of people would benefit, and Cuba and the US would be a new footing."
17,Learning Politics Using Board Games,politics," Many board games are based on some realistic life experiences, some deal with sports, real estate, and even banking.

18,"Barack Obama – Senator to President-hopeful, President of the United States",politics," Relationships! The definitive Advice as to whether a presidential candidate would win the election and eventually become the President of the United States could be verified, among other things, by computing whether there is any propensity for  long-term relationships with his (for the time being) nominated vice president. The Democratic Party has chosen Barack Obama, the junior United States Senator from Illinois as its nominee to compete against the Republican Party's John McCain from Arizona in the forth-coming United States presidential election of 2008. The 2008 presidential election is the first time in the U.S. history that two sitting senators will run against each other for the presidency of the United States, and more importantly, it is also the first time an African American has become a presidential nominee for a major party, as well as the first time both candidates of the two major parties -- Democratic and Republican, were born outside the continental U. S. A. -- Hawaii for Obama and the Panama Canal Zone for McCain. On November 4, 2008, the Election Day in all fifty states and the District of Columbia, registered voters will cast votes for presidential candidates nominated and listed. They will however only select their state's members of Electoral College and thereby indirectly vote for their presidential candidates. On December 15, 2008, members of the U. S. Electoral College will meet in their respective state capital to officially cast their votes for President and Vice President. On January 6, 2009, Electoral votes will officially be tallied before both chambers of Congress -- the Senate and the House of Representatives. On January 20, 2009, the constitutionally set Inauguration Day, Barack H. Obama, Jr. will become the 44th President of the United States and Joseph R. Biden, Jr. the 47th Vice President of the United States. Barack H. Obama, Jr. (born August 4, 1961) announced his candidacy for the presidency of the United States in Springfield, Illinois, on February 10, 2007. On August 27, 2008 he became the nominee of the Democratic Party for the 2008 presidential election. Shortly after midnight on August 23, 2008, Barack Obama’s campaign announced, by way of text message to their supporters, that Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware has become the Vice Presidential candidate. Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (born November 20, 1942) is the senior United States Senator from Delaware. Biden is both the Vice Presidential candidate for the 2008 November election and a candidate for re-election in the U.S. Senate. On Wednesday, February 6, 2008, the day after the Super Tuesday -- the single biggest U. S. presidential primary day, Best-Relationship-Advice made a bold and definitive advice that the then Senator Obama, now presidential nominee, or better called President-hopeful, will become President-elect at the end of 2008. Subsequent to the announcement of the partnership with Senator Joe Biden, Best-Relationship-Advice has carefully computed definitively the Relationship between the presidential candidate, Obama, and the vice Presidential candidate, Biden. The result is stunning -- there is absolute propensity for a long-term partnership. In the current situation that they are teamed up for the 2008 presidential campaign, this could only lead to one single conclusion, that Barack Obama and Joe Biden will become President and Vice President of the United States in the 2008 Election. Parallel study has been made on John McCain and Sarah Palin. The result is affirmative, that the presidential and vice presidential candidates of the Republican Party do not reflect any long-term relationship in the coming years. The result is therefore conclusive, which duly coincides with the same piece of advice given before based upon a totally different methodology by Best Relationship Advice. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof!"
19,American Anti-Terrorist Campaigns 1908 - 2008,politics," The capture of badly wounded Papa Faustino Ablen, his subsequent recovery, trial for brigandage (thievery, abduction, extortion, etc.,) and his execution in August of 1907 broke the back of the Dios-Dios Pulahanes as a major insurgency. His principal sub-chiefs, Felipe Ydos, Espiridion Rota, Afroniano Fernandez and other sub-chiefs were also hanged.  Lesser officers were sentenced to long prison terms.  Recruits received lesser punishments. Many Pulahan members from Leyte and Samar, to put some distance between themselves and their former enemies they had preyed upon, moved to Mindanao.  They continued to live in small remote communes and to practice their apocalyptic beliefs of the ""golden heaven"" they’d seen in Ablen’s dagger handle. Continuing government harassment resulted in more conflicts such as the 1924 Colorum Uprising in Surigao.  To this year 2008, the influence of the Pulahanes is still found in Christian sects throughout Mindanao.1. Millenarianism took root in the Philippines as a result of oppressive Spanish policies during the colonial period. The Dios-Dios movement was really driven by a desire to radically change their society.  They awaited the appearance of the ""great city"" they saw in Ablen’s bolo handle, the resurrection of the dead, the victory over their enemies through their magical prayers and amulets.  At first they just withdrew to their mountain retreats and lived passively. When America defeated Spain in the Spanish American War, the Pulahanes helped the Philippine insurgency under Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy in the anti-colonial American struggle.  But after Aguinaldo surrendered they continued their insurgency until the capture of Faustino Ablen.  They targeted not only Americans but also their fellow Filipinos who had been their enemies before the Americans came. It is interesting to note that the Pulahanes, as a group never (to this day) surrendered.2. America’s Future – The Terrorist Threat In The Late 20th And Early 21st Centuries Newspaper and television reports continue to allude to Al Qaeda Terrorist cells in the United States.  Some accounts center them in radical Islamic Mosques led by Fundamentalist Imams like the Mosques in Los Angeles and San Diego among others. Islamic terrorism is a serious threat not only to American and West European values but also to the rest of the Islamic World, most of which do not hold Fundamentalist radical views but are terrified (with some exceptions) to take a public stand against the Al Qaeda and Taliban brand of Islam because Islamic terrorists have demonstrated in Iraq and Afghanistan that they do not hesitate to blow up fellow Muslims who do not support their radical beliefs. As many as seventy-seven thousand terrorist targets, are currently listed, with our seaport areas having major vulnerability. Reform of our terrorist-fighting infrastructure is an urgent ongoing endeavor in which both candidates for President in the fall of 2008 endorse though each of them has his own specific plan that differs from the other candidates plan. Conclusion The American Anti-Terrorist Campaign of the first eight years of the twenty-first century came gradually.  It received its most significant ""push"" with the bombing of the twin towers in New York City in September 2001. This time we have groups like the Taliban and Al Qaeda.  They too have their charismatic leaders, principal of whom is Osama Bin Laden. Bin Laden is similar to Aguinaldo and Ablen in several ways.  He wants to ""free"" his people who are Conservative, Fundamentalist Muslims, to preserve their way of life and culture, from the ""infidels"" who collectively are non-Muslim or what he considers to be liberal Muslims who have betrayed their faith. Bin Laden also has the support of many Muslims, both the elite and wealthy as well as ordinary persons of modest means. Like Ablen, Bin Laden promises his people who give their lives for the cause a glorious life in heaven. But there the similarity between the American Anti-Terrorist campaigns of 1900-1902 and 1903-07 in the Philippines, and the 2001-2008 (and still ongoing) end. The current Anti-Terrorist Campaign is much broader in scope and intensity.  Unlike Aguinaldo and Ablen whose focus was to ""free"" the Philippines from the American invaders, Bin Laden wants freedom from all non-Muslim political and religious ideas and to impose his version of Islam on the entire world. Many more people have been and are being killed.  Many more nations are involved. It is really a clash of cultures, radically different ways of life.  It is a struggle, the end of which, no one can accurately predict. The current struggle grows increasingly more and more worldwide, and no one has yet found the way to end it and restore peace. We are in the midst of another American led Anti-Terrorist Campaign but this one is a world-changing event in human history!

20,Dewan  Eboo Pirbhai,politics," Period: (1905-1990) Dewan Sir Eboo Pirbhai, the first Chairman of the Leaders' International Forum, was born at Bombay on May 27, 1905. His father, Pirbhai Gangji belonged to a noble family. He came in Nairobi in 1910 with his family, where he took his early education at the Duke of Gloucester School. Without much formal education, he became a taxi owner-driver in 1926. Based on hard work from this beginning, he built up a vast fleet of vehicles and diversified into servicing the needs of the growing East African safari industry. He married to Kulsoom, the daughter of Karamali Nathoo. She was educated at Seaforth College and Cambridge, and Cheltenhem Ladies College in England. His first debut in community service was when he joined the Volunteer Corps in 1923 at Nairobi at the age of 17 years. In 1937, he was destined to drive the Imam’s car. In 1944, he became the Private Secretary of Prince Aly Khan and his wife. During the Diamond jubilee in Dar-es-Salaam on August 10, 1946, he performed his duties efficiently. The Imam blessed him for his dedicated services and said, ""Mr. Eboo’s name is sure to remain in the history of Islam."" The Imam also told him to start his own petrol pump station. He ventured into the field and became one of the leading car dealers in East Africa. Dewan Sir Eboo Pirbhai rose gradually to prominence, first in Municipal affairs of Nairobi on whose City Council he sat from 1938 to 1943 as a President, and then in national politics as a member of Kenya's Legislative Council from 1948 to 1960. He was also a member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. These were the formative years of Kenya's freedom movement, culminating in the Lancaster House Conference, which eventually led to the country's independence under Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, whose close friend Sir Eboo cherished with affection. He was also a close friend of Daniel Arap Moi, the President of the Republic of Kenya. In recognition of his national services, King George VI awarded him the OBE (Order of British Empire) in 1946 and in 1952 Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II honored him with a Knighthood and the Coronation Medal. He also served as the President of the Central Muslim Association of Kenya from 1938 to 1958. In recognition of his services to the Muslim community, he was awarded the title of Brilliant Star of Zanzibar in 1956, and The Commander of the Green Crescent Cross of the Comores in 1966. He was appointed member of the Nairobi Council from 1938 to 1943, and also became the President of H.R.H. The Aga Khan Supreme Council and Executive Councils for Africa. He was also a member of the Aga Khan Legion in 1946 and during the Diamond jubilee in Africa; he became Imam's private secretary during the tour and was awarded gold moon, diamond ring and a watch. During the first Ismaili Mission Conference held in Dar-es-Salaam on July 20, 1945, he was specially invited to participate in it. The Imam summoned a conference of the Ismaili delegates in Cairo to review the occasion of the Platinum Jubilee upon the completion of 70 years of his Imamate. Dewan Eboo Pirbhai attended the conference. The delegates mutually discussed in the morning and met the Imam at evening on March 15, 1951 in Hotel Semiramese. The Imam emphasized that the programme should be worked out on the pattern of Golden and Diamond Jubilees to improve the social and economical conditions of the Ismailis. The Imam, Mata Salamat and Prince Aly Khan invited them on next day for a lunch at Mohamedali Club and graced them with a photograph. The Imam deputed him to Aden as his High Commissioner with Missionary Jaffer Ali Muhammad Sufi (1908-1963) on December 12, 1955. In Aden, there were hardly 20 to 25 Ismailis. Dewan Sir Eboo Pirbhai held a meeting with the governor and solved the problems faced by the Ismailis. With his efforts, the sites for the Jamatkhana and a graveyard could be arranged for the first time in Aden. He was in a long line of community leaders in Africa, Asia and Middle East and devoted lifetime services for the progress of the jamat worldwide. This encompassed lying sound institutional foundations for the upliftment of the jamat with a network of schools, hospitals, health clinics, business cooperatives, housing societies, investment trusts and an insurance company. He was among the group of supporters of the efforts initiated by Imam Sultan Muhammad Shah, and since continued by Hazar Imam, for the educational advancement of the indigenous East African Muslims as the most effective way of ensuring their full participation in the national life of their countries. During the Takhat Nashini programme of the Imam in East Africa in 1957, he rendered excellent services in Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika. He also accompanied the Imam in 1958 on the visit of Europe, Canada and United State. He was made the Vice-Chairman of the first World Ismailia Socio-Economic Conference held in Karachi on December 15, 1964 and also addressed on behalf of the 54 delegates from African countries like Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Republic of Malagasy, Republic of Congo, Rawandi, Burundi, South Africa, Portuguese East Africa, Aden, etc. In 1972, the Ismailis were expelled from Uganda. On that juncture, he is credited to have settled most of the Ismailis in Canada according to the guidance of the Imam. He also served as Chairman of the Jubilee Insurance Co. since 1953, a Senior Director of the IPS and TPS and the Diamond Jubilee Trust, Chairman of the Aga Khan Foundation (Kenya) since 1980, Chairman of H.H. The Aga Khan Shia Imami Ismaili Supreme Councils for Africa, Canada, United States and Western Europe since 1973, the member of the Board of Governors of the Institute of Ismaili Studies, London, and the Chairman of the Ismaili International Leaders' Forum since 1977. He attended the fourth International Review Meeting of the world Ismailia Associations in Bombay as its Chairman on January 13, 1982. On Sunday, July 11, 1982, the world leaders visited Aiglemont to tender cheerful felicitations on behalf of millions of Ismailis to their beloved Hazar Imam. It was on this day exactly 25 years ago, that the Imam acceded to the throne of Imamate in Geneva. Leaders of jamats represented Africa, Bangladesh, Canada, Europe, India, Kuwait, Kenya, Malagasy, the Middle East, Malaysia, Pakistan, Portugal, Rwanda, Burundi, Syria, Singapore, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States and Zaire and more countries that any other previous jubilees. The Imam made his gracious arrival in a big hall with Begum Salimah, Princess Zahra, Prince Rahim, Prince Husayn, Princess Tajuddawlah, Mata Salamat, Princess Yasmin and Prince Amyn Muhammad. The scene was picturesque, the atmosphere was charged and the exuberance and boundless. Dewan Sir Eboo Pirbhai had the honour to address on behalf of the world jamats and said, ""It feels as though it was only yesterday that the young Prince Karim became our 49th Imam. On the other hand the sheer scope and weight of your achievements in this brief time-span makes us feel as impossible for so much to be achieved in so brief a time-span. For him, this day constituted as milestone in the continuation of the vast work done by Mawlana Hazar Imam’s grandfather. The sheer magnitude of the achievements that were to come could not then be comprehended by the jamat. For, as the 49th Ismaili Imam, you have given unstintedly of your time and energy in guiding us on the Siratul Mustaqim. You are doing so with the paternal, maternal concern and benevolence, and with indulgence that have been the foundation of the unique link between the Imam and the jamat since time immemorial."" The Imam referred to that day as a ""historical occasion"" and prayed the worldwide Ismailis with best loving blessings. By his talent and invaluable services, he merited the titles of Alijah andRai before 1946. He was bestowed the title of Wazir in 1946 and Count in 1954. During the grand occasion of the Silver Jubilee Darbar in London in July 7, 1983, the Imam conferred upon him the title of Dewan for his over 50 years invaluable services. In his farman, the Imam said, ""What I wish to do today is to recognize in an exceptional manner in front of the jamat, the services of a member of the jamat who has served my grandfather, who has served me, and who has served the jamat consistently for more than 50 years, taking even personal risks at times of crisis in the developing world, extending to the jamat all the benefit of his time and wisdom, and I have decided to give the title of Dewan to Count Sir Eboo Pirbhai. This is also a symbol, because the Imam is saying to the jamat that the Imam wishes to recognize publicly, exceptional service by a very young man."" Sir Eboo Pirbhai was present on that occasion and his eyes were moisted with tears when he heard the Imam’s farman. With the help of Wazir Amir Bhatia, he climbed on the stage with his wife and submissively bowed his head, uttering ""amen."" The last few days of his life were marred by illness and physical affliction, which he bore with the same tranquility and peace of mind, which marked his whole path through life. He breathed his last in London on Thursday, January 4, 1990 at the age of 85 years. His funeral service held at the Parkland’s Ismaili Cultural Centre Hall, attended by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Kenya the Hon. Daniel Arap Moi, the Vice President and Minister for Finance Prof. George Saitloti and a host of Cabinet Ministers, the Permanent Secretary to the Cabinet and Head of the Civil Service, members of Parliament, the Nairobi Provincial Commissioner and the British High Commissioner to Kenya, members of the leaders International Forum, office bearers of the Aga Khan Foundation, Geneva, the staff from the Imam’s Secretariat and office bearers of Imamate Institutions in Kenya and overseas, etc. In a message, the Imam said, ""Sir Eboo’s leadership has been a major source of inspiration to members of my community in volunteering their services in various capacities to assist in improving the quality of life of all those among whom they live. Sir Eboo’s life and work spanned the critical years of Kenya’s recent history and the country’s emergence to nationhood in which, as a member of the country’s Legislative Council and a leader of the wider Muslim community, he played a significant role. His quiet and gentle manner, his humility and above all his thoughtfulness and wisdom earned him the esteem and affection of all those, regardless of rank or position, who came in contact with him."" In his message, Daniel Arap Moi, the President of Kenya paid a glowing tribute to him that, ""The late Sir Eboo was a friend of many and he passionately believed in the development and welfare of others. One of his outstanding qualities was his service to the people irrespective of their nationalities. He will always be remembered for spearheading various development projects in this 50 years at the helm of the Ismaili community; he promoted the development and expansion of the community’s institutions. He was respected and admired by all in the Ismaili community and indeed by all Kenyans, the cruel hand of death has taken away an irreplaceable personality from amongst us all. At this time of grief and sorrow, I convey to his bereaved family, His Highness the Aga Khan, the Ismaili community, relatives and friends, my heartfelt sympathies and condolences. May the Good Lord grant them strength and courage to bear the loss."" Sir Michael Blundell, the veteran European leader in Kenya said, ""Sir Eboo was indeed the forerunner and later a leader in the great contribution to the development of Kenya, which has been made by the Ismaili community.¼With His Highness’ support he guided the community along the path of Kenya citizenship at a time when other people were hesitant to take this step. `Eboo’ as he was affectionately and universally known, always supported the idea of a non-racial Kenya in which all communities could play a part and never wavered in its support. The last few years of his life were marred by illness and physical affliction, which he bore with the same tranquility and peace of mind, which marked his whole path through life. Kenya as a country and many individuals in it will be the poorer for his passing away."" In an editorial, the ‘Daily Nation"" of Kenya wrote on January 5, 1990, ""The death of Sir Eboo Pirbhai in London yesterday after a long illness closes a chapter of Kenyan history - a history in which he played a distinguished role as one of the most influential leaders of the Asian communities in this country both before and since independence. A close confidant and friend of the late President Kenyatta and the close friend of President Moi, Sir Eboo never sought the limelight of publicity. He will be remembered above all as a gentle and modest man. His influence was nonetheless profound and throughout his life he worked persistently for moderation and racial harmony at home and abroad. Above all, he will be remembered for his tireless work as a leader of the Ismaili community worldwide and for a life-long devotion to his Imam. At an age when most men have long since retired from active work, Sir Eboo travelled constantly and he will be mourned today by a host of colleagues and friends across the globe. The ""Nation"" salutes the passing of a distinguished Kenyan patriot, one man who devoted so much of his life to the service of his fellow men."" In sum, Dewan Sir Eboo Pirbhai was in a long line of jamati leaders in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, who devoted a lifetime of honorary services towards the vision of Imam Sultan Muhammad Shah and Hazar Imam for the upliftment and progress of the jamat worldwide. This encompassed laying sound institutional foundations for the progress of the jamat with a network of schools, hospitals, health clinics, business cooperatives, housing societies, investment trusts and an insurance company. He was a gentle and modest man. His influence was nonetheless profound and through out his life he worked persistently for moderation and racial harmony at home and abroad. He will be remembered for his tireless work as a leader of the Ismaili community worldwide and for a life-long devotion to the Imam. On November 2, 1990, the Imam paid rich tribute once again to Dewan Eboo Pirbhai before the African Delegation at Aiglemont, France that, ""The principle of honorary service, the principle of concern for the weak, the principle of love and affection, of never letting personal differences affect the service that one renders to the jamat. These are principles, which I will always sustain, defend and remind you of them whenever it is necessary.
