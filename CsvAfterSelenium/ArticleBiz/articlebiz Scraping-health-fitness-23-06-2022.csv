1,What to do if you need arch support?,health-fitness," Our feet evolved to walk on soft and uneven ground. It did not evolve to walk on concrete. That mismatch is what many think may be the reason for a lot of the foot problems that we have today. The concrete and need for protection from the environment means that we need to wear shoes. Those shoes can deform and weaken feet. This can lead to deformities of the toes, bunions and fallen arches because of the weakness. This leads to discussion of if our footwear should have arch supports built into them or does it mean we should stop wearing shoes and do exercises to strengthen the arch muscles. Probably either extreme is not that practical. The foot is quote capable of supporting itself well and has its own built in arch supporting mechanism called the windlass mechanism. However, is the long-term wearing of shoes interfering with this mechanism, then the foot may need some extra support built into them or other options for support. There are many different options available to support the foot if that extra arch support is needed. You could use the over-the-counter inserts that you can buy at retail. They typically work well for those that have a minor problem and are a much better alternative that the more costly ones. The only problem with this approach is that it can be a bit hit-and-miss as to if what you buy matches what your foot’s shape which means that it may or may not help. The other option is to see a podiatrist for a custom-made device. They will be able to work out what your foot needs and then take a plaster cast or take a digital scan and send that to a foot orthotic laboratory to have them make a custom-made device that matches your foot shape perfectly and has additions to change the foot the way in which the podiatrist diagnoses that it should be changed.  The research evidence that these types of supports do work better, but they are probably not better for the simpler easier problems in which the over-the-counter foot supports can work for. There are other options. There are exercises that can be done to help support the foot and they should be encouraged. However, if you have a painful problem now, it is going to take a while for the exercises to help and foot supports can work right now at helping the problems, so its going to be a balance if you need a bit of both in the early stages. Another option is footwear that has some arch support built in. A number of running shoes have support built into them and can be used for this. These shoes have a similar amount of support as the over-the-counter arch supports but can be a practical option. Some brands of flip-flops also have an arch support built into them and could be worth a try. Even those who use foot orthotics also like using these flip-flops to mix it up with these."
2,Dealing with the consequences of trauma to the toenails,health-fitness," Damage to a toe nail may be especially unpleasant, particularly when it's an acute occurrence. This kind of trauma can result in an initial acute issue or persistent long term issue with the toe nail thickness and also the shape. The actual acute injury for instance coming from an accident or severely banging the foot is apparent if it takes place. What is not so obvious is the nail changes which happen from injury, however no problems are seen until months later on once the toenail gets thicker and misshaped. The most typical cause for a disability to a toenail is injury. This injury might originate from a one-off occurrence such as dropping a large rock on the foot or it might appear with the repetitive injury with wearing footwear that happen to be too restricted and the constant strain on the nail from that. It may also originate from losing the toe nail through the foot sliding around in the footwear, for instance in tennis footwear. This specific damage could affect a single or multiple or all of the toe nails. The toe nail plate becomes thicker as a consequence of harm to the toe nail matrix or growing section of the toe nail. As well as getting thicker this nail plate can also be distorted or misshaped. If your toenail plate is simply thicker, this gets identified as onychauxis. When the nail plate is misshaped along with thick, then that gets known as onychogryphosis. If following the toe nail is traumatised and the toenail growing area is just not impaired, the toenail can re-grow a standard thickness, but may have a ridge of thicker section of toenail that grows out as the toe nail grows. To treat the acute toe nail damage, there's going to have to be some medicine to help with pain alleviation. Any parts of the nail that can be cleaned up and removed without any issues really should be detached. The toenails as well as the vicinity need to be thoroughly cleaned out with an antiseptic. In some cases what is left of the nail is removed with a local anesthetic. It is important that the nail is safe using a wound bandage and when there is an open wound present, safeguards need to be taken to stop any contamination occurring. The management of the onychauxis along with onychogryphosis disorders need a long term strategy and not simply the one-off treatments for the acute trauma. Decent handling of the acute episode will reduce the danger of these types of thicker nail kinds of disorders. The best way to take care of the onychauxis type issues will be to keep the toe nails cut short and taking advantage of a nail file to reduce the thicker nail. This will take plenty of effort, particularly if the toenail is deformed as well. It is usually a great idea to go to the podiatrist to help get the nails cut and lowered down. The podiatrist will typically make use of a high-speed drill to reduce the thicker nail. Unfortunately, when the damage is within the growing portion of the toenail it's going to only thicken up once again meaning that onychauxis can be an recurring issue. When they do end up being very hard to take care of, then permanent surgery with the nail can be an alternative."

4,Health Benefits of Red Onions,health-fitness," Onions (Allium) are bulb vegetables related to chives, garlic, scallions, shallots, and leeks. They contain high levels of ANTIOXIDANTS and sulfur-containing compound levels linked to reduced cancer risk, lower blood sugar levels, and better bone health. Highly versatile, onions are excellent flavorings and can be cooked any way without losing their goodness. You can bake, boil, grill, fry, roast, or sauté the things and even eat them raw. Onions come in many sizes, shapes, and colors, but seemingly red onions are best as their pigmentation is due to the presence of ANTHOCYANINS. The taste of onions ranges from mild and sweet to sharp and spicy, depending on the variety, season, and age. They can be eaten before they mature, the youngest being scallions and spring or summer onions. Red onions are called SPANISH or PURPLE onions and are very mild with a sweetish taste. There are four varieties: TURDA onions from Central Romania with their particular aroma TROPEA onions from Italy with a strong and sweet taste WETHERSFIELD red onion from the US CONNECTICUT red onion, also from the US. Red onions have more health benefits than white onions. They provide ten percent of the vitamin C RDA, but red onions contain MORE antioxidants. Although White onion has more fiber and sulfur, red onion has more FLAVONOLS and anthocyanins. For example, the total anthocyanin contents determined by the pH differential method were on average 0.75 mg per 100 g fresh weight in white onion, 9.64 mg per100 g in yellow onion, and a huge 30 mg per 100 g in red onion, respectively. So, the anthocyanin content in onions is red>yellow>white. The average flavonoid contents of onions with three different colors are 36.64 and 111.10 mg per 100 g in yellow and red, respectively, whereas white onion contains none. Red onions are also a more effective natural blood thinner than white onions because of their flavonoids, which help thin the blood. In addition, the phytochemicals in red onion help boost the immune system. They are also rich in vitamins K, B6, and C. However, the phytochemicals act as a stimulant to vitamin C within the body. The fiber in red onions helps digestion and prevents constipation. As for minerals, red onion contains CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM, POTASSIUM, CHROMIUM, IRON, and MANGANESE. It also contains folate and thiamine. The chromium is suitable for people with diabetes as it impacts blood sugar levels by slowing and controlling the release of sugar into the body. Because chromium affects insulin activity, a lack of it may cause weight gain, so if you want to lose weight, eat red onions! Among the antioxidants in red onion is QUERCETIN. Antioxidants fight the free radicals, which are toxic organic waste. However, they are considered dangerous because they can cause cancer by mutating DNA. Because of that, quercetin is most valued as studies show that it can even reduce the spreading of cancer through the body. Interestingly, studies showed that consuming half a red onion each day may reduce the risk of stomach cancer by a half. For example, in Georgia, USA, where red onion is grown, the number of stomach cancer cases is half the US average. Similar data comes from China, where red onion is mainly used. Quercetin also helps to regulate blood pressure. According to a study by the University of Utah, this antioxidant can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. Quercetin is also an anti-inflammatory, so it benefits people suffering from allergies, asthma, and arthritis. Red onion’s anti-inflammatory powers help acne sufferers. Applying red onion mixed with honey or olive oil to the affected areas of the face reduces redness and swelling. If you get stung by a bee or wasp, apply red onion to the injured area, and you will get instant relief from the burning sensation. That is because red onion helps neutralize the harmful effects of the cocktail of substances injected by these stinging insects, which includes mast-cell degranulation protein, hyaluronidase, acid phosphatase, lysophospholipase, histamine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Red onion is a very low glycemic food with a glycemic index of GI, so it is ideal when dieting. In addition, 25 g contains only 11 calories and zero fat. If you have ringing in the ears due to tinnitus, or earache, a few drops of red onion in the ear may help. Does red onion have side effects? To some people, it has, especially those with an onion allergy. Onions give them itchy eyes, redness, and rashes. It may also cause them to vomit and suffer gastric problems. All in all, red onions are full of antioxidants, and may help fight several maladies. They are high in quercetin and form part of a healthy diet. If you know what you are doing, the above will help you get and maintain the essential minerals your body needs from red onions."
5,The Correlation of Gut Health and Mental Health,health-fitness," Close your eyes and think of your favorite food, maybe it's salt and vinegar chips? Now scan your body for any changes that may have arisen. Is your mouth watering or are you feeling a bit more hungry than you did before? This is a perfect example of how our central nervous system plays a role in our enteric nervous system (the mesh- like system of neurons that governs the function of the gastrointestinal tract). This specific example -as described by Alessio Fasano and Suzie Flaherty in the online book “Gut Feelings"" is referred to as the Pavlovian Response- meaning that an outside stimulus like a sound of a word produces an intrinsic response. This portion of the Gut- Brain Axis is widely understood and accepted because it is easy to understand. Think about it! We feel it everyday whether we are hungry after hearing the word “pizza” or not being able to eat before your first day at a new job. It all has to do with the role your brain plays on your stomach. This correlation is also made incredibly clear in the  rate of comorbidity of the gastrointestinal disorder- Irritable Bowel Syndrome I.B.S. for short and neurological disorders like Anxiety or Depression. I.B.S. is described as a miscommunication of the neuroendocrine signals and effector nerves inside the GI Tract usually by the perceived stressors in that individual's environment; this could be anxiety brought upon by social factors, or an individual’s behavior or thought patterns (Fasano et al. 2021). What is a little more difficult to grasp and has just recently been studied is how the Gut- Brain Axis functions in reverse. Meaning how the enteric nervous system can also influence the central nervous system in the same way. Pioneers in the psychological field started by collecting massive amounts of research that connected gut bacteria and neurological disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Anxiety, Epilepsy, and Parkinson’s just to name a few (Fasano et al. 2021). What all people suffering with these disorders had in common was that the microbiome of their stomach was lacking in biodiversity (Bastiaanssen et al. 2020). Diving deeper into this concept that the G.I. Tract influences the central nervous system through the use of pro and prebiotics. First let us define what pro and prebiotics are. Probiotics are microorganisms that promote gut health and can be found in yogurts or fermented food. Prebiotics are non- digestible food particles that promote the host to create beneficial bacteria in the colon that aids in digestion. Studies suggest that participants who took probiotics to cure their I.B.S. also saw major improvements in their anxiety symptoms as well (Bastiaanssen et al. 2020). For comparison there are around 500 different species of microflora in the gastrointestinal tract . That is ten times the amount of white blood cells we harness in our body (McEwan et al. 2019). Some experts believe that the close relationship between the gut and brain goes back to our developmental stages. Pertaining to the ectoderm ( one of the three germ levels of an embryo) that is where the formation of both the G.I. Tract and the brain take place. This could give reason to the close functioning or communication of hormonal signals, nerve networks, and endocrine signaling between these two body systems (Fasano et al. 2021) In conclusion, the importance of these two systems is undeniable for reasons listed above. Think about the major roles these two partake in each other the next time you’re thinking about buying fast food instead of properly preparing a meal or just skipping a meal in general. It could be the difference between a productive day or a lousy one."

Unless you are in the right head-space you will not be in the right frame of mind to make the right choices as far as what you eat.

Understand that for every person who appears in those testimonials there are countless others who were unsuccessful despite all their efforts. The success stories you read of are often exaggerated. Take no notice of the before and after adverts. The only before and after photos you should concern yourself with are your own. An unflattering photo is always used for the before photo.You do not know what goes on in order to produce such a flattering image in the after photo. Make gradual changes to your diet in order for your body to become accustomed to a different routine whether that is changes to your diet or a new fitness regime. Develop good habits by taking bite-sized changes. It will all take time but it is better than trying to achieve too much in a short time then losing heart and giving up. Rome wasn't built in a day and neither was anything else worth achieving so be patient. It may be frustrating when you are not making much progress. Don't lose heart, just keep to your healthy living plan and you will at least be satisfied that you are doing the right thing. Focus on your hobbies and this will keep your mind off worries. Enjoy living your life despite your circumstances. This is essential for your well-being because unless you are in the right head-space your efforts to control your weight will be in vain.

In fact, evidence released by alzheimers.org.uk suggests that keeping a regular exercise regime may reduce the risk of dementia by 30%. Eating a healthy, balanced diet helps to keep your brain functioning at optimal levels and reduces inflammatory markers, which may play a role in cognitive decline. The MIND Diet: How Does It Help? There are two diets that are particularly eﬃcient in preventing cognitive decline: the Mediterranean Diet and the DASH Diet. The Mediterranean diet is high in lean protein, unsaturated fats, fish, and fruits and vegetables, and wholegrain foods, and low in refined carbohydrates, saturated fats, and sugary foods. The DASH diet, standing for Dietary Approaches To Stop Hypertension, focuses on reducing symptoms of high blood pressure (hypertension), and contains foods which are high in magnesium, calcium and potassium, and restricts foods that have high levels of sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. The MIND Diet combines both these diets to achieve a balanced diet that is high in essential nutrients and fats, while reducing levels of fat, refined sugar, and sodium. The MIND diet also contains high levels of foods that have been found to boost cognitive health and brain function, including: •	Leafy greens, which are high in nutrients linked to better brain health, including folate, Vitamin E, flavonoids, and carotenoids. The diet recommends at least 6 servings of leafy greens weekly. •	Nuts full of fat-soluble Vitamin E, which is essential for brain health and resilience. Snack on a handful of nuts a few times a week instead of empty-calorie foods like crisps or sweets. •	Berries should be eaten twice a week on the MIND Diet. In a 20-year study on 16,000 older adults, those who ate the most blueberries and strawberries had the lowest rates of cognitive decline. Authors credited this diﬀerence to the flavonoids found in the berries, but more research is required in this area. •	Oily fish has been proven to have a positive impact on brain health and cognition. This benefit has been speculatively attributed to Omegas 3 and 6, however studies specifically on Omega nutrients have been inconclusive. It’s has been suggested that this benefit may be due to the oils and nutrients in the fish itself. The MIND diet therefore recommends oily fish at least once a week. •	Beans are high in B Vitamins, which are known for their role in promoting brain health. Participants should limit their red meat consumption and increase their levels of low carbohydrate plant-based foods. •	Wholegrains, 3 or more per day •	Poultry, 2 or more servings weekly •	Wine (optional), one glass per day Why The MIND Diet Works Researchers suggest that one of the ways that the MIND Diet works is by reducing levels of harmful beta-amyloid proteins, which are increased by high levels of saturated fats and trans fats. While beta-amyloids are naturally found in the body, eating too many saturated and trans fats may cause them to build up, forming ‘plaques’ that interrupt brain cell communication and lead to cell death. High levels of vitamins and antioxidants, however, may help to prevent these plaques from building up in the first place, so the MIND diet focuses on nutrient rich, low sugar and low-fat foods. Antioxidants also help to prevent oxidative stress and inflammation, which are two other known contributors to the development of cognitive impairments. Following the Mediterranean Diet and DASH diet is associated with lower levels of oxidative stress, so this is also likely to be the case for the MIND Diet. In conclusion, the MIND Diet is an evidence-based approach which builds on our current understanding of how our food aﬀects our cognitive health. Using principles from both the Mediterranean Diet and the DASH diet means that it has all the nutritional value of a healthy balanced diet, while avoiding the high levels of saturated fats, sugars, and sodium which may cause oxidative stress and beta-amyloid brain plaques. Be aware however, that adding light exercise to this regime is essential to getting the full benefit out of the MIND Diet."
10,3 Ways Coconut Water Can Benefit You Quickly,health-fitness," Are you having problems gaining the minerals in your diet that you need? Want to have peace of mind that you are getting all the essential minerals your body needs to stay healthy? Well, here are three easy ways coconut water can quickly help. But first, a bit about the coconut. The coconut tree (Cocos nucifera) is a palm tree from the Arecaceae family of plants that originate from Island Southeast Asia and spread some 6,000 years ago via seaborne migrations to the Pacific, Madagascar, and Comoros. The name coconut is from the Portuguese word coco, which means ‘head’ or ‘skull’ because the three indentations on the coconut shell resemble a face. Coco and coconut appear to date from 1521, when Iberian explorers found the large nuts, which reminded them of a ghost or witch in Portuguese folklore called ‘coco.’ Botanically, the coconut is a DRUPE, not a nut, with the outer yellow-green-brown glossy skin being the exocarp. The tough fiber or coir is the mesocarp, which has many commercial uses. The exocarp and the mesocarp make up the coconut “husk,” and the endocarp is the hard coconut “shell.” Inside the endocarp is a hollow, initially filled with a liquid endosperm called “coconut water,” which is this article’s subject. Coconut water is 94% water with very little fat. As the drupe matures, the coconut water becomes solid endosperm or white “coconut meat or flesh,” which later nourishes the newly germinating coconut tree if allowed by farmers. A coconut drupe takes 10-12 months to mature. Do not confuse coconut water with coconut milk, which is made by adding water to grated coconut meat. Coconut milk contains 50 percent water and is relatively high in fat. 3 Health Benefits of Coconut Water #1. Coconut water is slightly sweet and nutty and loaded with minerals. A cupful or a quarter of a liter contains just 60 calories and the following MINERALS: Calcium: 4% of the Recommended Daily Amount (RDA) Magnesium: 4% of the RDA Phosphorus: 2% of the RDA Potassium: 15% of the RDA #2. Research indicates that coconut water contains ANTIOXIDANTS which may counter the harmful effects of free radicals. #3. Coconut water is an HYDRATOR. It is a beverage for restoring hydration and replenishing electrolytes such as potassium and magnesium lost during exercise. In addition to these three health benefits, coconut water is slightly sweet with a subtle, nutty flavor. It is freshest directly out of the fruit. However, it is impractical to fill the fridge with fresh coconuts, so many brands of coconut water are available in the shops. However, read the ingredients to verify you are getting 100 percent coconut water, as some bottled brands contain added sugar or flavoring agents. In cooking, coconut water is an excellent base for smoothies, chia seed pudding, and vinaigrette dressing. Use it as a substitute for plain water whenever a little natural sweetness is desired. Your ultimate levels of minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants from coconut water can be reached if you take note of the principles given in this article. Getting the proper mineral balance is not a pipe dream and has nothing to do with genetic makeup. Use the information here, and very soon, you will have confidence and satisfaction that you have the correct minerals and antioxidants your body needs from coconut water."

However, there are also regular Convictions - including heavy fines. Cannabis products are used because of their acute mental health. Side effects are often not well tolerated, or may be due to it if these side effects are not administered at the doses indicated for adequate therapy would actually be necessary. The cans, at which psychological side effects occur vary greatly from person to person and are usually between 5 and 20 milligrams of THC per day. To avoid psychological side effects, one should start treatment with low doses and then increase the dose slowly over the next few days and weeks until the required amount. The most medicinally active ingredient in the hemp plant (cannabis) is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (abbreviated: THC). Medical Drugs containing THC and products from Hemp plants, which contain a lot of THC, are used. The natural and medicinally effective products from the hemp plant include herbal cannabis (marijuana) and cannabis resin (hashish). This chapter contains some more detailed explanations of the Cannabis plant, its relevant ingredients and their mode of action as well as the different CBD oil products. Also find At the end of this chapter you will find an overview of the main terms and are briefly explained again. Cannabis and cannabinoids - an introduction Cannabis sativa L. (Cannabis sativa Linné), Cannabis for short, is the Latin name for the hemp plant. She belongs to the order of nettle-like plants. Along with the genus Humulus (Hop) Cannabis belongs to the Cannabidaceae family (cannabis-like). Hemp is a green, generally annual Plant. Low-THC hemp strains are occasionally called fiber hemp or industrial hemp and are allowed in about 30 countries around the world, including in Australia, grown to make fibers for the industry and to gain hemp seeds for nutrition. fiber hemp may contain a maximum of 0.2 percent THC in the European Union, so that intoxication with this hemp is definitely excluded can be. THC-rich hemp varieties can be called drug hemp will. Marijuana and hashish are obtained from them. The female plants have a higher THC content than male, so that for marijuana and hash production usually only the female plants are used. The hemp plant contains characteristic ingredients, which are called cannabinoids. To date, more than 100 found various cannabinoids, the majority of which are ten assigned to groups. The most important group is the THC group with nine different cannabinoids. The most important Representative of this group is the delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol or Delta-9-THC or THC for short. The international Generic name for the THC that occurs naturally in the hemp plant is dronabinol. It is both medical for most Properties as well as for the characteristic mental effects of CBD oil.. For example, it works uplifting, muscle relaxant, antiepileptic, anti-nausea, appetite-enhancing, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, lowering intraocular pressure, expanding bronchi, calming and pain-relieving. As a rule, the respective medicinal effect is through a daily intake of about 5 to 30 milligrams of the cannabis active ingredient THC. The second most important cannabinoid group is the cannabidiol group. Cannabidiol (CBD) is mainly found in fiber hemp and some Hashish types available. Unlike THC, it causes no psychological effects and effective in sufficiently high doses it even counteracts the psychological effects of THC. However it can enhance the pain-relieving properties of THC. Cannabidiol also has a calming, anti-inflammatory, antiepileptic, anxiolytic, antipsychotic and intraocular pressure sinking. However, when compared to THC, these effects are reduced only achieved with comparatively large amounts of cannabidiol. Usually there are only three to four different ones in one plant Cannabinoids in relevant concentrations, while the rest do not or are only represented in traces. In drug hemp varieties from which Marijuana and hashish is obtained, THC comes in high Concentration from 1 to 25 percent while in fiber hemp Cannabidiol with a content of about 0.5 to 1 percent prevails. The mode of action of plant cannabinoids in the human Body is similar to the mechanism of action of certain endogenous Substances called endocannabinoids (from the Greek endo, ""inside""). Endocannabinoids are cannabinoids those formed by the human body itself and not from the outside have to be included. Endocannabinoids and herbal Cannabinoids share a similar chemical structure. The Effects of both endocannabinoids and Cannabinoids rely on the recognition and binding of certain Binding sites located on the surface of many body cells. These binding sites are called cannabinoid receptors. The endocannabinoids are among the natural messengers in the brain and other organs Send messages about the state of the body. Tie Cannabinoids to their respective receptors, so in the affected cell triggered certain reactions. While that is the body's own cannabinoid system, for example in regulation of appetite, the perception of sensory impressions and pain and the coordination of movements. Due to the similarity of the mechanisms of action of the body's own and the vegetable"
12,3 Easy Ways Dark Chocolate Can Benefit You Quickly,health-fitness," Are you having problems gaining the minerals in your diet that you need? Want to have peace of mind that you are getting all the essential minerals your body needs to stay healthy? Well, here are three easy ways dark chocolate can quickly help. But first, a bit about the cocoa plant. The cocoa plant (Theobroma cacao) is a fruit from the cocoa tree, a 12 m evergreen in the family Malvaceae. Its seeds are cocoa beans, which are used to make chocolate liquor, cocoa solids, cocoa butter, and chocolate. The cocoa family of plants originates from southeastern Mexico to the Amazon basin. The healthy form of chocolate consists of 70%, 80%, and 90% cocoa as these have LESS added SUGAR. The 3 Health Benefits of Dark Chocolate Dark chocolate is LOADED with nutrients that can actually be good for you, but not a lot of people know that. It is made from the cacao tree’s seed and is one of the BEST sources of antioxidants. But don’t get too excited. Dark chocolate has its downsides if eaten to excess. Here are two fundamental benefits of dark chocolate and another ‘maybe’ benefit. #1. QUALITY dark chocolate with a HIGH cocoa content is nutritious with soluble fiber and, most importantly, MINERALS. 100 g of 80 percent dark cocoa contains two-thirds of the RDA for iron, a third of the RDA for magnesium, 90 percent for copper, and NEARLY ALL the manganese. It also has some phosphorus, potassium, selenium, and zinc. #2. UNPROCESSED cocoa beans are loaded with antioxidants such as polyphenols, flavanols, and catechins. #3. This is the IFFY bit: Compounds in dark chocolate APPEAR to be HIGHLY protective against the oxidation of LOW-DENSITY lipoprotein, or LDL for short. LDL cholesterol is said to be “bad” cholesterol because it collects in the walls of blood vessels, therefore increasing the chances of health problems such as heart attacks or strokes. But the body NEEDS LDL to protect its nerves and make healthy cells and hormones. Some cholesterol comes from food, and the liver makes more. Cholesterol is insoluble in blood, so proteins carry it where it needs to go. These protein carriers are called LIPOPROTEINS. Most of the cholesterol in the body is LDL. The rest is HIGH-DENSITY lipoprotein or HDL for short. HDL cholesterol is said to be “good” cholesterol because HDL channels LDL to the liver, where it is FLUSHED OUT of the body. Some believe that high HDL levels might protect against heart attacks and strokes. Chemically, LDL is a tiny blob made up of an outer rim of lipoprotein with a cholesterol center. In the long run, eating dark chocolate SHOULD cause much less cholesterol to lodge in the arteries, resulting in a LOWER risk of heart disease. For example, a study showed that eating chocolate twice a week lowers the risk of plaque calcification in the arteries by a third. However, consuming dark chocolate less often had no effect. All in all, dark chocolate is tasty, contains much-needed minerals, and is packed with antioxidants such as polyphenols, flavanols, and catechins, but the cholesterol thing is not absolutely certain. Your ultimate levels of minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants from dark chocolate can be reached if you take note of the principles given in this article. Getting the proper mineral balance is not a pipe dream and has nothing to do with genetic makeup. Use the information here, and very soon, you will have confidence and satisfaction that you have the correct minerals, vitamins, antioxidants, and especially the polyphenols, flavanols, and catechins your body needs that come from dark chocolate."
13,Can Men with Prostatitis Be Better with the Coming of Summer?,health-fitness," In hot summer, the secretion of sweat glands of patients with prostatitis will increase, and the number of urine will be naturally reduced. In addition, the warm climate can make the focus muscle relax, blood vessels expand, blood circulation accelerate, relieve the edema and congestion of prostate, the urethra can be temporarily unblocked, resulting in the ""illusion"" of inflammation reduction"". Some patients who take medicine for a long time think this phenomenon is the effect of taking medication for a long time. Taking antibiotics for chronic prostatitis will have a specific impact, but it is difficult to break the roots. Prostatitis is a particular tissue organ with a hard lipid membrane, which is a drug barrier, making it difficult for antibiotics to penetrate the prostate. Therefore, many patients with prostatitis will go back and forth. The warm weather will ease the pain, the cold weather, those annoying symptoms of frequent urination and urgency will come back. Therefore, if you want to cure the prostate, you need to customize a proper method according to the severity of the disease, such as herbal medicine Diuretic and Anti-inflammatory Pill. The pill is made mainly from leaves, flowers, and seeds and roots of natural plants such as honeysuckle, cape jasmine, yam, liquorice, etc. They won't cause any harm to the body. It repairs damaged tissue, removes toxins, and restores the reproductive system. At the same time, it can improve your immunity and self-healing ability, enhance the defense ability against bacteria and infection, and prevent the recurrence of the disease. During the treatment, what should we do to maintain the prostate in summer? Water can play a role in metabolism for the human body. Drink more water can be conducive to urination, the body of toxins quickly discharged, reducing the retention time of toxins in the body. Drink a little more water every day, and you can thoroughly flush the urethra through urine, which helps discharge the secretion inside the prostate. Because spicy food can stimulate the prostate, if you often eat it, it is likely to have a burning feeling and urethral discomfort, in some severe cases, it will cause edema and congestion of the prostate. Therefore, we must eat less at ordinary times. In addition, alcohol may cause your capillaries to become congested, causing edema. To ensure a healthy prostate, a male should not wear tight underwear. Because wearing tight clothes is not good for our health. And it can squeeze the private areas, especially when people sweat a lot in summer. If you hold urine regularly, it may affect your bladder and prostate. So don't hold your urine. For the prevention of prostatitis, the most important thing is to control your sex. Prostatitis patients can have a normal sexual life, as long as they avoid being excessive. Otherwise, it will aggravate the prostate's inflammation. Try to eat some light food and have each of your meals at a regular time, avoid over-working or staying up too late."

15,Kenneth’s Story: A Poignant Example of How Evidence-Based Care Can Improve Patient Outcomes in the Intensive Care Unit,health-fitness," In my haste to convey the horror experienced by so many patients who have been sedated and immobilized in the ICU, the case studies I’ve published have not had particularly happy endings. So far, the cases I’ve detailed have involved either the patient dying, being traumatized by the delirium they suffered while under sedation, or otherwise having to walk a long, long road to recovery. That being said, I figured it would be a good idea to start publishing more positive stories of how evidence-based practices have actually helped to improve patient outcomes in the intensive care unit. I think up until this point, I’ve overlooked how important these happy endings can be for putting things into perspective for people. They provide additional context, offer an encouraging contrast to offset all the tragedy, and work to illustrate where I would like things to go in terms of how ICU patients are treated. The case I’m about to describe involves a man whose experience in the ICU offers a poignant example of how evidence-based practices can improve ICU patient outcomes. If he’d been subjected to the treatment typical of most intensive care units, the outcome of his ICU stay would have been much different, and it probably would have been for the worse. Luckily for him, things didn’t turn out that way, and the evidence-based care he received has allowed him to resume the quality of life he enjoyed before he was admitted to the ICU. The man I’m referring to is Dr. Kenneth Hurwitz, and this is his story. How Evidence-Based Care Ensured Greater Quality of Life for Kenneth Kenneth was admitted to the high acuity “Awake and Walking COVID ICU” after being intubated for acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. During his first six days on the ventilator, he was able to remain awake and walk around his room. Still, he spent most of his time sitting in a chair, writing on a board, and texting the staff and his wife. When his status changed and his lungs became worse, he was lightly sedated while proned for two days, and then deeply sedated for another six days because he was unable to oxygenate while being on his back. After eight days of immobility, including two days of paralysis and four additional days of sedation and delirium, Kenneth returned to a world of weakness and hallucinations. But as soon as he could be on his back, the nurse gave him a sedation vacation to see if he could oxygenate with movement. When it was clear that despite his continued high ventilator settings and delirium, he was able to oxygenate while moving his limbs, his nurse recognized there was no longer an indication for sedation. At this point, she discontinued his sedation and called in physical therapy to help with his delirium and agitation. They promptly started to sit him up and began working on getting him back on his feet again. After being liberated from sedation, he continued to have delusions and hallucinations. But luckily, mobility and engagement within the ICU helped him to cope and emerge from his delirium. The ICU team members who treated Kenneth are dedicated to adhering to these kinds of evidence-based practices, and they did whatever they could to help him remain awake and mobile during his time on the ventilator. improving ICU mobility icu mobility icu intubation and mobility The ICU team members who treated Kenneth mourned the loss of the opportunity to walk the halls with their intubated patients. But they found other ways to keep Kenneth moving, including walking wall-to-wall within the room, as well as arm and hand cycling. Utilizing this cardiopulmonary challenge from ICU admission to discharge helps to prevent intubation and tracheostomies, and makes patients more likely to walk out of the ICU doors and eventually discharge home from the hospital. That being said, if Kenneth had received the kind of care practiced in most ICUs, which would have included deep sedation and immediate immobility from the moment he was intubated, he would have spent at least three weeks suffering from delirium and muscular atrophy. This probably would have caused him to be unable to wean from the ventilator, which could have led to him facing a tracheostomy, spending many more days or weeks being ventilated, and guaranteed, he would have had to be admitted to some sort of nursing facility for extensive rehabilitation. This would have greatly increased his risks of death, and having to suffer through weeks or months of rehabilitation, at best. But as a result of the evidence-based care he received, four days after being able to lie on his back again, he was also able to be off the ventilator. Then, ten days after getting off the ventilator, he walked himself to his car, shut the door, and didn’t look back. He has continued to recover at home, and fortunately, has been able to care for himself and be in the company of his wife. In addition, he has been able to quickly resume the activities he enjoyed before he was ever struck by COVID. If you want to hear more about Kenneth’s story, you can check out Episode 44 of my Walking Home From The ICU podcast. icu recovery with improved outcome How is Kenneth Doing Now? complete recovery from icu Less than six weeks after leaving the hospital, Kenneth was able to do 25 push-ups and 30 sit-ups. He was also able to achieve the goal he set for his 70th birthday and ended up golfing 18 holes. Two months after discharging home, he was able to walk eight miles on the golf course. And a few months later, he was back to gracefully gliding down the mountains in the Utah snow. He is still battling pulmonary fibrosis from COVID-19, but the preservation of his physical and mental capacity has enabled him to live a life that many severe COVID-19 survivors could only dream of. If Kenneth had been subjected to the kind of treatment that’s typical in most ICUs, I have no doubt that things would have been very different, and he wouldn’t have the quality of life he’s able to enjoy today. In any case, his positive outcomes and long-term quality of life are no accident. They were realized by the hard work of a team dedicated to following evidence-based practices by avoiding deep sedation and optimizing early ambulation and mobility. Such outcomes have been the norm for most COVID survivors in this “Awake and Walking COVID ICU.” However, the ability to save and preserve lives during critical illness is not exclusively owned by one ICU. Medicine is a field of evolution and progress, and the practices and outcomes I’ve described in this case study are possible for any ICU team that understands its “why” and works together to find its “how”. Do you want to know more about how evidence-based practices can reduce ICU complications, and improve patient outcomes in the intensive care unit in your hospital? If your ICU team is ready to improve outcomes, workload, and healthcare costs, we’re ready to help. We can walk you through the entire process, so please don’t hesitate to contact us."

17,Will Sanity Prevail?,health-fitness," Has the world gone crazy? Have we lost all our common sense and ethical approach in our social dealings? Have our perceptions become so distorted that we cannot think rationally? There is a war going on between Russia and Ukraine. It can only mean death, destruction and devastation in Ukraine. No country in the world wants to fight a World War III. So the rest of the world is playing a spectator role. We know that Russia is a big powerful country. It is beating the daylights out of its little brother. Since the rest of the world is not prepared to defend Ukraine physically, what advice should we be giving its leaders? It is clear Russia has got the tiger by the tail. Right or wrong, I cannot see it back down. I fear for the people of Ukraine. Common sense tells us they should stop fighting and negotiate a peace deal. One has to face reality. It is not a perfect world, and we have to learn to compromise on living in peace and harmony. There is no point in trying to be a hero. If this fight continues, it will only destroy a beautiful country and its people, where there will be no country left to defend. A dead hero is no use to anyone, but a live hero may live to fight another day. So what advice we should be giving its leaders? Should we encourage its leaders to continue the fight by supplying more arms and ammunition? Please do not get distracted by the rights and wrongs of this issue. It can only become a pretext to fight a war. War is the result of an ultimate breakdown in communication. If we are not careful and do not become aware of how we think, it can quickly become our path to self-destruction. Recently in Quora on the Internet, I answered the following two questions which can relate to the topic above. Answer: Most people do not realize that our thinking process is hypnotic. In my mind, the ego is a product of self-hypnosis; it appears in our conscious mind by using words. We live in a very superficial world of words. We use words to express our feelings. So the way we think can make us feel and act in whatever direction we want. Be aware of rhetorics and philosophies that create feelings of nobleness and sacrifice. One can easily talk oneself into a path of self-destruction. Please read my recent articles on the Internet regarding the ego and its operation. Please do not take yourself very seriously. The ego is a con artist. Answer: When you see people walking around you like zombies, what do you think that is? When people are influenced to fight and kill each other, what do you think that is? I hope it answers your question. All the above brings me to raise the question of the medical profession’s role. We are the ones who have to deal with the physical and mental wrecks of any war. What is our eminent psychiatrists and psychologists have to say about the direction we are heading? Do they have any social conscience about what is happening in society today? Where do they stand, and what advice should they be giving? I want our readers to understand that we live in a hypnotic world. When we think we are hypnotizing ourselves. The words, not their meaning, directly affect our subconscious mind. I want people to become aware that we do not talk ourselves into fighting another war."
18,9 Health Benefits of Kale,health-fitness," Are you having problems gaining the minerals in your diet that you need? Want to have peace of mind that you are getting all the essential minerals your body needs to stay healthy? Well, here are nine easy ways kale can quickly help. But first, a bit about the kale vegetable. Kale (Brassica oleracea, variety acephala) is a vegetable from the brassica family of plants originating from the northern Mediterranean. 9 Health Benefits of Kale #1. Kale is a CRUCIFEROUS vegetable and one of the most nutritious foods in the world. Like broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower, kale is packed with health-promoting biological compounds such as antioxidants. The most common variety of kale is Curly kale or Scots kale, which has green and curly leaves and a hard, fibrous stem. Shetland Kale is the oldest known variety, grown since at least the 17th Century. The dropped leaves were used as winter feed for farm animals. A cup of raw kale contains: •	Vitamin A: TWICE the Recommended Daily Allowances (RDA), via beta-carotene, for good eyesight and the immune system •	Vitamin K: SEVEN times the RDA for the blood and bones •	Vitamin C: more than the RDA for growth and tissue repair •	Vitamin B6: about a tenth of the RDA for the nervous and immune systems •	Manganese: a quarter of the RDA for tissues, bones, blood, and sex hormones •	Calcium: about a tenth of the RDA for bones and teeth •	Copper: a tenth of the RDA for the bones, blood vessels, immune and nervous systems, and iron absorption •	Potassium: about a tenth of the RDA for the heart, muscles, and nerves •	Magnesium: six percent of the RDA for bone and cellular health •	Three percent or more of the RDA for vitamin B1 (thiamin), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin), iron, and phosphorus The same cupful of kale contains just 33 calories, 6 g carbohydrates, 2 g fiber, and 3 g protein. The tiny amount of fat in kale comes as the beneficial omega-3 alpha-linolenic fatty acid. Now you know why KALE is among the most NUTRIENT-DENSE foods. #2. Kale contains the antioxidants QUERCETIN and KAEMPFEROL. Antioxidants help prevent oxidative damage by harmful FREE RADICALS. Kale contains relatively large amounts of antioxidant flavonoids like QUERCETIN and KAEMPFEROL. These compounds have been found to protect the heart and help to reduce blood pressure. #3. Kale is an ideal source of VITAMIN C, which is needed for collagen synthesis, the most abundant structural protein in the human body. That is why the vitamin is essential to repair damage to tissues, which happens every day to all of us. The vegetable provides more vitamin C than most others – almost five times more than spinach and more than a whole orange. #4. Kale is the best source of VITAMIN K. Scientists have found that vitamin K activates protein-binding calcium. As mentioned above, a cupful of raw kale contains almost seven times the RDA. That is enormous. Vitamin K1 helps to fight heart disease and osteoporosis. #5. Kale is packed with BETA-CAROTENE, an antioxidant that eventually becomes vitamin A, which is good for eyesight and immunity. #7. Kale is a rich source of CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM, and POTASSIUM. The vegetable is rich in calcium for bones and cellular health. It is also a good source of magnesium, which helps combat type 2 diabetes and heart disease. The potassium in kale helps maintain the right electrical potential in cells to regulate blood pressure. #8. Kale is LOW in OXALATE. Oxalate seems to prevent minerals from being absorbed, which can cause serious health problems. #9. Kale is high in LUTEIN and ZEAXANTHIN. These are potent nutrients that are good for eyesight, especially for older folks. Lutein and zeaxanthin are CAROTENOID antioxidants present in large amounts in kale. These antioxidants greatly help reduce the risk of macular degeneration and cataracts, two prevalent eye disorders in aging folk. All in all, kale is a vegetable full of antioxidants that may help fight several maladies. It is exceptionally high in vitamins A, C, and K and is part of a healthy diet. If you know what you are doing, the above will help you get and maintain the essential minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants your body needs from kale. The vegetable is best eaten raw. Your ultimate levels of minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants from kale can be reached if you take note of the principles given in this article. Getting the proper mineral balance is not a pipe dream and has nothing to do with genetic makeup. Use the information here, and very soon, you will have confidence and satisfaction that you have the correct minerals, vitamins, antioxidants, and especially the vitamins your body needs that come from kale."
19,The Importance of Skincare & the Benefits of Natural Skin Care Products,health-fitness," According to Desmond Morris, the most prized human characteristic is perfect skin. It promotes health, happiness, and fertility. Because of the importance of skincare, people of all ages are looking for the most effective products available. They ask their friends, dermatologists, and favourite bloggers for recommendations on items that will give them the results they want. As a result, individuals frequently purchase costly skincare products that do not improve their complexion. While many individuals assume that professional skincare treatments are more significant than daily maintenance, external factors account for only 30% of skin ageing. UV exposure, pollution, smoking, and nutrition are examples of extrinsic influences. Intrinsic ageing is a result of the body's general health and proclivity to develop specific skin disorders, and it is genetically determined. Consumers should utilise a broad-spectrum SPF when considering these aspects. When it comes to skin whitening, the Chinese were the first to find safe ways. They believed that radiant, healthy skin reflected inner happiness. After the American Medical Association published a research tying lead-based whitening cosmetics to possible lead poisoning, the FDA changed many of these practises in the United States. Other dangerous activities include the formation of calluses, acne, dandruff, dry skin, and skin cancer, in addition to whitening. When it comes to applying skin care products, it's critical to do it in the correct sequence. Depending on your skin type, the order in which you use the items will differ. After cleaning your skin, apply an exfoliating toner. If you're using an exfoliant, don't combine it with a moisturising toner. The exfoliating product will not absorb into the thinner one, and vice versa. The use of modern technologies to generate effective, natural solutions is one of the most recent advancements in the field of skincare. The new generation of retinoid-based cosmetics will assist consumers in selecting products that successfully target skin ageing indicators. Retinol-containing products are likely to become a mainstay in every skincare regimen due to their numerous benefits to customers. There are several alternatives available to address a variety of skin issues. You might not have expected it, but the results are amazing, and the future appears to be promising. Dry, oily, and mixed skin types are the most common. Many external elements, as well as the function of layers beneath the skin, influence its health. A recent food or drink ingestion, for example, may induce skin redness and irritation. This could indicate an internal problem that needs to be addressed. You can also get your skin examined by a dermatologist. Wash your face and remove any makeup before starting your skincare routine. This will make it easier for your skin to absorb the components in your skincare products. Following that, dermatologist Mona Gohara, MD, associate clinical professor at Yale School of Medicine, recommends washing your face with warm water. Always moisturise your face after your facial wash to keep it from drying out. To avoid dryness and irritation, use a moisturiser in addition to cleansing. Natural Skin Care Products Have Many Advantages Natural skin care products are made with plant-based, safe components and are frequently marketed as being environmentally friendly. Skin care products, on the other hand, may contain dangerous ingredients such as tiny amounts of poisonous pesticides and chemicals that are harmful to the environment. Despite this, natural skin care products can benefit the skin by supplying antioxidants and other helpful ingredients. They can also improve skin texture and brightness, as well as brighten the complexion, minimise wrinkles, and firm the skin significantly. Healthy skin care products must contain emollients and antioxidants. Emollients, like shea butter, coconut oil, or synthetically derived ones, such as mineral oil are waxy lubricants that are beneficial to the skin. They also include trace minerals and nutrients, as well as the ability to exfoliate dead skin cells, albeit continuous usage of this product is not recommended. Jojoba oil is an antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-hydrating oil derived from the jojoba plant. Vitamin E and flavonoids are among the bioactive chemicals found in coconut oil. It may work to stop cancer cells from growing and is good for dry, sensitive, and acne-prone skin. It offers several benefits for your skin, including anti-aging effects, despite its oily nature. Other substances including licorice and mulberry have been shown to minimise the appearance of spots and redness. Origins Plantidote contains maitake mushrooms, which may help to calm the skin. Feverfew, a sunflower-family herb, is an effective natural calming agent."

Want to have peace of mind that you are getting all the essential minerals your body needs to stay healthy? Well, here are 7 easy ways tomatoes can quickly help. But first, a bit about the tomato plant. The Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), like the potato (Solanum tuberosum), is a fruit from the NIGHTSHADE family of plants that originate from South America. However, the DEADLY NIGHTSHADE (Solanum nigrum) is an EXTREMELY POISONOUS plant, and, therefore, its Solanum relatives, like the tomato plant, also carry toxicity – but not quite as much. Fortunately, tomato and potato plants carry their poisons in their GREEN parts, especially in the leaves and stems. Steroidal alkaloids like SOLANINE have atropine-like effects on the nervous system, but thankfully these are NOT present in edible potato tubers or tomato fruits. Botanically, tomatoes are FRUITS because they carry SEEDS. However, they are generally eaten and prepared like a VEGETABLE as they are not as sweet as sugar-laden fruits like blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, oranges, and apples. 7 Health Benefits of Tomatoes Tomatoes are famous for being the primary dietary source of the powerful antioxidant LYCOPENE. Lycopene occurs mainly in RIPE tomato SKINS, so NEVER peel a tomato. The more REDDER the fruit, the MORE lycopene it holds. Beneficial lycopene is formed when tomato fruits RIPEN and turn from green to RED. Tomatoes are also high in POTASSIUM, VITAMIN C, B9, and K1. Just one tomato gives around a QUARTER of the recommended daily intake of Vitamin C. Potassium is beneficial for controlling blood pressure. At the same time, vitamin K1 is good for the bones and blood. Vitamin B9 (folate) is suitable for tissue growth, especially during pregnancy. The essential compounds in tomatoes are the RED and YELLOW colored antioxidants LYCOPENE and BETA CAROTENE, respectively. NARINGENIN is a flavonoid in tomato skin, and CHLOROGENIC ACID is an antioxidant linked with lowering blood pressure. Amazingly, tomato KETCHUP, JUICE, PASTE, and SAUCES are the RICHEST sources of lycopene in the poor Western diet. A standard amount supplies us with FOUR-FIFTHS of our dietary lycopene. So, who said that processed foods are always bad for you? Weight-for-weight, the levels of LYCOPENE in PROCESSED tomato products are often MUCH HIGHER than in the fresh fruit as there is less water in concentrated processed tomato products. However, BE AWARE of the ADDED SUGARS in tomato ketchup! It is still better to eat FRESH TOMATOES whenever possible because of the other tomato nutrients mentioned above. Tomatoes Boost Heart Health. Heart attacks and strokes are the MOST common cause of death in industrialized countries. A study in middle-aged men found that LOW blood levels of lycopene and beta-carotene INCREASED the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Clinical studies of tomato products show a PROTECTIVE EFFECT on blood vessels that could decrease blood clotting risk. Things to Know About Tomatoes Ripening tomatoes release ETHYLENE, C2H2. Commercially, tomatoes are harvested and transported while green and immature. They are then sprayed with ethylene gas to prevent flavor development. That is the SOURCE of tasteless tomatoes. The ripening of green tomatoes is accelerated by wrapping them in old newspapers and leaving them on the kitchen table for a few days. However, they should be checked daily for ripeness. Tomato Side Effects Tomato allergy is VERY RARE, but pollen fever sufferers tend to be more allergic. Supplementation with pure plant-derived minerals may benefit susceptible types that get reactions like itchy mouths, scratchy throats, latex allergies, or even swelling of the mouth or throat. All in all, tomatoes are juicy, full of antioxidants, and may help fight several maladies. They are high in lycopene and form part of a healthy diet. If you know what you are doing, the above will help you get and maintain the essential minerals your body needs from tomatoes.

An inside and out the conversation on these numbers will follow later. For the present, we should begin by discussing the impacts of the prevailing fashion slimming down on our bodies. Craze counts calories draw in health food nuts who look to obtain speedy outcomes. At the point when you attempt a craze diet, you will probably lose pounds surprisingly fast as guaranteed since you will eat an extremely confined diet. At the point when you roll out huge improvements in your body, your body will respond.

This prevailing fashion that eats less is likewise prohibitive and exhausting, making it challenging to support over the long haul. When you stop the eating regimen and resume your typical way of life, odds are good that you will restore the weight - with a couple of extra pounds. Craze slims down additionally preclude you from eating specific kinds of food. A portion of these weight control plans limits or take out natural products, vegetables, dairy items, and entire grains. These food varieties are stacked with supplements that are remembered to assist with forestalling numerous ongoing circumstances. The eating regimens that dispense with specific food sources from an individual's eating regimen totally put the individual in danger of supplement lack. Research has shown that to acquire how many supplements our body needs consistently we should consume a decent and shifted diet.

Prevailing fashion slims down are handy solutions, not extremely durable answers for the weight issue. You might shed pounds at first, yet when you start eating normal food again you recover the weight. The issue is your dietary patterns and absence of action. Until you start eating better and practicing consistently, your weight will keep on going all over. So what's the solution to accomplishing your weight reduction objective? The response is a reasonable eating plan that incorporates legitimate supplements joined with moderate actual work. It is however basic as getting thinner may be troublesome. No particular food or item can cause weight gain or misfortune. The best way to get thinner is to improve on your propensities and reliably eat fewer calories and exercise more throughout some stretch of time. To get thinner you really want to eat less calories than you consume. Eat a decent eating routine wealthy in all nutritional categories; zeroing in on what to eat, rather than zeroing in on what not to eat. Increment your movement level by performing the everyday moderate activity and you will feel improved inwardly, intellectually, and actually. It is so basic yet not many of us can do it, despite the fact that doing this will completely change you. We perceive the issue with slimming down, we know the arrangement, for what reason is the heftiness rate in America actually scaling? Wellbeing specialists will let you know on numerous occasions that the best way to really get thinner and keep it off is by rolling out long-haul improvements to your way of life, for example, adjusting a better eating routine and consistently working out. Obviously, it isn't actually simple or fast to roll out these improvements. Industry master Robyn A. Osborn, RD, Ph.D., a dietician, and instructive therapist say individuals need to feel that the advantages of changing their conduct will offset the expenses. For some weight watchers, the mental expense of surrendering their swelling way of life appears to be excessively extraordinary. So they pick the ""handy solution."" Craze counting calories isn't such a great amount about the solid parts of shedding pounds, yet more about the mental advantages of the weight reduction results. Does this imply that weight reduction is more mental than it is physical? ""The examination is clear-diet programs don't work! Not just health food nuts fizzle, the eating routine projects bomb too. We know that under 10% of all calorie counters support any weight reduction, around half in the end acquire than they lose and that the most widely recognized outcome yo weight reduction can be more regrettable for individuals' wellbeing than essentially being overweight. Further, we are finding out increasingly more about how our way of life of ""slenderness"" is horrendous to the regard and strength of young ladies and ladies."" says David Bedrick, J.D., Dipl. PW creator of Talking Back to Dr. Phil: Alternatives to Mainstream Psychology. As indicated by another overview of therapists recommends that with regards to counting calories, weight reduction, and weight gain, feelings assume a focal part and might be the essential impediment to weight reduction. A large number of us take a gander at ourselves and contrast ourselves with those we see consistently in magazines, on TV, and in papers. We quickly feed ""negative talk"" into ourselves calling ourselves fat, griping about our body parts, etc so forward. We frequently then times rationalize, ""I'm excessively occupied"", ""It's genetic"", and ""I such as myself along these lines"".

5,Is water bloating a real thing?,health-fitness," Everybody complains about feeling puffy or appearing a bit more bloated. One friend will always rush to tell them the truth. To find out if they were actually correct (or just being kind), I did some research to discover if water bloating was a real phenomenon or a myth. Is water bloating a fact or fiction? It is true. It happens for many reasons, so don’t be discouraged. It is not a negative thing. Let's begin by looking at the facts about water and our bodies. Water is found in our capillaries and bones, as well as fats, and muscles. Bloating can occur when water is trapped in our cells as it travels through our bodies. Capillary walls that are ""too loose"" can cause liquids to ""be released into spaces between cells"". This causes water to get trapped in tissue and not return to the capillaries. Bloating can then occur. Water bloating can happen in many other ways. Water retention can occur due to other factors than ""leaky capillaries"". These include changes in blood pressure, water flow, and lymphatic system. External factors can also cause water bloating. You can also cause water bloating by being physically inactive. This could affect how fast your blood flows through your body. This could cause water bloating and other health problems. Causes of a Bloated Stomach Bloating can be confused with weight gain, water retention, or feeling full. These conditions do not mean that you feel bloated. What is bloating, you ask? According to the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFM), bloating is when the stomach is full of gas or air. Bloating can be exacerbated by certain medical conditions like IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). The Cleveland Clinic experts consider that underlying conditions such as Crohn’s disease and colon cancer can cause bloating. A distended stomach can also be caused by menstruation. Bloating can also be caused by certain eating and drinking habits. These habits can either lead to gas or encourage air into the stomach. Bloating can be caused by eating foods that cause gas or drinking through straws. These habits allow for the stomach to become fuller. How can you tell if your body is retaining water? -These are the most common signs that you have retaining water: -Consistently, you're bloated -Unexplained weight gain in a short time -Your feet and hands are swelling - is your ring no longer suitable for you? What can I do to stop water bloating from happening? Yes, there are many. Even if you only do a little bit of exercise, regular exercise can prevent you from water bloating. You can also reduce salt intake, lose weight, avoid extreme temperatures, and raise your legs to increase circulation to help prevent water bloating. Your chances of retaining water are not just dependent on how much sodium you consume, but also on how many carbs you consume. Juice cleanses are a bad idea. These cleansers may seem like the latest miracle diet, but they can be harmful to your lymph system and prevent you from getting enough protein. Prevent a Bloated Stomach Certain medical conditions may make you more likely to bloat, but water bloat can be managed and even prevented. There are some things you can do to avoid it. -Avoid sparkling water, as the bubbles in it can cause your GI tract to fill with air. -Drink water only through a straw. This allows for more air to reach the stomach. -Instead of chugging water, sip. -Instead of drinking too much water at once, spread your water intake over the day. -Water is essential for your body to function. Don't reduce your water intake to avoid bloating. It will go away, even if you feel water bloat. Water bloating does not equal fat. It is possible to avoid it, even though it is more common in women than it is in men. Relax if you're committed to eating a healthy diet, and making exercise a regular part of your daily routine. Water bloating may not be an issue for your body."
6,Jim’s Story: How Evidence-Based Practices Can Stop the Domino Effect and Reduce ICU Complications,health-fitness," I hate to say it, but what I’m about to tell you is nothing new. The unnecessary suffering I’m about to describe has occurred countless times due to a culture of habit in the intensive care unit, and a lack of support or investment in evidence-based practices. Regrettably, for many who end up in the ICU, this use of obsolete practices results in a domino effect, where one outmoded practice leads to complications, which are further exacerbated by another outmoded practice, and so on, and so forth. The story I’m about to tell is one of the worst examples of this domino effect I’ve ever seen, and the unfortunate victim was a man named Jim. This is his story. How a Misguided Attempt to Reduce ICU Complications Caused Jim to Suffer Needlessly Jim is a 70-year-old man with a history of bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety, and previous knee replacement. He has retired from the hockey industry and enjoys being an active part of the lives of his children and grandchildren. Sadly, he ended up suffering a C6-C7 vertebrae compression fracture and had to undergo cervical decompression surgery. He was discharged from the hospital on Friday, May 15th, 2021. He returned to the ER on May 16th due to uncontrolled pain. He was given IV morphine, which led to respiratory failure and witnessed cardiac arrest. He was immediately and successfully resuscitated with CPR and then intubated and put on the ventilator. According to his family, it is unclear if his neurological status was assessed. His MRI did not show evidence of any hypoxic injury during his cardiac arrest. Presumably, Jim was immediately started on continuous sedation solely because he was intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His family is unaware of any sedation vacations that took place as he remained on mechanical ventilation for another two days. On May 18th, he was extubated and was found to be very combative and physically aggressive with the staff and his family. At this point, Jim was re-intubated and automatically re-sedated. On May 20th he was extubated again and was again agitated, restrained, confined to the bed, and required a high-flow nasal cannula with a FiO2 of 80%. He was then re-intubated and re-sedated again. On May 25th (after nine days of mechanical ventilation, sedation, and immobility) he developed ventilator-associated pneumonia. His ventilator settings increased, and his family was called to come to the bedside to prepare for his demise. Fortunately, he responded to antibiotics and survived. Then, on June 7th, after 22 days of mechanical ventilation, sedation, and immobility, he again achieved ventilator settings of a PEEP 5 and a Fi02 of 40%. He was extubated and remained off the ventilator overnight. He gradually became more agitated, more confused, and developed hypercarbia. At one point, he told his wife, “I can’t breathe. It’s too hard to breathe!” and requested that she push on his diaphragm to help him breathe. On June 8th he was re-intubated for hypercarbia and respiratory failure (likely due to diaphragm dysfunction), and once again, he was automatically re-sedated. By June 16th he had developed a pulmonary embolism for a lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and required IV anticoagulation. After one month of almost continuous sedation and immobility, he underwent a tracheostomy and PEG tube placement, and sedation was finally discontinued. On June 17th he was sent to the step-down unit. Shortly later, he developed an ileus, his PEG tube was dislodged, and he suffered a new infection from his PEG tube complications. He then underwent emergency surgery to replace the PEG tube and was readmitted to the ICU. Less than 24 hours after being readmitted to the ICU, he was transferred to a long-term acute care hospital (LTACH). During the following months, he continued to suffer from persistent vomiting from the PEG tube, along with horrific delirium, and struggled to spend more than a few hours off of the ventilator due to his profound weakness and diaphragm dysfunction. He developed MRSA as a second ventilator-associated pneumonia. After months of aggressive rehabilitation, he was eventually able to be weaned off of the ventilator and have his tracheostomy removed. He was discharged home on August 11th and was cared for by his wife and home health caregivers. He continues to suffer cognitive impairments and unspeakable PTSD, and is unable to participate in the puzzles and activities he used to enjoy. He refuses to talk about the terrors he experienced under sedation. Fortunately, as of January 2022, his bipolar disorder is once again under control. He has had two more hospital readmissions, but his family reports that he is finally stabilizing and progressing at home. Later on Jim was back on his lawn mower, about six months after his admission to the ICU, as he’s finally starting to resume his life again. Jim’s daughter, Leah, provided a perfectly unfortunate demonstration of how automatically starting sedation after intubation hits the first domino of this entire chain of consequences. She shares her father’s journey in Episode 81 of my Walking Home From The ICU podcast. What Went Wrong: How Things Could Have Been Different for Jim and the ICU Team Members Who Treated Him Jim’s journey clearly demonstrates the impact of the decision to start continuous sedation after every intubation. If Jim had been allowed to wake up immediately after his cardiac arrest, it is likely that he may have been able to be extubated and discharged home from the hospital shortly thereafter. But as a result of automatically starting sedation without a clear indicator, Jim was forced to stay on the ventilator when it may not have been necessary. He was subjected to terrible delirium, as manifested by his agitation and combativeness when sedation was discontinued after two days. But instead of recognizing and treating his delirium, he was automatically re-intubated for his delirium, and the very sedation that caused the delirium was resumed. By being denied the opportunity to stay physically strong and functional on the ventilator, he likely developed diaphragm dysfunction, as well, in addition to his delirium. This probably contributed to his need for a high-flow nasal cannula after his second extubation. This diaphragm dysfunction became even more evident after his third extubation following 22 days of immobility and sedation. He reported he was unable to breathe and required a third intubation ventilator support again, despite minimal ventilator settings. This is a prime example of how sedation and immobility cause patients to be on the ventilator for days or months longer than if they had been awake and mobile while ventilated. The sedation and immobility also led him to suffer from three hospital-acquired infections, including two ventilator-associated bouts of pneumonia, and a PEG tube infection. Oftentimes, this is not even taken into consideration, but the fact of the matter is the more patients are intubated, reclined, immobile, and unable to cough, the more at risk they are of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia. Had Jim been allowed to wake up after intubation and promptly extubated, he would not have needed the ventilator or the PEG tube in the first place. These infections led to him being readmitted to the ICU, spending more time on the ventilator, more time in the hospital, and ultimately, enduring more suffering. Jim was discharged on anticoagulation for the pulmonary embolism he developed, which was likely caused by his month of immobility. He was later readmitted to the hospital for bleeding complications due to his long-term anticoagulation. On the tenth day of his ICU stay, Jim’s family started to advocate for sedation cessation and early mobility. Unsurprisingly, they were constantly told that the ICU team “had neither the time nor resources” for those interventions. The painful irony is that their failure to invest time and resources into evidence-based practices for patients like Jim ended up costing the ICU team a month’s worth of time, money, staff, and resources providing care that was probably unnecessary. This should provide a poignant reminder to all ICU teams that poor patient care is costly, both for them and their patients. To summarize, Jim came to the ER for postoperative back pain, and he became too sedated following IV morphine, which led to his cardiac arrest and prompt resuscitation. Sadly, a simple neurological exam and evaluation of the need for mechanical ventilation soon after intubation and throughout his time in the ICU could have drastically changed the trajectory of his life, which would have benefited everyone, including him, his family and the ICU team members who treated him. Nothing But The Facts: How Evidence-Based Practices Can Reduce ICU Complications, and What Can Happen When They’re Not Applied The research is clear. Sedation increases the risk of: ●	Dying in the ICU or after the ICU [1, 2] ●	Infection [3, 4] ●	Pressure sores [5] ●	Blood clots [6] ●	Delirium [7, 8, 9] ●	ICU-acquired weakness [10] ●	More time on the ventilator [11] ●	More time in the hospital [12] ●	Tracheostomy [13] ●	Discharge from hospital to a rehab center or nursing home [14] ●	Post-ICU PTSD [15, 16] ●	Post-ICU dementia (cognitive dysfunction) [17] ●	Depression [18] ●	Being readmitted to the hospital and ICU [19] ●	Post-intensive care syndrome [20] Sedation decreases the chances of: ●	Discharging home from the hospital [14] ●	Being able to walk upon transfer from the ICU [21] ●	Returning to work [22] ●	Having an optimal quality of life [23] Avoiding sedation and ensuring early mobility, as recommended in the ABCDEF Bundle, decreases the risk of: ●	Death [24] ●	Ventilator and hospital-associated pneumonia [25] ●	Central line and catheter infections [26] ●	Pressure injuries [27] ●	Falls [28, 29] ●	Delirium [24] ●	Aspiration pneumonia [30] ●	Constipation/ileus [31] ●	Intubation [14] ●	Re-intubation [14] ●	Tracheostomy and PEG tube placements [32] ●	Discharge to care facilities [24] ●	Hospital and ICU readmissions [24] ●	Diaphragm dysfunction [33] ●	ICU-acquired weakness [34] These practices can also improve the chances of: ●	Successful extubation [24] ●	Discharges from ICU [24] ●	Discharges home [24, 35] ●	Survival [24] ●	Functional independence after discharge [36] ●	Having optimal quality of life [37] ●	Proper lung aeration [38] ●	Secretion clearance [39] The choice to automatically sedate Jim after intubation and the failure to apply evidence-based practices in his care, such as the ABCDEF bundle, ended up resulting in: ●	Weeks and/or months of ICU delirium ●	Diaphragm dysfunction ●	ICU-acquired weakness ●	Deep vein thrombosis (blood clots)/pulmonary embolism ●	Three failed extubations ●	Three intubations ●	A tracheostomy ●	Two cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia ●	A total of three hospital-acquired infections ●	Readmission to the ICU ●	A preventable one-month ICU stay ●	Danger and burden to ICU staff ●	Months of painful and difficult rehabilitation in a LTACH ●	Post-ICU PTSD ●	Post-ICU dementia ●	Bleeding complications from long-term anticoagulation ●	Trauma and burden to family caregivers ●	Decreased quality of life ●	Two hospital readmissions during the first five months following discharge home Even while he was in excruciating pain following back surgery, Jim walked into the hospital, and he should have received the care to be able to walk himself out. Unfortunately, the failure of so many ICUs to implement these evidence-based practices creates an unimaginable amount of unnecessary suffering, and burdens patients like Jim, their families, and the ICU teams in the hospitals where they’re treated. But things do not have to be this way. With the implementation of evidence-based practices, such as the ABCDEF bundle, ICUs around the world can move beyond the archaic care they’re currently providing and do what’s best for themselves and their patients. Are you looking to learn more about how evidence-based practices can reduce ICU complications, and how you can work to implement them in your ICU? I can walk you through the entire process, so please don’t hesitate to contact me. Kali Dayton References: Shehabi, et al. (2012).

7,"Think Fat Loss, Not Weight Loss",health-fitness," Weight loss is one of the hottest topics ever. Everyone seems to be trying to lose weight nowadays. Most diet programs are about weight loss and body weight is often used as an indicator of fitness progress. But, this is an incorrect approach. Your ultimate goal should always be to lose fat and reducing excess body fat is what you should be concerned about. Weight loss and Fat loss is NOT the same thing! Many people confuse the two terms, often believing that they mean the same, when in fact weight loss and fat loss are very different from one another. This article will help you understand how weight loss is different than fat loss and how fat loss is far superior to weight loss in almost all ways. What Is Weight Loss? (Weight Loss = Muscle Loss + Fat Loss + Water Loss) Weight loss is attempting to lower your total body weight. It simply refers to a lower number on a scale. Your body weight is composed of all the parts of your body such as muscles, fat, bones, water, organs, tissues, blood, water etc. When you lose weight, you lose a little bit of... fat, muscle and water. You lose fat but very little and along with the fat you lose muscle and some amount of water. The higher you reduce your calorie intake, the faster you drop weight and the more muscle mass you lose. Do know your muscle matters? Loss of muscle affects your health and your overall appearance. When you lose weight too quickly, your body cannot maintain its muscle. Because muscle requires more calories to sustain itself, your body begins to metabolize it so that it can reserve the incoming calories for its survival. It protects it fat stores as a defense mechanism to ensure your survival in case of future famine and instead use lean tissue or muscle to provide it with calories it needs to keep its vital organs such as your brain, heart, kidneys and liver functioning. If you reach a point where you have very little fat or muscle, your body will metabolize your organs to keep your brain functioning leading to heart attack, stroke and liver and kidney failure. As the body loses more muscle mass, the body's overall metabolic rate decreases. The metabolic rate is the rate at which the body burns calories and is partly determined by the amount of muscle you have. So the more muscle you have, the higher your metabolic rate; the less muscle you have, the lower your metabolic rate and fewer calories you burn. This explains why it is crucial to protect your metabolic rate and not have muscle loss. Loss of muscle also leads to loss of tone underneath the skin leaving you soft and unshapely with no form or contour. If you lose weight too rapidly, your skin won't have time to adjust either. Also muscle is what gives you strength and loss of it means a weak body. With weight loss you shrink in size and become a smaller version of yourself with a fragile frame with saggy skin. Weight loss works in the short run to make you smaller but is temporary, almost everyone rebounds and regains the weight. This forces you to find another diet. And then another one, and another one - because eventually they'll all fail. What Is Fat Loss? (Fat Loss = Loss Of Stored Body Fat) Fat loss is attempting to lower your total body fat - i.e. the percentage of your total body weight that is made up of fat. The right approach for fat loss is to exercise smartly and eat intelligently in a way that maintains muscle and focuses on fat loss exclusively. The muscle you have is not there forever. If you don't feed it and don't use it - you lose it. A proper plan with right combination of resistance and cardiovascular training with adequate progression and a right nutrition plan to support it can help you achieve this. Exercise only boosts the burning process but doesn't just melt the fat away on its own - if you do not create a deficit and feed the body too much - it won't touch the stored fuel reserves. On the hand if you drastically cut your calories and do not feed your muscle properly or don't exercise and use your muscle, you will lose it. Fat loss is about finding that right balance. With fat loss you maintain the muscle and keep the metabolic rate running high. You also develop stronger connective tissue, tighter skin and stronger bones and joints. With fat loss you transform your body. Fat loss is a lifestyle approach where you give your body what it needs without depriving and shocking it with threat of starvation. You get to see slow but permanent steady progress. It may sound odd, but it's possible to get thinner without actually seeing a change in your weight. This happens when you lose body fat while gaining muscle. Your weight stays the same, even as you lose inches. Lets see how this happens. Fat tissue is very loose and not dense. It occupies a lot of space in your body. Whereas muscle is more dense and takes up less space. When you lose fat, this space is freed and you can notice inch loss. If you are following a consistent strength training program then gain in lean muscle tissue will balance out this loss of fat and weight stays the same. Since muscle takes less space than fat, you lose inches and start to look more toned, lean and shapely. consistent strength training program then gain in lean muscle tissue will balance out this loss of fat and weight stays the same. Since muscle takes less space than fat, you lose inches and start to look more toned, lean and shapely. Myth: ""Getting fit"" means ""Losing weight."" Truth: Getting fit means lowering your body fat percentage!"

9,Why do I have skin tags popping up?,health-fitness," There are roughly 3 million individuals that will be diagnosed with skin tags in the United States today. This is something that is common, but when it occurs on your skin, you may be tempted to panic because it may appear to be an oddly placed solution. This is an issue that comes up from the skin, and can cause a great deal of cosmetic issue, but nothing more. It’s not cancerous, it’s not going to cause much issue in terms of pain, and will not cause you to much issue if you leave it alone. But it is something that can be cosmetic in nature, and therefore you will want to get it removed, right? Well, before you can get to that step, you may want to know why you have skin tags that are popping up, and why they keep coming up over time. Understanding What Skin Tags Are The first thing that you need to know is that these are not something that are going to cause bleeding, discharge, or any sort of pain. In fact, you are not going to end up dealing with much of an issue in most cases. People don’t often have to deal with a wide variety of symptoms associated with tags. However, that doesn’t mean that you should just let them pop up without retort. Root causes associated with skin tags start with friction. Whenever the skin rubs against itself, or has any form of irritation, a small amount of collagen is pushed into the dermis. That small push upwards will have a growth that looks like a zit or acne. However, there will be no head and it will not be easy to remove with normal means. You’ll need to focus on working on something that is going to help with removal with ease. Tags come up due to friction, but they are associated with certain medical issues. Some of the most common issues include diabetes, tight fitting clothing, detergent issues, and hormonal shifts. These are common, but they are not the only issues that could cause tags to form frequently. Removing Skin Tags For those that are looking to figure out how to remove skin tags, the first thing to do is seek out a root cause. For instance, if it’s due to tight clothing, a change in lifestyle could help. If it’s due to sickness, a doctor may be needed to help. However, in most instances, you could use self care to get these things taken care of overall. The most common options for removing skin tags is to look for options that you can apply topically. For instance, you could use acne medication. This is a medication that you can place topically on skin tags and watch them fall off in due time. Another option that you can use is essential oils. These are options that you can place on the tag and let the elements penetrate the dermis and eventually cause the options to fall away with ease. It’s something that doesn’t take a lot of work to see come through."
10,Are skin tags and stretch marks related?,health-fitness," Skin tags are small growths that come up from the skin and are not cancerous. Many people assume that growths are related to sexually transmitted diseases or something similar. The truth of the matter is simple, they are not. That’s right, they are not issues associated with cancer cells or even sexually transmitted. This is something that you’re going to see occur at any age, for a number of reasons. You may think that stretch marks and skin tags are related, and you may be right. In fact, there’s a correlation between the two, but not for the reasons that you may think. Consider a few notes in regard to this, and you’ll denote why this is so important to consider, before you try and remove them overall. What Exactly Are Skin Tags? First and foremost, you should know that skin tags are nothing to be afraid of. They are simple to find, and easy to remove, if you know what’s going on. Tags form when there’s an allergic reaction or a friction of the dermis. Whenever you feel skin rubbing against itself, your body may react and trigger a small growth. A small growth that looks like a wart or a zit is what you’ll see and feel along your skin. It’s not something that you are going to find to be difficult to manage, mind you. It’s a simple thing that you can deal with, and it’s not going to hurt. This occurs on the skin in places like the ears, neck, under breasts, under arms, and near the pubic region. Whenever there’s an area that wrinkles, folds, or rubs against itself, you’ll find an issue that could grow. What About Stretch Marks? Stretch marks are associated with rapid weight gain, and weight loss. Women, for instance, may get pregnant and see these. Men can also get stretch marks, and that’s due to weight gain, loss, and other issues. Whenever the body has skin that stretches, you’ll find these marks. But are they related to the skin tags that you may see? The short answer is simple, yes. But not always. The Correlation Between The Two The reason why these two are connected is because the body stretches and causes folds, wrinkles, and movement to occur. When that happens, your body is going to react with a push of collagen into the areas where this occurs. When that happens, you’ll get a small growth upwards from the dermis, and you’ll have the tag formed. Now, that doesn’t always happen, but it is something that you can find to be true. Removing Skin Tags If you have skin tags, you can get them removed. You could remove them with a simple element. For instance, you could use acne medication topically on the tag. You could also utilize hemorrhoid creams, and even astringents that you can find over the counter. In most instances, you can get tags removed. You just have to make sure that you don’t pull, cut, or try to scratch tags away."
11,Are skin tags and rash related?,health-fitness," Skin problems are something that millions of people will have to deal with at various stages of their lives. You will not be immune to dealing with this at one point or another. It’s something that can be benign in nature, or it could be due to irritation of the skin, or any number of reasons. Another skin issue that many people deal with on a regular basis is that of skin tags. These two options are not distinctly related, but they can be similar in nature. To determine if you’re dealing with this and it’s something that you will need help with, it’s imperative to understand a few notes about each item and how it works. You’ll find that there’s a specific issue that comes through with each option and some can be worse than others. What Is A Rash? The first thing that you should know is that rashes could be due to a number of things. Skin rash is an area of skin that has been irritated for any number of reasons. Rashes can come up with bumps, burning, itching, and red skin. It could be to viral issues, detergents that come on the skin, tight clothing, sun exposure, and other problems overall. You could find that there’s a number of options that you can pursue in this regard, to clean things up and to avoid dermatitis overall, but it’s not always connected to the same things. That’s why many go with over the counter creams to relief the itching and burning. However, it’s imperative to realize that some people may need medical attention for this issue. What Are Skin Tags? The next thing that you should know is that skin tags are associated with this in a minor way. If you have skin irritation, you could develop a rash and a skin tag. Tags are formed when skin has friction of any kind. When you have friction, you’ll find that the skin can cause a small push upwards from the skin, and could very well change the course of your treatment. Tags form due to small amounts of collagen coming up from the dermis whenever there’s irritation or skin rubbing against other skin. Are The Two Related? The short answer is no, but the long answer is that there could be a sequence of union. The reason why is because there are common skin issues that could cause a small growth to appear on the dermal tissue. These small layers could push up a growth and cause irritation, and if you were to scratch tags, you could cause more irritation and that will require you to get medical help. Removing Rash and Skin Tags At the end of the day, you’ll find that both options can require a bit of help. The main focus of removing these things can be attributed to topical solutions. You could use tea tree oil, acne mediation and other options for skin tags. For rashes, you could use a number of antibiotic creams that will help with reversing dermatitis overall. Either way, you’ll find that these things can be done with relative ease."
12,What are the best essential oils for skin tags removal?,health-fitness," Skin tags form up from the dermis in a lot of different ways. There are a lot of people that will have to deal with this, including upwards of 3 million individuals in the United States today. This is something that doesn’t hurt, will not cause much trouble, and will not force any major issue overall. You’re going to find that this is something that is going to be easy to work with, especially if you know what they are, and how you can get rid of them with essential oils. What Exactly Are Skin Tags? First and foremost, you should know what skin tags are. The first thing that you should know is that they are small growths that come up from the dermis. This is something that is harmless, non-cancerous, and something that is not going to cause an issue for the most part. It’s something that is simple to work with, especially when it comes to skin irritation. You see, tags are not like acne, they are not boils, and are not lesions. They will not bleed, they will not puss, and will not cause major problems. They simply are growths that come up from the dermis due to irritation, and elements that come with this. Tags are something that come up due to collagen pushes. Collagen rushes to areas that there is irritation in the dermis, and often due to friction. Whether you have tight clothing, an allergic reaction, or skin rubbing against itself in areas. This may come up on the ears, neck, under breasts, underarms, under the waistline, and around the pubic region. Removing Skin Tags With Essential Oils There are several different ways that you can remove skin tags. One of the most common is to work with essential oils. You’ll take oils and apply them on the tags upwards of 3 times a day. In a matter of weeks, you’ll find that the tag will fall off without incident. There will be no blemish, and no issue at all, they’ll just fall off in time. Now, which essential oils work well? The following will show you a few things as to which ones can work out. Tea Tree Oil The first option is that of a tea tree oil. It’s something that is antiseptic, and anti-inflammatory. It’s an easy to work with option that you can apply directly to the tag and it works within a short span of time. Oregano Oil This oil is a positive solution hat will help you work out the kinks of tags. Apply this to the tags directly 3 times a day, and it will be easy to get results. Lemon Oil Another highly powerful and potent solution is that of lemon oil. Lemon oil is powerful, can help with pulling out skin tags over time. It’s simple to use, and is powerful in small doses. Rosemary Oil Rosemary oil is a good option. It’s simple to work with, and it has antiseptic and anti-inflammatory elements. You apply this the same way that you would other options."
13,The Importance of Professionalism in Healthcare,health-fitness," Professionalism is important in any career, but it's especially vital for people working in healthcare. Healthcare professionals deal directly with the sensitive matter of people's health and wellbeing. A lack of professionalism can mean a lapse in proper privacy practices, disrespecting patients, and building a toxic environment. Read below to learn more about why practicing proper professionalism is crucial in healthcare settings. Puts Patients at Ease Health matters can be sensitive and anxiety-inducing for patients, no matter what healthcare discipline you might work in. Whether a person is anxious about a potential diagnosis or just experiencing some nerves about a routine exam, an unprofessional practitioner only increases the tension. Healthcare professionals must find the delicate balance between being friendly and empathetic enough to put patients at ease while maintaining the authority and professionalism needed to foster an appropriate patient relationship. Protects Patients' Privacy Patients trust their healthcare professionals with a lot of personal, private information. Healthcare workers must treat this responsibility with care. There are many laws and regulations in place to protect privacy rights, and it is essential to stay up-to-date on those matters and any unique office policies that might be in place. Avoid gossiping about patient situations to coworkers and store all records as required, so patients continue to trust you with their care. Promotes Collaborative and Respectful Culture In addition to encouraging patient trust, maintaining professionalism also affects the overall office environment. Establishing a reputation as a responsible and respectful worker will help foster positive coworker relationships, encourage peers to reach out for collaboration on projects and reduce petty workplace drama so that attention can remain focused on giving patients the best care possible. These are just a few reasons why being professional in healthcare is so important. Integrity, compassion, and excellence are key qualities of successful healthcare professionals, and focusing on professionalism will help exemplify these traits. Patients trust their healthcare providers with their care and deserve to be met with professionalism and empathy. It can be easy to get caught up in the day-to-day routines and challenging interactions, but it's vital to ensure professionalism is maintained regardless."
14,The Biggest Cause of Burnout and What You Can Do About It,health-fitness," Burnout is becoming a more commonly acknowledged symptom that the majority of the workforce will feel at some point in their careers. Whether short-term or long-term, burnout can have significant repercussions on one’s personal and professional life. With this attentiveness to burnout’s effects, an undeniable interest in where it originates from has also come. Countless health professionals have done studies into the causes of burnout, concluding that it is a result of being overworked, a loss of sleep, mounding tasks and worries, and little personal time, to name a few. However, one underlying cause sets this all into motion: a feeling of lack of control. How Does This Cause Burnout? When one doesn’t feel in control of their life, career, looming circumstances, and financial obligations, it can lead to immense stress. When not dealt with, this stress multiplies and weeds itself into other areas of your life that might not have had any association with the original cause of the tension. Over time, stress leads to emotional problems and can even cause physical health issues. Combining these symptoms can become too much for someone, leading to a severe case of burnout and a different feeling of a loss of control. Feeling like you have little power over yourself and your circumstances can lead to a loss of identity and cause you to do uncharacteristic things that lead to poor work performance, disagreeable relationships, and a loss of motivation. What Can People Do About This? Burnout can feel like a hopeless corner once you’ve been backed into it, but managing burnout begins with dealing with its leading cause: a feeling of loss of control. As you strive to leave burnout behind, you’ll need to focus on taking back the control that you felt you lost. Address your potential more effectively by looking at the areas you can regain control of. For instance, you may not be able to control your boss’s work tasks they give you, but you can voice your desires for growth and the type of work you’d like to achieve in the workplace. At the same time, you must listen to your burnout as a sign to do some personal reflection. Do you feel stuck in your current career, or will this be something you can work through at your present job? Sometimes, burnout can lead to exciting career changes, but it takes listening to your desires to implement these transitions. As you realize this, you’ll come to regain control of your path and disconnect from the effects of burnout."
15,What is Endovascular Surgery?,health-fitness," Each decade brings with it new innovations in a wide variety of industries, including healthcare. This ever-evolving landscape is an exciting topic for many, as new healthcare innovations present the opportunity for relatives and friends to recover from once-incurable conditions. Endovascular surgery is one of many innovative procedural techniques to treat such diagnoses. In a nutshell, this surgery encompasses the minimally invasive insertion of a catheter into the arteries or veins and can often be performed in outpatient facilities. Types of clinical problems that can be successfully managed with endovascular surgery include most cardiovascular disorders, carotid artery disease, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cancer of the liver, uterine fibroids, strokes and many other vascular-related disorders. What Are the Perks of Endovascular Surgery? When most people picture surgery, they imagine open surgery, which usually requires a patient to be put under general anesthesia since open surgery can be quite invasive. On the other hand, most endovascular surgery is much less invasive and can be done with sedation. It often has fewer risks, is better tolerated by patients, and is the preferred way to treat a number of diseases. Given that endovascular surgery is done through a small incision, the post-procedural recovery time is much quicker than open surgery with most patients going home the same day of their procedure. Patients typically will not require physical therapy or significant recovery time and potentially lost work as they would need following open surgery. Endovascular surgery is much less painful and does not usually require post-procedural narcotics which are often needed following open surgery. Because of the minimally invasive nature of endovascular surgery, usually requiring no stitches whatsoever, patients are much less likely to have wound complications or scarring after endovascular surgery. The quick recovery time, less pain, and low risk of complications give patients much greater peace of mind and a more rapid return to their normal lifestyle. What Are the Risks of Endovascular Surgery? All procedures carry some risk, and healthcare providers are obligated to counsel patients of any risks and alternatives associated with the planned medical procedure. While uncommon and unique to the particular procedure, endovascular surgery can cause complications such as infection, blocked blood flow, blood leakage around the vessel, stent fracturing, or restenosis. Always be sure to ask your physician about the potential risks of any planned procedure and whether the procedural benefits outweigh the risks. Is There Any Follow-Up Care? Although some basic outpatient procedures do not require any follow-up, your healthcare provider may schedule a virtual or in-person follow-up in the days or weeks following your surgery. Even with an uncomplicated recovery, your doctor should want to ensure you are recovering normally and have benefitted from the procedure."
16,New Therapy Treats ED in Men with Diabetes,health-fitness," The most dangerous aspect of Diabetes is the affect it has on the vascular system (blood vessels).  Heart disease is the main cause of reduced life expectancy in patients with diabetes. Other conditions caused by diabetes include nephropathy (kidney disease) and retinopathy (blindness). Men with diabetes are also more likely to experience erectile dysfunction (ED).  The most common medications (Viagra and Cialis) used to treat ED act by dilating the blood vessels. Unfortunately, because of the effects that Diabetes has on the circulatory system, these drugs don’t work well in patients with chronic diabetes, especially when it’s not well managed. First introduced in the 1970s to treat people with kidney or gallstones, low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy (LI-ESWT) has since evolved to successfully treat many conditions, including erectile dysfunction.  It does this by causing painless, mechanical stress to the treatment site, triggering a wound-healing response that stimulates blood vessel growth and improved blood flow. Research shows up to 70% of diabetic ED sufferers experience improvement with shockwave therapy.  This new therapy is available at Integrative Health and Rehabilitation in Denver, CO. Our office utilizes the patented Alma Duo device to provide the gold standard in shock wave technology. Men suffering from Diabetes should first consult with their endocrinologist to ensure their diabetes is being properly managed. Next, testosterone levels should be tested. Low testosterone levels can be treated with bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. Optimizing hormone levels has many benefits, including improved sexual function, decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, and protection against Alzheimer’s disease. Diabetic men also see the most improvement in their condition when they receive regular ongoing maintenance treatment sessions. Treatment typically recommended is an initial, intensive course of Duo shockwave therapy twice a week for 6 treatment weeks (12 sessions total). After completing the initial course of shockwave therapy, we continue with bi-monthly sessions to maintain the benefits of the shockwave therapy. We offer a discounted annual subscription for diabetic patients to take advantage of shockwave therapy. Alma Duo shockwave therapy for ED does not interfere with oral diabetes medications such as metformin, pioglitazone, Avandia (rosiglitazone), glipizide, Prandin (repaglinide), Januvia (sitagliptin), Tradjenta, Janumet, or Kombiglyze. Men taking insulin (e.g. Lantus, Toujeo, Novolog, Levemir, Humalog, Humulin and insulin glargine). can also safely receive shockwave therapy without any negative effect on diabetes control."
17,10 ways quitting smoking weed changed my life,health-fitness," There’s a lot of different things that you are going to find to be true about quitting smoking. There are many ways that it can change your life. Here are 10 ways that quitting smoking changed my life, and how it may help you as well. Clarity of Thought The first thing that you’re going to find to be true is simple, clearance of thought. Your mind will be clearer, you’ll be able to concentrate better, and will memorize a lot more. Your memory will improve, and will absolutely help you gain a roaring start in what you need to move forward with. Sleep Less You may argue that you need more sleep, but that’s not what this means. You’ll find that you will need less sleep to feel energized, and will be able to thrive at work and at home. When smoking weed, the sleep cycles you have can end up causing a great deal of issues. Quitting helps sleep better for less time. No Worries About The Police When you’re constantly smoking, you may smell like marijuana. You may be subject to a search, and if caught in some states, you will be arrested. To avoid that, quitting is a good route. When you quit, you will not have to worry about if you’re smoking or not, or if you have weed on you or smell. More Money In The Bank Perhaps the best thing that occurs when you quit smoking is that you have more money. No joke, I am not constantly worried about my finances any longer, and can substantiate spending on other things. This is a great feeling, because having more money brings security in many ways. No More Depression One of the reasons why smoking helps many is because it can help with depression, but in some people, it can actually make it worse. There’s a balancing act of extremes that occur when smoking that causes many issues. Quitting diminishes this completely. Breathing Easier My lungs have never been this good. You’ll find that you will be able to breathe easier than ever, and will enjoy the process of breathing, and even swimming. Lung capacity improves systematically. Mood Improvement Quitting may start with a difficult thing to deal with, meaning your moods may shift to negative at first. But in time, you’ll find that you will feel better about yourself, and your moods will improve systematically. Fitness Improvement With the added lung capacity, you’re going to find that fitness will be easier to manage. That’s right, you will be able to hit the gym and not be winded as easily, which also means better experiences in other areas of your life as well. Improved Sinuses Your breathing will improve, but so will your sense of smell and taste. The taste buds and the sinuses improve, so that you can smell things in a much more fluid manner, and taste things in a vibrant manner as well. Better Work Lastly, I found that my work improved. That includes school work and my job as well. The process was great overall, and now I can truly say that I’m better off for quitting."
18,How to remove skin tags fast in 3 days?,health-fitness," Skin care is one of the most important things that you can pursue, because it’s a visible part of your daily life. That being said, many people today will be dealing with something that is known as skin tags.

This is not cancerous, this is not going to cause issues, and it’s not something that you’re going to be able to gain the upper hand with if you don’t know what they are or how to treat them. To understand this on a deeper level, consider a few notes in relationship to this option. What Exactly Are Skin Tags? The first thing that you should know is that skin tags are not sexually transmitted diseases, and do not transfer via sex. They also do not hurt. They do not bleed, and will not spread to other parts of the body. They are small growths that are benign, harmless in most instances, and cosmetic in nature for millions of people. If you have this on your skin, you will find that it can be cosmetically bad, but not necessarily painful. With that in mind, you can remove them at home, and sometimes in as little as 3 days. Here are a few options that you can pursue in regard to removing them. Wart Remover The first option that you can test out is a simple one, wart remover. This can be purchased over the counter at a pharmacy and it works out very well. This is often a cryotherapy solution that you place directly on the tags, and the elements will help removing them. If one application doesn’t help, you may need to apply another coat, and then test it out again. This does work, it just may take a couple of tries. Clear Nail Polish Another solution that can work fast is the option of using clear nail polish. You can paint the skin tag with this element, and let it dry overnight. In the morning, you can use nail polish remover to take away the element, and dry out the core with ease. Clearing nail polish is simple, and easy to use. This should work within 24 to 48 hours, but you can test it out again if it doesn’t take at first. Tea Tree Oil The next thing that you can test out is the use of tea tree oil. This is a solution that you can apply directly on the tags. Tea tree penetrates the core and dries out the tag. The tag will fall out with simplicity, and you will not have to deal with any side effects. The tea tree oil is a great solution that is natural, and doesn’t require a lot of applications to see results. Just apply this directly to the tag. It’s a simple element that you can use at home without spending a great deal or feeling any pain as a result."

1,How to sit when you have hemorrhoids?,health-fitness," We sit all the time. Be it on your days off or at work, we always sit. Unless of course you work as a salesperson on shopping malls or you’re a human statue on theme parks, most people, sit. On a normal day, a person sits an average of 7.7 hours, long enough to put pressure on the plump muscles that we have on our behind. On our offices, relaxing at coffee shops, picnic at the park, during meetings, conferences, when we eat our meals, read our books or even when we are passing stool. Maintaining a sitting position for hours can be very uncomfortable. Now imagine yourself with aching, throbbing, itching and worse, bleeding hemorrhoids on your behind and you have to sit for hours? Hemorrhoids or sometimes called piles, is a condition on which small veins located on the walls of the rectum and anus becomes swollen and bulge. This condition is commonly caused by constant pressure on the veins by straining when you pass stool. This is further aggravated by poor diet, constipation or diarrhea, improper lifting of heavy objects, pregnancy, being overweight or obese, poor posture and well you guessed it, prolonged sitting. Medical professionals advise that when you absolutely have to sit the whole day, take a break every hour to stretch, stroll for a few minutes or to just stand up. Aside from preventing a whole lot of other medical condition, the risk of hemorrhoid formation will also lessen. But what if, you already have them and your job requires you to sit in front of a computer the whole day? Well, it’s easy. Although none of the following sitting methods will treat hemorrhoids, these will surely help in decreasing the pressure you put on your buttocks thus lessening the pain and making it easier for you to go through out your day. Same if you’re still hemorrhoid-free, try to sneak in 5-10 minutes (as your schedule permits) of stretching, walking and standing. Again, this would decrease the pressure on your hemorrhoids. These are types of pillow with a hole in the middle made to relieve pressure on your anus. The difference between a donut cushion and hemorrhoid pillow is that hemorrhoid pillow maintains and holds its shape even after hours of use. Most available donut cushion are inflatable and thus easy to bring when traveling. If for some reason option number 2 is not available, a regular cushioned chair would be fine. Although would not effectively relieve pressure on your hemorrhoids, it would, at some level provide comfort compared to a regular chair. To aid bowel movement effectively and decrease the time spent in the toilet, elevate your feet on a step stool. It will change the position of the rectum and anus allowing easier passage of the stool. If possible, do not spend too much time sitting on the toilet as it puts too much pressure on the veins located on your rectum and anal wall. All this, together with consulting with a doctor, increasing dietary fiber, drinking a lot of water, maintaining a good posture and exercising, would help make hemorrhoid-associated pain tolerable and before you knew it, you’re pain-free and hemorrhoid-free."

Should my water be warm or cool? Do I need to sit for an hour? Do I need to put salt, aroma or baking soda on the basin? Do I need to do this once a week? Preparing and doing a sitz bath is generally easy. Just remember the following: Prepare a plastic sitz bath purchased at most drug stores, or if not available, a large enough basin or a regular bath tub. Ensure that the basin that will be used is large enough that a person can fit in and the water can be filled up to the level of the hips otherwise the therapeutic effect of the bath on the hemorrhoids and the pain will not be as efficient. Warm water (although some prefer alternating cool water after a warm sitz bath, cool or cold water is still optional). Although there is no standard temperature for a sitz bath, the water should be warm enough to provide relief but not too hot that it can burn. The effects of the warm water include reduction of the swelling of the hemorrhoids, regulating the blood flow and relaxing the muscles and skin on the buttocks area. During the 10-15 minute period of the bath, water will naturally cool down therefore it will help that there is a continuous flow of warm water. Again, as desired, cool or cold water can be alternated. Materials for entertainment such as books, crossword puzzles, music devices or a mobile phone. Since doing the sitz bath might take a while, it would be helpful to provide some entertainment to occupy your mind away from the pain caused by the hemorrhoids. Just make sure that the entertainment of choice does not need to use electricity. Remember, water and electricity does not work well together. Drying towels.

In some instance when sitz bath is done for 20 minutes or so, some experience dizziness and/or palpitation.

If preferred and not contraindicated, essence or aroma, salt, baking powder and oil can be used. Although no scientific evidence says it helps with relieving hemorrhoids, if it can make the experience much relaxing, then these additional things can be used as well. Sitz bath no matter how much relief it provides is not a treatment for hemorrhoids. It is best to consult with the doctor if condition worsens."

7,Why You Should Be Careful With DIY Teeth Whitening Hacks,health-fitness," Although editing your teeth to look whiter in a photo can be fixed quickly with the click of a button, individuals still desire to have pearly whites for in-person interactions and as a boost of self-confidence. Scared off by the high price tag of professional in-house teeth whitening, many individuals take to DIY methods they’ve seen passed around social media. However, while these viral trends might seem like a cost-effective way to whiten your teeth, they can end up doing more harm than good. Here’s why you should be careful with DIY teeth whitening hacks: You Might Damage Your Enamel Tooth enamel is the outer covering of your tooth. Its purpose is to protect the inner parts of your teeth, which are more fragile. It helps delay and prevents tooth decay. Using at-home hacks, especially as a continual habit, can end up damaging your enamel. Since these hacks usually involve harsh scrubbing or abrasive materials, they can end up weakening the very part of your teeth that was built to be a protective “shield.” Tooth enamel is not reproduced over time, which is why individuals should be extra cautious when participating in viral teeth whitening trends that haven’t been backed up by dental professionals. They Could Cause Uneven Colors Many people purchase whitening strips and other methods marketed as quick fixes to stained teeth. However, amateur use of these products and the products’ designs, in general, can lead to an uneven coloring effect. What once began as a way to whiten your teeth can end in your teeth looking worse than before, highlighting your discolored teeth next to newly brightened teeth. This can give you the opposite effect of what you were going for. When trying to whiten your teeth, it is worth it to spend a little more in order to achieve a more unified result that doesn’t point out the “imperfections” in your smile. There Can Be Dangerous Health Effects Whether purchasing over-the-counter kits or using at-home hacks that haven’t been approved by your dentist, there are some dangerous health effects that can come about. These hacks can actually lead to stomach problems, infections, toothaches, and other dental-related or digestive issues. Whenever using new products, especially in your mouth, it is important to read which chemicals and ingredients are used and what health effects they could have. A seemingly inexpensive DIY hack can actually result in a hefty doctor’s bill if it takes this effect on your body. Hacks Can Cause Gum Damage As your dentist would affirm, gum health is just as important as teeth health, and it is important to protect them just as you would your teeth. However, some ingredients in teeth whitening hacks, especially hydrogen peroxide, have been known to cause gum damage if used in excess. It is best to avoid these harmful ingredients altogether rather than trying to find a cheap remedy for stained teeth. Keeping healthy gums contributes to your dental hygiene and tooth coloring. Therefore, implementing DIY methods that harm your gums could be counteractive to your goal. Dentists instead recommend relying on basic hygiene methods, like flossing, to help you achieve a brighter smile. When wanting to improve the outer appearance of your teeth, it is always wise to contact your dentist and allow them to advise you on the best possible methods. It is understandable that not every individual will choose to pay for professional teeth whitening, but your dentist will likely have additional suggestions for achieving a glowing look without putting your enamel and gums in harm’s way. DIY teeth whitening hacks may seem like a cheaper way to achieve visually appealing pearly whites, but they can cause long-term damage, especially if used regularly."

10,"Immortality, Fantasy and Reality",health-fitness," Do you know that human beings are delusive thinkers? We do not realise that we live in a hypnotic world. Our thinking process is hypnotic. The words we use in our minds have a conditioned response in the subconscious mind. The meaning of the words does not matter, but they generate real feelings. The subconscious mind is like a piano, and the words we use are the keys on the piano keyboard. They produce a specific sound. Twenty-four hours a day, we play a tune on this keyboard, and most people have no idea how their mind works. We have to use our brains for thinking and reasoning. Without using our brains, we will not understand how our mind works, and without this self-knowledge, we will continue to live in a world of delusions. Here I am going to try to help you understand how we delude ourselves. Yes, truth is stranger than fiction. You do not have to believe what I say, but please try to disprove it in your mind and see if what I write makes sense. Do you know that words have a powerful hypnotic effect on our perceptions and thinking? We use words not only for communication but also to express our thoughts and feelings. Words make us travel in time and stimulate our imagination. Without words, we would be stuck in the present timeless reality. Since the beginning of time, we have been using words to communicate and think. Our ego is a product of self-hypnosis. It cannot appear in the conscious mind without using words. Without words, it has to stay in the background. But to survive this harsh world of reality, the ego has to use the brain with its thinking process to constantly appear in the conscious mind. Thus using words and thinking become ego-boosting tools and habits. To understand how delusive our thinking process is, we must understand how words affect us.  Remember, the ego creates words; no one else does. For example, the word ‘soul’ immediately creates imagery of immortality, something that never dies. Whether such a thing exists or not does not matter. When we use the word ‘spirit’ or ‘spiritual’, it instantly creates a world beyond the one we see in front of us. The same thing happens when we use ‘heaven’ and ‘hell’. They instantly create a world beyond the present. All these words give form to our feelings. Every day, people use these words in their daily lives created by an ego seeking immortality. It instantly creates a world of dreams and everlasting life. Another example, let us look at the ‘sun’ and the ‘moon’. They are real objects and create an instant picture in your mind which is not dependent on any belief. Then consider the words ‘angel’ and ‘Santa Claus’. They also make an instant picture, which most people do not treat as real. However, using words such as ‘God, Allah or Bhagwan’ can create a powerful spiritual reality in many people. Why? It is because these words have a belief system associated with them. The ego is forever seeking immortality, never the truth. Using words such as ‘resurrection’ and ‘reincarnation’ instantly creates a picture of a world beyond the present with a comforting prospect of survival after death. How can one not resist falling for such a beautiful world of delusion? The more one thinks about it, the more real it becomes in our minds. Thus, we create a whole new dream world out of our imagination to bring us a sense of peace, permanence and security. When we look at our present civilisation and the ones before, are we different? The beliefs and philosophies created by the ego in all cultures provide a comfort zone. They are evidence of our attempts to harmonise how we think with how we live. They try to give meaning to our stressful, miserable lives and existence. Yet sadly, because people do not understand the mechanism of delusion and have no insight into how their mind works, they are willing to kill and die for their beliefs. Yes, all the words we use have conditioned responses in our subconscious mind. The words ‘ yesterday, today and tomorrow’ have the same effect. When we use these words, they make us travel in time from the past to the present and future. Yet, in reality, there is no such thing as time. Looking at the world today, one can see how the ego uses the hypnotic power of words to survive and build in this harsh world of reality. Words can make us happy or sad. When we pray, we use words; when we sing, we use words. When we fall in love, words intensify our feelings. Music without words has not the same effect as when we add lyrics to it. It touches our hearts and emotions and can bring tears to our eyes. Twenty-four hours a day, we submerge ourselves in a hypnotic world of words. The radio, the TV, the cinema, the newspapers, the books etc., all ensure that we remain in a hypnotic world of a time traveller—no wonder the ego does not want to and cannot stop thinking. It has this false fear that it might disappear from the mind if it stops thinking. Since the ego can only appear in our conscious mind using words, non-stop thinking becomes a habit, turning the mind into an endless turbulent mode. Thus, in its pursuit of immortality, the ego conjures up and creates a world of dreams from the knowledge we gain from the world around us. It prefers to remain in a world of delusion rather than face and understand reality. It is why academics do not want to study the ego because they are afraid to look at themselves for fear they might have to change their perceptions and direction. When they say they practise evidence-based medicine, the medical profession must be joking. After reading the above, do you appreciate that we live in a hypnotic world? How do we wake up and face the timeless reality in front of us? Since you now know that your thinking process is hypnotic, just become aware of the words and how you use them in your mind. Become aware of your emotions and feeling. Become aware of your habit of verbalising your thoughts and feelings. See what happens when you temporary stop verbalising. Do your thoughts and feelings have any substance when you do this? Learn to understand your hopes, fears and desires. The ego wants to control everything. That is just a bad habit. Become aware. Harmonise your thoughts and feelings. You will only be able to do this if you are aware of what you are doing. Awareness dehypnotises you. Get your perceptions straightened out. The sooner you understand how your mind is working and learn more about how your ego operates, the quicker you will discover how eternal and peaceful the mind is. When the French philosopher Rene Descartes in 1637 made this famous statement, “I think; therefore, I am”, he did not understand what hypnosis was. He did not realise that the self or the ego is a product of self-hypnosis. We are hypnotic creatures. The ego ( thinker) in your mind can only appear if you use words. Without the words, the ego automatically has to take the back seat to become an observer in the conscious mind. The nature of the ego does not allow it to take the back seat. Thus thinking and the ego become linked-  “I think; therefore, I am”. If you still think you are not living in a fool’s paradise after considering what I have just explained, please think again. Become a true scientist, not a pseudo-scientist. There is peace and eternity to be found in the timeless present if you stop chasing your shadow. Discover it while you are alive. Because when we die, we all return to the timeless dimension."
11,5 Foods That Replenish Electrolytes,health-fitness," Minerals with an electrical charge are known as electrolytes. They're necessary for survival and wellbeing because electrolytes stimulate cell action all across the body. They aid hydration and energy production in the body. They're also in charge of causing muscular contractions, such as those that keep your heart beating. Electrolytes can be found in some foods, which means you can have them in your body without drinking any artificial drink. Isn’t that amazing? Let’s find out about the 10 foods that replenish electrolytes: Electrolyte mix drinks vary by brand, but they can fulfill the need of electrolytes in your body in a matter of seconds. Electrolytes can be obtained by eating your  proteins! The electrolyte ‘calcium’ can be found in abundance in milk and yogurt.  One cup of milk has roughly 300 milligrams of calcium, while one cup of yogurt has about 450 milligrams. Cheese is also a good source of chloride.  All of them are great post-workout snacks for rehydrating electrolytes and increasing protein intake! Celery is one of the best vegetables because it contains electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus), vitamin A, vitamin K, vitamin C, etc.  Since celery is rich in so many nutrients, it helps you deal with constipation problems better. Spinach is a phenomenal source of electrolytes, especially magnesium and calcium. Besides, micronutrients like vitamin A and vitamin K are also found in spinach. A single cup of cooked spinach contains 73% magnesium and 24% calcium for an adult. An electrolyte imbalance can happen for various causes, but it's most commonly associated with dehydration or excessive sweating. So, include these foods in your food chart today, and let us know how you felt after trying this electrolyte-infused diet."
12,Noise Management Program in Ontario,health-fitness," Hearing Excellence launches the industry first Noise Management Program to tackle the challenges associated with ever increasing noise. We live in a noisy world. The global phenomenon of ever-increasing environmental noise affects everyday lives and is one of the factors impacting general wellbeing. Noise has been diagnosed as a major cause of hearing loss, insomnia, increased stress levels and other health related problems. When the Hearing Excellence team was discussing the concept of creating the Noise Clinic. We understood that excessive noise in the workplace can lead to miscommunication, sleep interference and elevated blood pressure. It can cause serious, irreversible damage to the inner ear, leading to long-term issues with hearing as well as cognitive functioning. Fortunately, noise prevention protocols are well defined in workplaces. There is a reasonable level of awareness among the workforce and technology has evolved to allow us to protect our ears from occupational noise by using hearing protection, such as ear plugs. However, it became evident that, people are caught off guard when it comes to everyday noise. Our awareness levels are low, and we have no definite protocols to follow. The use of hearing protection devices in everyday life is extremely slow. Exposure to everyday noise is also a major cause of insomnia, elevated stress, and other health-related problems. Once the hearing pathway is damaged, there is no way to fix it. The only way we can stop this is through community awareness, noise management counselling, thorough diagnostics, accurate product prescription and solution validation. To tackle the universal noise problem, a our team of Audiologists worked on creating a world class Noise Management Protocol” says Sharad Ojha, the President of Hearing Excellence. Noise pollution around us is ever growing. Often, we don’t realize that permanent hearing damage can develop after exposure to just one incidence of extreme noise or after listening to loud sounds over time. Sound is measured in decibels (dB). We typically converse at around 60 dB, and that is a safe level of sound. But while watching a game in a stadium or while enjoying a rock concert, we are potentially exposed to noise levels in the range of 100- 180 dB. These are dangerous levels of noise, and it only takes a minute to 30 minutes of exposure to cause permanent damage to our hearing. Our lifestyle also forces us to be exposed to excess noise for example being in heavy traffic, listening to loud music, riding a motorcycle, passing subway car, standing on the GO station, frequenting noisy bars, mowing our lawns. All these situations are associated with noise levels that could impact our health. There are ranges of sounds we probably didn’t know, create havoc in our ears. In short, not only extreme loud noises but repeated exposure to higher decibels begins to destroy the nerve endings in inner ear permanently and cause multiple health issues. Recent studies show that loud music plus music blasted directly into the ears via earphones, have resulted in an alarming increase of hearing damage and tinnitus (ringing in the ears) in teenagers. All this is preventable if we don’t overload our ears."
13,Weight loss tips,health-fitness," Losing weight is not just a matter of eating the right foods and getting enough exercise, it is also a matter of developing the mental side of it because unless you get yourself into the right frame of mind your weight loss efforts are doomed to fail. Here are ten weight-loss hacks. Weight management is more a healthy living mind-set rather than a weight-loss one. Get into healthy living habits try not to focus on how much weight you are losing. Focus instead on getting enough exercise and eating the right foods. Healthy living also means living well and looking after your mental well-being. Unless you are in the right head-space you will not be in the right frame of mind to make the right choices as far as what you eat. Some people make a decision that they are not going to be happy until they lose x amount of weight or for some other reason. In other words they need a license in order to be happy. The catch-22 situation is that a low self-esteem will undermine your weight-controlling efforts. Being happy is your responsibility and yours alone. It is up to you to find your own calling in life and being the person you were meant to be will go a long way towards achieving happiness and once you achieve that it will be easier to achieve your ideal weight. There is no one else like you so be the best at being you rather than an imitation of someone else. It is better to polish the personal unique gifts and talents you have rather than be envious of others who are gifted in other areas. You are not meant to hide the talents you have or keep them to yourself but rather share them with others so that they may benefit from them. As far as weight-loss goes, it is futile to try and achieve a model-like figure when you have a different body-type. Run your own race and let others run their races. People who have a low self-esteem tend to make unfavourable comparisons with others. It is true that people tend to date their self-esteem. They are attracted to people who have the same issues as they have. Just accept who you are and if others do not like who you are then that is their problem, not yours. Just do your best! Advertisers will use all the tricks in the book to appeal to your desires. That includes making you feel guilty about who you are. Honestly, you can understand why some women's self-esteem suffers when you see some of the ads. There is usually a disclaimer in the ad saying ""results are not typical."" Understand that for every person who appears in those testimonials there are countless others who were unsuccessful despite all their efforts. The success stories you read of are often exaggerated. Take no notice of the before and after adverts. The only before and after photos you should concern yourself with are your own. An unflattering photo is always used for the before photo.You do not know what goes on in order to produce such a flattering image in the after photo. Make gradual changes to your diet in order for your body to become accustomed to a different routine whether that is changes to your diet or a new fitness regime. Develop good habits by taking bite-sized changes. It will all take time but it is better than trying to achieve too much in a short time then losing heart and giving up. Rome wasn't built in a day and neither was anything else worth achieving so be patient. It may be frustrating when you are not making much progress. Don't lose heart, just keep to your healthy living plan and you will at least be satisfied that you are doing the right thing. Focus on your hobbies and this will keep your mind off worries. Enjoy living your life despite your circumstances. This is essential for your well-being because unless you are in the right head-space your efforts to control your weight will be in vain. Have you heard of the saying ""comfort eating?"" Sport enables you to connect with others and helps to build up your network of friends and acquaintances. Getting involved in some kind of sport is an activity that will certainly help you to control your weight and help maintain your mental stability. There are a number of sports you can take up and it does not matter how unfit you are. Even walking around the block is better than not exercising. The key is to get into the habit of exercising. Your capacity to do more exercise will increase as your fitness increases. There is no magic formula for obtaining the body you want. There is no easy solution or short-cut method for reducing your weight. It takes effort and sacrifice and you have to decide whether it is all worth it. There is an ideal weight for all body types. Therefore you need to establish what is the ideal body type for your weight. https://fatburn27.carrd.co/"

19,Did You Realise That There’s a Healthy Trans Fat That Burns Abdominal Fat?,health-fitness," Most people are shocked when they find out that there is a special type of naturally occurring healthy Trans Fat which assists in burning off abdominal fat. Believe it or not this is true and it’s been proven! As I’m certain that you already know, much of our food today contains artificial Trans Fats. This fat comes from hydrogenated oils and is one of the most unhealthy foods which you can place in your body. These Trans Fats are proven to cause cancer, heart disease, obesity and so on… If you only make one change to your lifestyle starting today, I would recommend staying away from artificial Trans Fats that are generated from hydrogenated oils! Having said that, the one thing that you are probably not aware of, is that there’s a particular type of naturally occurring Trans Fat which stimulates fat loss in the body as well as helping to build lean muscle in the body. This natural Trans Fat is found in meat and dairy that comes from ruminant animals like cattle, sheep, venison, goat, kangaroo, bison and so on. This naturally occurring Trans Fat is called Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA). Consumption of CLA is proven to help prevent cancer within the body and also potentially burns fat within the body, especially abdominal fat. The quantity of CLA which occurs in ruminant animals is also much higher when the animal is grass-fed instead of grain-fed. Another extremely important fact that you need to keep in mind, is that the only type of healthy CLA is that which is found in grass-fed ruminant animals and is obtained via eating meat or drinking dairy. The CLA which your body absorbs through supplements or pills is an artificially created CLA which is made from a different isomer. As a result, taking CLA supplements and pills isn’t healthy and will not help to build lean muscle or burn body fat. To summarize, artificially created Trans Fats, especially the ones that are generated from hydrogenated oils, are extremely unhealthy for you and lead to the accumulation of body fat – stay away from these! There is however a naturally occurring Trans Fat which is found in grass-fed ruminant animals which is very healthy and helps to build lean muscle within the body as well as help to burn body fat. This natural Trans Fat is absorbed into the body through the consumption of meat and dairy from grass-fed ruminant animals and leads to an increase in metabolism in your body! So, there you go!

20,Can you Travel with CBD Oil?,health-fitness," Most countries allow people to obtain CBD with a prescription. There is also non-prescription CBD that comes in the form of dietary supplements. The legality of these products can be a bit different. If you are planning on traveling internationally, you are going to want to research the area you are traveling to. Also, look into the rules at the various airports you will be passing through. It’s not a good idea to pack CBD in your luggage if you know that you will potentially get in trouble. You may be able to obtain more products when you get to your final destination. The same goes for travel within the United States. States vary when it comes to the legality of CBD for recreational or prescription use. The Dangers of Travel in the United States In the United States, it is a federal crime to cross from one state to another state with cannabis in your possession. This applies to any cannabis-derived product. Even if you have a medical marijuana card, this won’t protect you from legal trouble. Regardless of what your medical need is, this is a big no-no. Regardless of what your stance is regarding the medical marijuana debate, that doesn’t give you the legal right to travel with THC-containing products in your possession. What Are the Rules Regarding CBD? People assume that CBD is legal to travel with because of its lack of THC. This is actually not a straightforward answer. If the product you are traveling with contains less than 0.3 percent THC and comes from the stem of a hemp plant, it is legal to carry from state to state. If you have a product that contains CBD but also contains other cannabis ingredients, then you’ll want to leave that product behind. Illegal products would include anything made with cannabis fibers, seeds or resins. If you need your CBD fix, stick to a very basic product that is strictly CBD based. How Do Companies Get Away with Shipping Internationally? You might be wondering how all these products are able to be shipped to various clients. In order for products to be legally sold and shipped, they must be made from industrial hemp, according to the 2018 Farm Bill, Section 7606. Any product that is being purchased, sold and shipped internationally or domestically must have less than 0.3 percent THC. There is also the loophole of being marketed as a dietary supplement. If a certain CBD product is marketed and sold as a dietary supplement or food product, they can be sold if they were created before laws were put into place. It’s important to remember, many countries consider cannabis and CBD to be illegal. You may still be able to find locations that will sell it to you over-the-counter. You may also be able to order it and have it shipped to your location. The majority of countries will allow for non-prescription CBD to be sold over-the-counter as long as there is no more than 0.2 percent THC in the product. When you are shopping for a specific CBD product, you can inquire about the THC content of a product. Most reputable CBD brands will provide you with lab results that give you the exact measurements of what is in their batch of product."

It's critical to do your homework before buying any brain supplement to ensure you're getting a high-quality product. #Memory Function with age As we get older, our brains naturally shrink.

There are a few factors to consider if you're searching for a memory and thinking enhancer. The first is to select a product that contains compounds that have been proved to work.

Be sure to keep track of how the supplement makes you feel. Some people experience side effects such as headaches, nausea, or irritability when taking brain supplements. If this occurs, discontinue use and talk with your doctor. Lastly, give the supplement time to work. Results won't be immediate, but you should start to notice an improvement in your memory and thinking skills after a few weeks of consistent use.

In addition, DMAE has been shown to increase skin suppleness and minimize wrinkles. #Can you overdose on brain supplements? It is generally considered that brain supplements are almost impossible to overdose on. This is due to the fact that these pills are intended to support and enhance cognitive performance, rather than induce intoxication or stimulation.

This is because some supplements may interact with prescription drugs, leading to adverse side effects. In general, however, brain supplements are considered to be very safe and well tolerated. So if you are looking for an edge in your cognitive performance, they may be a good option for you. #Conclusion The greatest way to guarantee good health is to get enough of these nutrients from food or supplement sources.

If you are looking for a way to improve your mental performance or protect your brain health, then consider taking a brain supplement like Neuro Plus."
2,4 Benefits of Matche Olive Leaf Tea Powder,health-fitness," What makes Matche so great is that it is the entire olive leaf, from Italy, transformed into a powder without any chemicals. This means that it is possible to consume all the good parts of the leaves, like oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol unlike with traditional teas where you can only pull out so much with hot water. Matche is characterized by a high content of polyphenols, which are micronutrients we get through our diet. Olive leaf phenols and their derivatives are associated with many therapeutic properties. The health benefits gained from these polyphenols depend on both how much is consumed and how much the body can absorb. The ability of Matche to scavenge reactive oxygen species is associated with its potential role in preventing heart disease and metabolic disorders. Briefly there are four main benefits of Matche: (1)	High amounts of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory capacity. (2)	May reduce the risk of heart disease. (3)	May help lower blood sugar. (4)	May promote bone health. But, like everything there are negatives: (1)	May enhance the effect of blood pressure medications. (2)	The research around olive leaves is relatively new. More in-depth, Matche is likely effective for: (1)	Antioxidant Hydroxytyrosol is the olive leaf phenol that is most effective at neutralizing free radicals, followed by oleuropein and tyrosol. Hydroxytyrosol improved antioxidant status in several clinical trials. It may also help lower blood sugar due to its ability to block free radical production by Nox2. The existing evidence suggests that olive leaves has antioxidant activity. You may discuss with your doctor how it may help your antioxidant status. (2)	Cardiovascular Health One of the main phenols in Matche, oleuropein, significantly lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as blood fat and cholesterol levels in some research. The blood pressure-lowering effects of olive leaves are possibly due to its ability to preserve blood vessel function. In animal studies, olive leaves reduced blood pressure, heart rate, and enlargement of the heart and kidney tissues while improving blood vessel function in rats with high blood pressure. Note, however, that it’s not approved by the FDA to treat or prevent these conditions. You may use it to improve your cardiovascular health if your doctor determines that it may help in your case. (3)	Anti-inflammatory In a small trial on 18 healthy volunteers, olive leaves reduced the production of a pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-8) and improved blood vessel function. Hydroxytyrosol, combined with omega-3 fatty acids and curcumin, reduced inflammation (CRP levels and pain) when taken for 1 month in a clinical trial on 45 women with breast cancer. Hydroxytyrosol also reduced inflammatory pain in a small trial on 25 people with joint disease (gonarthrosis). In colon samples isolated from 14 people with ulcerative colitis, treatment with olive leaves reduced the production of pro-inflammatory molecules (the enzyme COX-2 and the cytokine IL-17) and infiltration of immune cells (CD3, CD4, and CD20), resulting in decreased inflammatory damage. The research noted about is very limited but suggests that olive leaves and its components have some anti-inflammatory activity. Further clinical research should confirm these findings and establish how to use them therapeutically. (4)	Bone Health There has been some research showing women using olive leaves maintained bone mineral density and increased the blood levels of a bone-forming cell production marker (osteocalcin). The mechanism for this may be that human bone marrow stem increase bone cell production in the presence of oleuropein. Other potential effects of which there is limited evidence: Oleuropein, one of the main phenols in olive leaves, improved insulin sensitivity and increased the uptake of blood sugar in diabetic mice. In addition, oleuropein effectively prevented cell death and tumor formation in the spleens and livers of infected mice. Finally, preliminary research suggests that olive leaves may help fight obesity by preventing the body from generating more fat cells. As always, discuss this with your doctor before starting on something that may have an impact on your health. They have an understanding of your current medications and potential side-effects."
3,Seven Tips For A Long And Healthy Life,health-fitness," As good as modern medical technology, it will never be able to save you from a problem caused by an unhealthy lifestyle. Instead of getting modern medical improvements for each problem, it is much better to live in such a way that you will not fall ill. One ounce of prevention is certainly better than one pound of healing. Here are seven tips on how to live a long and healthy life. In addition, the same lifestyle that helps you avoid disease also helps you lose weight. People had to use their physical bodies as part of their everyday labor in the past. Today, though, someone may get up, drive to work, sit down, drive home, and then sit down for the rest of the day. There is no physical labor in such a life. Physical inactivity is one of the leading causes of a variety of illnesses. If our typical work does not demand us to strain ourselves physically, we must incorporate sports, running, walking, and other activities into our lives. I This might sound simple, but many people stay up even when their bodies tell them that it's time to sleep. Yoga and Doctor Ayurvedic also say that it's better to sleep at night and active during the day. However, people like students will drink coffee and stimulants to learn until late at night. The other develops the habit of staying active at night and sleeps during the day. While we can do this, finally taking victims of health. Alternative health doctors say that unnatural life like this is one of the factors that contribute to the causes of cancer and other diseases This is likewise a simple concept, but we frequently ignore the body's messages. You will not digest your food effectively if you eat out of habit or due to social pressure at a given time of day, even though you have no true appetite. Acidity and indigestion set in, increasing the likelihood of other, more complex disorders developing. Having an appetite is a sign of excellent health, but if you don't have one, you should wait a while before eating. (If you still don't have an appetite after waiting a reasonable amount of time, see a doctor because something is wrong.) If you are going to ask people to work 365 days per year without rest, they will complain and say that they must have a break or they will break down. But we never bothered asking or thinking about our digestive organs we forced to work day after day without rest. They cannot protest the way someone will go to his boss, but they give us a signal that they cannot work without stopping. When we ignore the signals and still force them to work, the organs broke down. That is why fasting is needed. Don't eat for one complete day. It gives a break on your digestive organs and also helps in removing waste from your body. Regular fasting allows someone to get extra time for intellectual or spiritual pursuit. Fasting is not for ascetic in the cave, but is a reasonable practice that can be practiced anyone. As mentioned above, the right sleep is very important for health care. If you wash your important motor and sensory organs (hands, arms, eyes, legs, mouth, genitals) before going to bed using cold water, this will calm you down and prepare you to sleep well. Your body is linked to your mind. Many of these era diseases are psychosomatic. Stress and anxiety took their victims on our physical health. Meditation is a mental exercise that, among others, allows you to escape life's worries. Learn simple techniques and do it regularly. ""Early to bed, early to wake"" is an old adage that ""makes a person healthy, wealthy, and wise."" I'm not sure if it will make you wealthy, but it will undoubtedly keep you healthy. Your body requires just the right amount of sleep, not too much or too little."

5,Alternatives to Traditional Dental Implants,health-fitness," Many people are nervous about asking for dental implants for various reasons. Some are afraid that they’ll have to wait too long to actually enjoy the benefits of their new teeth, while others think they might not be eligible for the process at all without bone grafts. As an oral surgeon who specializes in implant placement, I always take the time to let my patients know that the traditional method of placing dental implants is not the only option. Thanks to advancements in how implants are placed, the following alternatives are also available All-on-4 When replacing a full set of teeth with dental implants, the number of posts needed to support the full denture will vary. Sometimes as many as 8 dental implants might need to be used, but with the All-on-4 procedure, you can get a strong, stable smile with half that number. The four implant posts used in the procedure are placed in very specific positions. In particular, the implants near the back of your mouth are placed at an angle so that they join with the portion of the bone near the front of your jaw. The idea is that placing the dental implants this way lets them take advantage of the parts of the mouth where bone density is highest. Not only does this allow us to place the fewest number of implants possible, but it also means that even patients with bone loss can undergo the procedure without grafts first. Mini Dental Implants A mini dental implant is exactly what you’d expect: it looks like a regular implant, but it’s much smaller. This seemingly simple difference can drastically change the process of getting new teeth. Regular implant posts need to be surgically inserted into the jaw, but mini implants can be attached to the bone with a much less invasive process. Since less bone is required for this process, it can eliminate the need for bone grafting entirely, making it a great option for those who have already experienced bone loss after losing their teeth. Don’t worry; the smaller size doesn’t make mini implants any less reliable than traditional dental implants. Teeth-in-an-Hour One of the most common concerns that my patients seem to have with dental implants is the fact that there’s usually several months between implant surgery and the placement of the final restoration. The delay is due to the fact that the implants need time to form a bond with the jawbone, and making them support prosthetic teeth too early could disrupt the process. But with Teeth-in-an-Hour, there’s no waiting. The implants are placed in the ideal locations in ideal positions on the jawline with the help of a surgical guide. This technique significantly reduces healing time, and the implant posts are able to join with the jawbone much faster. As a result, they’ll be capable of supporting a temporary restoration – or sometimes even a permanent one – right away. In short, when you’re thinking about getting dental implants, you should take the time to carefully consider all of the available options. Depending on what procedure you choose, you could enjoy a new smile in less time with much less hassle."
6,Susanne’s Story: How to Improve ICU Patient Outcomes with the ABCDEF Bundle,health-fitness," When we think about the intensive care unit, most of us would assume it’s a place that provides the best possible treatment for patients, and is always on the cutting edge of science, medicine and technology. But while this may be true in many aspects, when it comes to things like sedation, early mobility, and management of delirium in the ICU, unfortunately, most ICUs are still using woefully outdated practices. Over the years, I’ve seen time and time again how these outmoded protocols can have an absolutely devastating effect on patient outcomes. One particularly egregious example of this involved a woman named Susanne. This is her story. How Susanne Became a Victim of the ICU Assembly Line Susanne was a healthy 49-year-old woman who developed Ludwig’s angina. She was admitted to the ICU for sepsis and polymicrobial cellulitis airway compromise due to significant submandibular swelling. She was intubated and put on mechanical ventilation to protect her airway. Prior to intubation, the risks of prolonged sedation and immobility were not disclosed to Susanne and her family, and she was not given the option to be awake and mobile. Due to the prevailing ICU culture of automatically sedating every patient on mechanical ventilation, Susanne was deeply sedated and immobile for 18 days, despite the lack of a clear indication of the need for prolonged deep sedation. It is important to understand that accumulating evidence shows there are only a few cases in which continuous deep sedation is essential for patients on mechanical ventilation. Those exceptions include things like intracranial hypertension, severe respiratory failure, refractory status epilepticus, and prevention of awareness in patients treated with neuromuscular blocking agents. Needless to say, Susanne did not require deep sedation, and there’s evidence to show she would have been a prime candidate for remaining awake while on the ventilator. Susanne reports suffering deeply traumatizing delirium that included vivid and graphic delusions that felt more real to her than the reality she now lives. It is unclear how long she needed the endotracheal tube for the protection of her airway, but long before she was liberated from sedation and extubated, she was given sedation vacations in attempts to do breathing trials. However, when sedation was decreased, she became physically active and expressed the terror and agitation she was experiencing from her delirium. This is a common occurrence during sedation vacations. At this point, Susanne recalls hearing clinicians at her bedside saying, “Well, she’s too crazy. She’s not ready to come off of this. We’ll try again in a few days.” It’s anyone’s guess how many more days of mechanical ventilation, deep sedation, and delirium Susanne was subjected to because of her response to what she had experienced. Her husband finally convinced the ICU team to take sedation off, allow Susanne to wake up, and get her off the ventilator. Without his persistence, who knows how much longer she would have had to endure this suffering. Remarkably, her lungs were healthy, and the swelling in her airway had likely decreased well before 18 days had elapsed, but due to her ICU team’s outdated practices, she remained sedated because she was intubated and intubated because she was sedated. When she was admitted to the ICU, Susanne weighed 130 pounds, but during those 18 days of immobility and muscular atrophy, she lost 35 pounds - mainly of lean muscle. She reports that the first time she stood on her feet again after being sedated was like stepping on glass because of the neuropathy she had developed. Her journey to rebuild muscle, regain the weight, and return to her baseline psychological, cognitive, and physical capacity has been quite the struggle, and Susanne wishes she had been allowed to remain awake, present, and mobile during her ICU stay. Unfortunately, Susanne fell victim to the ICU assembly line of automatic deep sedation and immobility for every patient on mechanical ventilation. She suffered ICU delirium, ICU-acquired weakness, prolonged time on the ventilator, and possible long-term deficits because of the choice to sedate her for 18 days. Long after her ICU discharge, Susanne continues to be haunted by the stress, terror, and panic experienced while under sedation. If you want to know more about her story, you can listen to Episode 92 of my Walking Home From The ICU podcast. How the ABCDEF Bundle Can Improve ICU Patient Outcomes for People Like Susanne The decision to deeply sedate Susanne is typical of ICU culture, and was likely habitual, but there was certainly no need for it. If this ICU team was following evidence-based practices, they would have applied the ABCDEF Bundle to help Susanne stay awake, free of delirium, and mobile during her time on mechanical ventilation. The ABCDEF Bundle provides a set of evidence-based practices for how to improve ICU patient outcomes for those who may require sedation in the ICU. It encourages exercise and early mobility in the ICU, family engagement and empowerment, the assessment, prevention, and management of both pain and delirium, and also recommends conducting both Spontaneous Awakening Trials (SATs) and Spontaneous Breathing Trials (SBTs), while allowing patients to choose whether they want to receive analgesia and sedation. The failure to apply the ABCDEF bundle in Susanne’s care increased her risk of: ●	Death ●	Delirium ●	Post-ICU PTSD ●	Post-ICU cognitive impairments ●	Post-ICU syndrome ●	ICU-acquired weakness ●	Prolonged time on the ventilator ●	Hospital-acquired infections ●	Hospital-acquired pressure injuries ●	Extensive rehabilitation ●	Longer time in the ICU and hospital ●	Increased risk of hospital and ICU readmission Susanne’s story provides a clear example of the results from numerous studies, which show that deep sedation typically results in more time on the ventilator. It’s also important to mention that proper sedation practices and early mobility in the ICU have been shown to improve ICU patient outcomes, and likely would have prevented delirium and significantly decreased Susanne’s time on the ventilator, among other outcomes. If her ICU team had been following evidence-based practices, they would have known that: Prolonged sedation prevents sleep, which causes delirium. Delirium is often very traumatic and causes agitation and panic, as patients may experience violent, graphic, and terrifying realities, which are far worse than the reality of being in the ICU. Susanne’s psychomotor activity was likely occurring due to the fact she was suffering from hyperactive delirium, and not because of the discomfort caused by her endotracheal tube. Delirium is a life-threatening condition and a medical emergency. The only treatment for delirium is to STOP medications that cause delirium, while allowing for family involvement, mobility, and REAL sleep. Resuming sedation at that moment does NOT make patients “more comfortable.” Turning sedation back on will cause, exacerbate, and prolong delirium, increasing the risk of suffering from the repercussions of sedation and immobility. Sending patients back into the depths of delirium is not humane and is not an evidence-based practice. Long story short, the ABCDEF bundle could have prevented much of this unnecessary suffering, and alleviated the costs of time and money for both Susanne and her ICU care team. If you want to know more about how I can help you advocate for evidence-based practices in your ICU, or the ICU where your family member has been admitted, please don’t hesitate to contact me.

7,"The Brain, The Ego and The Mind",health-fitness," Do you know how intimately connected we are to our body and mind? The energy that keeps us alive, where does it come from? When it leaves the body, the body dies. Where does this energy go? Most of us are involved in our daily routine of living and surviving on this planet earth. Despite all the technical knowledge and advances we have made through science, we have plenty of evidence that our mental health is deteriorating. It is because most people have no idea how the mind works. Here I will try to help you understand my understanding of the mind. You do not have to believe what I say, but please try to disprove it in your mind and see if what I write makes sense. It is evident there is a greater intelligence beyond our thinking process at work. If we looked at our body, we think it is our brain where all our brilliance lies. It is because the brain is the physical part we use for thinking and reasoning. If we are unable to use our brain for any reason, we would feel handicapped. The brain protects us from our environment and helps us take evasive action if any danger threatens us. Without the brain, we would not survive or understand our world and our mind. Life would become challenging if we could not use our brains. Thus the brain plays a crucial role in our perception of reality. It is the organ we use to understand our mind. It is the organ that helps us perceive reality. If we did not use it properly, it is the organ that can lead to physical and mental ill-health. It is the organ the mind uses to express our talents and personality. Without the brain, the mind cannot function fully. So what is the mind? As I see it, the mind is the energy source (the current) that keeps us alive. For convenience, we can divide it into two parts, the conscious and the subconscious. But in reality, we have one mind. The self or ego operates in the conscious part of the mind. It is a concentration of our desire to survive on this planet. It is territorial and possessive and wants to control everything. It builds itself (ego-boost) on the knowledge and experiences in life to become a well-defined entity and hides behind beliefs. It wants to continue to live forever and is tied to time. It has an immense capacity to delude itself.  We need the ego to interpret reality in front of us. We also need the brain to develop our egos. Without the ego, we cannot function as individuals. The brain allows the ego to experience consciousness and awareness, which are the property of the mind. So one can see how intimately the brain and the ego are connected. However, our subconscious mind is also connected to the brain. It controls all our vital functions and systems in our body, such as the cardiovascular system, respiratory system, digestive system etc. People take the subconscious mind for granted and show very little understanding of how the ego influences the subconscious mind. It is the subconscious mind that makes us happy or sad, depending on how we stimulate it. It has no discriminating power. It does not recognize right from wrong, the good from the bad. Whatever we do in life, we are always trying to appease our subconscious mind. For instance, when we pray to God or some other entity, we try to appease our subconscious mind. We are doing the same thing when we are playing music, dancing, singing etc. Our subconscious mind is the piano we use to play the tune we want. The keys of the piano are the words we use to produce a specific sound. We can play a happy tune or a sad tune, depending on how we use the words. Therefore, shouldn't we try to understand how our subconscious mind works? If we looked at our body, intelligence permeates right through, from the central (the brain) to the individual cellular level. Yes, there is perception taking place even at the cellular level. Every cell in our body knows its function and how to replace itself. The skin cells know their function of protecting us from the outside environment, the lung cells know how to transfer oxygen from the air, the kidney cells know how to purify our blood, the digestive cells in the gastrointestinal system know how to digest food etc., and so it goes on. All this is under subconscious control. Even our immune system, which involves the healing process, is under subconscious control. The conscious mind, where the ego operates, has very little control but indirectly influences all these areas. Hence, ignoring the subconscious mind and taking it for granted would be a stupid thing to do. Yet, it is what we have been doing and are doing today. So what happens when we incur some damage to our brain? One can have a stroke or have a head injury from a fall. One can suffer from some degenerative brain disease like Alzheimer's or a motor neuron disease, etc. The symptoms and signs we will suffer from will depend on the area of the affected brain. We can lose our consciousness, lose our memory, or we can become paralyzed, etc. When this happens, our ego or self cannot function correctly. We will feel handicapped. When a person becomes brain dead, the conscious mind or the ego cannot function at all. Yet, the subconscious mind can keep the vital functions going, and the person can continue to live. When we switch off the life support system, the body dies as the mind separates from the body. Yes, our brain is like the hardware of the computer system. If it malfunctions for any reason, the software (the mind) will crash. A perfect example of a mind trapped in a crippled body is the case of Dr Stephen Hawkins. He was a British scientist who suffered for 55 years from motor neuron disease, which only affected the motor areas of his brain. Since other areas of his brain were unaffected,  his ego (the conscious mind) could function normally; that is, he could think and reason. Therefore, it is clear that specific areas of our brain are involved in maintaining our consciousness and awareness, without which the ego cannot operate. In the Brisbane Courier-Mail Qweekend Magazine of 24/4/2021, there was a story about three young adults aged 20,21 and 22  from different backgrounds dying in their sleep. They went to sleep and never woke up. They suffered from epilepsy and died from SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy). This tragedy shows that any defect in our brain can cause it to malfunction, and our life can be at risk. Our mental and physical health depends on our ability to use our brain not just for ego-building exercise but also to understand how our mind works.  We should learn how the ego influences the subconscious mind. We should become aware of how our perceptions influence our thinking and how our thinking affects our actions. Our perception of time that we have created makes us time-travellers. We are caught in this net of time and always travelling between the past, present and future. But in reality, there is no such thing as time. There is a timeless dimension all around us. It is just as real as the time dimension of our creation. The only thing that separates the two is our perception. Everyone experiences this timeless dimension from time to time when the observer in mind and what is being observed become one phenomenon. But because the ego is so dependent on thinking and fearful of disappearing into the timeless that it cannot recognize it. To experience the timeless dimension, one should go to the mountain top or out in the bush away from any man-made structures.  Here the pull of nature is so powerful that it is easy to observe the phenomenon of the observer in your mind, and what is being observed become one. But one can experience this anywhere. When this happens, you will discover that we have only one mind. Your mind is experiencing eternity in this state, and you are fully alert and aware of both your inner and outer worlds. The ego is there, and you are not in a trance. You will realize that you are not separate but one with the universe. You will realize that you are also part of this timeless dimension. There is no thinking but just awareness. But once the ego uses words to describe what you see, you will revert to our familiar time zone. From the above observations, one can see that we have only one mind, and the ego is not the whole mind. The ego cannot operate effectively without a healthy brain. The brain allows the ego to think and reason. The brain allows us to perceive reality. The ego ties itself to time without realizing that it is a part of the timeless dimension. What the ego is creating is an escapist world today. The more one tries to escape from reality, the more out of touch with reality one becomes. It is distorting our perceptions, and we will suffer from more mental health problems. It is, therefore, time to understand our ego better and become aware of our perceptions and thinking. We have to use our brains to understand the timeless dimension and lose the fear of death before our mind separates from the body.  Without self-knowledge, you are like a ship without an engine on the ocean of life. The rough seas will buffet you. You will be worse for wear when you arrive at your destination. However, if you want to be a ship that can plough through the rough seas without much effort, empower yourself with the engine of self-knowledge.

8,Exploring Traditional Chinese Medicine,health-fitness," Traditional Chinese medicine has been a part of Chinese culture for thousands of years. There are many physical and mental benefits to Chinese medicine as it promotes better overall health. Chinese medicine is a broad field which involves many different techniques and specializations. One of these specializations/techniques is acupuncture. Acupuncture is a technique where needles are carefully inserted into the body to stimulate light pain in different areas of the body. The reasoning for this is that this stimulates the release of the body’s natural painkillers and “trains” your brain to handle pain more effectively. The end result is that your body is able to tolerate better certain types of pain such as low-back pain, neck pain, osteoarthritis/knee pain, and pain from carpal tunnel syndrome (https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/traditional-chinese-medicine-what-you-need-to-know). If the field of Chinese medicine and acupuncture interest you, then you might be wondering how you can get yourself involved. You have to embark on your journey to become an acupuncturist. Acupuncturists are licensed medical professionals that have been extensively trained in the field of Chinese medicine and acupuncture. There are many different schools that you can attend to become a licensed acupuncturist. One of these schools that holds top ratings is the Canadian College of Traditional Chinese Medicine (CCTCM). CCTCM offers a variety of different programs designed to help you become a licensed medical professional in traditional Chinese medicine. There are also different types of degrees offered by CCTCM that are designed to suit your priorities and schedule. Whether you are a young student or a mature student, CCTCM hosts program and program routes designed to fit your needs. CCTCM also has extremely reasonable tuition costs and fees and many different flexible options to pay the fees. The biggest dilemma you may face is whether proper COVID-19 safety protocols have been implemented at CCTCM. You can be assured that CCTCM strictly adheres to and follows all COVID-19 safety protocols as mandated by the municipal and federal governments. CCTCM takes student safety very seriously. Now, as many colleges shift to in-person learning, CCTCM makes sure that students learn in a safe environment without worrying about COVID-19. If you are thinking of becoming an acupuncturist, it is advised that you thoroughly conduct research before embarking on this journey. Becoming an acupuncturist may seem intimidating to some due to the fact that it takes a few years to successfully complete all the required courses and examinations and actually starting to practice acupuncture. However, those who are truly interested in pursuing the field of acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine will need to dedicate themselves towards completing the required courses and examinations in order to become an acupuncturist. Acupuncture is a field that rewards patience and dedication to those that successfully complete the necessary requirements.  Suppose you want to consult more resources to help you make your decision. In that case, CCTCM holds regular workshops, seminars, and clinics to educate young students about acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine. These events aim to help potential students to evaluate whether acupuncture is the right career choice or not. By: Staff, CCTCM"
9,Tips for transitioning to natural deodorants,health-fitness," It is challenging to switch from commercial deodorants and replace them with natural deodorants; however, it is highly recommended and a good decision. You need to take care of your body in a natural way. This begins by making wise decisions about what to apply on our bodies. It is advisable to care for the body by using natural products. Why must natural deodorants be used? There are harsh toxins present in conventional/commercial deodorants like phthalates, metals, and parabens. All these are harmful toxins that make it time-consuming to detoxify your body. Difference between antiperspirant and natural deodorant The function of these products is to lower your body’s odour. Aluminum is present in antiperspirants, which helps minimize perspiration and blocks sweat glands. It doesn’t create a favourable effect by preventing adverse odour and keeps armpits dry. Deodorant helps to mask and lessen body odour. Harsh toxin chemicals are present in conventional antiperspirants and deodorants. It is challenging to switch from antiperspirant to a natural deodorant. However, transitioning with Tea Tree Body Wash 16 Fl Oz will help you in ample ways in the longer run. Following are the tips for using natural deodorant. Get ready for a detox period. After transitioning to natural deodorant from conventional ones, one crucial setback is the detox period. Initially, you may feel that the natural deodorant isn’t reducing body odor. However, the truth is that the toxin build-up is being detoxified. Natural deodorants mask the odor without stopping the sweat. You need to make your body adjust to the changes, which can be complicated. The detox period length will vary from three days to three weeks. You’ll feel normal after the detox period gets over. Sweating is good Sweating is a part of your body’s physiological process, which is good but only the smell feels bad. Sweat clears excess toxins and heat from your body. You should try to stop the odor instead of preventing sweat. Toxin removal should be promoted through exercise, so regularly practice exercises. When you become used to natural products after the detox period gets over, then you’ll feel more comfortable. Underarms should be moisturized Antiperspirant is present in conventional deodorants that make armpits sensitive and dry. Initially, natural deodorant will be difficult to transition, especially after shaving, like rashes and redness. Try pampering your armpits during the transitioning process and soothe your pain. You should moisturize your underarms by applying coconut oil, and this is the best remedy. Clay mask for speeding detox If you want to enjoy the benefits of natural deodorants, then speed up the detox process by applying a detox clay mask to your armpits. For detoxifying the portion of underarms, you can make your own Dead Sea Mud Mask For Face And Skin. This requires a detoxifying skin agent called Betonite clay that doesn’t contain chemicals."
10,5 Must-Have Vitamins Supplements for a Healthy Smile,health-fitness," When you think of oral health best practices, what comes to mind? For many it’s brushing twice a day, flossing daily, and getting a checkup and cleaning every six months. While these are all certainly important, there is another essential component of achieving pristine oral health that patients often forget: consuming the right nutrients. After all, you need to keep your teeth healthy from the inside-out too! To learn the vitamins I recommend as a dentist, read on. #1. Calcium Calcium isn’t just essential for your bones, it’s essential for your teeth. In fact, the National Institutes of Health named calcium one of the most important minerals! The good news is that there are a wide variety of foods that are high in this essential vitamin, including canned salmon, kale, and almonds. Even better, dairy products, like milk and yogurt, are both high in calcium and light in color, helping you maintain nice, white teeth. #2. Phosphorus Phosphorus is extremely important when it comes to oral health in large part because it helps your body absorb calcium! Therefore, it’s important to fill your diet with meat, eggs, milk, and other phosphorus-rich foods and beverages. If you follow a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle, don’t worry – there are other ways to meet this goal, like whole grains or supplements. #3. Vitamin D Over the years, researchers have found that vitamin D deficiencies have been linked to several dental problems, including tooth decay and gum disease. The good news is that incorporating this essential vitamin into your diet is as easy as taking a supplement each day! Otherwise, you can stock up on milk, breakfast cereals, and oily fish, like salmon. #4. Potassium Potassium is important for multiple reasons, including the fact that it aids bone mineral density and helps the blood from becoming too acidic. Therefore, incorporating a healthy amount into your daily diet can help both your oral and overall health. Some good sources of potassium include bananas, beans, tomatoes, avocados, and prunes. #5. Vitamin K Have you heard of Vitamin K? Essentially, it helps shield substances that break down bone. Furthermore, a vitamin K deficiency can cause complications, like slowing down your body’s healing process. This can be a nuisance if you are struggling with a canker sore or are recovering from a restorative treatment, like root canal therapy. So, be mindful to include Brussel sprouts, broccoli, parsley, and other vitamin K-rich foods in your diet. Remember, keeping your smile happy and healthy is about so much more than how often you brush and floss. Consuming the right foods is just as important!"
11,"Personal Fitness Trainer in Kenya, personal Trainer in Kenya, personal fitness coach, jpnyiha.com",health-fitness," There is a common misconception among women that lifting weights will give them a “bulky and masculine” appearance, which they would rather not have. As such, many of them flock to cardio and light weight, high repetition training in their quest to “tone” and firm up their muscles. First off, let it be known, that “toning” does not exist. When most people say that they want to tone up, what they are referring to, is a look. And all it takes to achieve this look is to build muscle, and be lean enough for said muscle to show. That being said, how exactly do we grow muscle? The process is the same, regardless of whether you are male or female. First & most important: You MUST train using progressive overload; improving your performance in the gym over time e.g. by using heavier weights and/or performing more sets and reps. You MUST train with a high enough intensity of effort in order to force your muscles to adapt and grow. This is done by taking ALL your sets 1-2 repetitions shy of form failure (the point at which you are unable to perform another repetition of an exercise using proper lifting technique). Majority of your training should include multi-joint, compound movements e.g. Squats, Hip Thrusts, Bench Presses & Barbell Rows. These exercises have the greatest propensity to build the most strength and muscle in the least amount of time. Now, for the women reading this saying that they don’t want to build “TOO MUCH” muscle. Understand that, even for men, who have the added advantage of having much larger amounts of testosterone coursing through their bodies, will take many years in order to build appreciable muscle mass. Therefore women, who have very little natural testosterone, will have to fight tooth and nail to get too big. And even then, it probably will not happen. What will happen instead is that all the muscle you put on will actually give you the “toned” look that you desire. If you want to have “toned” arms? Build muscle in your arms. If you want “toned” thighs, build muscle in your thighs. https://jpnyiha.com/ Cardio does not build muscle ladies! It only burns calories. If all you are doing is cardio and NO resistance training then you will not look toned, you will instead look soft and frail. So the next time you are at the gym, opt for the squat rack instead of the treadmill (you can do that after :P) and you will finally get the results that you desire."
12,Why KIlling Youth Aka Future,health-fitness," WHY KILLING YOUTH AKA FUTURE ?! Showcased in Substance Use and Misuse,  Estoup, Cambell, Varma and Stewart’s (2016) article, “The Impact of Marijuana Legalization on Adolescent Use, Consequences, and Perceived Risk,” points out that marijuana use harms young people. These Clinical Psychologists examined various people and concluded that marijuana use can result in cancers, damage to developing areas of the brain and also it leads to depression (“Background,” para. 1). The authors of this article indirectly slap the persons/governing bodies who have legalized marijuana in full. Their research and references in an article trying to implement that use of marijuana create consequences in adolescence (Estoup. et.al, 2018, “marijuana legalization and use,” para. 1). Why are developed countries trying to kill the young generation of their country itself, which means why they legalized marijuana in full?! Why they are killing their future? Research has proven – and all major scientific and medical organizations agree – marijuana is both addictive and harmful to the human brain, especially when used as an adolescent. One in every six 16-year-olds who try marijuana will become addicted to it. And if an adolescent has a genetic predisposition for schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, using marijuana as their brain continues to develop can increase the risk of that disorder (Kevin, 2016,  “Important lessons from Cannabis legalization,” para 1). The use of marijuana affects social life in various ways. Those who consume or are addicted to these drugs create more accidents on roads and thus create a social imbalance in society. How a government can allow all these things? Why is no one taking necessary modifications in legalization rules?! Self-directed selfish society is not at all interested in their future generation. Marijuana use in adolescence affects their education life too. Many students are forced to stop their schooling due to their addiction to this filthy drug. Without creating a well-educated society how a nation can provide a socially balanced society?! The usage of marijuana may not immensely affect this generation, but studies show that it will create an imbalanced society in future. While using marijuana users are not able to control their own emotions. They can’t control their anger, anxiety, fear and sadness. All these direct them to depression and crimes. If they can’t control their emotions, then why they are called humans? They are not humans; They are animals. No, they are even worse (Estoup. et.al, 2018, “marijuana legalization and use,” para. 1). The use of marijuana increases year by year, especially since the young generation uses it the most. People between the ages group 15-24 are the most consumers of marijuana. Wow! This shows how a nation kills its future. Legalization causes the wide use of this filthy drug. Some foolish irresponsible studies show that the legalization of marijuana decreased the rate of suicide, rate of accidents, alcohol consumption. I don’t know how they can relate marijuana with these facts. Even under-aged person knows that the use of marijuana will affect their whole body. How a government can take such irresponsible decisions? (Estoup.et.al, 2018, “Background,” para. 1). In my view, marijuana legalization will create an immense bad effect on the future. There is no need for world war 3. Because the widespread of legalization other countries will lead to the destruction of the young generation. It’s so pathetic that no one is tense about their future generation. Many intellectuals, scientists, political parties are trying to hide the real facts about the impact of marijuana on adolescence. Without an educated, socially balanced society there is no future for this present world. Yes, we are dying! Yes, we are killing ourselves. ."

15,ADHD - Racial and Gender Differences Leading to Disparities in Diagnosis,health-fitness," Over the last decade, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has become a prevalent diagnosis and has become part of the mainstream culture in school age children (5 years of age to 18 years of age). While there is a debate over if it is an overused diagnosis, the question becomes: are there inequalities behind the diagnosis of ADHD? There are some clear disparities in the diagnosis of people of color and women as well as socioeconomics playing a factor in a positive diagnosis. Interestingly, it is unclear if the diagnostic inequality with African Americans is due to racism or lack of data collection. In either case, having a disparity in a medical diagnosis of any proportion is an issue because it means there is a multitude of people who are struggling unnecessarily and could benefit from receiving a medical intervention. Curiously, of the current demographics being studied, much of the diagnosis of the pediatric population surrounding attention deficit hyperactivity disorders are given to white males that originate from a family in a lower socioeconomic class. A study done at University of Kentucky, run by Myles Moody which was published in The Journal of African American Studies, discusses contributing factors to the school-to-prison pipeline. He includes underdiagnosing of black kids with ADHD as part of the pipeline. “…the underdiagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in Black children is a result of racism…” Moody goes on to paraphrase a paper written in 2013 about a study done in 1999, entitled Early Childhood Longitudinal Study: Kindergarten Class of 1998–1999, to say that white children were predominantly diagnosed during middle school in comparison to the their black counterparts. “…of 17,100 children what they found was approximately 7% of white children had been diagnosed with ADHD…between kindergarten and with grade…only 3% of Black children had been diagnosed by middle school”. The long-term effect of not diagnosing a person of color seems to be minimal when in fact the results have potential for a very negative impact on a child’s life — particularly in the African American community. Theoretically based off Moody’s study, if a child of color who is symptomatic for ADHD but is not given the diagnosis, he will become less focused in the classroom and start having trouble in his personal life because he is not studying. Moody claims that the failure to diagnose ADHD in children of color potentially can lead several problems in the future. As an example, kids being punished for not focusing on the classroom, or being treated like a criminal for struggling with academic performance or constantly being late for class. The school to prison pipeline can be reduced by properly diagnosing people from all demographics. It is disturbing that one group in the population appears to be so underdiagnosed for ADHD (Shi Y, Hunter Guevara LR, Dykhoff HJ, et al.) but based on historical context and based on another common misdiagnosis it is not surprising. Based on historical context for dishonest research practices in the African American communities, such as the Tuskegee syphilis disaster, it makes sense to contribute the underdiagnosis to racism. Even though it might be a stretch to say this because there is a lack of empirical data, it seems that maybe the lack of diagnosis has to do with the parent’s knowledge of what ADHD is. In a study done by Regins Bussling and et. al. published in The Journal of Family issues in 2007, they found that “…Most parents had heard about ADHD and considered themselves knowledgeable…compared to their Caucasian counterparts, African American parents reported less ADHD awareness and lower self-rated knowledge…” While Moody is content to say that the diagnosing physician has a racial bias which leads to a systemic issue of African Americans not being diagnosed. Regin’s study points to a more widespread issue: the lack of information communicated to the African American community. An implicit racial bias is hard to correct on a large scale but having a community that lacks information can be fixed. The argument that a lack of information is the cause of disparities in diagnosis in African Americans is sensical because African American parents do not fully understand what ADHD is and have a negative perception of t according to a study done by Olaniyan et al. “Some perceived that children were labeled with ADHD because of poor educational environments that were unresponsive to the needs of AA children.” This is backed up Busslings study “…Furthermore, they made more etiological attributions to sugar intake and expected less benefit from treatment…” These decisions and assumptions that the non-Caucasian parents made, were not made because they were stupid. These people had different backgrounds and styles of education and the schools do not provide resources to educate a particular demographic of people. The African American parents in the study and the portion of the population whom they represent made the assumptions that their kids were not content rations and acting hyper based on the communal knowledge which they knew from how they were raised. Without a doubt there is some racism in the medical community with regards to who gets a diagnosis. And there is a relationship between racism and black kids not being properly diagnosed with ADHD per Moody’s study. But the racism for the most part is not overt. The racism stems from a certain way in how the medical schools teach and train doctors to diagnose white kids. This creates a learned, implicit bias. Looking at ADHD, there is no qualitative or quantitative data to back up any kind of proof for overt racism being a root cause in ADHD diagnosis disparities. While on the other hand there is data to back up the lack of information provided to African American parents such as with a study testing cues regarding ADHD. This suggests that the conversation surrounding the lack of ADHD diagnosis in the African American community should be about why there is a lack of resources (in the form that they would be most receptable to learning from) being provided to non-white parents about ADHD and how they can get resources to help their children. The issue that keeps popping up in writing this paper is the lack of data. When researching disparities in ADHD, there is data and research being done in almost every category. The data that is not being tracked by sociologists and medical professionals is if all children who get recommended for testing and treatment by schools get the help they need, if not, is it because of cost or lack of understanding or something completely different and what is the person’s demographics? African Americans are not the only demographic in which there are diagnostic differences with ADHD. It is known that there is an inequality in the level of medical care for women. For a young female child this is no different when it comes to being diagnosed with ADHD. This is because for many years it was assumed that ADHD was a male disease. Later it was discovered that women have ADHD as well. However, both women and men present with ADHD differently. In fact, according to Holthe, M. E. G., & Langvik, E. in their study (2017) they found based on other studies as well that boys were more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than girls. The ratio was for every three boys diagnosed; one girl would get diagnosed. There is plenty of research on the male and female presentations of ADHD. However, except for two to three studies not a whole lot has been done to rectify the problem of women’s mental health, specifically with regards to ADHD not being looked at when there are more males diagnosed. It is possible that this lack of data is part of a more systematic issue. But also, the same issue that causes issues with misdiagnosis with African Americans is true for women as well; the medical students learn to diagnose white males. This means that women are less likely to get a correct diagnosis in general. But specific to ADHD, Female African Americans or the least likely to be helped or diagnosed based on the statistics presented earlier. The disparities in diagnosing ADHD are small issues that all come together to create a big whopping mess. These issues overlap with other systemic problems. But regarding ADHD diagnosing in the pediatric population, it boils down to two main issues: race and gender. But these are part of an overarching category of lack of communication with parents. To oversimplify, this can be fixed by providing resources to explain what ADHD is, and why the child in question needs testing, in a format that is consistent with the parents’ background. The other issue that appears is socioeconomic status. But there is no explanation or proven link to what connects the socioeconomics of a family to have an ADHD diagnosis. By providing more resources, it can cause more children to receive help and create more success in minority populations. Resources: Moody, M. (2016).

A chemical imbalance within the endocannabinoid system could cause changes in our appetite, mood, and even our health. The body makes its own cannabinoids in order to aid the body function.

18,The Modus operandi of The Ego,health-fitness," Do you know who the greatest con artist in the world is? It is your ego, the thinker in your mind. Here I will try to expose the ego’s modus operandi to help you understand your mind. If you are a true scientist, please try to disprove in your mind what I write and see if I am wrong. There is a saying, “One can lead a horse to water, but one cannot force it to drink”. It applies to every individual ego that exists in the world today. From my observations, I see no one wants to find the truth about themselves. Everyone is determined to live in a world of delusions. Whatever activities we are involved in are egocentric. Everyone prefers to look outside them, not inside them. If something goes wrong, it is never you but always them. These activities are designed to boost the ego and give no insight into the mind or self-knowledge. Instead of understanding the ego, we hide behind the scientific knowledge we have acquired over the centuries and strengthen our ego. The philosophies and beliefs we have today are just exercises in delusional thinking. We have built an escapist world. As a result, we are becoming increasingly out of touch with reality, and our mental health is deteriorating. Is our civilization today any different from the past ones in their thinking? Here I will try to give you some insight into your mind and help you understand how the ego operates. It operates basically in three modes. The first one is the thinker and the thought mode. Here the ego (thinker) is doing all the thinking and controlling. It is the active mode in which most people live all the time. The second mode is the observer, and the observed mode. Here the ego is in a passive mode where learning and understanding occur. In this mode, you are in the present and aware of your actions and what is happening. However, because the ego is pushed into the background as an observer, it quickly reverts to the first mode, thinking actively. In between the above two modes is the third mode, the dream mode. I call it zombie mode. In this mode, thoughts, emotions, feelings and images randomly appear out of our subconscious mind. It is our auto mode where we do things automated without much thought. But once the ego verbalizes them, the dream mode switches to the first active mode. So you are back in command. The dream mode occurs anytime during waking or sleeping hours and alternates with the first two modes. Most people cannot stop thinking, which results in mental health problems such as insomnia, anxiety, depression etc. Shouldn’t we ask why and know why? Do you realize your ego is a product of self-hypnosis? It means that it can only appear in our conscious mind when we use words. Without words, the ego cannot appear in the conscious mind, as it would be stuck in the present. The only way the ego can make its presence felt is by verbalizing; hence words and thinking become the lifeline of the ego. Please observe that we are living in a sea of words. When we pray to God, we use words. When we sing, we sing with lyrics, which are words. Words make us happy or sad. Words make us laugh or cry. We cannot express our emotions or communicate our real feelings without words. Words help us dream and turn our dreams into reality. And without words, we cannot travel in time. Words have a direct effect on our subconscious mind. They hypnotize us. So you see how dependent the ego is on words and the thinking process for its appearance in the conscious mind? Hence thinking in our mind becomes a habit, an obsession. It is why one feels one cannot stop thinking. There is another reason one does not want to stop thinking. There is fear that if one stops thinking, the ego might disappear from the conscious mind. That, of course, is a false fear. Because the ego is still there, it only switches to the second observer mode or the dream mode when not thinking actively. Yet another reason to keep thinking is the thought of death. The ego does not want to die, so death becomes an anathema. Hence, the ego uses the hypnotic power of words and the imaginative power of the mind to create a world of beliefs and philosophies that we see today. These beliefs and philosophies, of course, are just a projection of our desire to live forever, creating a world of delusion. One can see now that the ego does not disappear when one stops thinking. It just switches modes. The mind is thus never empty or blank. As constant thinking becomes torture, to help calm the turbulent mind, the clever ego has devised various forms of meditation. In my mind, they are just a form of self-hypnosis; these techniques cannot possibly lead to enlightenment or insight into one’s thinking process. They can only promote delusion. If a person wants mental peace and harmony, you will only find it in the second mode of the observer and the observed I mentioned above. In this mode only, you will find awareness of what is happening inside and outside you. As I have mentioned in my previous articles, we live in a timeless universe. There is a timeless dimension around you that coexists with the time dimension we know in the present. When you experience the phenomenon of the observer in mind and what is being observed becoming one, you will understand the meaning of meditation. Here, the mind is fully alert and aware of what is happening inside and outside. You are not in a trance. It is a spontaneous occurrence where you realize that you and the timeless dimension are one. From the above observations, one can see that we live in a very superficial world, drowning in a sea of words and reacting to words all the time. The negative world around us, bombarding us with negative information, is making us sick as it distorts our perceptions and negatively influences our subconscious mind. Although our mental health is deteriorating, no one seems interested in finding a solution as everyone is in the same boat. The medical profession, which is supposed to look after our mental health, has abandoned its responsibility and suffers from a perception disorder. Doctors are identifying themselves with other bureaucratic professionals who have limited thinking. How can they improve your mental health when they become part of the problem? How can one have compassion, empathy or humanity if one goes along with any bureaucratic system? A doctor used to be a friend, philosopher and a guru, but not any more. It is because compassion and humanity are incompatible with bureaucracy. The management or rather mismanagement of the Covid pandemic worldwide is a perfect example of bureaucracy in action. Indeed, in my mind, the medical profession has lost the plot. They have become medical technocrats and need to review their perceptions and role in society. They should not be involved in any coercive or mandatory policies of any government. One cannot be a friend and a bully at the same time. One does not need to be a prophet to predict more mental illness in society as we become more bureaucratic in our approach to everything. One can only blame the government and the legal profession for turning doctors and other professionals into bureaucratic thinkers. I trust this article will give you new insight into your mind. In the meantime, my plea to every individual is not to take their ego seriously. Please gain some self-knowledge. If you feel negative, try not to verbalize your feelings and see what happens. When you do not verbalize, you do not disappear in mind but are forced into an observer mode. When you are aware, you are doing the same thing. If you find yourself saying negative words, replace them with positive words and see what happens. Do the same things with negative thoughts. Do not verbalize and see what happens. Become aware of your thoughts and feelings and the words you are using. Words activate our thoughts, feelings and emotions. Remember, our subconscious mind reacts to words, not the meaning of words. You can manipulate it by acquiring self-knowledge this way. Learn to understand your ego and how you operate in your mind by becoming self-aware."
19,How to Become a Cannabis Influencer,health-fitness," A cannabis influencer is someone who uses their influence within the cannabis industry for positive social change. These individuals include performers, business owners, attorneys, and leaders within our society who are making a positive impact through their cannabis use and knowledge.  However, they adhere to a specific protocol for releasing information about their products or services: they do not share information that could put them at risk for federal prosecution or local laws regarding consumption, production, possession or distribution of cannabis. If you want to become a very good cannabis influencer, you should know the path to it. Gain knowledge on marijuana Becoming a cannabis influencer is one of the easiest ways to increase your reach and popularity. It allows you to talk about the benefits of cannabis and provide ideas and content to other people who might not be interested in this topic. People are hungry for information, and they're willing to pay attention to different people and brands. Once you understand the market, you'll find it easy to promote products that will help people become more educated about marijuana and product reviews to help others make better purchasing decisions. There are many articles available about the benefits of medical and recreational cannabis. However, you may not know how much information is needed about growers, product varieties, concentrates, oil formulas, and testing practices. It is essential to know how these laws and regulations affect a business involved in both recreational and medical marijuana sales. Taxed profits are expected to drastically decrease, putting many small business owners out of business. Choose your own niche There’s a wealth of knowledge available online on cannabis brands, products, ways to grow, etc., making it a perfect space for influencers to expand their portfolios and gain a following. So whether you’re a concerned parent deciding which strain is right for your child, or an entrepreneur looking for a new product line to bring to market, there are plenty of choices for people interested in promoting wellness and maximizing profit through legal means. Cultivate a solid social media presence As a cannabis industry artist, your platform needs to include vital information for your audience. From social media links (Facebook, Twitter) to contact information, use the right media centre software to build relationships and drive traffic to your websites. The more people that visit your sites, the more likely it is that they will become customers. You need to develop content and information that directly appeals to your target audiences. This means you need consistency in your promotion tactics and cross-posting from one blog to another. The more people following your posts, the more opinionated and engaged you become, and the more likely someone will follow your work. Have a unique perspective You’re an influencer. Your job is to spread awareness and tell people about products, businesses and services that can help them. And, for good measure, you also need to generate revenue. How will you do that? It’s time to look at cannabis as an industry based on your unique perspective – not what mainstream media tells you about it. Find out how others are generating money with their cannabis platforms and how you can get on their team. You could be the next big thing! Wrapping up You have the potential to influence millions of people, and in a few short months, you can make a real impact on the world by becoming an influencer in the cannabis world. First, however, several things need to be done to build up your brand and get it out in front of people. For that you must follow some simple guidelines when it comes to promoting your brand. The more active you are, the more results you'll get from using social media; conversely, being passive and taking care of your own publicity could see you approaching results."
20,Overview On Ezetimibe,health-fitness," Cholesterol can be defined as a class of certain organic molecules. Cholesterol is a sterol or modified steroid; a type of lipid whose is biogenesis is done by all animal cells and is an important structural component of animal cell membranes. It’s a waxy substance present in your blood. Body needs cholesterol to develop healthy cells, but high levels of cholesterol can raise your risk of heart disease.With high cholesterol, one can develop fatty deposits in blood vessels. When such deposits break suddenly and form a clot, it results in a heart attack or stroke.High cholesterol can be genetic, but usually it is the result of unhealthy lifestyle choices that make it preventable and treatable. It can be reduced by balancing a healthy diet, regular exercise and sometimes medication.It's main cause is eating fatty food, avoiding exercising, sedentary life style, being overweight, smoking and drinking alcohol. Since it’s genetic, it can also run in families.High cholesterol does not show symptoms. The only way to detect it is to have a blood test. Ezetimibe is prescribed together with lifestyle changes (diet, weight-loss, exercise) to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood. It can be prescribed alone or in combination with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin). Ezetimibe belongs to the class of medications called cholesterol-lowering medications. It acts by preventing the absorption of cholesterol in the intestine. Ezetimibe is prescribed to treat high blood cholesterol and certain other lipid abnormalities. Usually it is taken together with dietary changes and a statin. It is an oral medication, available in the fixed combinations of ezetimibe / simvastatin, ezetimibe / atorvastatin, and ezetimibe / rosuvastatin. The medication has some common adverse effects that include upper respiratory tract infections, joint pain, diarrheal, and tiredness. Serious side effects can cause anaphylaxis, liver problems, depression, and muscle breakdown. Itsuse in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of ambiguous safety. Ezetimibe acts by decreasing cholesterol absorption in the intestines. A process called as atherosclerosis which causesbuildup of cholesterol and fats along the walls of the blood vessels decreases blood flow, which results in decreasing oxygen supply to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body. Decreasing blood levels of cholesterol and fats may help decrease this buildup and may decrease chances of developing heart conditions like angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks. It is not concluded the reason behind the additional lowering of cholesterol levels in the blood did not resulted to a greater decline in cholesterol and fat buildup along the walls of the blood vessels in patients taking ezetimibe and simvastatin. Further studies are initiated to compare treatment with ezetimibe and simvastatin to treatment with simvastatin aloneso as toobserve if there is a difference in the risk of developing heart disease. Moreover taking a cholesterol-lowering medication, making certain changes in daily habits can also lower blood cholesterol levels. Eating a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol, exercise 30 minutes daily and lose weight in case of overweight can make wonders in balancing Cholesterol level. Ezetimibe may cause side effects. Consulting a doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away is important.

1,What Kind of Conditions Can Your Dentist Find by Looking at Your Mouth?,health-fitness," Tooth decay and gum disease aren’t the only things that a dentist might find during a routine checkup. Many systemic health problems have symptoms that manifest orally; as such, the mouth often exhibits warning signs that there’s a problem in the rest of the body. Here are some examples of conditions that a dentist might be able to identify. Cancer Nowadays, routine dental checkups and cleanings often include oral cancer screening. The dentist will check for discolored spots, ulcerated areas in the cheeks, and unusual lumps and bumps. They might also look for signs of swelling in the glands around the neck. If any concerning symptoms are found, they will likely make arrangements for a specialist to perform a biopsy to see if cancer is present. Diabetes Diabetes affects the entire body in numerous ways, and naturally that includes the mouth. Some people notice a burning sensation or wounds that don’t heal as quickly as they should. Also, due to an impaired immune system, the risk of gum disease and other infections is much higher, and they’re likely to be more severe. It’s important to take steps to get diabetes under control as soon as it’s identified in order to minimize the damage it causes. A dentist will take note of any symptoms that could point to untreated diabetes and tell the patient what steps they need to take next. GERD “GERD” is short for “gastroesophageal reflux disease,” which is a condition where the acids in your stomach travel up through the esophagus. The acids can get on the teeth, wearing down and weakening the enamel at an unusually fast rate; other possible consequences include bad breath, canker sores, and dry mouth. A dentist might be able to catch GERD if they notice unusual damage done to the teeth near the back of the mouth. Sjorgen’s Syndrome Sjorgen’s Syndrome is an autoimmune condition where the immune system starts attacking healthy cells in your mouth – specifically in the glands responsible for keeping the mouth moist. This can result in a dry mouth, which is not only uncomfortable but also raises the risk of oral infection. If your dentist finds that you have swollen salivary glands accompanying your dry mouth, it’s often a sign that Sjorgen’s Syndrome is the culprit. Anemia When your body can’t produce enough red blood cells, or if the red blood cells you do have don’t function properly, you have a condition called anemia. The main symptom of anemia is fatigue, but another possible warning sign is a loss of color in the gums, tongue, and other soft tissues in the mouth. A dentist that observes such changes might recommend supplements or dietary changes to increase the patient’s iron intake. There are more conditions that a dentist may be able to identify while examining the teeth and gums, and if they identify them during a checkup, they can ensure that their patients get the treatment they need all the sooner. About the Practice Dr. David Crumpton has been serving the Trophy Club, Southlake, Westlake, Grapevine, and Roanoke  communities for over 26 years. By staying on top of the latest dental technology, he’s able to offer his patients truly thorough examinations that catch even the smallest sign of tooth decay, cavities, and many other conditions. He is always up front about the available treatment options and will never try to upsell you; he’ll only tell you what your smile truly needs."

3,BENEFITS OF JUICING ONCE A DAY AND HOW TO USE A JUICER,health-fitness," Benefits of Juicing Once a Day and How to Use a Juicer Juicing was amassed for those with a lot of time and money to spare in the past, but now those juicers are more reasonable and convenient to use than ever before and it’s no longer just for the elite! Juicing can be handy in many ways; it helps you get your daily advised intake of fruits and vegetables and supplies energy boosts when needed and also aids in weight loss. Thanks to all the vitamins and minerals uncovered in fresh produce, it can also help you lose weight. The post continues by documenting the Benefits of juicing once a day and how to use a juicer Juicers can be a great way to count more fruits and vegetables to your diet they’re also suitable because they make the whole method of juicing easy, in addition they make it effortless for you to assemble delicious fresh juices that can help amplify your immune system and provide vitality. The Aicok juicer is one of the most prevalent machines on the market today because it delivers so many features at an affordable price. Advantages Of Juicing After drinking a glass of water I recently uncovered juicing and looked up some of the advantages then, I wanted to add fruit to the water and see how I favored it, it was an inadequate experience and I was not too fond of how it tasted. That’s when I thought of the concept of making my juice so not only am I getting my regular dosage of water, but I am also getting the suitable nutrients from the juice fruit that I need to fight detrimental diseases and even cancer. As you may have read and noticed I am relatively a health freak and I can’t believe that had been going on in life without a juicer, growing up my mother was the one that presented me to juicing, II don’t even think I would know what a juicer was without her help, she would always make time to juice carrots, beetroot, and ginger. How Juicers Have Changed I also remember the size of juicers and how they have transformed over the years my mother would use the ones that were so enormous and about the size of a microwave not to mention the noisy noises it would make. These days juicers are being made more miniature and are now more consolidated, the juicer that I got is much quieter than my mothers’ old school juicer, and I am so pleased that I bought the brand I got. The juicer I own is from a company called Aicok, and I bought it mainly because it was inexpensive and easy to find. This blog post will go over the main benefits of juicing once a day and how to use a juicer and why I love juicing so much. aicok juicer review What Are the Benefits of Juicing If you’re the sort of person who doesn’t have the time to eat the regular amount of fruit and veggies that you have to ingest every day then juicing may be for you, I’m a busy girl and find it contesting to make time or set aside time to eat healthily, making salads and preparing fruit bowls is something that I find that I skip out on and don’t think they are essential it’s the kind of specialty when I need a juice cleanse that I don’t take seriously. I recently discovered that doing this was very detrimental to my health, I was not eating my daily dose of veggies and lacked the nutrients a typical body needs I was jeopardizing my health. I thought that a daily vitamin was all you would need to reap adequate health benefits, I was mistaken, and I took my health a bit more seriously. Aicok Juicer The Aicok juicer, which is the one that I have has a 65 mm circular feed tube so I don’t even have to agonize about preparing the food all I do is wash the fruit or veggie, cut apples in half, and start juicing, I am also happy at how time-efficient juicing is with my new juicer and how effortless it is to clean. Did you know that fruit and vegetable juices can help fight toxic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and blood pressure? I recently learned this and I am so happy that I did, it’s not that juicing thwarts cancer but the actual fruit/vegetable you are eating. If you think about it to fight cancer and prevent the build of cancer, you would have to eat a large dinner plate loaded with fruits and veggies the only thing is that you extract all of the nutrients from the fruit/vegetable with juicing, so probabilities are you are more likely to drink a glass full of a plate of veggies and fruit daily than eating them raw. So, in the end, juicing does prevent those poisonous diseases such as cancer and heart disease by lowering blood sugar levels because we are juicing more often. I have found it so uncomplicated to use my new juicer and that it is a dream to clean, and all I do is rinse off the parts of the machine when I conclude, and it takes not even 5 minutes to do this. When you are juicing and want your daily juice all that you need is to use a slight portion of fruits and veggies (plant compounds) , and I will tell you why, you’ll require about 1 cup of fruit, one apple, and 1 cup of vegetables in a second. That’s it! Do you want to know why? I’ll tell you…. I notice that many people are just consuming the juice as is when it comes out of the juicer drinking concentrated juice is a big no-no, and I wanted to share a tip that I learned from the pros by the pros I mean the producers of juice that you find in the supermarket and stores. How to Make Your Own Juice, the Right Way The prize is…….to add water! That’s it! To dilute or weaken the concoction you will need to add about 2 cups of water (the same amount of fruits and veggies combined). Don’t taste it yet after diluting it you will add a tablespoon of sugar if it is a sweet drink, if you don’t gauge the sugar it will not taste as good. Adding water is a tip from trial and error and that a lot of the juice in the grocery stores makes and is mostly with water but tastes just as great! Try it you’ll love it! Another advantage of juicing is that it hydrates you and your skin! You double or triple the water combined into the drink by executing my procedure and adding water and sweetener. Keeping your body hydrated is very significant and detrimental to your health you need to hydrate your skin to regulate the blood, withdraw toxins from the body, increase productivity and encourage healthy skin. Another tip that you can do if you think that water isn’t adding to the flavor of your juiced beverage is to add some coconut water. Juice Recipe Recently I created a great drink with a small portion of the juice of strawberries (1/4 cup), I also add some coconut water (1/4 cup), and the rest was cold water then I add a little sweetener to enhance the taste, I was trying to execute the Starbucks pink drink, and I think I did an outstanding job matching it, also you can add a tablespoon of coconut milk to give it a pink look. This drink tasted fantastic, and it was so good that I have yet to try any other copycat Starbucks drinks you also might want to try it yourself! Try Adding Coconut Water ! Coconut water also delivers extra hydration and electrolytes ( that you would encounter in Gatorade). It also aids your heart health and combats cancer, it is so amazing how natural fruit can be a blessing to the body and your overall health. Conclusion Juicing is an excellent way to get your daily dose of fruits and vegetables it’s also an alternative remedy for certain diseases, like cancer or diabetes. You can also make juice at home with minimal equipment! Of course it would benefit if you had a juicer and some produce from the grocery store. Juicing makes it easy to fit more nutritional habits into our busy lives while reaping all the health advantages that come along with fresh fruit juices! Some of the advantages of juicing are that you can consume eminent quantities of your fruits and veggies and even multi-task because you are not eating and just drinking liquids. If juiced consistently and daily it also wards of deadly viruses and body disorders such as cancer and heart disease, and you can say goodbye to juice bars! if you don’t have a juicer yet I advise you to get into it by buying a juicer today here, then subscribe to receive new blog posts sent directly to your inbox every week, so you never miss out on juicy tips again!"
4,7 BEST SMELLING BODY LOTION THAT YOUR BODY WILL LOVE,health-fitness," 7 Best Smelling Body Lotion Today in this blog post I will share some of my top favored, best smelling body lotion with you, I am a person that is very immense on fragrances, and so I want to share with you some of the best-smelling body lotions on the market and that also hydrate dry skin. I’m the kind of gal that likes fruity fragrances and sweet fragrances like Vanilla and the smell of desserts like cake or cupcakes, I’m not sure if you have the same sense of smell like myself, but continue with my recommendations if you do and if you enjoy some of these notes. You can find some incredible smelling body care products at a myriad of locations such as Victoria’s Secret, Bath and Body Works, and Marshalls, to name a few, however my favored place to shop for body care products is Bath and Bodyworks. Did you know that both Victoria’s Secret and Bath and Bodyworks are under the same company’s license (Limited Branded). They both have sumptuous smelling products, and I find that no wonder, why? Because the products that they carry are very alike. So now I am going to share with you my top 3 favorite body lotions. Best Smelling Body Lotion Cake Beauty is a beauty brand that I found recently at a steal at Marshall’s, it is also a lightweight lotion that I treasure to use. They have exceptional smelling whipped body cream, lotions, and even body washes and mists that will make you smell great all day long. While they have recently revised their branding and marketing, I still adore their products, however the fragrances have altered, and I am not thrilled because they now offer exotic body lotions and perfumes. I can always go back to the authentic scents that they have online, you can buy Cake products at Shoppers Drug Mart, and it is also a proudly Canadian Brand. One of my favored products from this line is the Lemon and cream fragrance. Cake products also come in body lotion, fragrance mist, and body wash. I appreciate these products because the scent is unique, and it smells just like a lemon-cream cupcake, I chatted about this body lotion in a previous blog post, and you can find it here. Best Smelling Body Lotion PINK! Fresh Vanilla is a new fragrance established from the Victoria Secret PINK Brand, before this fragrance I was a tremendous fan of their fresh and clean scent and had body lotion. I decided to try something new, and I adore this unique fragrance, so when I don’t want to smell like a cupcake all the time I will opt for this fragrance. It will also make your skin feel like butter! PINK! Beauty is a collection of lotions that PINK has launched containing essential oils for its fragrance and dermatologist tested, usually my skin leans to be prone to breakouts, and so far, my skin loves the ingredients in this lotion. To round it up, this lotion makes me smell like a cookie, I like to wear it at night after a fresh shower. victoria secret pure seduction lotion The Victoria Secret Pure seduction is a scent that I have used for years, and I still use it, when Victoria’s secret came out with their pure seduction perfume, it was so hard to find. It is such a comfort to find this fragrance in a lotion format. Pure Seduction is a fragrance that I would define as sexy and if you like fruity scents this may be the right lotion for you, and I like to wear this fragrance paired with their signature pure seduction perfume (which I did end up finding online) when I am going out or wearing lingerie, men will also love this fragrance. Bath and Body Works Near Me If you adore the smell of fresh-baked cake, you will value this fragrance, it smells good and this fragrance is comparable to the cake lotion I mentioned above, and although I love cake products I am slowly falling for Bath and Body works products. I buy most of my shower gels, and hand soaps from Bath and Body works, mainly because Bath and Body works have a vast assortment of fragrances, and I love to hop into the shower and play around with different scents. It’s an thrilling experience, so far I only use the Strawberry pound cake shower gel, hand sanitizer, and foaming hand wash, and eventually, I plan on obtaining their other products like the body mist, lotion, and candle. This fragrance launched in 2020, so it is a somewhat new product, so if you are a fan of sweet-smelling fragrances and baked goods like dessert, then you should give this fragrance a shot. Ahava Body Lotion I recently received the Ahava mineral body lotion sample from my IPSY beauty subscription, at first I did not care for the smell as it smelled very earthy. Then a few weeks later I noticed a fragrance coming out of my purse (where I usually keep this sample-sized lotion), then finally, I saw how pleasant it smelt! The fragrance reminds me of a lavish fragrance like Christian Dior J’adore, a very grown scent, and a very warming scent ,this lotion can be found at most department stores but is not low-grade, so if you have the money to splurge on high-end products, this product might be the proper one for you. Ahava has various skincare products, from bath scrubs to body butter, and the lotion that I received is also obtainable in other fragrances. To be more precise the name of the body lotion that I received is the Ahava Dead Sea Water Mineral Body Lotion in the fragrance “Spring Blossom”, although this lotion does smell nice, one of the other advantages is that its formula contains a mix of minerals from the dead sea. This lotion also reminds me of products you would employ in a spa for a massage. Now we are moving back to one of my favored brands for scented body lotion and where the whole body lotion spectacle began. I newly picked up this fragrance after not finding the PINK! Fresh Vanilla when I went to restock on it, although I am disenchanted that they no longer have the fresh vanilla scent with a hint of orchid, there are so many other great-smelling lotions that Victoria’s Secret has to deliver. By the way, did you know that the same company possesses both Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works? It’s no wonder that they do when you see all of the different scents each store maintains, they are very alike, but if you are looking for a broad variety of fragrances Bath and Bodyworks would be your best bet. I am also uncovering that I like Victoria’s Secret Pink! For some reason I am finding that Vicotria secret demands their beauty products to a more adult audience… To each his own. The Victoria’s Secret Pink Paradise Bloom Scented Body Lotion smells fresh to me and, at first, smells like drug store lotion, but after a while, the fragrance evolves into a flowered scent after incorporating it into your skin and also leaves skin hydrated. I also purchased the body mist as it smelt so incredible in the store when I bought it, but I don’t think I would re-buy to be unbiased, if you are looking for a light floral scent with a tinge of fruit, this lotion would be your best alternative. Rerum Natura I also received this fragrance in my beauty subscription box, and I appreciated it, I am a massive fan of perfumes which is off-topic, but I think I am a fan of fragrances after being introduced to scented markers when I was a child. To me the Rerum Natura Beauty body lotion is a lotion that I would recommend for someone looking for an organic scent, this lotion is also organic and contains aloe- vera and shea butter that nourish the skin. This lotion smells very similar to Carol’s Daughter Healthy Hair Butter, and I value this scent, healthy hair butter has a nice genuine scent ad I think it is the sweet orange extracts that make it smell the way it does. Healthy hair butter also reminds me of when I was 100% natural, and I cherished using it to soften my natural hair and style it. So when I whip out the rerum natura body cream, it immediately reminds me of those times and to wear my hair curly again and take care of it organically, in it’ natural state. Conclusion I rounded up and shared my top seven favorite body lotions with you, I have a few more, but I thought I would share my immediate seven, from smelling like a cupcake to smelling fruity and mature, like I cited I am a fan of sweet, pleasant smells. Using body lotions is a great way to include fragrances in your daily regimen, and when you’re not deeming like wearing perfume you can always count on scented body lotions to help spruce up your typical scent. And these take the cake! Thanks for reading!"
5,Seven Tips For A Long And Healthy Life,health-fitness," However great as current clinical innovation seems to be, it can never save you from the issues brought about by a way of life that is unfortunate.

An ounce of counteraction is absolutely better compared to a pound of fix. The following are seven hints on the best way to carry on with a long and solid life. Likewise, the very way of life that assists you with keeping away from ailment additionally assists you with getting thinner. In the past individuals needed to involve their actual bodies over their ordinary work. However, today somebody might get up, go to work in a vehicle, then, at that point, plunk down, get up to return home in the vehicle and while showing up at home, plunk down again for the remainder of the day. In such a day to day existence there is no actual work. This actual inertia is one of the fundamental explanations behind a large group of sicknesses. Sport, running. strolling and different things should be added to our life in the event that our ordinary work doesn't expect us to endeavor truly. I This might sound basic, yet many individuals keep awake until late in any event, when their body is letting them know that the time has come to rest. Yoga and Ayurvedic specialists additionally say that it is smarter to rest in the evening and be dynamic during the day. Nonetheless, individuals, for example, understudies will take espresso and energizers to concentrate until quite a bit later. Others foster the propensity for staying dynamic around evening time and dozing during the day. While we can do this, it in the end negatively affects wellbeing. Elective wellbeing specialists say that this sort of unnatural living is one of the contributing variables in the causation of malignant growth and different sicknesses Yet again this is additionally a straightforward thought, yet we frequently conflict with the messages of the body. On the off chance that you eat without much forethought or because of prevailing difficulty at specific time, in any event, when you have no genuine hunger, then, at that point, you won't process your food appropriately. Causticity and heartburn start, and this adds to the probability of other more perplexing illnesses flourishing.

(Assuming you have no craving even in the wake of anticipating a sensible measure of time, then, at that point, you ought to counsel a specialist since something isn't right.) 4.Fast on a Regular, Systematic Basis Assuming you would request that any individual work 365 days out of every year with practically no rest, they would grumble and say that they should have some rest or, in all likelihood they will separate. However, we have never tried to get some information about our stomach related organs which we force to work consistently without a rest. They can't fight the manner in which an individual would to his chief, however they truly do give us flags that they can't work constant. At the point when we overlook those signs and still propel them to work, those organs separate. For that reason intermittent fasting is essential. Forgo eating for one complete day. This gives a rest to your stomach related organs and furthermore helps in the disposal of squanders from your body. Ordinary fasting permits an individual to acquire additional time for scholarly or otherworldly pursuits. Fasting isn't really for loners in a cavern, yet is a reasonable practice that anybody can rehearse. As referenced above, legitimate rest is fundamental for the upkeep of wellbeing. In the event that you wash your significant engine and tactile organs (hands, arms, eyes, legs, mouth, privates) before rest utilizing cool water, this will loosen up you and set you up for profound rest. Your body is connected to your psyche. A large number of the sicknesses of this period are psychosomatic. Stress and uneasiness negatively affect our actual wellbeing. Reflection is a psychological exercise which, in addition to other things, permits you to withdraw yourself from the concerns of life. Gain proficiency with a straightforward procedure and do it routinely. Indeed the old precept, ""Right on time to bed, ahead of schedule to rise makes an individual solid, rich and savvy."" I couldn't say whether it will make you well off, however it will absolutely make you sound. Your body needs barely sufficient rest, not to an extreme and not excessively little."

7,Energy Healing Techniques to Help You Gain Greater Control of Your Emotions,health-fitness," These Energy Healing Techniques Will Help You Deal with Low Energy by Taking Control of Your Emotions Instead of Running Away From Them Have you ever been sapped of energy by your highly emotional life experiences? You know, the ones that leave you feeling exhausted as the day progresses? You drag yourself along throughout the day praying the veil of heaviness leaves and then regain ground on the energy front, only to find out the veil gets heavier and heavier as the days go on. You could have emotional toxicity holding you back and hindering your daily potential and vital energy. This blog will explain emotional toxicity, how that relates to low energy, and provide an analogy and some strategies that will empower you to better deal with these issues. Energy Healing Techniques to Take Control of Your Emotions and Deal with Low Energy When there is a strong emotion surging through your body it creates chemicals, and some of those chemicals can become toxic to you. At this point, you’re highly stressed, and these emotions are unresolved, so there is no break in the emotional chain and no true rest for the body, mind and soul. This effect is known as emotional toxicity. One of the primary emotions we feel is grief. Grief is a fight/flight emotion because it is associated with survival. It is also an amygdala emotion, and when we feel grief, a hormone called adrenaline is released as a response. Adrenaline helps you react to a perceived threat. But once that threat passes, another hormone kicks in called cortisol, which is a hormone that can make you feel exhausted. So now you’re thinking, “Holy smokes, is grief a threat?” Well, it sort of is and it sort of isn’t. Let me share an analogy with you. Emotions a-knockin’ at the door You're sitting at the kitchen table enjoying a cup of tea, and there’s a knock at the front door. You open the door and immediately are faced with grief - an old friend you know all too well and thought you’d dealt with already. Instantly, you slam the door shut. You go back to your tea and decide it's just not worth letting that grief back into your home. The last time grief showed up in your life it resulted in you devolving into that deep ugly cry, curled up in the fetal position, and you found yourself embarrassed and exhausted as you slowly awakened from your sobbing hot mess. You swore you were not about to let yourself succumb to that again. So there you sit, with grief on one side of the door and you on the other. Then you hear it knock again, and a hit of adrenaline makes you jump, so you decide to move to a different room. Moving further away from grief seems reasonable, and you start to settle into a good book, but it happens again. However, this time the knocking is loud and the doorbell starts to ring. So you put on a TV show and attempt to drown out the noise of grief. Winding down now, you decide it’s bedtime and you know you need to relax so you have a cup of chamomile tea and get all nestled into bed. Then, just when you get to the beautiful, dreamy, almost asleep space, that damned doorbell rings again and your mind starts to race. “No! Not GRIEF! Not again! Not now!” you cry, while the mental and emotional turmoil leaves you feeling raw and vulnerable. It's 3 a.m., you're exhausted, and you’re lying awake in fear, wondering if grief is going to come back again. You wake up the next day feeling sapped of energy and you know grief is near and it wants to move in -  you just know it. At this point, you feel defeated and you spend the next week avoiding grief and feeling exhausted as a result. This is an unfortunate pattern that can go on for weeks, months, or in some cases years if it's not dealt with. Now, let's look at this from a different perspective. Inviting your emotions in for tea You're sitting at the kitchen table enjoying your cup of tea when along comes grief, and it knocks on the front door. But this time you do a quick body scan to make sure it's grief. You confirm within yourself that indeed, it is, and you quickly realize you’ve already dealt with this monster in the past and it wasn't very pretty. Moving forward, you find yourself on the other side of the door and you say, “GRIEF! I know it's you. I know how you work, and I know you want to consume me! So, here's the deal: I’m going to open up the door and let you in, but only for 10 minutes! I'm going to set the timer on the stove and when it dings you’ve got to go, but I promise to give you all of my attention for 10 minutes.” So you go over to the stove and set the timer for 10 minutes and then open the door, allowing the grief to slowly move in. You grab your pen and some paper and write down everything grief has to share with you. You write down all the hurt, with as much description as possible, until you hear the ding of the stove timer. But as you look up after hearing the ding you realize grief has already left your home. This analogy offers a great example of how taking control of your grief gives you the opportunity to deal with it and defuse it, instead of ignoring it to the point where you’re no longer getting a good night's sleep, and you’re fighting to keep it away from you. This method allows you to temporarily permit grief to “Come on in,” rather than spending all that energy running away from it. Consciously deciding when you have time and energy to deal with your grief, and doing so in a healthy way, empowers you so you can stop running from grief and invite it in for tea - on your terms. When that emotion is knocking on your door, you have to take the time to honour yourself, heal, and save your energy by allowing for a safe way to cope. Otherwise, that emotion banging on the door can lead to greater emotional toxicity and keep you from living your best life because your brain is having to work really hard to keep thinking of ways to keep grief out. These healing techniques work to prevent emotional toxicity, and can even stop it altogether. Reaching out for help and healing techniques Sometimes stress becomes too much and you know you need support. This is where someone like me, who’s trained in specialized kinesiology, can really help. We use advanced acupressure, along with muscle testing to help you narrow down exactly which emotion is at the root of your exhaustion and possible emotional toxicity. By using advanced energy healing techniques, like emotional stress release, attitude with essence, and specific chakra attunements, I can help you to deconstruct that which no longer serves you and reconstruct how you want it to be. I use a variety of support tools in my 1-hour long emotional release sessions, including sound healing, visualization, essential oils, advanced amygdala support, and gentle specific massage, which can all help to create a new blueprint for how you want to react when emotions come a-knockin’. A session with me can give you greater confidence and peace of mind by knowing you have the strength to better cope with your emotions, and the strategies to defuse the negative stress associated with them. This will leave you feeling calm, centred and focused and get you back on top, with vital energy and better emotional regulation. Helping you live the life you love more naturally, Christine Plumb"
8,How Live Blood Cell Analysis and Proper Nutrition Provide Solutions for Sore Joints,health-fitness," Learn how red blood cells are related to sore muscles and joints and how the right nutritional support can offer answers for how to manage pain. Did you know your sore muscles and joints might be telling you your digestion is off? If you’re wondering how this could be true, let me explain. I practice photo comparative live blood cell analysis, and one common complaint I get from those whom I consult with is how stiff, sore and achy they feel. It’s truly astounding what the blood can reveal about your body and what could be contributing to these sore muscles and joints. This post discusses how red blood cells function, how they’re related to pain, and how proper nutrition can offer solutions for how to manage that pain. How Live Blood Cell Analysis Relates to Pain Let me give you a little science background, from the perspective of a photo comparative blood analyst. Red blood cells should be free-floating and separate because each cell has a negative charge that repels the others. When we see individual cells, this indicates that the person’s nutrient absorption is good. If we see red blood cells all stuck together it indicates that there is a positive charge on them and this means that the assimilation of nutrients in the small intestine is poor, which contributes to inflammation in the body. Generally, this is triggered by a lack of enzymes in the upper digestive tract and organs like the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder, which all work together to help with the chemical digestive process. If intestinal permeability is compromised and the enzyme action is poor, then those larger undigested food particles like proteins and lipids may compromise the gut membrane. This can trigger increased intestinal permeability, meaning bacteria, toxins, and proteins can go through the intestinal wall, out into the blood, and create that positive charge on the red blood cells, which causes them to attract instead of repel one another. We observe this as rouleau or stacks of red blood cells in the sample. I’ll use an analogy to further explain the function of red blood cells so you can see how this all ties into your stiff, sore, achy muscles and joints. Red blood cells are like a bus. They work on surface area, so if they’re all separate and free-floating then the bus doors open easily and things flow freely off and onto the bus. However, if they’re all stuck together in a traffic jam,  then those doors can’t open or close efficiently because they’re stuck. What gets off and on the bus, you ask? Red blood cells are responsible for transporting oxygen to your body's tissues. Your tissues produce energy with the oxygen and release waste, identified as a metabolic byproduct. This waste is taken to the digestive system and other organs so your body can remove it, via red blood cells. So, if your red blood cells are separate and free-floating (not in a traffic jam) then your body can easily remove the waste from your metabolism. But, if those red blood cells are all stuck together then their carrying capacity to efficiently remove waste is significantly reduced. Over time, the metabolic byproduct that doesn’t get removed contributes to inflammatory concerns, which are often to blame for stiff, sore, achy muscles and joints. This brings us back around to what causes the blood cells to stick together in the first place. One big answer is the lack of enzymes in the small intestine. You see, we need to have enzymes and healthy gut flora to break down those proteins, fats and other food particles and prevent red blood cells from sticking together. Enzymes get secreted by digestive organs and your body also works with the enzymes in your food so you can break those food particles down more efficiently and stop the problem before it manifests to the next level of muscle and joint pain. Luckily, there are enzymes in certain foods that work synergistically together and make great combinations when it comes to supporting this natural digestive process. Foods that offer solutions for how to manage pain One of the ways you can do this is to eat your fruits separately from all other foods. Simply eat your fruit in the recommended combinations below either 30 minutes before a meal or two hours after. But make sure to eat melons separately from all other fruit! The exception to this rule is that pineapple, papaya, and kiwi can be eaten with any other food. These fruits are rich in enzymes like papain and bromelain, which help to break things down and reduce inflammation. There are lots of different ways to use your food as a tool to help your stiff, sore, achy muscles and joints, but let’s start with one small dietary change at a time. At any rate, fruits make a great snack! Helping you live the life you love more naturally, Christine Plumb"
9,How the Bowel Influences Digestion and Wellness Strategies to Ensure it’s Functioning Properly,health-fitness," A Crash Course on Bowel Function with Healing Techniques and Wellness Strategies to Help You Ensure the Proper Function of Your Bowel Could the position of your bowel influence your digestion? This blog post will give you some background on the structure of the bowel, discuss how it functions, explore some issues that can arise when it’s not functioning properly, and provide some tips on how you can support healthy bowel function and position. To start things off, let’s go over some fun facts about the bowel, which you might not know. How the Bowel Functions and Wellness Strategies to Ensure it’s Working Properly The large intestine, which is part of the bowel, is about 5 feet (1.5 metres) long! It is made up of a few different segments: The ascending colon is the first part of the large intestine and runs up on the vertical axis in the right abdomen. The very bottom of it is where the appendix sits. The food that passes into the colon from the small intestine is controlled by a little valve called the ileocecal valve. The transverse colon sits horizontally across the abdomen about level with the navel or just slightly higher. The descending colon runs vertically down the left side of the abdomen to the sigmoid colon and rectum. This is where the waste materials are held before elimination. Did you know 80% of what enters into the colon is reabsorbed back into the body? No wonder it’s so important to pay attention to the unique function and structure of this wonderful sanitizing organ, which provides so many benefits for the body. If you neglected your home's sewer system you would have a blockage creating all kinds of problems, and the same goes for your body. Just as you’d call a plumber to unblock your sewer system, when your bowel is not functioning properly, you have to find healing techniques and wellness strategies to deal with the problem. What is the function of the colon? •	Food is received into the ascending colon and is semi-liquid. It is in this area where the water is withdrawn and absorbed. •	Good bacteria play a role in the completion of the digestion process. Billions of friendly bacteria synthesize valuable nutrients by digesting the fecal mass. Vitamins like K and B, as well as other nutrients are produced from this amazing process! •	Alkaline fluids aid in the completion of digestion. •	Digested food is pushed along through the bowel by something called peristalsis, which is a unique movement the bowel makes that is initiated from the muscles in the bowel wall. •	As digested food moves, positive bacteria and more water are withdrawn and waste from the blood system is received and carried with the fecal material to the rectum. •	The movement and passage of this material should be regularly evacuated in a consistent and effortless way. Colon problems and their negative effects on the body Diverticulitis, colitis, spastic bowel, ballooning, strictures, and prolapsus are all concerns that can inhibit the natural movement and function of the bowel. What I want to pay specific attention to here are the concerns associated with prolapsus. When the transverse colon sinks down due to an  overload of accumulated waste, the “droopy” part of the colon is now sitting on the lower body organs.  This is a huge concern for women, in particular. The abnormal pressure needed to force the feces towards the descending colon becomes increasingly problematic if the transverse colon has dropped down. The positional stress created with the prolapse may be corrected with a unique type of massage, which is part of the body management modality I practice. This massage for the bowel works great as a “reset”. In any case, things like fatigue, sickness, lethargy and poor digestion can all be attributed to the bowel’s poor function due to positional stress. I've been performing this unique massage with clients, friends and family for more than 20 years and the results are truly amazing! Healing techniques to support healthy bowel function and position •	Eat fibre-rich foods •	Drink water •	Exercise! •	Consider calling me for a unique, non-invasive abdominal massage (Body Management Session) •	Do a colon cleanse, which entails a specific supplement regime whereby I will do a photo comparative blood analysis session to determine the best approach to cleansing for your specific needs Helping you live the life you love more naturally, Christine Plumb"
10,Exipure Reviews: The Shocking Truth Exposed! What are Customers Saying?,health-fitness," At the conclusion of every year, people make new resolutions. ""To lose weight and get in shape"" is one of the most prevalent. However, within a few weeks, the vast majority of people have reverted to their old habits of consuming unhealthy foods and not exercising. Temporary defeat is one of the most common reasons people abandon their weight-loss goals. Maybe they gained a few pounds while on vacation, or they've been swamped with work and haven't exercised in a week or two, and what's the use in starting up again? In 2022, there are numerous accounts of people who have incorporated Exipure, an all-natural weight loss pill, into their diet and experiencing astonishing results. What Is Exipure? Exipure is an all-natural weight loss supplement with a novel mechanism of action that targets and improves fat-burning processes. According to its official website, this weight loss formula uses eight natural ingredients blended in appropriate amounts and enclosed in easy-to-swallow capsules to achieve weight loss. Exipure is completely safe to use because it contains no chemicals, toxins, or additives. These diet pills are only available on the official website at various discounted prices for customers to take advantage of today. The main goal of this natural pill is to boost metabolism so that you can burn fat faster than before. At the same time, the supplement's unique formulation prevents unexplained weight gain. This will allow you to lose weight without having to engage in strenuous exercise or dieting plans. Exipure's creators believe that low brown adipose tissue (BAT) levels are the primary cause of weight loss. Exipure works by increasing energy expenditure and thermogenesis by targeting low levels of brown adipose tissue. Thermogenesis is the production of heat by metabolic processes within cells. When we consume food, our bodies use glucose as fuel to generate ATP, also known as cellular energy. In addition to using glucose as fuel, some extra calories can be stored as glycogen in the muscles and liver. Glycogen stores provide us with a quick energy source, but because they cannot store large amounts of energy, if they are not burned, they turn into fats. This is why Exipure focuses on addressing the issue at its source. Its goal is to ensure that people no longer experience unexplained weight gain, which can be difficult to deal with. How Does Exipure Work? According to the Exipure official website, these pills use a novel mechanism of action to promote fat loss within the body. Exipure weight loss pills target brown adipose tissue, or BAT, inside the body in addition to improving metabolism and removing factors like inflammation and oxidative stress that directly interfere with metabolic activities. At this moment you may be wondering what BAT is. BAT is a type of fatty tissue; however, contrary to popular belief, it does not contribute to weight gain. Consider it a fat-burning furnace that is naturally present in everyone. However, it appears to run faster and more efficiently in lean people. Multiple studies have suggested a possible link between BAT and weight loss because this type of fat cell burns more calories than regular fat cells. This means that the higher your BAT, the more calories your body burns and the more energetic and lean it becomes. Unfortunately, there aren't many supplements on the market that contain the necessary ingredients to boost BAT levels in the body. Sensing a lack of BAT-boosting products, the company developed Exipure, which, according to the information on its official website, can increase the levels of BAT inside the body to cause weight loss without adhering to strenuous exercise regimens or strict diet plans. Exipure weight loss supplement can help you lose weight while also improving your energy levels, strength, and endurance, which you can use in the gym to further optimize your weight loss journey. Furthermore, the ingredients in this formula work by regulating appetite so that you consume fewer calories than usual, making them easy to process without adding to your body weight. What Are The Ingredients In Exipure? Exipure used their unique blend of eight plant-based ingredients in a potent 300mg dose per capsule to increase brown adipose levels in your body. In this section, we will discuss the eight natural ingredients and their benefits in greater detail. Perilla leaves (Perilla frutescens) Perilla has long been used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. Its extract has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of obesity and diabetes. According to a study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology, perilla leaf extracts could lower blood sugar levels in rats fed high fructose diets. Another 2012 study discovered that perilla oil had antiobesity, anorexigenic, anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, antioxidant, and anti-allergic properties. Holy Basil (Ocimum sanctum) Holy basil is another well-known herb with a long list of medicinal benefits to its name. It works to reduce stress while also combating inflammation. Both of these factors are the primary causes of a sluggish metabolism, and once they are addressed, the metabolism begins to run as efficiently as possible, resulting in weight loss. In addition to the effects listed above, basil has detoxifying properties that can remove waste, toxins, and cellular debris from the body on a regular basis. This ensures that nothing harmful remains inside the body that could interfere with its metabolic activities. Propolis Propolis is created by combining beeswax with resin collected from trees or shrubs. Propolis is collected by bees for protection. This sticky substance aids in the construction of hives and keeps intruders at bay. Propolis has antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, immunostimulant, and wound healing properties, according to researchers. It also encourages cell growth and prevents tumor formation. Amur cork Bark (Phellodendron amurense) Phellodendron is used to treat osteoarthritis, weight loss and obesity, diarrhea, stomach or upper small intestine ulcers (peptic ulcers), diabetes, meningitis, pneumonia, eye infections, tuberculosis, and liver cirrhosis. Some people use phellodendron on their skin to treat psoriasis, kill germs, and reduce redness and swelling. Some of the chemicals found in phellodendron may help to reduce redness and swelling (inflammation). Berberine, another chemical, may be able to lower blood sugar and ""bad"" LDL cholesterol while also protecting the liver from toxic materials. Berberine may also have anti-tumor properties. White Korean Ginseng This Korean ingredient has been included in the Exipure weight loss formula because it aids in energy restoration. When you're trying to lose weight, it's normal to feel down, lethargic, and weak. However, with white Korean ginseng in these pills, you can have unrivaled energy to perform daily tasks while losing weight on a daily basis. Kudzu (Pueraria Lobata) In Asian countries such as Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand, kudzu root powder is commonly used as a food additive and dietary supplement.

11,Ultrasonic Cavitation Weight Loss,health-fitness," 40K Ultrasonic Cavitation Weight Loss Directory Introduction The characteristics of ultrasound and the principle of weight loss The effect of ultrasound on biological tissue Body fat metabolism Effectiveness and side effects of ultrasound weight loss Conclusion Introduce Liposuction is one of the most popular ways to remove fat from the body, and according to 2019 data from the American Medical Institute, liposuction is on the rise, with an increase of 15 percent. Compared with 2017, an increase of 5.3%. With the development of science and technology, the technology of losing weight and removing fat is constantly improving, and now it has changed from the original liposuction to the most popular ultrasound and frozen weight loss. These weight-loss techniques are safer and have a shorter recovery time. At the end of the last century, ultrasound was used in a wide range of medical fields. At that time, ultrasound was used to remove body fat. Although liposuction is now very mature, the medical community is still trying to find a safer and more effective weight-loss technology to meet the needs of the market. Even liposuction, to some extent, does not have a great impact on health. But most people would prefer to lose weight that is safer, more convenient, and less expensive, and doesn't even require a conditioning cycle like liposuction. Subsequently, EMS weight-loss methods, such as Radio frequency weight-loss, Vacuum RF weight-loss, Frozen weight loss and cavitation weight loss, are gradually proposed by the medical community. In general, in the past few years, the number of people losing weight has been on the increase, mainly because people are paying more and more attention to their health. The characteristics of ultrasound and the principle of weight loss We come to understand what is ultrasonic, so help you understand the principle of ultrasonic weight loss. Ultrasonic wave is a kind of mechanical wave with a very short wavelength, which propagates through the medium in the form of pressure wave. The length of the acoustic wave band that we can hear is 20hz to 2000hz, and the band beyond this range is the ultrasonic wave that cannot be heard by human ears. Ultrasound is widely used in medicine. Low frequency ultrasound (20~200khz) can be based on mechanical action to generate sound waves to dissolve fat and build body, used in dental treatment, eye treatment, etc. The middle frequency band (0.7~3) can be used for thermal therapy; High frequency ultrasound (1~20MHZ) can be used for ultrasound diagnosis and medical surgery. Ultrasonic wave is a kind of mechanical wave, it is transmitted through the medium, sound wave is with energy. So, this is why ultrasound can be used to remove body fat, with the role of weight loss. In addition, a very important point is that ultrasonic wave can be reflected and refracted in the process of transmission. In a uniform medium, ultrasonic waves will travel in straight lines. However, when the interface of the medium in the transmission process blocks the transmission of sound waves, reflection or refraction will occur. The principle that ultrasonic reduces weight When ultrasound is transmitted to adipose tissue, it is reflected and refracted by the adipose cell wall. This causes energy to be reflected directly and repeatedly in the fat cells, and energy is eventually absorbed and scattered by the fat cells. The cell acts as the medium through which the sound waves are transmitted, and as the sound waves bounce off the medium many times, eventually all the energy carried by the sound waves is converted into heat energy. The heat creates tiny bubbles between the cells, plus some energy that vibrates at high frequencies. The interaction between bubbles and ultrasonic waves is called cavitation. As cavitation intensifies, it causes the bubble to expand, and the heat also expands the fat cells, which eventually burst and shed fatty acids. Fatty acids are broken down by the body's lymphatic system, which is the body's metabolism, and ultimately fat is broken down and eliminated from the body. Achieve the effect of removing fat and losing weight. The effect of ultrasound on biological tissues There are two main things that happen when ultrasound is applied inside tissues. One is that the energy carried by ultrasound is converted into heat when it acts on tissue cells. Here we say the thermal effect. Thermal effects Heating cells does not always kill cells and can be used for a variety of thermal treatments. For example, thermoliao can be performed on tumors to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy and stimulate various functional activities of tissue species. The second is cavitation, which will generate a large number of bubbles inside the tissue, and then the bubbles are constantly heating and expanding, including high frequency mechanical vibration. When a certain threshold is reached, the cell tissue will rupture. Ultrasonic reducing weight is to use this one characteristic. Another is the effect of low pulse ultrasound on tissue. When low-frequency ultrasound acts on tissues, it will stimulate mitochondria, change the transmission of gene signals, make human lymphocytes apoptosis, promote the continuous proliferation of activated cells and the continuous generation of collagen protein. This will improve skin elasticity, remove wrinkles, and repair bone tissue. Body fat metabolism The body's fat cells are constantly being replaced. Fat is in the form of triglycerides, which enter the extracellular fluid when the walls of fat cells break down. When the lymphatic system detects the presence of triglycerides in extracellular fluid, the lymphatic tissue decomposes the triglycerides from the outflow, a process called catabolism. The broken down triglycerides are excreted through the body's perspiration, or flushing system. Effectiveness and side effects of ultrasound weight loss Ultrasound is very safe and effective for weight loss. A slight red spot will appear within an hour after the ultrasound weight-loss treatment. Others experience mild skin redness, increased sensitivity, or slight bruising. These are normal phenomena, generally after 24 hours will disappear. From a medical point of view, this method of losing weight is effective. But the cycle will be slightly longer, generally need 8 weeks of treatment will see significant results. This is mainly due to waiting for the body's metabolic processes to finish breaking down the damaged fat cells. Moreover, ultrasonic weight loss does not require drugs or surgery, only through the penetration of ultrasonic energy on fat cells. With targeted effect, so, will not damage other tissues, will not cause physical injury. Conclusion Ultrasonic weight loss is an effective, safe, no side effect weight loss method. Use ultrasonic to reduce weight, won't cause an effect to normal life, and the effect can be very apparent. But when doing ultrasonic to reduce weight, need to have the aid of gel, the main effect is to avoid the blood vessel that damages epidermal organization to let energy better action at fat cell."
12,What Lowers Testosterone? The Answers May Surprise You.,health-fitness," People know that testosterone is a sex hormone, but it also has a significant impact on one's health, let’s take a look at “What Lowers Testosterone”. It's critical to keep this hormone’s levels in check if you want to develop muscle mass, improve sexual function, or increase strength. What Lowers Testosterone Levels: What are the Causes, and How Can You Prevent It? It is true that testosterone levels are dropping all around the world. As a wave of low testosterone diagnoses sweeps the nation, many men are anxious about their testosterone levels. Furthermore, the typical man's testosterone level is roughly 25% lower than it was 30 years ago. While numerous factors play a role in testosterone management, a good diet is essential for maintaining testosterone levels and preventing them from falling too low. What is Low Testosterone Levels? When testosterone levels are less than 300 ng/dL, it is known as low testosterone. Experts have stated that a normal range is 300 to 1,000 ng/dL. If you want to check the amount of circulating testosterone, you should go for a blood test called a serum testosterone test. What Decreases Testosterone? Testosterone management is dictated by multiple factors, but maintaining a balanced diet is essential for keeping testosterone levels in check and preventing them from falling too low. Hundreds of hours of research have shown that some diets have negative impacts on testosterone levels. Soy, almonds, salmon, spearmint tea, red reishi mushrooms, flaxseed, processed carbs, and meat hormones are just a few examples. It's critical to eat these meals in moderation to effectively fight these side effects. There are beverages to avoid as well as meals that alter testosterone levels. Beer and water with high estrogen levels are two of the most well-known beverages. It has been discovered that even modest alcohol use can lower testosterone levels by up to 6.8%. In today's world, sleep deprivation is a relatively frequent condition. Lack of sleep leads to lower morning testosterone levels in middle-aged and older men (and even younger males). Regular exercise naturally raises testosterone levels, but too much of it might have negative consequences. High-intensity activities have been associated with reduced sex drive and testosterone levels, according to some studies. Cortisol levels are directly related to chronic stress, making it difficult for hormones to flow through brain pathways. This inhibits the production of reproductive hormones, including testosterone. What Foods Decrease Testosterone? Here are the foods that decrease testosterone levels: Soy and soy containing foods Soy is high in phytoestrogen isoflavones, which are estrogen-like chemicals found in plants. These phytoestrogens can activate estrogen receptors in your body, but they can also inhibit androgen receptor activity, which is where testosterone attaches. If it can't attach to those receptors, your testosterone won't be able to do its job — and you won't be able to either. Despite multiple research, the verdict on soy is still out, with inconsistent outcomes. It's definitely better to think of soy as a possible testosterone killer and limit your intake until further study is done. Products derived from milk Before you go for that cheese plate or a tall glass of whole milk, think twice. Dairy products have been shown in several studies to lower testosterone levels. Pregnant female cows provide the majority of commercially produced and marketed milk, and their milk is high in estrogen and progesterone. These hormones decrease gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which males require for the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) (LH). Your testes can't create testosterone if they aren't released. Alcohol A few drinks here and there won't give your hormones a hangover. However, if you drink a lot of beer, spirits, or wine, your testosterone levels may drop. Alcohol use impairs the function of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and testes, according to considerable study. The hypothalamus, like cheese, is unable to release GnRH, the pituitary gland is unable to release FSH and LH, and your testes are unable to make testosterone. In other words, if you're overserved all of the time, your hormones will become underserved. Worse, they're the ones who foot the bill. Alcohol abuse may harm your body in a variety of ways, including your liver, kidneys, and heart, in addition to destroying testosterone. Please drink responsibly and in moderation. Products from bakeries Who doesn't like a delicious cookie or loaf of bread, especially one that has just come out of the oven? Unfortunately, many baked products are heavy in trans-unsaturated fatty acids, often known as trans-fat, which have been linked to a drop in T levels. According to a 2017 study, people who ate meals high in trans-fat had testosterone levels that were 15% lower than those who ate the least. Baked products like pastries, danish, pies, and other sweet delights can raise your insulin levels, and it can result in low testosterone levels and poor taste. Keep this in mind the next time you're tempted to have a second doughnut. Mint You may have heard that spearmint and peppermint are natural stress relievers, digestive aids and provide sinus relief. They can also aid in the freshening of your breath. Mint may, unfortunately, stink when it comes to male hormones, according to some studies. More study is needed, particularly with human male participants, before a conclusive link between mint and low testosterone can be established. Nuts Certain nuts have a negative impact on your hormones. Nuts have a good reputation for being abundant in healthful fats and minerals, but studies reveal that nuts strong in polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as walnuts, pistachios, peanuts, pecans, and almonds, might promote oxidative stress in storage tissues, lowering testosterone levels. Flaxseed There's no denying that flaxseed has health advantages, such as lowering blood pressure and enhancing cholesterol levels and intestinal health. However, too much of it can turn into a testosterone killer. Other foods that can lower testosterone levels are processed foods, vegetable oil, and Licorice root. Risks Associated with Low Testosterone Levels This hormone is largely responsible for men's sexual urges. A drop in testosterone might result in a drop in libido. One of the most significant concerns for men with low testosterone levels is the possibility that their sexual drive and performance will be harmed. Men may have a variety of symptoms linked to sexual function as they age, which might be caused by reduced levels of this hormone. Low testosterone production is not a prevalent cause of erectile dysfunction. Hormone replacement treatment may assist your erectile dysfunction if you have erectile dysfunction and poor testosterone production. These adverse effects aren't usually noticeable right away. If they do, it's possible that low testosterone levels aren't the main factor. Low levels of this hormone can cause a variety of physical changes in your body. The “masculine” hormone, testosterone, is occasionally referred to as such. It helps in muscular mass development, promotes the growth of body hair, and adds to a more manly appearance. Low testosterone levels can lead to fatigue, sleeplessness, and other sleep disturbances. Sleep apnea can be caused or exacerbated by testosterone replacement treatment. Sleep apnea is a significant medical disorder in which your breathing continuously stops and starts while you are sleeping. In the process, it can interrupt your sleep pattern and put you at risk for severe concerns, such as a stroke. It is a hormone that has an impact on emotional control. Low testosterone has been related to depression in males. The reasons can be low testosterone-related irritation, diminished sex drive, and weariness. Foods That Raise Testosterone Some medical therapies, particularly in younger men, can help to boost low testosterone levels, but a person can also stimulate the body to create more testosterone by making dietary and lifestyle changes. The foods that raise testosterone are listed below. Bananas Bromelain, an enzyme found in bananas, is known to help raise testosterone levels. Bananas are also great for keeping energy levels up and lowering antioxidants, making them the ideal on-the-go snack! Beef Red meat over consumption has become a severe health hazard. On the other hand, the right parts of meat are said to be helpful for men in improving their testosterone levels. More importantly, zinc is abundant in meats like ground beef. In addition, vitamin D is abundant in beef liver. However, like with other things, you should consume beef without overeating. It is also possible to replace beef with a different protein. You can also go for a vegetable instead of eating it every day. Shellfish It is true that fish and oysters are helpful for low testosterone levels. However, a great approach to get zinc into your diet is to eat shellfish to improve testosterone levels. Tuna and Salmon Tuna is rich in protein, and it is also low in calories. You can also get a sufficient amount of vitamin D, which has been linked to higher testosterone levels. The typical person's daily vitamin D need is met by one dish of tuna. If tuna isn't your thing, other wonderful sources of vitamin D include salmon, cod, tilapia, and a variety of other seafood. When it comes to seafood, though, remember that moderation is key. To reduce your mercury consumption, limit yourself to two or three portions of seafood each week. Tuna is high in Vitamin D, and it can be helpful in increasing testosterone levels by up to 90%! Vitamin D is important for sperm count maintenance, and tuna is a fantastic source of this vitamin, especially if you don't get much time outside! Lemons Lemons (like other citrus fruits) are excellent testosterone boosters! They, like garlic, assist in reducing cortisol levels, allowing the testosterone to be created faster. In addition, they also contain vitamin A, which is necessary for testosterone synthesis and can help suppress estrogen levels, making testosterone more effective. Oats for Porridge Porridge oats are high in B vitamins, which are essential for testosterone synthesis. B vitamins are available in the market in many forms, and many of them may be found in testosterone-boosting meals. Vitamin B6 has a direct function in testosterone synthesis by suppressing estrogen production and therefore allowing testosterone levels to grow! Beans Beans contain sufficient quantities of both zinc and vitamin D. They're also a plant-based protein that helps with heart health. Baked beans are another fantastic source of vitamin D and zinc, but you'll still need to complement your diet with other sources. Spinach This vegetable has long been regarded as one of the finest meals for increasing testosterone levels. It's one of the most popular superfoods! Spinach is a natural supply of magnesium, which has been linked to a higher amount of testosterone hormone. In addition, vitamin B6 and iron are also good for testosterone, and they are also found in spinach. Egg Yolks Another great source of vitamin D to include in your diet is egg yolks. In recent years, eggs have gained a negative image for being high in cholesterol, prompting many individuals to abandon egg yolks. However, it has been proven that egg yolks contain more nutrients than egg whites and. Moreover, they can aid men with low testosterone levels. You may comfortably eat one to three eggs for breakfast each day unless you have excessive cholesterol. Use of Supplements to Raise Testosterone Along with the proper diet, another effective way to boost testosterone naturally is with the use of supplements. Many people take testosterone boosters because they are considered to be a great way to increase muscle growth. Most of the testosterone boosters advertised on the internet claim to improve testosterone levels while, in fact, many of these products have no effect on testosterone levels at all. But some testosterone supplements do in fact enhance your testosterone levels, but this generally only lasts a few months. When paired with a balanced diet, testosterone boosters can help enhance testosterone levels and provide additional advantages. Some testosterone boosters can enhance your testosterone levels by 20 to 50 percent, depending on the components and your lifestyle. Fenugreek is a well-studied plant that boosts testosterone levels and improves performance. So, it is recommended to use a testosterone booster containing Fenugreek. Conclusion An easy first step to deal with low testosterone levels is to create and keep to a balanced diet comprising the above-mentioned testosterone-boosting foods and supplements. However, to counteract low testosterone, we recommend you to see your primary care physician and plan your meals and supplements after consultation."
13,Hair Loss in Children: The Lasting Impression Treatment,health-fitness," Hair loss, or alopecia, is a common medical condition. Most people associate it with age, but it can affect anyone. Losing your hair can feel frightening, or you might get embarrassed. But, there are plenty of effective treatments that you can use. How Does Hair Loss Work? Everyone loses hair. Usually, people lose about 100 strands of hair each day. That's not a problem most of the time. However, it can become troublesome in some cases. Alopecia is what happens when you lose too much hair, causing bald spots. You might start by noticing you've got more hair coming out of your head than usual. Then, it can progress to bald spots. There are a lot of things that may cause alopecia. Hormonal imbalances are pretty common, and stress could also be a factor. In fact, women tend to lose a lot of hair after giving birth. A lot of alopecia cases are genetically linked. That means you can inherit the condition from your parents. If they lose their hair, then your chances of it happening become a lot higher. Depending on the cause, you might be able to regrow your hair. Different treatments work on alopecia using different approaches. You'll need to speak to your doctor to determine what's causing yours. Age is another major factor. As we age, our bodies might not hold onto our hair as well. Age-related alopecia is the most likely cause for most people. Men, in particular, seem to suffer from it often. That's because testosterone affects their hair follicles. Over time, excess testosterone may lead to them not growing back. How Does It Affect Children? Watching children lose their hair can be particularly worrisome for parents. If your child has been losing theirs, it could be the result of a number of things. However, it happens more often than you think. Here are a few of the most common reasons your child might be suffering from alopecia. Ringworm of the Scalp Sometimes, children develop loss of hair because of a fungal infection. You'll see patches of scaly skin developing on their scalp. Using an oral antifungal medication should resolve any issues, though. If you suspect this is the case, take your child to a doctor. They'll inspect them using a microscope to verify it's a fungal infection. Then, they can prescribe you the correct medications to treat the disorder. Autoimmune Disorders Some children suffer from loss of hair because of an autoimmune condition. That's when their body's immune system begins attacking itself. Seek out a doctor if you think your children have this condition. It doesn't have a cure, but there are ways you can manage it. Compulsive Hair Pulling Trichotillomania is a condition where children pull out their own hair, compulsively. Usually, you'll notice more hair is gone on their dominant side. Children might engage in this behavior because of anxiety. Or, they might not realize they're doing it at all. Speak to a medical professional to see what they can do. Most of the time, they'll recommend some sort of behavioral modification. Fortunately, this isn't a medically-caused case. So, as long as you get them to change their behavior, everything should grow back. Sudden Severe Stress Certain types of stress could lead to your children losing their hair. For example, if they've had a high fever, then it might fall out. Even losing a loved one might trigger this effect. Because of the severe stress, their hair follicles stop growing mid-phase. Then, it'll fall out within a few weeks. Luckily, once the stress is gone, everything will start growing again. They should have full heads of hair within 6 to 12 months. Nutritional Deficiencies Hair growth requires the presence of certain nutrients. Vitamin B and Zinc are both necessary for healthy hair growth. In some cases, too much vitamin A could cause it to fall out as well. Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism may also cause hair to fall out. This is an endocrine problem where the thyroid doesn't produce enough hormones. As a result, you may notice weight gain and loss of hair. Correcting it with hormone replacements should resolve any issues. How Do You Treat It? Losing your hair is never any fun. Fortunately, there are plenty of treatments that can help. Choosing the right one depends on what's causing your alopecia. Talk to your dermatologist to see if they can figure out what's going on. Laser Treatment Certain laser treatments could be an effective way to help you regrow your hair. Light shines onto the scalp, stimulating your hair follicles. There are at-home versions of this treatment available. However, medical centers tend to produce better results. Minoxidil Minoxidil is one of the first medications used to treat alopecia. It can help to slow the loss of hair, and it may help to regrow it as well. Using it along with another medication seems to produce even better results most of the time. Hair Transplants Hair transplants replace your hair follicles with some from another person. It's a surgical procedure, so it may be risky. However, with the help of a good doctor, it's effective. Plus, you'll have new hair permanently. Finasteride Finasteride is a medication used to treat male pattern baldness. It prevents testosterone from aromatizing. As a result, your hair follicles should start regrowing. It's also great at slowing down age-related conditions.

Altai Balance practitioners emphasize that their strict routine is better than diet and exercise for diabetics, anti-aging, weight loss, and blood sugar. When caring for a serious illness such as diabetes, you should trust your doctor's advice. Many doctors recommend diet and exercise before recommending supplements. Yet, Altai Balance is considered online as the most useful way to manage blood sugar than any diet or training program. This point you can get all the usefulness of diet and training without working out. What is the Altai balance for? Knowledge of how Altai Balance works helps to comprehend what is in Altai Balance and what they do. Here is a quick summary following Globe Newswire's analysis of Altai Balance highlights and their effect: Chromium: Chromium is one of the most important and visible elements in the Altai Balance. Each Altai Balance supplement contains 714% of the recommended daily Chromium value. Most people with diabetes often have chromium deficiency, and doctors recommend taking chromium or multivitamin supplements. You can get chromium from any multivitamin or from a reliable chromium addendum, although Altai Balance has a more elevated quantity. Biotin: Altai Balance too has an elevated dose of Biotin, vitamin B united with energy, anti-aging, and overall healthiness and fitness. Each Altai Balance supplement contains 1000% of the biotin value you recommend daily. Biotin has not yet been shown to reduce blood sugar significantly or to have serious fatal consequences. However, some studies suggest that biotin may contribute to energy and overall health and wellness. Vitamins and different minerals: Altai Balance contains little doses of multiple other vitamins and minerals, including magnesium, vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, and manganese. None of these vitamins or minerals are especially important for diabetics, but they are essential for anyone who wants to promote good health and well-being. Altai Balance has little doses of each spice, delivering 12% to 73% of your day-to-day recommended dose of each vitamin and mineral. Alpha Lipoic Acid: Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA) from Altai Balance can be found in many other supplements for diabetes. It is one of the most popular diabetes supplements available. Although Altai Balance does not have a high dose of ALA, this active ingredient generally acts as an antioxidant. Since ALA is a penultimate application listed in the Altai Balance mix, there may be only a few milligrams in the Altai Balance (if applicable). However, ALA can support blood sugar and other benefits in high doses. Taurine and Amino Acids: Altai Balance contains taurine and different amino acids. Your body produces amino acids on its own while receiving other amino acids in your diet. Your body needs amino acids for many bodily functions, including protein synthesis. Some people regularly take amino acid supplements for metabolism, energy, and muscle building. They are usually found in addition to mental health supplements, pre-and post-exercise supplements, as well as other procedures. They are rarely associated with diabetes, although they can support energy in many ways. Grass and Herbicides: Most of the Altai Balance blends herbs and herbs. These supplements include some of the most popular diabetes supplements sold online today, including licorice, bananas, cinnamon bark, and bitter gourd. Most supplements for diabetes have one or more of these, although it is higher than what we see in Altai Balance. Overall, Altai Balance has many aspects related to regulating and regulating blood sugar. Other than chromium and biotin, however, none of these factors indicate that it is potent enough to have a significant effect on the human body. Altai Balance Ingredients Altai Balance says it consumes large doses of 19 foods, vitamins, minerals, herbs, and plant extracts. Anyway, the hardware icon tells us something else. The Altai Balance formula contains a blend that contains only 212 mg of the total formula. This system has more than a dozen listed, which means that each item has only one symbol. For instance, people with diabetes carry 100 mg to 500 mg of any essence, such as alpha-lipoic acid, upset gourd, and licorice. However, the Altai Balance has only 212 mg of its composition. Altai Balance contains good vitamins and minerals, including 715% of the daily value (DV) of chromium, an essential mineral for people with diabetes. Many doctors tell people with diabetes to take chromium supplements (or to add more chromium to their diet). People with diabetes often have lower chromium levels than non-diabetics, as well as essential chromium supplements. In any case, here is a list of Altai Balance items: 50 mg of vitamin C (56% DV) 5 mg of vitamin E (33% DV) 300 mg of biotin (1000% DV) 50mg of magnesium (12% DV) 15 mg of zinc (73% DV) 1 mg of manganese (43%) 250 mg of chromium (714% DV) 212 mg of free blood sugar system including taurine, licorice root, bark cinnamon, yarrow, cayenne pepper, juniper berries, Gymnema, bananas, bananas extract, bitter gourd, white mulberry leaf, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA ), and vanadyl sulfate Other ingredients such as gelatin (to make a capsule) and microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate (to bind the ingredients together, preserve the structure and prevent breakage) As mentioned above, Altai Balance has many anti-diabetic supplements shown. However, a few of the features in Altai Balance may not be fully functional compared to other additions or studies. It is attainable that Altai Balance may supply weak help for blood sugar based on the listed facets, but it is unlikely to lower blood sugar or provide strong support for diabetes in any way. Benefits. The Benefits of Altai Balance: What Does Science Say? Altai Balance has not yet achieved any clinical trial to evaluate its effects or benefits. There are no studies to show that a combination of ingredients in Altai Balance may support the symptoms of diabetes, blood sugar, weight loss, or other side effects reported. Altai Balance makers cite several studies on their reference pages showing that the ingredients can support blood sugar levels in a number of ways. However, most studies use a higher rate of any active substance than what we see in Altai Balance. The compounds may have supportive effects even in small doses, but science tells us that Altai Balance cannot support the symptoms of diabetes. Chromium and biotin are the two main elements in Altai Balance. You can get chromium and biotin from your diet - or from a multivitamin. They are very important for overall health and well-being and are especially important for people with diabetes. People with diabetes are often chromium and biotin deficient. According to WebMD, chromium and biotin can lead to ""very good"" blood sugar and cholesterol readings, according to several studies. Other studies have found a link between the symptoms of diabetes and chromium, as well as those without chromium, who may have symptoms of diabetes. Taurine and other amino acids can support the symptoms of diabetes in many ways. Studies have shown that taking 400 to 6000 mg of taurine daily can ""be used"" in controlling the symptoms of diabetes. Most amino acid supplements contain 1,000 mg to 6,000 mg of amino acids per scoop or per message. Altai Balance contains taurine, although it appears to be the only amount of taurine in this process. It is one of the twelve listed in its 212 mg proprietary blend. Most people consume 50 to 500 mg of taurine daily as part of a regular diet, so a small dose does not work. Many people with diabetes consider cinnamon extract as a natural way to regulate blood sugar levels. It is popular in many supplements for diabetes. Some studies have shown that the appearance of cinnamon makes it easier for you to maintain your blood sugar level. However, other studies have not been limited, indicating that there is no difference between cinnamon extract and placebo. In a recent study, the Mayo Clinic examined evidence of cinnamon extract in diabetes. He concludes that it is “still unclear” whether the appearance of cinnamon helps people with diabetes control their blood sugar or not. Another popular supplement in addition to diabetes is alpha-lipoic acid. As such, the researchers used doses of 600 mg to 1800 mg of ALA in the study, and in these studies combined ALA with a small antioxidant and blood sugar reduction effect. For example, in this study, participants took 600 mg of ALA daily and lowered their blood sugar. Altai Balance contains a small portion of the recommended medication. Overall, Altai Balance has many side effects related to diabetes, blood sugar, and other side effects, but the supplement may not have large doses of the listed ingredients. With the exception of chromium and biotin, all elements of the Altai Balance are much lower than those used in scientific studies in addition to the competition. There is little evidence that it can support high blood sugar. Price Balance Altai Altai Balance is priced from $ 34 to $ 49 per bottle, depending on how many bottles you order. Each bottle contains 30 capsules (30 servings) or 30 days' food. You take one capsule daily to boost your body's ability to control blood sugar. 1 bottle: $ 49 3 bottles: $ 117 6 bottle : $ 204 The 60-day money-back guarantee covers every buy, even though the factory does not reimburse shipping costs ($ 9.95 per unit). If the Altai Balance does not provide blood sugar help and other benefits such as advertising, you have the right to a full refund.

18,The Naked Truth,health-fitness," In history there are instances that have been misunderstood, omitted from recorded record, and completely distorted. What the world is experiencing today reflects the same blatant desire of some to distort occurrences that have the potential to upend the existing power structure. It is this power structure that has almost complete control over societies. The United States government is complicit in what is amounting to be the gravest medical error since the Black Death. What is so discerning is that there is a complete aversion to what the medical community, our government and the media are trying and to a large extent selling to the public in regards to their reactions to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. The Pharmaceutical industry where Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson have all collaborated in designing an experimental vaccine using a synthetic compound. It is this mRNA compound that when people are inoculated they theoretically would be able to fight off the Covid-19 infection. In theory, but, what has been discovered is that instead of increasing the bodies immune responses to the Covid-19 virus it has the exact opposite reaction. The bodies immune system breaks down and subsequently people who have already been inoculated many suffer from adverse side effects and are more prone to be infected. Today, with almost a year into the experimental vaccination program where more people have already been inoculated we would have thought the infection rates would have already declined considerably. Yet, infection rates are increasing drastically, more deaths are occurring and the world is becoming more unstable. Despite the enormous public awareness campaign by the media, the CDC, and our governments to encourage and even go so far as mandating all to be inoculated with the experimental vaccine in spite of the recent surge of infections occurring in those already vaccinated should raise serious questions about the violability of this vaccine and why the big push to get vaccinated with these experimental drugs. In trying to answer these questions we can somewhat conclude that one, the mRNA compound being synthetic isn't the silver bullet to combat the Covid-19. Two, it should be quite obvious in realizing that today after a year of almost forced vaccination using this mRNA vaccine instead of diminishing rates of infection the rates have only increased drastically. What is really behind this big push for an experimental vaccine that isn't working? We have to go back to 2014 when the World Economic Forum's founder Klaus Schwab called for what is now called a Global Reset. With the combined backing of some of the world's wealthiest like Bill Gates George Sorus etc. set the stage for what is now happening. The means to reap more wealth and control over governments and populations. Today, 9 people from the Pharmaceutical industry that are involved with this mRNA experimental vaccine have already become Billionaires. Today there are two causes to why Covid-19 cases are surging. One, the mRNA experimental vaccine does not work it is now actually causes an almost complete breakdown of the immune system, other serious adverse reactions and increases in Covid-19 infections. The other reason is purely money motivated. The public has been duped into a false sense of awareness by the CDC, the media and our government. What is already happening is the beginning of not only a medical travesty playing out but the ramifications of this big push to vaccinate the world will bring an economic and financial catastrophe to populations all over the globe.

19,"Dr. William Martinez, MD Cardiac Surgery Open Heart Surgery With No Open Chest",health-fitness," Dr. William Martinez, MD Cardiac Surgery - Cardiovascular diseases are very common globally and almost 528 million people are suffering worldwide. You are likely to come across someone in your surrounding with a heart disease. There are also chances that you might know someone who has underwent bypass heart surgery and they might have shared their uncomfortable journey of recovery. But fortunately, the science has come a long way and heart bypass surgery can be conducted with minimal incision or major cutting. This was first-hand experience by Ida Foraker of Enfield. She explained, “I never experienced too much pain. All I felt was mostly discomfort”. With the help of Tylenol, her discomfort was managed but what Ida was unaware until recently was of the fact that she was born with a medical condition known as Atrial Septal Defect. In this condition, there is whole in the wall of heart and this was the reason behind frightening palpitations Ida was experiencing. She said, “The feeling of racing heart was pretty scary for me sometimes because my heart would be beating so fast that I could only listen the pounding blood in my years and I would have no idea what would happen in the next breath.” If she was left untreated there were high chances that she would have suffered a stroke. Her doctor recommended an open heart surgery to treat her condition but the surgery was an altogether new experience for her. “We will only make incision of about two to three inches,” Dr. William Martinez, MD Cardiac Surgery at St. Francis Hospital explained to her. This was completely different from what all of us including Ida have heard about the open heart surgery in the past. Dr. William Martinez, MD Cardiac Surgery elaborated, “In a traditional open heart surgery, the breastbone or sternum is fully cut open and divided. So incision made in open heart surgery equals that size of the sternum” that is approximately i2 inches. The minimally invasive heart surgery was first time performed by the Surgeons of St. Francis Hospital in Connecticut. Now this technique is commonly used to treat heart valve issues and septal defects of heart. Dr. William Martinez, MD Cardiac Surgery commented, “Minimally invasive heart surgery is great new tool to treat people and the period of recovery after this surgery is a big advancement in comparison to traditional open-heart surgery.” “This procedure does not pose any limitation outside of the pain. People can easily return to their normal life and start working once they feel they can get back to work.” According to Dr. William Martinez, MD Cardiac Surgery, “Patients are able to recover and feel much better within two weeks.”  It was not easy for Ida to believe all this since she has witnessed her husband undergoing double bypass surgery some ten years ago. Ida was amazed and said, “This procedure is just like a miracle. One can never expect that such a surgery can be performed at a small scale. It is enough to blow one’s mind.” Ida has noticed that she is no more experiencing racing heart since the surgery and she is very thankful for that. She said, “I am aware of my limits. I know what I can manage to do and what I cannot do.” Dr. William Martinez, MD Cardiac Surgery expects the incision to become even smaller in the next io years to come."
20,White Spots on Teeth: How to Improve Your Smile,health-fitness," When you see stains on teeth, the solution to the issue is usually simple. They need to be whitened. Professional treatment can remove deep-set stains, but what do you do about white spots on teeth? You can’t treat this problem the same way, and they can attract the wrong kind of attention to your teeth. Although veneers can cover discoloration, they involve a more invasive treatment, and very few dentists out there offer a more conservative option called Icon treatment. Read on to learn more about what these white spots are and how this procedure can resolve the issue. Where Do the White Spots Come from? Most often white discoloration occurs when there has been demineralization in the enamel. Other causes include dental fluorosis, poor oral hygiene, and even trauma. Regardless of the cause, if you have white spots on your teeth, you can do something about it. How Does Icon Treatment Work? This procedure requires about an hour to perform. The dentist utilizes micro-abrasion to create a rough surface on the tooth. Then, they apply a tooth-colored resin, which fills the demineralized tubules of the tooth. Finally, the dentist smooths the surface so that it reflects light just like natural enamel. If your smile doesn’t look the way you want it to, you don’t have to settle. At Plush Dentistry, we provide Icon treatment to give you a more natural-looking, even whiteness to your teeth. Contact us to take care of your white spots today!"

1,Weight Loss and Your Smile: How Eating Healthier Can Help Your Waistline and Your Mouth,health-fitness," Around this time of year, many people make goals for self-improvement. Roughly half of those who make new year’s resolu6tions say they want to lose weight. Does this apply to you? Although exercise and movement definitely play a major role in weight loss, healthy eating is an essential part of successful weight loss. But it can be difficult to muster the motivation to eat healthier if your only goal is to see the number go down on the scale. Maybe you need more substantial reasons for weight management. Well, did you know that a healthier diet can also help you have a strong, brilliant smile? In this post, you’ll learn how your goal to lose weight could also benefit your mouth, and you’ll hopefully get the drive to make your resolution last throughout 2022. Cutting Back on Sugar For years now, the effects of sugar on the body have been well researched. You know you should cut back on sugar and carbohydrates if you want to lose pounds. Fortunately, saying no to sugar also benefits your smile. How? Your mouth serves as the first stage in the digestive system. Your teeth grind and break down food so that the stomach can begin processing it for your body’s use. Some bits of food, namely sugar, starches, and carbohydrates which behave like sugar, can stay behind in the mouth. Bacteria love sugar and produce eroding acids. That’s when tooth decay starts. When you eat candy, cookies, bread, crackers, and other starchy foods excessively, you increase your risk of getting cavities. On the other hand, when you limit your sugar consumption, you keep the bacteria in your mouth under control. Getting Necessary Nutrients In addition, if you choose to eat more nutrient-rich foods like broccoli, leafy greens, and more, you provide the vitamins and minerals your teeth and bones need to stay strong. These foods also help your body fight inflammation and infection, which comes in handy in the mouth. Fibrous fruits and vegetables also cause you to salivate more, washing away bits of food that could cause plaque formation. As a result, your teeth can stay healthy and resist decay. Making Healthy Choices Along with diet and exercise, if you want to lose weight, you may need to change some lifestyle choices. For instance, instead of taking the elevator, you should walk up the stairs, and you should drink more water throughout the day. Another healthy decision is to visit your dentist at least twice every year for checkups and cleanings. These appointments may be routine, but by taking the time for these visits, you ensure a healthy, infection-free mouth, allowing you to eat more nutritious foods and lose weight. In the end, the more reasons you have to stick to your weight loss goals, the more likely you’ll be to achieve them. Keeping your mouth healthy and beautiful can help you stay on track and see progress in 2022. Plus, when you improve weight management, you’ll have plenty to smile about!"

4,How Exercise Can Benefit Your Mouth,health-fitness," You need to strengthen your heart. You want to improve your sleep. You are trying to control your weight. There are plenty of reasons to be more active and exercise. Here’s one to add to the list: you want to keep your smile healthy and strong. You may be wondering how working out your muscles can possibly impact your mouth. Read on to find out more about the connection and why you should do your best to keep moving. Reduce Your Risk of Gum Disease Recent studies have found that those who exercise regularly are significantly less likely to have gum disease than those who do not exercise often. In fact, non-smokers leading an active lifestyle were more than 50 percent less likely to have this serious gum infection. Although researchers can’t say for certain that lack of exercise is a direct cause of gum disease, it looks like there is a strong link between the two. A person who doesn’t exercise regularly isn’t necessarily practicing healthy self-care. It stands to reason that they may also falter in other areas of self-care such as oral hygiene, causing gum disease and other issues. Fortify Your Body Against Inflammation When you are more active, you get your blood pumping. Your body becomes trained to function optimally, and blood flow is improved throughout the body. This benefits basically all systems but your digestive system in particular. Bowel movements as well as nutrient absorption are much easier and more productive; as a result, your body is able to use vitamins and minerals from food more efficiently. For instance, calcium can be properly digested to strengthen your teeth and bones. Plus, improved circulation helps organs and tissues resist infection and inflammation. As the very first part of your digestive system, your mouth also benefits from better blood flow because the gum tissues are better able to stay strong against inflammation-causing bacteria. So, the next time you’re debating whether you should go to the gym or not, remember that exercise isn’t just good for your figure. It helps your body and mouth in the long term, and it’s worth taking the time and effort so that you can keep smiling!"
5,Ways To Lose Weight Permanently,health-fitness," Planning is important when setting goals to get things done. It doesn’t matter if it’s your main goal in life or a small shopping trip. For many people, losing weight is their main goal in life. This is something people strive for all their lives. You need a plan. If you want your body to burn calories by limiting your metabolism, you need to refuel and get a good supply of healthy calories. Eat smaller portions more often. Check food labels to keep track of how you eat them. Water is the key to weight control. Always stay hydrated. Include many healthy foods in your diet, such as grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, seafood, poultry, and meat. Avoid processed foods. To keep feeling full and full for longer, include some healthy fats in your diet. Include plenty of fiber in your diet. Take responsibility The reason for gaining weight is often to blame for everything, including parents, genes, society, and holidays. It’s time to take responsibility for your actions. Track calories using an app available on your smartphone or a little diary. Find a group of friends or family members to encourage, support, and hold you accountable. If you don’t have such people, you’ll find that there are many online support groups where completely strangers support and cheer each other up. These people strengthen and motivate you even if you want to quit smoking. The whole process of losing weight takes a long time and effort. You need all the support you can get. Intermittent fasting is another way to help control your eating habits. Fasting is difficult at first, but over time you will learn to ignore the urge to keep eating. Aim to lose about 12 pounds per week. It’s tempting to lose more, but in the long run it’s impossible, and secondly, you’ll lose bone, muscle and water. This is absolutely not necessary on your weight loss journey. Getting to Know Yourself Why food is hungry? What triggers do you have? Why are you hungry? It’s time to get to know yourself and your eating habits. Some respond to stress, some get angry, some feel comforted, and some eat out of boredom. Some people eat when they are depressed. If you are swayed by your emotions, learn to direct them in the other direction. Get into healthy habits like drawing, listening to music, reading, or taking a walk. Another reason people eat is that they spend their lives trying to avoid wasting food or leaving nothing on their plate. If that’s the problem, cook a little less, eat less, and store leftovers in the refrigerator for the next meal. When you are offered free food or pay to “eat as much as you can”, curb your urges and eat only what you need. There is no need to justify the price. Think of it as paying for the atmosphere or the experience. Not because of the food. Change What You Eat If you’re on a diet of junk food, cookies, baked goods, candies, sodas and more, it’s time to move on to healthier, fresher ingredients. How about adding more fruits and vegetables to your diet? Switch to whole grains, healthy dairy products, nuts and seeds, and healthy fats and protein. Balance your diet with the right combination of carbohydrates, protein and fat. Choose foods with fiber that will help you feel full longer and keep your digestion running smoothly. If you find it difficult to distance food between meals, break your meal into 5 small meals. Always have food available when you are hungry. Eating enough protein can make you feel full and satisfied for a long time. The same goes for good fats. Avoid processed carbohydrates as they often make you feel hungry."
6,How to Prevent Cavities When You Have a Sweet Tooth,health-fitness," Are you a self-proclaimed chocolate lover? Do you crave something sweet each afternoon? Does your evening seem incomplete without a scoop or two of ice cream? Then you, my friend, have a sweet tooth. While delicious treats are much-loved by your tastebuds, they can wreak havoc on the condition of your oral health. Fortunately, as your dentist near Fairfield, I know a few ways you can keep cavities at bay. Keep reading to learn what they are! #1. Brush Often The sugar found in sour gummies, delicious lollipops, and smooth chocolate can wreak havoc on your oral health. To prevent that from happening, make sure to brush with a soft-bristled toothbrush after each meal and snack. This will remove food particles, plaque, and bacteria, reducing your chances of developing a cavity. (Pro tip: if you can’t remember the last time you changed your toothbrush, now is the time to do so!). #2. Drink Plenty of Water Drinking water throughout the day won’t just keep you hydrated, it will also rinse the sugar from your teeth. Therefore, instead of reaching for coffee, soda, or red wine throughout the day, keep a glass of water close by. Your teeth will thank you for it! #3. Don’t Forget to Floss Flossing is crucial in preventing interproximal cavities (the ones that develop between your teeth). As a result, you should be flossing at least once a day. Plus, some studies have shown that flossing before brushing is even more beneficial. However, as long as you are gently stringing the floss between each tooth and cleaning along the gumline, you’re covered. #4. Opt for Less Sugary Snacks When You Can While indulging in your favorite treats from time to time is certainly okay, it’s best to find some healthier alternatives as well. For example, instead of indulging in a chocolate bar, consider opting for a chocolate-covered strawberry. Or, opt for a slice of pound cake instead of a gooey brownie. These small switches may not seem like much, but they can make all the difference. #5. Visit Your Dentist Biannually A solid at-home oral hygiene routine will go a long way, but your dental care is ultimately incomplete without your biannual preventive care visits. These six-month checkups catch cavities in the early stages, screen for oral cancer, check your bite alignment, and clean the hard-to-reach areas of your mouth. In short, they play an essential role in preventing tooth decay. Indulging in something sweet now and again is part of life, and you shouldn’t have to stop for the sake of your oral health! Just keep the above tips in mind to keep your smile in tip-top shape for years to come.

7,How Celiac Disease Affects Dental Health,health-fitness," According to The National Institutes of Health, more than 3 million Americans have Celiac Disease. This prevalent auto-immune disorder is triggered by gluten, which is a protein often found in wheat, barley, and rye. As a result, patients are encouraged to adopt a gluten-free diet to avoid damage to the small intestine that results in fatigue, diarrhea, anemia, and other serious health complications. What many aren’t aware of, however, is the link between this condition and poor dental health. To learn more, read on! So, How Does Celiac Disease Affect Dental Health? Since Celiac Disease largely affects the small intestine and digestion, it may not seem like your smile is in jeopardy. However, experts at the Celiac Disease Foundation have shared important research showing that dental enamel defects, delayed dental development, and cavities are a few oral health problems associated with this auto-immune disorder. Furthermore, patients who don’t maintain a gluten-free diet are at-risk for mouth cancers. As a result, it’s of the utmost importance to prioritize oral care.

Although they may seem insignificant at first glance, they can actually be lifesaving. That’s because the examination portion of these visits screen for oral cancer. Since patients with Celiac Disease have a higher risk of developing mouth cancers, these routine visits are extremely important. Not to mention that a skilled dentist can treat dental problems when they are minor, clean the hard-to-reach areas of your mouth effectively, and remove built-up plaque and tartar. Common Symptoms of Celiac Disease to Look Out For Sadly, many Americans with Celiac Disease go undiagnosed for years because they are unaware of the common symptoms. To prevent that from happening to you or a loved one, keep an eye out for the below: Symptoms of Celiac Disease in Children •	Nausea •	Vomiting •	Persistent diarrhea •	Swollen belly •	Constipation/gas Symptoms of Celiac Disease in Adults •	Diarrhea •	Fatigue •	Weight loss •	Bloating/gas •	Abdominal pain •	Vomiting Treating Celiac Disease If any of the above symptoms are present, then it’s important to talk to your primary care physician.

12,Guide to the Transition from Liquid Shampoos to Solid Shampoo Bars,health-fitness," Switching from a shampoo bottle to a shampoo bar has a number of benefits for both the environment and your hair health. Solid shampoo bars are more eco-friendly than shampoo bottles without harmful microbeads and all the superfluous packaging. And it's no secret that liquid shampoos contain chemicals that can be potentially damaging to our health long-term. Why is it worth trying solid shampoo bars? Shampoo bars have grown in popularity in recent years as consumers want more environmentally friendly and healthier hair care products. Many people are attempting to reduce their use of plastic and use biodegradable and natural ingredients. Shampoo bars are also balanced with bonding agents, scalp conditioning, and compounds that provide better hair nourishment than a liquid shampoo. Shampoo in solid form can be made with a dynamic mix of essential oils to boost hair health, nurture, and cleanse hair, and enliven the senses. Many essential oils have antibacterial and antifungal qualities, which aid in the elimination of microorganisms that cause dandruff and dull hair. Other typical substitutes include coconut milk, palm oil, and castor oil that protects the hair from damage and breakage by sealing in moisture. Making an easy transition from liquid shampoos to solid shampoo bars If you’re ready to make the change to a shampoo bar because you want a more natural and sustainable approach to hair care, here are some tips that will help make the transition easier. Choosing the right shampoo bar There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all shampoo irrespective if it’s in a solid or liquid form. Look for a bar with hydrating ingredients and oils for dry hair and for thin or flat hair, select a bar that’s designed to add fullness. If your scalp is easily irritated or itchy, search for a shampoo bar that contains soothing and clarifying ingredients, and if your hair is well-balanced, opt for a shampoo bar that gently cleanses your hair. Refine your hair washing technique Shampoo bars take a bit of getting used to but it will be easy over time with the right approach. To disperse your natural oils, begin by brushing your dry hair from the scalp to the tips. Then hop in the shower or bath and rub the bar between your fingers until thick lather forms. Gently massage the shampoo into your hair, concentrating on the scalp. After that, properly rinse it off. Use soft water Hard water can have an unhealthy impact on your hair, and it can also make your hair look knotted and dry. The way a shampoo bar interacts with your hair can also be affected by chlorinated, mineralized, or fluoridated water. By washing your hair with soft water, the shampoo bar can work directly with your natural oils without having to fight through chemicals in the water. What to keep in mind about solid shampoos? Shampoo bars are soap bars that are concentrated. They don't produce as much foam as liquid shampoos, but the lather they do make is thick and luxurious. It is also worth noting that some shampoo bars (but not all) can leave a waxy residue. In these cases, an apple cider vinegar rinse will get rid of any deposits left behind. Some people find it difficult or painful to massage a bar on their heads. For the most part, this strangeness fades away fast. Or simply lather the soap in your hands before applying it to your hair. How to use solid shampoo? Begin by wetting your hair and then roll the bar a few times in your palms to build up a little lather. Work it into your hair with your hands or apply the bar directly to the hair by swiping it across your hair strands. Work the lather in to give your hair a good wash. Then thoroughly rinse to prevent any residue build-up. How to store a solid shampoo bar? Allowing a solid hair shampoo bar to sit in a pool of water for an extended amount of time may soften and corrode it, shortening its lifespan. Therefore it is best to have your shampoo bar to air dry on a soap dish. To avoid contact with water when you’re not using it, the best soap dishes self-drain or slightly elevate the bar from the dish's surface. Using a draining soap dish will allow your bar to dry completely, even if it becomes a little soft. What to expect during the adjustment period? Everyone's transition from liquid shampoo to shampoo bars is unique. Some people will barely feel the difference, while others will find it difficult to adjust. So, knowing how to use a solid shampoo bar and what to expect will make the transition better to manage. You probably have some chemical residue in your hair if you've used commercial shampoos and conditioners for a long time. This is due to the presence of detergents and silicones in commercial hair products. It takes some time to remove these leftovers from your hair. Your scalp is recalibrating its natural oil production at the same time when changing hair care products. Your hair may feel heavy, greasy, and/or lifeless during this transition, and remember that it may take some time to experiment with finding the right shampoo bar. Expect Great Results after the Adjustment Period Chemicals in liquid shampoos are harsh and detergents, preservatives, and other chemical ingredients in commercial shampoos can stress your hair and scalp, causing or exacerbating issues like dryness, irritation, and peeling. Good solid bars of shampoo are made of natural components, so they won't accumulate any residue. Using a shampoo bar over time will assist your scalp in better regulating its oil production and achieving a natural balance. The advantages of shampoo bars are that they are suitable for most hair types and work on restoring your scalp to a healthier state, reducing dandruff, and enhancing hair growth while promoting natural conditioning. The added benefit is that shampoo bars use limited packaging and thus decrease the amount of plastic waste created that is harmful to the environment."
13,Waiting to see the Doctor,health-fitness," I woke up one morning with a pain that ran from my left little and ring fingers and crawled up the sides of my forearm to my elbow. Thinking about it, I blamed my big head for injuring my nerves, as I have the habit of placing my forearm under my head while sleeping. When the pain did not subside, I forced myself to think about my activities over the past few days. Could I have injured a nerve while spending an entire day at the Mohegan Sun Casino? Or maybe while watching my favorite 007 James Bond movie, I could have crushed a nerve that hooks around the elbow joint without realizing it. Other than that, nothing else I did was out of the ordinary to have caused a bruised nerve. Though the pain was not debilitating, its mere presence, like a crawling spider, was annoying, as was the tormenting needles and pinpricks sensation. Two weeks later, when the pain refused to disappear, I began to treat it with the medical scrutiny it deserved. First, it occurred to me that to make the proper diagnosis, I would have to stop acting like a patient and put on my professional persona. With my professionalism engaged, I reasoned that what ached me could be part of a diagnostic basket containing shades of pinched nerves, from mild to severe. Was I sure? Not by any stretch of my imagination. Then, I began to examine the origins of my doubts in self-diagnosis. Is it because I know too much or too little? For instance, the pins and needles sensation could be a sign of vitamin deficiencies, especially vitamin B deficiencies. My narrow food preferences—primarily beans, fish, and peanuts—supported that suspicion. Broccoli used to be a part of my diet, but not anymore. In my professional opinion, however, vitamin deficiencies did not seem to be the origins of my woes. After all, had it been vitamin deficiencies, the pains would have been felt in other parts of my body, too, and not just my ring and pinky fingers. Setting aside that knowledge, I decided to start taking vitamins B12 and B6. Not entirely surprising, none of that vitamin stuff relieved my symptoms. A simple blood test, which I didn't even bother ordering, would have revealed whether lack of vitamins contributed to my ailment. Why would I do to myself what I wouldn't do to my patients? That is, I wouldn't have started any patients on vitamin supplements to cure such ailments without first obtaining a blood test to determine deficiency. Yet, I was treating myself blindly, tossing all medical logic out of the window. Since I proved incapable of being objective, I decided to seek help from a neurologist. I targeted the office of a medical building with a neurologist signpost. Upon entry, two older women were in an open room behind a glass window screen. Both looked up as I approached. The woman directly behind the window attended to me, while the other glimpsed around but continued to attend to the printer machine. No doubt, she was eavesdropping on the ensued dialogue. “How can I help you?” the receptionist asked. “I need to see a neurologist. I have this sharp pain that shoots from my fourth and fifth finger to my elbow, and I would like to see the neurologist,” I replied. After shaking her head sideways a few times, she asked me about my insurance, and I told her I had Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield. “Card please,” demanded the receptionist as she retrieved and opened her appointment notebook. Of course, I brought the wrong card for which I was reprimanded, but she still tried to schedule me to see the neurologist. Flipping the pages of the appointment book back and forth, the receptionist firmly announced, ""I do not have an appointment available until the end of November 2021,” which was 45 days out. “The doctor wouldn't see you for 45 days,” she emphasized. Standing next to the window, I thought, what would happen in 45 days? If I suffer from a precarious condition that needs urgent diagnosis, 45 days seemed too long to wait with no precise diagnosis. I wanted to ask the receptionist, “Shouldn't you at least run my symptoms by the neurologist to decide whether it is safe for me to be seen in 45 days, right now, or within a week?” But instead, I was frozen from thinking about what the long wait could mean to my health. Then, a middle-aged man dressed in a white coat with the prongs of a green-colored stethoscope clasping his neck came into view behind the women. Most likely, he had overhead my symptoms, and as physicians do, emerged from seclusion to assess whether I was about to die. He did not look like someone overwhelmed with clinical work. So, what did he do now that he was out in the open after seeing my face and hearing my complaint made in the most solemn voice possible? I had hoped for him to intervene and overrule the elderly receptionist. But he seemed to be tiptoeing around them like many medical practitioners nowadays. His mouth opened but shut rapidly when the receptionist stared him down. ""Guts, doctor, have some guts,” I thought to myself. “Talk to me and relieve my fears or intervene to get me on the schedule quickly."" None of my wishes came through, however, and the neurologist escaped. This encounter reaffirmed my belief about how physicians are quickly losing control of patient care. Since healthcare delivery steps in many parts of the world have become hyper-partitioned, clinicians frequently miss what is coming down the scheduling pike. Thus, inexperienced front desk receptionists or other ""gatekeepers"" in the healthcare delivery system could jeopardize patients' lives and wreak havoc on patient experiences and timely care delivery. Needless to say, I located another practice and neurologist who was eager and willing to help troubleshoot the cause of my pins and needles sensation. My condition said the new neurologist is probably an Ulnar nerve entrapment (cubital tunnel syndrome)."
14,Excellent Reasons For Joining a Pilates Class,health-fitness," What is Pilates? You may have heard people talking about Pilates as it is a popular type of exercise for a very good reason. If you have never tried it before you probably have the idea that it is similar to yoga. It does have similarities to yoga and some stretches and exercises are similar.  However, yoga was first practiced thousands of years ago in India, and Pilates was invented by a German named Joseph Pilates around 1910-1920. Probably due to ill-health as a youngster and then working with World War 1 veterans, Joseph spent his life trying to improve both his health and body condition and those with war injuries and amputations. During his youth, he tried gymnastics, boxing, yoga, and martial arts to become physically stronger and healthier. Later in life, he met his wife who was a dancer, and used his health and fitness knowledge to help dancers with body conditioning and rehabilitation from injury. The exercise and processes he developed have become known as the ‘Pilates Method’. Pilates classes can now be found worldwide but aren’t just for people with injuries.  All adults benefit from doing Pilates exercises to keep their bodies flexible, strong, and injury-free. Fundamentals of the Pilates Method The 8 fundamental principles of Pilates are relaxation, alignment, centring, breathing, flowing movements, concentration, stamina, and coordination. Benefits of Pilates There are many common ailments that by taking a regular Pilates class can either reduce the pain, relieve the pain, or even cure you completely. These ailments include back pain, neck pain, headaches including migraine, knee pain, sciatica, repetitive sprains, and many more. Basically, if you are a person that sits at a desk all day, does a job with very repetitive movement, or someone who takes part in a lot of sport, then Pilates will help reduce body stresses and strains caused by these actions or inactions.

15,Emotions during fertility treatment,health-fitness," During a fertility treatment there are emotions, lots of emotions. There is hope, because you are creating possibilities, but you also experience anxiety, fear, sadness and so many more. These emotions are a normal part of what you go through during treatment. They are not odd, strange or harmful. They are normal negative emotions. They feel unpleasant, but these feelings correspond to the situation you’re in and they help you deal with everything that’s going on. Suppressing these feelings is counter-productive; expressing them will give you relief and give you space and energy to continue. But we also have abnormal negative emotions. These emotions are often overwhelmingly negative/destructive ones, which are not easy to let go of. They are often associated with physical problems, they sap your energy, are experienced as disruptive to your life, and result in self-harm or dysfunctional behavior. These emotions have a negative effect on your body and mind and need to be addressed. If you are experiencing these feelings ask for immediate professional help. Recognizing feelings It’s important to be able to recognize for yourself which feelings are the effective negative emotions, and which are the ineffective negative.  With effective negative emotions, just feel them and experience them. Talking about them is very important. Suppressing these feelings is like trying to hold a balloon under water. It takes a toll on your energy, and when you finally get tired and let it go, the balloon pops up again with a bang. Relaxation Besides learning to talk about your feelings, and finding someone who really wants to listen and talking to them, it’s also important that you undertake action where you can learn to relax. If you love running, do it. Does your heart prefer yoga, make the time for yoga exercises, do you love reading, or watching a good movie, go for it, just do what relaxes you. Learning to relax is not a guarantee that your fertility treatment will definitely work. But the effect is that you can continue your treatment in a more positive state of mind. Taking the time to relax in times of stress will give you more mental flexibility. And that is so important. Mental coaching When people come to me for their first coaching consultation and are under the impression that I have a magic wand that will take away all their anxiety around their fertility treatment, then I say to them: If you are under the impression that consulting me will help you happily breeze through your treatment, you are not at the right address.  Going through this treatment will inevitably cause you great anxiety. But I can teach you the right mindset:  to accept that it’s exciting but also fraught with anxiety and stress, but, that it is also full of possibilities, that is the best mindset you should hold onto and with which you should enter this treatment program if you want to persevere to the end. It won’t help you to say to yourself all day long: It’s not going to work, it’s going to fail, just to protect yourself from possible disappointment. You also don’t have to be a positive guru, screaming: I know for sure this is going to work. Create and hold onto the mindset: I’m creating more possibilities for success for myself. And that is certainly the truth. You are not fooling yourself in any way. Go to my website to read more about how I can help you to go through your fertility treatment in the best possible way."

18,Answering FAQ’s About Plastic Surgery,health-fitness," When it comes to plastic surgery, there are many assumptions people have even if they have no personal experience with the matter. Along with these assumptions comes a wide array of questions. Continue reading to discover the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions regarding plastic surgery. What is the Difference Between Cosmetic and Reconstructive Surgery? It is important to note that there are two different types of plastic surgery: cosmetic and reconstructive. Cosmetic surgery may be that which you are more familiar with, as many celebrities have undergone this surgery for the purpose of boosting their self-esteem or wanting to change a part of their appearance for personal reasons. This is typically not covered by insurance since it is elective surgery. Reconstructive surgery, on the other hand, is performed on abnormal parts of the body that one has either been born with or derived from trauma or disease. For example, a young adult may decide to get a breast reduction if they have been dealing with severe back pain as a direct correlation. Due to the need for most of these surgeries, insurance will usually offer some coverage. Is Plastic Surgery Safe? As with any surgery, there are potential risks involved with plastic surgery, but these are few and far between. There are many plastic surgeries that take place every year without any sort of complication. Risks may differ depending on your health background, but these will all have been discussed prior to undergoing the procedure. Due to the nature of the surgery, patients can rest assured that their surgeon is following strict safety standards and other regulations. What Does Plastic Surgery Recovery Look Like? Recovery may look different depending on the severity of your surgery and your health history. Minor procedures will likely allow you to return to normal activities after a few days or weeks of rest. However, more intensive procedures may require physical therapy and can take months to recover fully. Your surgeon will converse with you to determine the best recovery plan for your specific situation and needs. How Long Do Results Last? Many individuals undergo plastic surgery in hopes that it will forever change their appearance or even keep them from aging. While plastic surgery does bring about the results a patient is looking for, they must also recognize that aging is a natural process. If you want to ward off aging as much as possible, you may have to undergo additional surgeries in the eventual future. Other procedures like liposuction will depend upon the patient to keep the weight off."
19,Dietary Tips on Reduced Sperm Count Caused by Chronic Prostatitis,health-fitness," The symptoms of chronic prostatitis are very similar to those of chronic prostatitis. They are usually mild at first, and the pain increases over time. It may be accompanied by fever or chills. If chronic prostatitis is not treated for a long time, it may affect the semen's quality, cause reduced sperm count, and even infertility. Why does reduced sperm affect fertility? Generally speaking, the survival rate and quality of sperm play an essential role in the success of pregnancy preparation. A lot of men after ejaculation did not care whether there is abnormal semen, which is very easy to lead to pregnancy. Once the amount of semen ejaculated by a man is less than two milliliters, it is considered that semen is too little. If you want to have sperm to combine with the egg smoothly, the probability is correspondingly much less. The success of pregnancy preparation is not so easy to achieve. Besides, the number of sperm is small. In addition to being affected by food, there are also some congenital diseases, such as congenital hypogenesis of seminal vesicle, small ejaculatory duct and so on. These congenital problems need to be treated by medical treatment, and if they are killed by food, some methods can be taken. What should spermicidal food be avoided in life? If you want to avoid eating some spermicidal food and lead to less sperm, you need to know which foods have a spermicidal effect and try to avoid eating them in your daily diet. Like pregnant women, coffee is also a drink that pregnant men can't touch. Although coffee has a strong refreshing effect, it also has a strong spermicidal effect. Therefore, men preparing for pregnancy must avoid drinking some caffeinated drinks and foods. According to a study by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, if men eat a lot of soy products, men are likely to reduce the number of sperm. Soybean products mainly reduce the number of sperm in men through the decline of male renal function, and then affect the hormone in men, provided that men eat a lot of soybean products. For men, drinking is the biggest harm that will lead to low androgen levels, and then make abnormal liver function. And finally, it will make men accumulate too much estrogen. Once there is too much estrogen, it will make the sperm in combination with the egg has been a premature release of body enzymes, so once the egg met, the sperm has lost vitality. Summer is the best season for barbecue, but men must avoid it because barbecue food contains a lot of acrylamide, which will not only cause cancer but also cause men to have less sperm or sperm motility. Although there are so many factors that affect the quantity and quality of sperm, there are also foods that can improve the quantity and quality of sperm. Zinc containing food can help men solve the problem of less sperm, and this kind of food mainly includes beans, seafood products, animal organs, among which sea fish, yam, peanut and other effects are better. Magnesium food can enhance the vitality of men's sperm and help regulate the heart and lower blood pressure. It is a rare kind of food. Magnesium containing foods mainly include potatoes, oats, macaroni and so on. In addition to diet management, the reduced sperm count caused by chronic prostatitis also requires drug treatment. To solve the problem, treat chronic prostatitis is necessary. There are many kinds of drugs to treat chronic prostatitis, such as antibiotics, α - receptor blockers, herbal medicine Diuretic and Anti-inflammatory Pill, etc.. At the same time, drink more water, avoid spicy and irritating food, avoid sitting, riding, or driving for a long time, and avoid excessive masturbation."

Eating too much and exercising too little can cause tummy fat Including being overweight. Also, while fat increases, your lean muscle mass can decrease slightly with age. Losing muscle mass also slows down the body's ability to burn calories, which can make it difficult to maintain a healthy weight. Females above 50 find it difficult to reduce their belly fat as time goes by. Many women find that their tummy fat increases as they get older. This may be due to reduced levels of estrogen, which may affect the distribution of fat in the body.  There may also be a genetic component in the tendency to gain weight around the waist, gain weight, and take the shape of an ""apple"" instead of a ""pear"". Best Home Exercise to Reduce Belly Fat It's important to combine aerobic exercise with weight training. Aerobic exercise can consist of exercises such as walking, swimming, cycling, and running, and should include high-intensity, low-intensity bursts. Weight training is about doing things that aren't easy. If you feel you are not stretching, step up again. This keeps your muscles strong and unleashes your metabolism. These are certain best exercises for weight loss for women over 50. There are basically two types of exercises, but there are many ways to do and incorporate them. In your life. Researchers agree that tummy fat, especially so-called visceral fat, is harmful to health. This fat in the abdomen can cause health problems such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, dementia, and stroke. Moreover, it is an indicator of premature death. Aerobic Exercises The benefits of aerobic exercise for women over the age of 50 who want to lose their tummy are: In front of me, I was sweating, my face was red, and I swelled violently, and  I hated it every minute. This type of aerobic exercise puts a lot of stress on your body, but it's not ideal for people over the age of 50. Don't expect to sweat and pant after working hard for an hour. Aerobic exercise is as easy as walking actively 5-6 days a week. Even better,  you can include one or two hills. It is recommended to do at least 30 minutes, preferably 40 minutes. In reality, aerobic exercise increases your heart rate even a little. Other suggestions are Cycling, Swimming, Dance, Golf, Gardening, Yoga, Pilates, and Weight Training.

1,Strength training for beginners,health-fitness," Best Method for Strength Training for a  Workout Beginner “The best workout program is the one you’re not using.” is a motto in which there is some wisdom, even though the design of a workout program is not very simple. There are many early studies regarding weight training that have attempted to find out the best single program for set/rep training. ""There can only be one"" is what is said in the Highlander series. One example is Arnold Schwarzenegger's 5x5 method that was has made popular by his mentor Reg Park, who was himself a Mr, Universe, and played the role of Hercules in the movies. Reg Park was the first bodybuilder who was able to bench press 500 pounds, and was as strong as he appeared to be. In 1981, Mike Stone and his other colleagues published a study that  suggested that it is best to combine protocols instead of concentrating on one protocol for strength training. In this study, ""A Hypothetical Model for Strength Training"", there was a transition in the workouts from low intensity/high reps with fewer sets or high volume to high intensity/low reps and more sets or low volume. This was based on on a model that was published in 1954 by Leonid Matveyev, a Russian sports scientist, as a popular periodization model. The end aim of this was to be able, at the end of a cycle of one repetition, to lift the maximum weights for 1RM (1 repetition maximum). This program has four phases, and each phase lasts for three to four weeks. Hypertrophy:  3-5 reps with 6-12 sets at 67-85% of 1RM Basic Strength: 3-5 reps with 6 sets at 85% of 1RM Strength and Power: 3-5 reps with 1-5 sets at 75-90% of 1RM Peaking or Maintenance: 1-3 reps with 1-3 sets that progress from high intensity to a very low intensity Another system of program design that is popular with strength coaches in colleges, non-linear periodization, has a focus on a variety in training. Compared to the Stone model of changing that changes set/rep protocols after every few weeks, this program varies them with each workout. There is a book on this topic written by Steve Fleck and William Kraemer, ""Optimizing Strength Training"" and  which introduces a workout for 16 weeks with a rotation of repetitions: Monday: 12-15 repetitions Wednesday: 8-10 repetitions Friday: 4-6 repetitions Monday: 1-3 repetitions Wednesday: 3 repetitions or fewer Friday: 12-15 repetitions I am in agreement with the necessity of changing repetition protocols, especially with athletes who are advanced. I follow a general guideline that has me changing the volume/intensity  of workouts every fortnight. However, from a physiological view this is a program that does not make sense, as it does not allow the body enough time to understand what it has to adapt to. To explain this, understand that, as an example,  when you perform 12-15 sets, it puts the focus on ""slow twitch"" muscles and muscle fibers of Type I, and sets of 1-5 would help in the development of ""fast twitch"" muscle fibers of type II. It is not possible for for Type I fibers to convert to Type II fibers, and as a result, football linemen or discus throwers who are strength/power athletes, would not find any value in this workout. It is a fact that Type II fibers will assume the characteristics of Type I fibers after aerobic training. All this will tell you that the design of a program for periodization is a complex subject , but there is no need for you to be left hanging. If you are a beginner, the one program that can be quite effective and useful is the 10/8/6 Training system. This is a system that is more than a century old, but the earliest reference that I got for this was from one of my colleagues, who told me that it was in 1972 that he was introduced to it, when he was a member of a Fremont, California club known as Bob's Athletic Club. The owner of this gym was Bob Perata, and the gym was named after him. Both the book cover and movie poster of ""Pumping Iron"" featured Ed Corney for whom Bob's Athletic Club was a home gym. Ed Corney is also one of the great posers for bodybuilding. In 1975, Franco Columbu had to run for his money in that year's Mr. Olympia in the lightweight division when he had to compete with Ed Corney. To add to that, Corney was made the poster boy for ""Pumping Iron"", a movie that featured the preparation of Arnold for the 1975 Mr. Olympia. A book by the same name, written by Charles Gaines and George Butler, also had Corney appearing on its cover. Beginners can get motivated by the 10/8/6 program as it has fewer reps on the 2nd and 3rd sets ,so that you can use heavier weights, which can then give the illusion that the workout has made you stronger, even if the previous sets have caused fatigue. The recovery ability of beginners is slow and this makes the three sets performed as more than plenty. The progress of trainees in Bob's club led them to use another program for some time, but they can then come back to this program. When there was an improvement in their recovery ability and they became stronger they could add another set and go in for permutations like 12/10/8/6 that focuses on muscle packing, and 10/8/6/4 for any additional strength requirements. The 10/8/6 system is not considered appropriate for all kinds of exercises. Olympic lifts, snatch and clean and jerk are too technical for these reps to be used. If you still did this, the light weights used would have little effect for strength training. In 1982, a system was introduced by Vince Gorin that made use of  a 10/8/6/15 protocol. In this, use was made of progressively heavier weights for 8 to 6 reps and this was finished with a 15 rep set with a light ""pump"". If this is converted into percentages,its workout progress would be: 10 repetitions at 50% of maximum weight can  be used for 6 reps 8 repetitions at 75% of 6RM 6 repetitions  at 100% of 6RM 15 repetitions at 35% of 6RM An individual who can press 100 pounds for 6 reps would rest 60 seconds between sets. He would do: 10 reps  with 50 pounds 8 reps  with 75 pounds 6 reps with 100 pounds 15 reps with 35 pounds I believe this repetition is too large for the optimum gain in strength as the body does not what it has to adapt to, but Gironda's system is time tested. It suits those who want to leave the gym quickly while leaving with a massive pump. If you want details about this workout program, read the book ""2nd Workout Bulletin: 10-3-6-15"" written by Gironda. To get the most from your strength training become a student of the Iron Game so that you can determine the best training system that can allow you to achieve your goals. Start with the 10/8/6 workout system, if you are a beginner."
2,How to find a quality CBD product In 2022 ?,health-fitness," Although CBD products are readily available almost everywhere these days, it’s important to keep in mind these products are not all created equal. The FDA hasn’t approved any over-the-counter CBD products yet, so it’s very important to look carefully at what you’re buying and where you’re purchasing from before you add to cart. Start by only shopping from reputable brands that are transparent about where they grow their hemp and how they make their products. This means combing through company websites, not purchasing through online marketplaces. Also, stay away from Amazon. Amazon doesn’t allow the sales of CBD products through its site, so any products you find listed there are likely fake. It’s also a good idea to see if the CBD brand you’re considering has any pending lawsuits or has received warning letters from the FDA. This can help you figure out whether the brand has a solid reputation. Next, carefully look at the ingredients. Check for anything you may be allergic to. You can also see which products come with beneficial added ingredients. Finally, it’s crucial to see the testing your product has undergone. The safest CBD products come with up-to-date, comprehensive COAs from a reputable third-party lab. The COA will show you how much CBD and THC the product contains. Plus, it’ll also verify whether the product has been tested for contaminants, like mold, pesticides, and heavy metals. How to use CBD As you can see from our list, CBD products come in many forms. Depending on the form, the dosing and other instructions will vary. Topicals, like balms, creams, and lotions, come in varying strengths. These are generally intended to be applied as you would a normal moisturizer — by massaging it gently into the area you’re treating, slowly adding more, as needed. CBD oils and tinctures are relatively easy to use too, although they can be a bit messy to measure, especially if you’re on the go. They can be added to food or drinks, or you can place them under your tongue (many come with a dropper for measuring) and hold them there for up to 1 minute before swallowing. CBD gummies, pills, and capsules, on the other hand, are easier to dose, store, and use while traveling. You take these as you would any non-CBD gummy or pill. Finding the right dosage for you generally depends on factors, like your body weight, the concentration of the CBD you’re taking, your experience with CBD, and the condition you’re treating. If you’re just starting out with CBD, it’s a good idea to begin with the lowest possible dose and see how your body responds. From here, you can up the dosage if you feel it’s necessary. CBD safety and side effects The World Health OrganizationTrusted Source reported that CBD is largely thought to be safe. However, some people may experience side effects, including: fatigue diarrhea changes in appetite changes in weight It’s best to talk with your doctor before trying CBD, especially if you’re taking any medications. CBD may interact with some medications. Topical CBD products are unlikely to cause any of the side effects mentioned above, but it’s important to check the ingredients first to make sure you don’t have any allergies to them. Performing a patch test is a safe way to make sure you don’t have any allergic reactions before applying the product to larger parts of your skin. Performing a patch test is simple. Just place a small amount of the topical product on the inside of your wrist. Wait 24 hours to see how your skin reacts. If you notice any signs of irritation, such as redness or itchiness, stop using the product. Remember to keep topicals away from broken skin. https://www.figibrands.com/"
3,Do You Need Motivation To Get Fitter and Healthier? An Online Fitness Programme May Be The Answer,health-fitness," During COVID-19 lockdowns, many of us turned to online fitness classes.  Some people followed celebrities on YouTube, others signed up to companies that offered a range of online classes, and others logged onto Zoom classes that their local gym teachers were running. There were lots of choices available for the few months spent at home during lockdown. When the COVID-19 restrictions lifted, most people then returned to their local gyms or outdoor classes as they were keen to see other people again and get back to some normality. How has your fitness progressed since then? Has everyday life got in the way of training?  Are you skipping classes when you are tired after a day’s work in an office? Are you needing motivated again? At fitandhappy, we have continued offering our clients online personal training and online classes.  They have proved to be popular for many reasons. Some clients found they just preferred training at home, others are still nervous about catching COVID-19, and a few like a mix of outdoor classes and online classes. Types of Online Fitness Classes Online classes vary from you following a recorded class to a fully interactive class using a video conference application like Zoom. With a recorded class, you can take part at whatever time you want but no one will know if you work hard, skip part of the class, or do the exercises correctly. If you are new to exercise there is a chance that you could hurt yourself by not following the instructions properly. An interactive class will cost more but the instructor will provide you with individual feedback and encouragement and will motivate you to keep going. They will also ensure that you are doing the exercises correctly without damaging your back or straining muscles. Benefits of Online Training The main benefit of online training is that you can work out at home. If you choose a pre-recorded class, you can work out at any time that suits you whether that is at 6am when you get up or at 10pm when your children have gone to bed. Many people who are carers find online training suits them best.  It means they can do a workout but if needed by the person or child who they are caring for, they can just leave the class and be of assistance immediately. People who have never attended a fitness class before often find that it is easier to start getting fit by being in the comfort of their own home.  They might feel they are too unfit or overweight and want to gain some confidence before joining a class in a gym. Fitandhappy online training for women At fitandhappy in Edinburgh, we offer both pre-recorded classes and an online personal training programme. We want our clients to be able to get fitter, healthier and happier no matter what their circumstances. Our online personal training programme is about more than just personal training sessions.  To ensure you do get fitter and have more confidence and energy to live your life, we also include nutrition advice, sleep and stress management, access to live classes, good habit tracking, and results tracking. With so much interaction from our expert personal trainers and coaches, you won’t want to miss your personal training sessions or classes. And remember, whether you choose to go to a gym, take part in an outdoor boot camp or try online fitness classes, they will all help you get fitter and healthier.  The endorphins released during exercise will make you feel good and improve your mental health too."
4,Preventing Burnout in the Healthcare Profession,health-fitness," Burnout is a point of exhaustion felt by many professionals during their careers, especially those in the healthcare industry. By spotting this early on, you can help avoid some of the negative effects of burnout and the toll it takes on your mental and physical health. However, many do not know the signs to look for, as they were not taught just how common burnout is in one’s career. What Are the Signs of Burnout? In order to be able to prevent burnout in the healthcare profession, it is first important to be able to recognize it for what it is. Burnout can be especially difficult to spot for those who already suffer from general anxiety or stress, which is why it is crucial to pay attention to your wellbeing. When one is growing close to burnout, they will often begin suffering from chronic fatigue that lasts for weeks, a pessimistic attitude, irritability, a decreased work performance and other factors. In the healthcare profession specifically, some signs of burnout may also look like resenting your clients, being late to appointments and more. How Can Healthcare Professionals Prevent Burnout? Given the negative effects that burnout can have on one’s well being and their regular job duties, it is imperative that healthcare professionals do all they can to prevent burnout. One proven way to do this is by surrounding yourself with a support system. Many healthcare professionals end up suffering from anxiety and other negative emotions because they are not prepared to deal with some of the situations they see on a daily basis. This is why it is important to make connections with individuals who understand your emotions and can encourage you. Some even prevent burnout by going to regular therapy, which can teach you how to deal with your stressors and prevent this negative mindset. Another way to prevent burnout is by taking care of your physical health. It might seem impossible to do when you’re working a busy schedule and picking up shifts, but even taking 20 to 30 minutes to take a fast-paced walk during the day can boost your emotional state and give your body the activity it needs. Preparing healthy meals for yourself and trying to develop somewhat of a healthy sleep routine will also help you prevent some of burnout’s worst effects. In addition to these efforts, it is also important that you learn when to say no. With staffing shortages in an essential industry like healthcare, it can seem extremely selfish and even impossible to say no picking up additional shifts. But if you are constantly overworked, you’ll find it difficult to perform at your best during the shifts you were originally scheduled for. It is honorable to want to help others out, but make sure you also know when to decline shifts when you feel the signs of burnout creeping in."
5,Importance of Physical Therapy for Knee Osteoarthritis,health-fitness," Knee osteoarthritis can feel like a double-edged sword. Overuse of the knees can aggravate joint health and lead to knee osteoarthritis, but the less you use them, the weaker they become. Knee osteoarthritis causes the muscles surrounding the knee to weaken, and the knee joints to stiffen making mobility difficult. But osteoarthritis physical therapy can assist in finding the right combination of activity to keep your knee joints strong and healthy. What is Osteoarthritis of Knee? Arthritis is a painful ailment, which affects the joints. There are many different forms of arthritis and it can impact other bodily tissues that are close to the joints such as the muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Some types of arthritis can also cause symptoms throughout the body. Osteoarthritis is a common form of arthritis in the knee. It is diagnosed through a clinical examination and verified with X-rays and blood tests. It is a degenerative, wear-and-tear type of arthritis that most commonly affects people who are older than 50 years, but it can sometimes occur in younger people. Over time, the knee joint cartilage eventually wears away. This causes the cartilage to get ragged and harsh, and the protecting area between the bones shrinks. This can cause painful bone spurs due to bone pressing on bone. Osteoarthritis typically develops over time, and the pain it causes intensifies. Other factors, in addition to the natural, unavoidable ageing of the knee joints, can make you more prone to pain. Knee difficulties can be caused or exacerbated by osteoarthritis, injuries, extra body weight, and a lack of muscular strength and flexibility. This is why knee osteoarthritis physical therapy is highly recommended to alleviate symptoms and improve mobility. How does it feel? An arthritis-affected knee joint can be uncomfortable and inflammatory. The discomfort usually comes on gradually over time, but it can also come on suddenly. Other signs and symptoms include: The knee joint may become stiff and swollen, making bending and straightening difficult. Morning pain and swelling may be severe, as well as after sitting or relaxing. Pain may worsen if you engage in strenuous exercise. The smooth motion of joints might be hampered by loose cartilage and other tissue debris. During movement, the knee may seize, and it can cause grinding sounds. A feeling of weakness or buckling in the knee may be caused by pain. Because the knee is a weight-bearing joint, your level of activity, as well as the type and duration of your activities, has a direct effect on your symptoms. Weight-bearing activity, such as walking while carrying a large object, may exacerbate symptoms. How to Take Care of Your Knees to Prevent Osteoarthritis? Injury to the knee can result in mild, recurring, or chronic pain, depending on whether it was caused by a previous accident or repetitive stress from kneeling, running, or other activities. If the damage is not addressed, it might progress to osteoarthritis. Extra stress on weight-bearing joints, such as the knees, increases the risk of knee pain. Excess body weight not only hastens joint degradation, but it also raises your risk of developing osteoarthritis. Muscles that are weak or inflexible exert undue strain on the joints. Your knees are more likely to be injured if you don't have the muscular strength and flexibility to securely support your complete range of motion. Physical therapy can help with knee osteoarthritis pain, edema, and stiffness, as well as improving knee joint function. It can also make walking, kneeling, bending, and sitting less painful. Physical therapy aims to improve function in people with knee osteoarthritis and may delay or prevent surgery. How to prevent osteoarthritis of knee There are measures you can take to protect the health of your knees by following certain lifestyle behaviors. Muscles in your upper and lower legs should be strengthened. Exercises that target your hamstrings, quadriceps, gluteus muscles, hip flexors, and psoas are a good place to start. To support your full range of motion, stretch those same leg muscles. Yoga can be incorporated into your stretching practice. Maintain a healthy weight. Extra pounds put a lot of strain on the knees. Even a 10-pound weight drop can have a significant impact. To protect the cartilage in your knees, use low-impact workouts. If you have a swelling knee, see a doctor straight away. It could be a sign of cartilage injury. When playing sports like basketball or football that demand you to start, halt, or pivot quickly, be cautious. Every day physical activity can help you avoid stiffness and muscle atrophy, as well as safeguard your knees from injury in the future. Change up your workout routine. Repetitive stress on your knees can raise your chances of developing a condition. Having high blood sugar levels. Why Therapy for Osteoarthritis of the Knee is so important The main focus of getting treatment is to promote self-management, minimize pain while optimizing function, and slowing the disease and its effects. The first type of treatment is physical therapy that involves exercise therapy, modifying activity, weight-loss advice, and issuing a knee brace. A physical therapist will design a treatment plan that is tailored to your specific condition and goals. Physical therapists are educated in how to prescribe exercises to those who are injured or in pain. Because knee osteoarthritis is a degenerative illness, it's critical to devise a strategy for getting adequate exercise to address the problem while avoiding undue stress on the knee joint. Activity is recommended and monitored according to the frequency, duration, and intensity of your condition, with enough rest and recovery time. Patients with knee osteoarthritis who walk more steps per day are less likely to have functional issues in the future. Therapy for osteoarthritis knee also includes hands-on techniques by physical therapists who apply gentle movements to increase the mobility, flexibility, and strength of your muscles and joints. These methods help treat areas that are hard for patients to reach on their own. Adding physical therapy techniques to exercise routines has been demonstrated to reduce pain and improve function."
6,The Covid-19 Vaccine and Chronic Spontaneous urticaria. Is it the immune system overreacting?,health-fitness," The Covid-19 Vaccine and Chronic Spontaneous urticaria. Is it the immune system overreacting? Disclaimer: I’m not a doctor or medical professional, I’m just doing my own research since there isn’t that much. All this information is what was on the websites I found and it’s not my work I’m just compiling it.The parts I found the most interesting are highlighted in red. And the sources will be listed below. I split it into six sections. What is a vaccine? How does your immune system work? What is chronic spontaneous urticaria? Things to think about. My personal experience with it. Sources used Hopefully this helps someone. Section 1: What is a vaccine? Vaccines are biological solutions that give a person immunity against spreadable diseases, such as the flu or coronavirus. Vaccines are used to prevent the spread of communicable, or infectious, diseases in a population. Since a virus can’t survive without a host, and vaccination prevents people from hosting the virus, the virus will eventually die out if enough people are vaccinated. What does it do to the immune system? A pathogen is a bacterium, virus, parasite or fungus that can cause disease within the body. Each pathogen is made up of several subparts, usually unique to that specific pathogen and the disease it causes. The subpart of a pathogen that causes the formation of antibodies is called an antigen. The antibodies produced in response to the pathogen’s antigen are an important part of the immune system. You can consider antibodies as the soldiers in your body’s defense system. Each antibody, or soldier, in our system is trained to recognize one specific antigen. We have thousands of different antibodies in our bodies. When the human body is exposed to an antigen for the first time, it takes time for the immune system to respond and produce antibodies specific to that antigen. In the meantime, the person is susceptible to becoming ill. Once the antigen-specific antibodies are produced, they work with the rest of the immune system to destroy the pathogen and stop the disease. Antibodies to one pathogen generally don’t protect against another pathogen except when two pathogens are very similar to each other. Once the body produces antibodies in its primary response to an antigen, it also creates antibody-producing memory cells, which remain alive even after the pathogen is defeated by the antibodies. If the body is exposed to the same pathogen more than once, the antibody response is much faster and more effective than the first time around because the memory cells are at the ready to pump out antibodies against that antigen. This means that if the person is exposed to the dangerous pathogen in the future, their immune system will be able to respond immediately, protecting against disease. How are vaccines tested for safety? Regulation- At the end of the 19th century, several vaccines for humans had been developed. They were smallpox, rabies, plague, cholera, and typhoid vaccines. However, no regulation of vaccine production existed. On July 1, 1902, the U.S. Congress passed ""An act to regulate the sale of viruses, serums, toxins, and analogous products,"" later referred to as the Biologics Control Act (even though ""biologics"" appears nowhere in the law). This was the first modern federal legislation to control the quality of drugs. This act emerged in part as a response to 1901 contamination events in St. Louis and Camden involving smallpox vaccine and diphtheria antitoxin. The Act created the Hygienic Laboratory of the U.S. Public Health Service to oversee manufacture of biological drugs. The Hygienic Laboratory eventually became the National Institutes of Health. The Act established the government’s right to control the establishments where vaccines were made. What goes into testing and developing a vaccine? Exploratory Stage- This stage involves basic laboratory research and often lasts 2-4 years. Federally funded academic and governmental scientists identify natural or synthetic antigens that might help prevent or treat a disease. These antigens could include virus-like particles, weakened viruses or bacteria, weakened bacterial toxins, or other substances derived from pathogens. Pre- Clinical Studies- Pre-clinical studies use tissue-culture or cell-culture systems and animal testing to assess the safety of the candidate vaccine and its immunogenicity, or ability to provoke an immune response. Animal subjects may include mice and monkeys. These studies give researchers an idea of the cellular responses they might expect in humans. They may also suggest a safe starting dose for the next phase of research as well as a safe method of administering the vaccine. Researchers may adapt the candidate vaccine during the pre-clinical state to try to make it more effective. They may also do challenge studies with the animals, meaning that they vaccinate the animals and then try to infect them with the target pathogen. Many candidate vaccines never progress beyond this stage because they fail to produce the desired immune response. The pre-clinical stages often lasts 1-2 years and usually involves researchers in private industry. IND Application- A sponsor, usually a private company, submits an application for an Investigational New Drug (IND) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The sponsor describes the manufacturing and testing processes, summarizes the laboratory reports, and describes the proposed study. An institutional review board, representing an institution where the clinical trial will be conducted, must approve the clinical protocol. The FDA has 30 days to approve the application. Once the IND application has been approved, the vaccine is subject to three phases of testing. Phase 1 trials- The goals of Phase 1 testing are to assess the safety of the candidate vaccine and to determine the type and extent of immune response that the vaccine provokes. In a small minority of Phase 1 vaccine trials, researchers may use the challenge model, attempting to infect participants with the pathogen after the experimental group has been vaccinated. The participants in these studies are carefully monitored and conditions are carefully controlled. In some cases, an attenuated, or modified, version of the pathogen is used for the challenge. Phase 2 Trials- A larger group of several hundred individuals participates in Phase II testing. Some of the individuals may belong to groups at risk of acquiring the disease. These trials are randomized and well controlled, and include a placebo group. The goals of Phase II testing are to study the candidate vaccine’s safety, immunogenicity, proposed doses, schedule of immunizations, and method of delivery. Phase 3 Trials- Successful Phase II candidate vaccines move on to larger trials, involving thousands to tens of thousands of people. These Phase III tests are randomized and double blind and involve the experimental vaccine being tested against a placebo (the placebo may be a saline solution, a vaccine for another disease, or some other substance). One Phase III goal is to assess vaccine safety in a large group of people. Certain rare side effects might not surface in the smaller groups of subjects tested in earlier phases. For example, suppose that an adverse event related to a candidate vaccine might occur in 1 of every 10,000 people. To detect a significant difference for a low-frequency event, the trial would have to include 60,000 subjects, half of them in the control, or no vaccine, group (Plotkin SA et al. Vaccines, 5th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders, 2008). Vaccine efficacy is tested as well. These factors might include 1) Does the candidate vaccine prevent disease? 2) Does it prevent infection with the pathogen? 3) Does it lead to production of antibodies or other types of immune responses related to the pathogen? Approval of Licensure- After a successful Phase III trial, the vaccine developer will submit a Biologics License Application to the FDA. Then the FDA will inspect the factory where the vaccine will be made and approve the labeling of the vaccine. After licensure, the FDA will continue to monitor the production of the vaccine, including inspecting facilities and reviewing the manufacturer’s tests of lots of vaccines for potency, safety and purity. The FDA has the right to conduct its own testing of manufacturers’ vaccines. Phase 4 Trials- Phase IV trial are optional studies that drug companies may conduct after a vaccine is released. The manufacturer may continue to test the vaccine for safety, efficacy, and other potential uses. VAERS- The CDC and FDA established The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System in 1990. The goal of VAERS, according to the CDC, is “to detect possible signals of adverse events associated with vaccines.” (A signal in this case is evidence of a possible adverse event that emerges in the data collected.) About 30,000 events are reported each year to VAERS. Between 10% and 15% of these reports describe serious medical events that result in hospitalization, life-threatening illness, disability, or death. VAERS is a voluntary reporting system. Anyone, such as a parent, a health care provider, or friend of the patient, who suspects an association between a vaccination and an adverse event may report that event and information about it to VAERS. The CDC then investigates the event and tries to find out whether the adverse event was in fact caused by the vaccination. The CDC states that they monitor VAERS data to •	Detect new, unusual, or rare vaccine adverse events •	Monitor increases in known adverse events •	Identify potential patient risk factors for particular types of adverse events •	Identify vaccine lots with increased numbers or types of reported adverse events •	Assess the safety of newly licensed vaccines Not all adverse events reported to VAERS are in fact caused by a vaccination. The two occurrences may be related in time only. And it is probable that not all adverse events resulting from vaccination are reported to VAERS. The CDC states that many adverse events such as swelling at the injection site are underreported. Serious adverse events, according to the CDC, “are probably more likely to be reported than minor ones, especially when they occur soon after vaccination, even if they may be coincidental and related to other causes.” VAERS has successfully identified several rare adverse events related to vaccination. Among them are •	An intestinal problem after the first vaccine for rotavirus was introduced in 1999 •	Neurologic and gastrointestinal diseases related to yellow fever vaccine Additionally, according to Plotkin et al., VAERS identified a need for further investigation of MMR association with a blood clotting disorder, encephalopathy after MMR, and syncope after immunization (Plotkin SA et al. Vaccines, 5th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders, 2008). Vaccine Safety Datalink- The CDC established this system in 1990. The VSD is a collection of linked databases containing information from large medical groups. The linked databases allow officials to gather data about vaccination among the populations served by the medical groups. Researchers can access the data by proposing studies to the CDC and having them approved. The VSD has some drawbacks. For example, few completely unvaccinated children are listed in the database. The medical groups providing information to VSD may have patient populations that are not representative of large populations in general. Additionally, the data come not from randomized, controlled, blinded trials but from actual medical practice. Therefore, it may be difficult to control and evaluate the data. Rapid Cycle Analysis is a program of the VSD, launched in 2005. It monitors real-time data to compare rates of adverse events in recently vaccinated people with rates among unvaccinated people. The system is used mainly to monitor new vaccines. Among the new vaccines being monitored in Rapid Cycle Analysis are the conjugated meningococcal vaccine, rotavirus vaccine, MMRV vaccine, Tdap vaccine, and the HPV vaccine. Possible associations between adverse events and vaccination are then studied further. Section 2: How does your immune system work? What does your immune system do? The immune system is your body's natural defense system. It helps fight infections. Your immune system is made up of antibodies, white blood cells, lymph nodes and vessels, and other chemicals and proteins. The parts of the immune system work together to protect your body. They attack and destroy substances that are foreign to your body, such as bacteria and viruses. What is Immunity? Immunity is how well you are protected from a disease. You may be born with short-term protection from certain diseases. Or you may be protected after you get an infection or a vaccine. A vaccine helps your immune system make antibodies to fight a disease. Those antibodies will then fight the disease if you're exposed to it in the future. This helps keep you from getting sick. Or you may not get as sick. What problems can your immune system cause? Your immune system can cause: •	Allergic reactions and allergies. These happen when your immune system overreacts to something that usually doesn't harm you. For example: Pollen. When some people breathe in pollen, their immune system attacks it. This causes allergy symptoms such as hay fever. •	Medicine, chemicals, food, insect bites, or other things. An overreaction can range from mild to deadly. Autoimmune diseases. •	These diseases happen when your immune system acts like some of your own tissues are foreign substances. The body makes antibodies and other cells that attack and destroy your tissues. These diseases include lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Section 3: What is Chronic Spontaneous urticaria? What does chronic mean? Something that is continuing or occurring again and again for a long time, always present or encountered. What is chronic spontaneous urticaria? It can look and feel different for everyone, but all cases of CSU result in itchy hives that last for six weeks or longer. This can result in raised red bumps that may grow, spread, change, disappear and reappear on the skin. It is also sometimes referred to as chronic idiopathic urticaria, or CIU. Common factors in CSU- •	Chronic– lasts for six weeks or more •	Spontaneous– there is no explanation for what is triggering the hives •	Urticaria– this is the medical term for hives, pronounced which are itchy, red, raised bumps on the skin that turn white when they are pressed in the center CSU Causes- Unlike other types of hives, there is no known trigger of CSU. This makes it harder to diagnose and treat than other conditions, and it may take some time before you are diagnosed. If you think you might have CSU, speak with an allergist, who is trained to identify and diagnose the condition. Allergists diagnose CSU by ruling out other potential causes, such as an infection or allergic reaction. CSU Symptoms- Common symptoms of CSU include: •	Red, raised circles on the skin, called “wheals” •	Itching •	Hives that may get bigger, change, disappear and reappear or spread •	Hives that turn white, or “blanch,” when they are pressed in the center •	Wheals, or hives, that occur most days of the week and last for at least six weeks What CSU is not- CSU is not caused by allergies or an infection, and it is usually not life threatening. It also is not contagious, and it is not caused by a reaction to the sun, stress, hormones, foods or other medical conditions. While some people may identify things that seemingly make their CSU worse, what distinguishes CSU from other forms of hives is that there is no known trigger. People who have chronic hives often think the hives are caused by something they’ve done or interacted with. Many people will go through an “elimination diet,” meaning they take foods out of their diet and slowly add them back to see if they have a reaction. They may also try to change products like soaps and detergents. For people with CSU, these things won’t make their hives go away. CSU VS. Hives- Hives are common, and many people will experience them in their lifetime. They are caused by swelling of the skin when the body releases a chemical called histamine and other chemicals into the blood. Often, people with allergies get hives. Hives can also be caused by insect or animal bites, a reaction to medications, allergies to pollen or dander, a food allergy, extreme stress, infections or illnesses. Most cases of hives last for only a few hours or days. CSU, on the other hand, has no known trigger. Often, it’s diagnosed when other causes of hives are ruled out. The hives last for six weeks or longer and can last for several years. What’s the difference between a primary care doctor and a specialist? Primary care doctors may care for adults (internal medicine), children (pediatrics) or both (family medicine). They have a broad range of medical knowledge and can diagnose and treat many common conditions. They also can refer patients to other doctors who are experts in certain conditions or diseases. Specialists have additional years of training in a specific area of medicine, and they may offer specialized tests to diagnose illness. They also receive ongoing training in the latest medical research and treatments in their specialty. Allergists are specialists who care for patients with asthma and allergic conditions. How does it affect the body? Urticaria occurs when a trigger causes high levels of histamine and other chemical messengers to be released in the skin. These substances cause the blood vessels in the affected area of skin to open (often resulting in redness or pinkness) and become leaky. The rash is usually very itchy and ranges in size from a few millimeters to the size of a hand. Doctors may refer to urticaria as either: •	acute urticaria– if the rash clears completely within 6 weeks •	chronic urticaria –in rarer cases, where the rash persists or comes and goes for more than 6 weeks, often over many years A much rarer type of urticaria, known as urticaria vasculitis, can cause blood vessels inside the skin to become inflamed. In these cases, the wheels last longer than 24 hours, are more painful, and can leave a bruise. When should you seek medical help? Visit your GP if your symptoms don't go away within 48 hours. You should also contact your GP if your symptoms are: •	severe •	causing distress •	disrupting daily activities •	occurring alongside other symptoms Section 4: Things to think about. How long was the Covid 19 vaccine in the laboratory stage ? How long was the Covid 19 vaccine in the pre- clinical stage ? How many people were in each trial? How long did they wait for reactions? What kind of chemicals are in the Covid 19 vaccine? What do they do to your body? What is the root cause of CSU? And why don’t scientist research more into it? Why is it chronic? Section 5: My experience so far. I developed CSU after my second dose of Moderna back in May 2021, it started as a small red spot at the injection site, however it disappeared.  A few weeks later my legs had a few red bumps on them, they weren’t painful or itchy. I thought it was just eczema or dry skin. Fast forward a week and there all over my legs and now there itchy as well. It wasn’t that bad just a little uncomfortable at times. Mostly at night. It continued that way for four and a half months until my menstrual cycle began. Then it got a whole lot worse, it was now all over my arms, legs, feet and stomach. It was red and raised bumps that where extremely itchy and burnie I couldn’t sleep at all that night, and then on the morning of October 25th I went to the hospital. We arrived at the hospital at 10:30 am there wasn’t anyone else there, so they saw me right away. It goes downhill from here. One nurse came in and looked at my rash and asked me some questions, then she left. Half an hour later a different nurse comes in and does the same thing, then leaves. Then after about an hour waiting for the doctor to come in or anyone for that matter (they were all by the desk talking about food and unrelated subjects) the “doctor “finally comes in. He looks at my rash asks no questions and leaves. And then more waiting, after thirty minutes I had to use the bathroom and when I came back, he was there talking to my mom. She doesn’t look happy at all, I asked her what he said, and she wouldn’t tell me until we got to the car. We waited and additional fifteen minutes for my paperwork, then we left When we got to the car, she told me he said it was scabies. I don’t live in a palace or anything but me and my mom deep clean everything once a month. And if we both had it (my mom has the same thing but it’s very minor) then my dad and brother would have it to. Anyway, we went to the pharmacy to get my prescriptions filled, I had one for a steroid and one for a lotion. Neither were in stock at my pharmacy, so we had to order them. When we got home, I started looking up ways to help with the itching and burning from the “scabies”. One YouTube video said a 50/50 mix of vinegar and water, and another said peroxide, so I start using them. I used a washcloth to apply the water and vinegar mixture and then let it air dry. It smelled bad but it revealed the burning, and then I used peroxide to help with the itching. My feet were swollen and had it the worst, so I gave them extra attention. I did the treatment every 4 hours, and it got me through the night. I had to sleep with no blankets because they made my feet painful. The next day my mom picks up my medication. Only the lotion was in, I was expecting something useful when she brought it home. It turned out to be head lice shampoo (it doesn’t even work for lice) how was that supposed to help. And the worst part was it was an over-the-counter product, so my insurance didn’t cover it, we had to pay $17.50 for it. As for the steroid, still to this day October 31, 2021, it’s not in and its over the counter to and costs an additional $17.50. Anyway, I continue using the vinegar-water and peroxide along with ibuprofen and it gets slightly less painful as I use it. I’m also taking pain medication for my menstrual cycle, another added annoyance. Each day I used it the rash got better, and after four days I finally got a good night sleep. My cycle stopped and the rash started to go away and was barely bothering me. I decided to take an oatmeal bath, basically you take a sock and you put oatmeal in it and the lather it onto your skin, and then rub it in and wash it off. It felt good to be itch free for one day. The rash subsided 90% there’s still some red spots but there’s no burning and minimal itching. As of right now I still have it, mostly my feet. But they’re not swollen or hurting. I feel better than I have in a while, I do have bruising and some scars from it though. Not only was it physically destroying my body but also mental health. And the lack of sleep from the itching and burning is the biggest contributor to it. As of now I’m not in pain but the rash is still here. I have an interview for my new job coming up, so things are looking better. Treatments that helped me get through it. A 50/50 mix of water and vinegar that you rub into your skin three times a day. It helps with the burning. Peroxide, it helps a lot with the itching, it works great at night before bed. Oatmeal bath, soak in a lukewarm bath and lather the oatmeal on your skin, then rub it in with your hand. For my mental health, pick a relaxing song to listen to mine is Colors by Grace Potter&nocturnals I highly recommend it, it’s a calming and beautiful song. When you have yours turn the volume up as high as you can, then close your eyes and lay there. Take slow and steady breathes. And it will help you stay calm. Questions I have? Why is there barley any information about the vaccine available? What where the results of the clinical trials? Did the government even do them? Why are hospitals not constantly updating and researching information about Covid and the vaccines? Why don’t they check for case studies? Do some people carry a gene or antibody that make them more likely to get CSU? How long will my CSU last? Is CSU affected by your estrogen levels? Is that why it’s more common in women?

7,Brain Injury Impacts and Brain Health Tips After Concussions or MTBI and Traumatic Brain Injuries,health-fitness," When a concussion or traumatic brain injury takes place, the impacts and symptoms of these injuries aren't constantly right away obvious. With a basic concussion, symptoms tend to last for 7-10 days for professional athletes and for upwards of a couple of months for non-athletes prior to dissipating totally, after which these people feel completely great and healthy. Regrettably, almost 30 percent of all people who struggle with a concussion will go through long-term negative effects, much of which impact the brain.

While the results of a concussion are normally momentary in nature, it's possible for them to continue and trigger degeneration in brain health as an individual age. Although concussions and traumatic brain injuries can happen for a large range of factors, they are generally caused by a blow to the head. When this injury happens, the body's immune system will respond instantly, which will lead to swelling surrounding the impacted locations. The parts of the brain that have actually been impacted by the concussion will struggle with a brief breakdown of a few of the structures within the cells. While these structures are closed down, the cells will not get the oxygen they need for regular functions, which is why impacted people will experience a range of symptoms. When these cells are harmed, trying to do something that's managed by these cells will likely lead to failure. For example, the impacted person might be not able to stabilize effectively. While different neural paths in the brain will be utilized to assist the private total these jobs, they will be less effective. Gradually, the injury will likely recover, which suggests that the cells and neural paths can resume their basic functions. Sadly, this isn't constantly the case. There are times when a few of the cells and structures surrounding them do not recover effectively, which can lead to consistent symptoms. Upon experiencing concussions or traumatic brain injuries several times, an individual's possibilities of establishing long-term symptoms will usually increase. While the long-term results and symptoms of brain injuries can be annoying to handle, there are actions that the impacted person can require to minimize the symptoms and lead a typical life. Main Symptoms of Brain Injuries When experiencing a concussion or small traumatic brain injury, there are some standard symptoms that an individual ought to anticipate going through while recovering from the injury. Remember that more serious traumatic brain injuries might lead to more harmful symptoms that need instant medical attention. The most typical symptoms referring to brain injuries can be separated into 4 classifications of cognitive-related symptoms, mood-related symptoms, blood-pressure symptoms, and sensory-related symptoms. Cognitive-Related Symptoms The basic cognitive-related symptoms that an individual might experience following a concussion consist of: Issues with memory Brain fog Problems with concentrating Troubles with reading Issues with discovering products Being quickly sidetracked Mood-Related Symptoms When it comes to mood-related symptoms, a few of the more significant results following a concussion consist of: Irritability Anxiety Depression Regularly low energy Blood-Pressure Symptoms Concussions and small traumatic brain injuries can trigger a vast array of issues with high blood pressure, which encompass: Queasiness Dizziness Tiredness Headaches Increased level of sensitivity to sound and light Pressure in your head Neck discomfort Problems with sleeping Exhausted eyes Sensory-Related Symptoms Concussions can likewise negatively impact an individual's senses and trigger such symptoms as: Ringing ears, which is likewise described as tinnitus Blurred vision Modifications in odor or taste Car sickness Long-Term Health Impacts to Watch Out For There are likewise some long-term health impacts that a person can experience if their concussion is serious or if they have actually gone through several brain injuries in the past. When a person is still experiencing symptoms after more than 6 weeks have actually passed given that the injury, it's most likely that they are impacted by a post-concussive syndrome. This syndrome happens in around 20 percent of individuals who experience a concussion. The many long-term health impacts that can happen following a concussion reach: Problems with concentration Memory issues Conditions with taste and odor Depression, irritability, and long-lasting behavioral modifications Numerous mental issues that continue While much of these exact same symptoms take place on a short-term basis with concussions, it's possible that they will continue, which can be challenging to handle. The long-term results like depression and memory issues can likewise increase the threat of suicide. It is necessary to comprehend that the results of several concussions or small traumatic brain injuries aren't constantly even worse than the results of a single concussion. Everybody will experience a concussion in a different way. How to Keep the Brain Healthy Rehab following a head injury or brain injury is needed to lower the symptoms. Bear in mind that these symptoms can be decreased even if they are long-term ones. Going to a medical professional a couple of days following a concussion needs to increase the possibility that the symptoms just last for a couple of days. While an absence of focus, weakening memory, and brain fog are numerous of the more discouraging results of a concussion on the brain, there are numerous strategies that can be utilized to enhance the health of the brain. To efficiently minimize the symptoms of a post-concussive syndrome, it is essential to: Get enough sleep every night Prevent taking illegal drugs or alcohol Think about acquiring therapy or treatment to handle the tension Attempt doing some muscle relaxation and breathing workouts Consume a healthy diet plan specifically brain-healthy foods abundant in Omega-fatty acids and anti-oxidants (Blueberries, Strawberries, Blackberries, Avocados, Broccoli, Whole Grains, Oily fish as salmon, mackerel, tuna, or sardines. Others as nuts and seeds, even dark chocolate benefit your brain. Attempt including Flax Seed, MCT oil to an early morning shake for additional brain octane. Despite the fact that the long-term results of a concussion can intensify gradually, the ideas discussed formerly can alleviate these concerns, which need to aid with keeping  total brain health. The crucial thing is to follow through with comprehensive house care and rehab following a concussion. Given that long-term impacts of a brain injury are unusual, the preliminary care that an individual gets after the concussion can play a substantial function in figuring out how extreme the impacts are."

9,Laser Hair Removal,health-fitness," What is laser hair removal? Laser hair removal is a medical procedure that uses a concentrated beam of light (laser) to remove unwanted hair. During laser hair removal, the emitted laser is absorbed by the pigment (melanin) in the hair, then the light energy is converted to heat, which damages the tube-shaped sacs within the skin (hair follicles) that produce hairs, this damage inhibits or delays future hair growth. Although laser hair removal effectively delays hair growth for long periods, it usually doesn't result in permanent hair removal. Multiple laser hair removal treatments are needed for initial hair removal, and maintenance treatments might be needed as well. Laser hair removal is most effective for people who have light skin and dark hair, but it can be successfully used on all skin types. Which parts of the body can be used? Laser hair removal is used to reduce unwanted hair. Common treatment locations include legs, armpits, upper lip, chin and the bikini line. However, it's possible to treat unwanted hair in nearly any area, except the eyelid or surrounding area. Skin with tattoos should not be treated either. Hair color and skin type influence the success of laser hair removal. The basic principle is that the pigment of the hair, but not the pigment of the skin, should absorb the light. The laser should damage only the hair follicle while avoiding damage to the skin. Therefore, a contrast between hair and skin color — dark hair and light skin — results in the best outcomes. The risk of damage to skin is greater when there is little contrast between hair and skin color, but advances in laser technology have made laser hair removal an option for people who have darker skin. Laser hair removal is less effective for hair colors that don't absorb light well: gray, red, blond and white. However, laser treatment options for light-colored hair continue to be developed. Is there any side effect? Risks of side effects vary with skin type, hair color, treatment plan and adherence to pre-treatment and post-treatment care. The most common side effects of laser hair removal include: Skin irritation - Temporary discomfort, redness and swelling are possible after laser hair removal. Any signs and symptoms typically disappear within several hours. Pigment changes - Laser hair removal might darken or lighten the affected skin. These changes might be temporary or permanent. Skin lightening primarily affects those who don't avoid sun exposure before or after treatment and those who have darker skin. Rarely, laser hair removal may cause blistering, crusting, scarring or other changes in skin texture. Other rare side effects include graying of treated hair or excessive hair growth around treated areas, particularly on darker skin. Laser hair removal isn't recommended for eyelids, eyebrows or surrounding areas, due to the possibility of severe eye injury. How should you prepare? If you're interested in laser hair removal, choose a doctor whose board certified in a specialty such as dermatology or cosmetic surgery and has experience with laser hair removal on your skin type. If a physician assistant or licensed nurse will do the procedure, make sure a doctor supervises and is available on-site during the treatments. Be cautious about spas, salons or other facilities that allow nonmedical personnel to do laser hair removal. Before laser hair removal, schedule a consultation with the doctor to determine if this is an appropriate treatment option for you. Your doctor will likely do the following: 1.Review your medical history, including medication use, history of skin disorders or scarring, and past hair removal procedures 2.Discuss risks, benefits and expectations, including what laser hair removal can and can't do for you. 3.Take photos to be used for before-and-after assessments and long-term reviews. 4.At the consultation, discuss a treatment plan and related costs. Laser hair removal is usually an out-of-pocket expense. The doctor will also offer specific instructions to prepare for laser hair removal. These might include: Staying out of the sun. Follow your doctor's advice for avoiding sun exposure before and after treatment. Whenever you go out, apply a broad-spectrum, SPF30 sunscreen. To light your skin, avoid any sunless skin creams that darken your skin. Your doctor might also prescribe a skin bleaching cream if you have a recent tan or darker skin. Avoiding other hair removal methods including plucking, waxing and electrolysis can disturb the hair follicle and should be avoided at least four weeks before treatment. Avoiding blood-thinning medications. Ask your doctor about what medications, such as aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs, to avoid before the procedure. Shaving treatment area. Trimming and shaving is recommended the day before laser treatment. It removes hair above the skin that can result in surface skin damage from burnt hairs, but it leaves the hair shaft intact below the surface. Laser hair removal usually requires two to six treatments. The interval between treatments will vary depending on the location. On areas where hair grows quickly, such as the upper lip, the treatment might be repeated in four to eight weeks. On areas of slow hair growth, such as the back, the treatment might be every 12 to 16 weeks. For each treatment you'll wear special goggles to protect your eyes from the laser beam. An assistant might shave the site again if necessary. The doctor might apply a topical anesthetic to your skin to reduce any discomfort during treatment. During the procedure The doctor will press a hand-held laser instrument to your skin. Depending on the type of laser, a cooling device on the tip of the instrument or a cool gel might be used to protect your skin and lessen the risk of side effects. When the doctor activates the laser, the laser beam will pass through your skin to the hair follicles. The intense heat from the laser beam damages the hair follicles, which inhibits hair growth. You might feel discomfort, such as a warm pinprick, and you'll likely feel a sensation of cold from the cooling device or gel. When treating a small area, such as the upper lip, might take only a few minutes. Treating a larger area, such as the back, might take more than an hour. After the procedure You might notice redness and swelling for the first few hours after laser hair removal. To reduce any discomfort, apply ice to the treated area. If you have a skin reaction immediately after laser hair removal, the doctor might apply a steroid cream to the affected area. After laser hair removal and between scheduled treatments, avoid sunlight and don't use a tanning bed for six weeks or as directed by your doctor. Use a broad-spectrum SPF30 sunscreen daily. Results Hairs do not fall out immediately, but you will shed them over a period of days to weeks. This may look like continued hair growth. The repeated treatments are usually necessary because hair growth and loss naturally occur in a cycle, and laser treatment works best with hair follicles in the new-growth stage. Results vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Most people experience hair removal that lasts several months, and it might last for years. But laser hair removal doesn't guarantee permanent hair removal. When hair regrows, it's usually finer and lighter in color. You might need maintenance laser treatments for long-term hair reduction. What about home lasers? Lasers that can be used at home for hair removal are available. These devices might cause modest hair reduction. But there are no large studies comparing how effective these devices are compared with laser hair removal done at a doctor's office. Additionally, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers these home laser hair removal devices to be cosmetic, not medical, which means they don't get the same level of scrutiny as other medical devices. Currently, there haven't been large, long-term studies on how safe and effective the home machines are. If you choose to use a home laser hair removal device, follow the instructions that come with the device to help reduce the risk of injury, especially eye injuries.

10,"The Typical Smartphone has 25,127 Bacteria per Square Inch",health-fitness," We’re still living in the midst of a global pandemic. All of us know that we need to wash our hands regularly and use hand sanitizer to mitigate the spread of germs so that we don’t spread Covid or the Flu to others. However, how many of us think about cleaning our cell phones? Cell phones often get dropped on the ground. They get placed on dirty table tops and oh yeah… do you use our cell phones while in the bathroom? If you answered yes, you're not alone. According to a survey A new from electronics trade-in website BankMyCell, this is America's dirtiest little tech secret. It doesn't matter whether you're male or female, iOS or Android user, from the East or West Coast—you probably use your smartphone when you’re doing your business. According to Seattle Times journalist Bobby Caina Calvan, your phone is covered in tens of thousands of germs: 25,127 bacteria per square inch, to be specific. This makes cell phones one of the most germ ridden objects that we regularily come in contact. When compared to other items typically categorized as “dirty,” cell phones take the trophy. Last year, Mashable.com put together a little video that compared the number of bacteria covering cell phones to bacteria covering toilet seats, pet food dishes, kitchen countertops, checkout touchscreens, and doorknobs. This is what they reported: Toilet seat: 1,201 bacteria per square inch Kitchen countertops: 1,736 bacteria per square inch Pet food dish: 2,110 bacteria per square inch Checkout screen: 4,500 bacteria per square inch Doorknob: 8,643 bacteria per square inch Your favorite tech device, your smartphone, carries more than three times the number of germs that dirty doorknobs do. Think about that next time you hold that thing up to your face, or when you pass your smartphone to a child to use. So what do you do? Well, for starters, keep washing your hands (or start, if you don’t do so regularly). But secondly, make sure to consistently clean your phone. Experts recommend using UV cleaning devices, or disposable wipes made to clean and disinfect cell phone surfaces, but you can also clean your phone with a gentile cloth—not a paper towel that may scratch your phone—dampened with a mix of 60% water and 40% isopropyl alcohol. If you’re high-tech, a gadget that pulses UV light to destroy surface bacteria might be your thing. Whatever method you choose, remember to clean your phone regularly to keep bacteria far from you, and helps mitigate the spread of contagion."
11,5 Facts Everyone Should Know About CPAP Mask,health-fitness," Sleep apnea happens when the muscles in the back of your throat relax at night, partially blocking your airway. Breathing can then become interrupted for several seconds to minutes, many times every hour; during these breathing pauses you typically do not breathe and have a low oxygen level in your bloodstream. A CPAP machine is a small, portable device that blows continuous positive air into your nose to keep your airways open. The steady flow of oxygen creates the pressure needed for snoring prevention and sleep apnea treatment. This belt wraps around your chest to hold the CPAP in place while you sleep. CPAP users need to make sure they know which type of mask styles will work with their Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine. Some may only use the masks that come with the CPAP machine, while others will want to explore some other options. Here are some CPAP masks you can choose from if your sleep apnea keeps you up at night.  They may seem like simple machines, but CPAP(continuous positive airway pressure) machines are pretty complicated. And they’re somewhat uncomfortable to wear as well, which deter a lot of people from using them regularly. IF YOU USE A CPAP, THERE ARE FIVE THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW: Whether you need it or not, fixed pressure machines maintain constant pressure. The trend for auto machines began 5 decades ago but is still running great. The pressure is adjusted automatically up and down to match your actual needs. The main distinction between a traditional CPAP machine and an APAP is how it works. The APAP equipment will automatically adjust air pressure based on how you breathe. Depending on your sleep position, stress level, health, and weight, your pressure needs may alter. APAP machines regulate themselves to keep your pressure as low as feasible while yet efficiently preventing apnea. Regardless of the situation, a basic CPAP machine maintains constant pressure. You must see your doctor alter a standard CPAP. All of the tweakings is done for you using an APAP, so you don't have to go to the doctor. Medical gadgets have progressed in lockstep with other technology, and CPAP machines are everywhere. CPAP machines are getting smaller, lighter, and quieter, to the point where you don't even notice they're on. (On the market, the smallest CPAP machine weighs just over a pound!). This implies that if/when you decide to buy a new mask or machine, you won't have to worry about compatibility issues because any machine, regardless of model, will function with any mask. CPAP users frequently believe that their mask does not fit their tube or CPAP machine and that nothing they do will make the mask fit. This means that a piece of your old mask is still lodged in your tube. The tube's ends should be connected by rubber; if you detect plastic, it's a remnant of your old mask. Remove the plastic piece by pressing firmly on the rubber tube end. Once you've removed the old plastic piece, you'll notice that your new mask fits wonderfully. If you've been using your mask for a time, you may notice that it no longer seals as well as it once did. To compensate for this, you may begin to tighten your headwear, which may progressively make you uncomfortable. This must not be done! Replace your seal instead. Seals can wear out faster than you expect, resulting in a looser fit and, in some cases, a loud leak. You might want to keep a backup seal on hand just in case. Check with your insurance carrier to see if two nasal pillows/cushions and one full-face cushion each month are covered. A CPAP machine, like other medical equipment, requires very minimal maintenance. Each one comes with a filter that should be changed as needed. The heated humidifier's water chamber is the only other portion of the machine that needs cleaning other than the filters. The damp environment in a CPAP machine is ideal for bacteria and mold to thrive. These molds and bacteria can irritate your sinuses and cause other health issues, defeating the goal of your CPAP. Every day, you should clean your tube and mask. Once a week, the headgear and humidifier should be cleaned. Warm water and a light, unscented soap should be used to clean your equipment. On your CPAP, never use vinegar or bleach. As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, many people have begun to take control of their treatment. Purchasing equipment online without dealing with red-tape or insurance issues is becoming more common among the baby boomer generation. It is also usually far less expensive in the long run."
12,Vacuum therapy for breast enlargement,health-fitness," Most of women are now suffering from breast problems associated with gravity and ageing. As they age, their breasts usually experience lack of elasticity and then become saggy, which is an inevitable process that is widely-acknowledged. Some of them feel self-conscious about being in that condition and even lose confidence in themselves. Actually, this is the situation where the vacuum therapy comes in, through which most of women are expected to have youthfully firmer breasts and regain self-confidence. There are several non-surgical treatments out there on the market. The popular one is vacuum therapy. So what is it and what advantages does it have？ Vacuum breast-augmentation is a non-surgical treatment with high-level safety and remarkable treatment results, bringing good news to people seeking replacements for breast-augmentation surgeries. Though some surgeries may enable you to see breasts become firmer to some extent, something unpleasant may occur like minor distension, long recovery time and lesions’ inflammations.

This non-invasive treatment can help shape and augment your breasts, thus bring self-confidence back to you. The vacuum therapy is a non-invasive treatment for fighting against severe cellulite.

13,Why make mindfulness a habit,health-fitness," There’s no denying that there is a connection between life and stress. Nowadays stress is a common problem in  modern life. Whether you’re a student, nine to five worker or a housewife, stress manages to infiltrate itself into your life and damage your wellbeing in the process. It had been a rough couple of weeks when I myself decided to opt for meditation and  mindfulness, but it wasn’t until I fully understood the meaning behind it that I could finally grasp its benefits. Mentalhealth.org.uk describes stress as the body's response to pressure from a situation or life events. What contributes to stress varies from person to person. Anything from our environment to social or economic circumstances. Stress triggers a known response called “fight or flight” which helps us respond quickly in dangerous situations. While some doses of stress have beneficial reactions, if pushed too far, stress can be the cause of major danger to your health. You can still prevent yourself and bring your mind and body back into balance. Here are a few symptoms of stress to look out for : Emotional Symptoms Becoming easily agitated, frustrated, and moody Feeling overwhelmed, like you are losing control or need to take control Having difficulty relaxing and quieting your mind Why meditate? Experience a calm inner you. ""MEDITATION PROVIDES A WAY OF LEARNING HOW TO LET GO. AS WE SIT, THE SELF WE’VE BEEN TRYING TO CONSTRUCT AND MAKE INTO A NICE NEAT PACKAGE CONTINUES TO UNRAVEL. "" A common misunderstanding is that people often equate mindfulness and meditation with one another. Meditation and mindfulness have its similarities as they ultimately complement and support each other, but they are completely different things. Let's take a look Meditation is a way to take back control of your emotions. While it may be good or satisfying  even to let yourself feel these emotions, they should be under your control. Through meditation you learn to handle these emotions in a way that fits you best. There are many different types of meditation that focus on awareness, opening the mind, inner peace and the list goes on. Here are a few examples: Breath-awareness meditation Loving-kindness meditation Mantra-based meditation Mindfulness While mindfulness is as simple as to slow down and notice your surroundings, as you quietly pay attention to your thoughts, body and breathing, it activates all of your senses. By being mindful you're helping yourself maintain a moment by moment awareness. You learn to stop your mind from wandering and that can be see as the most difficult part of practising mindfulness, since we can't instruct the mind what not to think. And unlike meditation, can be practiced at any given time. Here are a few practices: Mindfulness of body meditation Mindfulness of breath meditation Mindfulness of sounds meditation Mindfulness is a way to clear the mind and refocus on the present moment and meditation is a process of training your mind to redirect your thoughts. Many may also see it as an effective way to reduce stress and develop concentration. And even though it can look as if they overlap each other in many ways, meditation is simply one of the many roads to mindful living."
14,Introducing Palm & Pine Skincare - Protection Without Pollution,health-fitness," Palm & Pine Suncare are excited to announce the launch of their natural, plastic-free sunscreen brand; The first to promise sun protection without pollution. With the goal of stepping up the natural sunscreen market in Europe, Palm & Pine will offer an all-natural SPF 30 for general use, and high-factor face protection for the surf, snow, and outdoor market. ”Since relocating to sunny Portugal, my need for sunscreen increased so I wanted to find a natural alternative to the traditional chemical options available,'' says co-founder and CEO, Sarah Muir. “After being repeatedly disappointed by natural sunscreens, we decided to take matters into our own hands. Following some experimentation in the kitchen, myself and my partner, co-founder Ross Kemp, decided to formalise the idea and create our own brand.” After testing a number of products, gathering insights from friends and associates, our opportunity began to emerge. “We found that the USA and Australia are ahead of the game when it comes to natural sunscreen, with a multitude of brands on offer. When asking friends about their favourite natural sunscreen, the majority referred to non-European brands, particularly for surf protection. This led us to realise that there was an exciting opportunity to create a stylish, suncare brand, combining our love for minimalist design and leveraging the beauty and rising popularity of our chosen homeland, Portugal.” This set the ball rolling for Palm & Pine suncare and the search for a European manufacturer began. “Finding a natural skincare manufacturer in Europe was challenging. We needed to find a company who not only understood our eco mission but also our desire to innovate and take what is currently available and improve upon it. We were fortunate enough to find a company who were prepared to take on this challenge and explore innovative organic-based sun filters, developed in Europe. We have developed all-natural solutions that are kind to the skin, the environment, and most importantly are nice to use.” When formulating the brand there were immediate factors that they were not prepared to compromise on. “In researching products currently available, we saw a number of companies claiming ‘ocean-friendly (containing none of the chemicals deemed to damage marine life). The majority are, however, packaged in plastic or ‘eco’ plastics which have equally long degradation times. We saw an opportunity to be truly ocean-friendly, from product to packaging. Living beside the Atlantic ocean we are conscious of plastic pollution and decided that if we were to create a new skincare brand, we were committed to doing so without plastic - of any kind.” The team are exploring fully compostable packaging solutions but state that it will be some time before these solutions are ready for cosmetic products. Palm & Pine will launch with aluminum product packaging and zero-plastic delivery solutions. In addition to minimising the impact on the environment via the packaging, Palm & Pine also promises the following features and benefits; All-natural ingredients Protects against UVA/UVB Rays Vegan Water-resistant Ocean-friendly and Reef-Safe Free-from chemical preservatives & fragrances Eye-lid safe & Lip safe Baby-friendly"
15,Java Burn Reviews Coffee Weight Loss Supplement Really Works?,health-fitness," Java Burn is a weight loss supplement that supercharges your metabolism and helps with fat burning. According to the official website, it uses scientifically proven ingredients, capable of triggering a natural weight loss. Java Burn is a blend of natural metabolism boosters combined as a formula by John Barban. This supplement, when mixed in a coffee, can help consumers live an obesity-free life without undergoing weight loss surgeries, starving their bodies, or spending hours at the gym. This Java Burn review will go through all the crucial details and evaluate them for actual benefits. Let’s dive in. Java Burn Review - An Overview Obesity is both a disease and a symptom that affects the quality of life. It can target not only the physical health but also the mental health of a person, causing poor health, failure in professional life, isolated social life, and anxiety. Although the market is full of products offering amazing weight loss benefits, nearly 90% of them are fake and may even cause severe side effects in the user. The remaining 10% are high-end options that are rare to find, expensive, and not accessible for common people. So, they are only left with trying fad diets, hiring fitness trainers, and paying expensive gym subscriptions. What if someone tells you that weight loss is not as hard as it looks and there are actual products that might help you? Java Burn weight loss supplement is one such product that encourages the body to get into a better shape, using its natural functions. Read this complete Java Burn review to learn more about its efficacy and benefits. What is Java Burn? Java Burn is a simple, revolutionary, and affordable supplement with proven weight loss benefits. It is made of 100% natural ingredients, some of which are a part of our diet. There are no artificial ingredients, fillers, additives, or toxins added into this formula; therefore, the risk of side effects with this product is minimal. More than a diet pill, Java Burn is a metabolic booster. It comes in a powder form that makes its usage even more convenient. Java Burn coffee supplement relieves inflammation that slows down metabolism and aids in fat layering. Once the inflammation is under control, the body gets back to a healthy metabolic rate and uses the stored fat to generate energy and run cellular functions. Unlike other powdered supplements, JavaBurn has even saved you from measuring the dosage. It comes in small prepacked sachets; each packet is one day’s dosage. You simply have to mix Java Burn in your coffee and that’s it. No pills, no recipe, no tonic, etc. You don’t even have to change your coffee brand. Java Burn is tasteless, which means you can keep enjoying your favorite coffee while experiencing amazing results. You can use Java Burn with other beverages as well, but it is preferable to use it with coffee, for best results. One pack of Java Burn has 30 servings and is enough for one entire month. If you wish to use it for a longer time, which is highly recommended, check out its bundle packs and order in bulk. Weight Loss With Java Burn Coffee Powder Age changes everything from the outer look, physical health, mental health, and the ability to function normally. It is possible for metabolism to change with age and become slow, resulting in weight gain and obesity. However, it does not mean that you have to live an unhealthy and ugly life when you are aging. Java Burn works on the real issue in weight loss, which is chronic inflammation in the gut. The ingredients used in this supplement are anti-inflammatory, immune-modulating, and relaxing; as a result, the body returns to the healthy track within a few weeks. This type of weight loss is better than spending money on options that may or may not work. Though individual results may vary, weight loss with the Java Burn supplement is legit, and the results would show up within a few weeks. Some of the initial signs include appetite control, low cravings, no mood swings, complete digestion, high energy levels, and visible body fat loss. Java Burn Ingredients It is hard to believe JavaBurn effects without knowing about its ingredients, each of which has proven health benefits to offer. Here is a list of major Java Burn ingredients and their benefits for weight. Vitamin D (Cholecalciferol) The first ingredient in Java Burn is vitamin D (20 mcg) that fills in for the vitamin deficiency. Obese patients are primarily deficient in vitamin D, making it hard to move around and maintain bone integrity. That is why using a supplement with vitamin D in it sounds desirable. This vitamin helps in absorbing calcium and builds strong bones and teeth while losing weight. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) Based on research evidence, vitamin B6 plays a huge part in initiating weight loss as it supports metabolizing fat cells. According to some studies, it also reduces water retention in the body and plays a vitamin role in this weight loss journey. Not many people know, but low B6 levels result in a reduction in serotonin, a hormone that controls stress, mood, appetite, and food cravings, all of which are directly associated with obesity. Vitamin B12 (Methylcobalamin) This Java Burn ingredient helps to maintain optimal health, especially for weight management. People who wish to lose weight should have a substantial amount of vitamin B12 in their bodies, as it maintains energy levels and shares a link with weight loss. Although there is only limited evidence available, vitamin B12 is one of the key players in fat metabolism. If the body is deficient, it can cause fat accumulation, especially around the belly, thighs, and hips. Chromium (Chromium chloride) Chromium does not initiate weight loss directly, but inside the Java Burn formula, this mineral stabilizes blood sugar, controls hunger and food cravings that otherwise lead to weight gain. It targets neurotransmitters that reduce food cravings and appetite. As a result, the body adapts mindful eating habits. Green Tea Leaf Extract Green tea helps in weight loss by activating metabolism. It has a flavonoid called catechin that acts as an antioxidant, cleanses the body from toxins, waste materials, and free radicals. The caffeine in green tea boosts metabolism and induces a faster weight loss while providing high energy to function all day. That is why the weight loss with Java Burn is neither lethargic nor weakening, in fact, it does not even feel like you are on a weight-loss track. Green Coffee Green coffee is a natural fat burner, even without diet or exercise. Many people use green coffee as their regular hot beverage for maintaining their weight. When added to Java Burn, the effects of green coffee are enhanced because of the other ingredients added that work in synergy and complement each other’s effects. L-Carnitine Do not let this name confuse you, as L-Carnitine is an amino acid with thermogenic properties. It is often called the ‘mother of amino acids’ for its effective role in nearly all body functions. Based on some studies, it is clear that it increases the fat-burning ability of the body without affecting muscle integrity and energy levels. L-Theanine The last Java Burn ingredient is L-Theanine, which helps in weight management after losing it once. It also regulates the sleep cycle and makes a person enjoy restful sleep despite a constantly active metabolism working on melting fat. More evidence suggests its benefits for brain functions, immunity boost, disease prevention, and anxiety. Nothing inside Java Burn seems like a risk. All these ingredients are natural and are sourced from premium locations. There are no threats attached, and even these ingredients are free from allergens too. The chances of food allergies with natural foods are rare, and everything inside this formula is also a normal part of a diet. There are no chances of any of these to go wrong and induce an unwanted effect. The company behind the JavaBurn supplement ensures quality sources, GMP-certified and FDA-approved manufacturing units, and high-quality standards during this process. The final product is packaged in single-use sachets that are to be mixed in water and consumed orally. Also, read Java Burn customer reviews and weight loss testimonials from real users. How does Java Burn coffee powder really help with fat burning? Check out this report before buying! Best Effects Of Java Burn Powder Java Burn is presented as a weight loss product but losing weight is not the only thing it can do. Read the following benefits of consuming this drink every day. It initiates a complete body cleanse and detox, clearing all toxic materials away. The high antioxidant count of this supplement is behind these detoxification properties, and it does not remove any beneficial compound. Java Burn works on metabolism and fixes the slow process by clearing inflammation in the gut, the biggest reason the metabolism declines with age. Once this main issue is fixed, the body gets back to normal digestion and immunity, with better diet control and regular bowel movement. Not many people know, but digestion and immunity are directly connected to each other, and any improvements in digestion mean benefits for immunity too. A good immunity saves from pathogenic invasions by making the body stronger to fight against them. Some Java Burn ingredients work on cardiovascular health, regulate blood pressure and maintain healthy sugar levels. Who Should and Should Not Use Java Burn Powder? Java Burn is pretty safe to use and is suitable for every person over 18 years of age and interested in losing weight. Although diet and exercise are two credible ways to lose weight, people are unable to take out time for diet planning, cooking, groceries, and time to work out. All these people can alternatively take help from dietary supplements that help the body lose weight without affecting other body functions. It is not suitable for a person if he is 18 or below 18 years old. Childhood and teenage obesity is treated differently, and using adult products on children is not a safe idea. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should also avoid it. Moreover, people with underlying medical conditions should avoid taking any dietary formula without consulting their doctor. Many times obesity is caused by a disease, and in that case, fixing the disease reduces the obesity. For Maximum Savings Use This Link to Order Java Burn Supplement Online!

Javaburn.com suggests mixing Java Burn powder in your morning coffee. Yes, the best time to take the Java Burn supplement is in the morning, when you are ready to kickstart your day with a highly productive, active, and lively mood. There is no prescription required to take Java Burn powder. But it should also not be combined with any OTC or prescription-based medicine. You may mix it in fruit juice instead of water if you like to experience a better taste. Do not take a higher dose to get faster results, as overdose is associated with a number of digestive issues and is never a recommended idea. Java Burn - When Should You Expect Results? This question is vague, but people are actually interested to know the time required to make this supplement work. If your target weight is only 4-5 pounds away, one month is enough for you. But if you are far away from your target weight, using it for three to six months is ideal and recommended by John Barban. However, the time required to lose weight with Java Burn also depends upon age, health, fat, and genetics. Although not a compulsion, a healthy diet and active lifestyle can actually make the results show faster. Start eating healthy, make your portions small and introduce physical activity in your routine to lose more weight in less time.

In as little as twenty minutes of vigorous exercise a day, we can significantly increase our stamina. This process can be adapted to suit however much time we have on our hands. It could be as much as a full spring clean when we have a day off. Or it can be as little as a small space in the home like a drawer, bookcase, or sink. However much or little we do, if we do it with a little gusto we will be benefiting our health. So the next time you need to let off a little steam after a long working week, get the duster out! It Keeps You Organised Cleaning is not simply about keeping up appearances. While it may be true that a clean home is beautiful to look at, it has benefits far beyond that. A clean and tidy home can save you time and stress by keeping you organised. You are no longer wasting time searching for things that should have a proper place. You are not sifting through dirty crockery or laundry to find what you need for the day. Everything has a suitable place in the home, and this leads to feeling less fraught and overwhelmed. Keeping things clean can also save you money in the long run too, as they are more likely to stay in good working order. It Can Be An Act of Love Expressing love and gratitude has proven effects on wellbeing. We may think that these would have to be grand gestures, but appreciating the small things is even more important. Cleaning can reduce your anxiety by being an act of love and self-care — some time to yourself, for yourself, to make your space the best it can be. It is a way of showing respect and gratitude to the home you are in, and also a form of care for a partner, loved ones, or whoever may live with you. Cleaning is anxiety-inducing only when it feels like an overwhelming chore. If we change our attitude, and see it as an act of love and gratitude, we can immediately enjoy it more. It Supports Your Immune System Did you know that our carpets and home surfaces can harbour some nasty bugs? From common, relatively harmless germs to the dreaded MRSA, we tread all sorts of bacteria back into our home. The good news is that these can be easily eradicated. Regular cleaning, even for just a few minutes a day, can stop the spread of bacteria and viruses. Places of ‘high traffic’ should be your top priority. This means where there is regular contact and use such as on kitchen surfaces, the bathroom, flooring, and anywhere we spend a lot of time."
18,3 Tips to Get Fit Fast in 3 Weeks,health-fitness," Given the question ""What is the key to fitness?"", There are some things to consider. Regardless of the science, everyone knows the physical state differently according to their own preferences. There are many ways to get to any fitness component, I've only talked about a couple. You must know what are the five basic components of physical fitness determined by science. All the ""keys"" of physical condition require constant effort on the part of the person receiving the form. Once these things are determined, we can begin to analyze some of the ways in which I know that you can improve your fitness level quickly. To be specific, I will discuss four (4) parts of the board that I will only give to those who want to get in shape as quickly as possible. Then, without further ado, go ahead! 1* - The enemy often: whether you are working, cycling, jumping or climbing a tree for a long time, do so with maximum intensity. Of course, this reduces the time you spend in the activity, but the general physiology of the activity will benefit you. Having said that, maybe I should explain that last statement. If you want to run a marathon or swim in Tahiti, my previous statement is a direct lie. However, if you want to be strong, strong, energetic, vital and muscular, my affirmation is about money (give me five cents, another grape, please). The people who run as an essential part of their training are muscular, lax and strong. If you do not believe me On the other hand, people who walk or are less intense (running, cycling, etc.) tend to be thin, less muscular and have a less general structure. If you wish, you can write ""Sports Resistance"" in Google Images. Although I tend to appreciate the two types of physical activity and the two types of physical condition that I admit, these exploits are more like my idea of correct body image. So, if you want a functional and powerful body, strong, thin and vibrant, go for a run! 2* - Reduce cereals and dairy products: Fortunately, this indication starts at the root and becomes more acceptable in the world of fitness. Minimum: our bodies have not been designed to receive grain products or dairy products from non-human animals. Cow's milk, goat's milk, all milk other than breast milk is designed for children of this type, not for you or the first. While human milk was designed for us to drink, it was even supposed to be ingested at a young age. As soon as we can eat, chew and eat our food, we pretend to eat the naturally nutritious things that the earth naturally provides us with. The grains are large quantities because our hungry descendants on the way to the day found that growing wheat or rye or oats in a bag was much easier than chasing rabbits or roots around the nut a snowstorm. Fortunately, we are not very difficult to feed these days. If you are hungry, then, of course, continue with milk and bread. Hell, if you're really hungry, everything you can find! But if physical fitness is your goal and not just survival, cut the beans and milk. They are solid in the body, not easy to digest, many of them are addictive, they tend to create inflammation and the body reacts swelling, slow and oily. There is evidence to suggest that cereals (wheat in the first place) can lead to verifiable brain damage and contribute to disorders such as ADHD, ADHD, and depression. Try to continue with skim meat, fiber vegetables, nuts, berries, and melons. These kinds of things are what our bodies are designed to eat, so try to try it. 3* - Work with a fitness coach - I know, I know, you think, ""Jared, it's not a very original board"", but this is one of the best tips I can give you. In my experience, less than 1% of most sports club members work with a personal trainer, while over 60% stop working and eventually lose their membership. You see every month! Bands of people join the gym and try the mills as if a primitive force will lead them. After a few weeks, you will see fewer and fewer new faces, and in March, it will be the same group of regular customers who have always come. But we know that those who work with them and continue."
19,Diabetes Freedom Reviews - How I Learnt to Control My Diabetes Free Diet,health-fitness," What is the best way to achieve diabetes freedom? With the ever-increasingly expensive medications and insulin pumps that keep you on the right track, most people just get along. But if you're like the majority of people with diabetes who no longer respond well to these traditional modes of treatment, are there other options that you may want to look into? diabetes freedom If you're looking for a diabetes freedom program, one of the first things you can do is to change your overall health. In this book, I re-discovered my own personal list of ideal foods and some special combinations which have big advantages over the ""ordinary"" forms of diet. These foods are rich in antioxidants, phytonutrients, and other powerful anti-inflammatory compounds. For example, bananas are great in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing blood sugar levels. But even more than that, bananas are excellent at improving overall health, which is critical in any weight-loss plan. The second component of a successful diabetes freedom program is to maintain optimal blood pressure. Blood pressure is directly linked to blood sugar levels, so it's crucial to have a healthy blood sugar level. Many conventional prescription medications only manage to suppress the blood sugar levels enough to prevent an impulse buy or two. However, if you take hypertension medication regularly, your risk for developing heart problems is greatly increased. In fact, it's estimated that many of those with high blood pressure don't even realize they have it! So what should you be eating if you're looking to get rid of prescription medications and achieve total diabetes freedom? Well, I've talked extensively about the benefits of natural ways to reduce stress, as well as the powerful effects of simple carbohydrates (i.e. bread, rice, pasta, etc.) Eating real whole foods (organic if possible) is highly beneficial. Finally, another component of the diabetes freedom reviews I've written is about reversing the root cause of the problem. That is, the root cause of the problem is still being maintained by your pancreas and other organs. If you just have a bad diet, it doesn't mean the pancreas will stop working. It just means that certain nutrients won't be processed properly, which means your blood sugar levels can still drop too much. What you must do in order to reverse the root cause of the problem is to make some changes to your lifestyle. You should definitely eat healthy foods and eat plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits. But, what you really need to do is increase your physical activity. Exercise is absolutely vital to diabetes freedom because it helps to keep your blood sugar levels normal and regulate insulin secretion. As a matter of fact, exercise is so important that doctors will usually recommend it as soon as your doctor diagnoses that you have this condition. And, there are still several other components of the diabetes freedom reviews I have written that you can look into as well. For example, one component is about using herbal remedies. In fact, many of the symptoms you experience with this condition can be relieved by using herbal remedies. And, these herbal remedies are safe and cheap, so you don't have to worry about spending a lot of money on them. I have personally tried many different natural remedies that have helped me with my symptoms. In fact, one herb, in particular, gives me the power to not get hungry. What this herb does is tells my body to slow down or stop eating whenever I feel hungry. It also increases the amount of energy I have, which helps me get through my daily activities. This is a very powerful herb, which you should learn more about if you want to make some significant changes to your diabetes freedom diet."
20,Best Weight Loss Methods For Today 2021,health-fitness," The primary focus for your weight loss journey should be on diet and exercise routines. Your diet will keep your energy levels in check, while the exercise routine will tone your body by giving it a lean mass. Dietary Routine When trying to lose weight, there are certain foods you should incorporate in your diet while others that you avoid entirely. What you input in your body determines your overall body well-being. • Start your day with an energy-packed breakfast: skipping breakfast is the most common mistake people make when trying to lose weight, but starving yourself does not help. Instead, eat a high protein and fibre packed meal to kick off your day. These include eggs, oatmeal, fruits, and vegetables. • Eat healthy snacks between meals: instead of eating chocolates, cakes, and biscuits, choose healthier alternatives like a handful of nuts, baby carrots, salads, etc. • Avoid wheat products: the gluten contained in wheat grain is hard to digest; hence causes the body to accumulate fat mainly around your waist. There are many alternatives to wheat, these include; almond flour, cassava flour, gram flour, teff flour, etc. • Eat high fibre and low-fat foods: dietary fibre keeps your blood sugar in check, prevents constipation, and keeps you full longer hence aiding weight loss. Fibre curbs unnecessary cravings. These foods include broccoli, chia seeds, sweet potatoes, lentils, black beans, kidney beans, peas, etc. • Drink plenty of water: water contains zero calories and flushes out toxins from your body. Keeping your body hydrated optimizes your internal organ activity and skin to look young and glowing. Focus on drinking at least eight glasses of water every day. If you do not like the taste of plain water, you can try infusing it with either lemon, mint or cucumber. Add these to your water in a large container and let it sit overnight for best results. • Avoid carbonated drinks and artificial juices: these drinks contain processed sugars and copious amounts of calories; which are toxic to your body. Drinking freshly squeezed juice is the best choice. Exercise Routine It is essential to keep your body active as it improves its metabolism. There are lots of physical activities that you can engage in to accomplish this. Cardiovascular exercises are ideal for weight loss; they include • cycling, • swimming, • running, • skipping rope, • Stair climbing, etc. These exercises will not only help you lose weight but also keep your heart healthy. Choose an activity that you enjoy so that you enjoy the weight loss process. Joining a gym can be the best option as you will meet other people with the same agenda and they will keep you motivated. Losing weight is a journey that requires consistency, hard work, and sacrifice. Following the routine shared here will guarantee you the results that you desire. Good luck!

1,Loose Weight Quick - Easy Ways to Loose Weight,health-fitness," Loosing weight quick can be a challenging and ultimately rewarding experience that can help you look and feel your best. These simple weight loss tips can and will help you get started, so you can look and feel healthy and more energetic in no time. Here are some simple ways to loose weight quick. Tip #1 Decide Why You Want To Loose Weight. To look good? Fit back into some of your favorite clothes? To feel healthier? What ever the reasons keep these in mind at all times. Write them down and put them in a place were you can see them every day. Review them once in a while to remind yourself of the cool reasons you started this. Tip #2 Keep a food journal Make a Diet Journal - Write down everything you eat throughout the day no matter how small it is. This will help you stay on your diet in the long run. You can also use your journal to track your weight loss, your feelings and so much more. You can really get creative here. The main point is to write it down. It will keep you involved and motivated. Tip #3 Drink More Water Drink More Water - Looking for a way to loose weight quick? then Drink more water. I know this diet tips is so basic, but it is because it flat out works. 6-8 glasses of water every day may sound like a lot, but spread out over the course of the day it isn't. Drinking water before meals will also make you seem fuller and prevent you from overeating. Tip #4 Don't Skip Breakfast Always eat breakfast. This will kick-start your metabolism for the day and also help you loose weight quick. It's been slow all night so you want to give it a boost. If you don't have time in the mornings then something as simple as a banana and yoghurt will do the trick. A firm banana will provide a slow release of energy throughout the morning so you shouldn't feel the need for a mid-morning snack. Tip #5 Consider Fruits and Vegetables Adding additional fruit and vegetables to your diet provides you with plenty of energy giving vitamins and minerals. In addition to this, they provide extra fiber plus fluid to help speed the movement of food through your bowels. I have found Smoothies to be a great way to quickly add several servings of fresh fruit to my daily menu. Tip #6 Learn proper portion sizes Learn proper portion sizes. Most people do not realize what a half a cup of ice-cream looks like; therefore, when they dish up what they believe to be a 350 calorie serving, more than likely they've dished at least a cup and the calories are now 700. Not understanding portion sizes will sabotage your weight loss diet efforts. Again, food labels are your source here. Use measuring cups and count out things like crackers to see just how much you should really be eating. For portion sizes that are measured in ounces, a good rule of thumb is that a fist is about the size of a serving of meat. Tip #7 Bring your lunch. While it may be tempting to grab something from a fast food restaurant for a quick lunch, bringing your own lunch that is healthy and low fat is even better. Pack a healthy lunch and throw in some healthy snacks as well. If you bring raw veggies or low fat cheese with whole wheat crackers, you can snack on them between meals. A handful of almonds can be a quick pick me up when late afternoon rolls around and you start to feel fatigued. Tip # 8 Exercise for at least 30 minutes a day It's easy to make the excuse that you don't have time to exercise but set aside at least 30 minutes a day for some activity. Exercise can range from sports to running to yoga. There are a variety of fun and simple ways to get your exercise time in without necessarily going to the gym. Tip #9 Choose walking over driving whenever it makes sense When given the opportunity to walk to the store or to run errands, choose walking over driving. That extra travel time can be seen as being put towards your exercise time. This is also the environmentally friendly alternative. Tip #10 Be realistic If you follow the above guidelines you can eat what you want and loose weight quick. Keep in mind once you are doing the above your weight will go down quicker than with any fad diet. Don't starve yourself this won't help. Crash dieting is unhealthy and the pounds soon come back on. Stay with the above and you will soon loose weight fast and reach the weight you desire in a healthy manner. If you're truly serious about losing weight, then go to the link below to get your free report now. Your body will never remain the same."
2,How to Overcome Weight Loss Challenges,health-fitness," Weight loss is often more of a challenge than anticipated You decide to lose weight. That's easy. So you sign up for a gym membership or start a diet program. Even easier. Once you start you find out it isn't easy at all. In fact, it's pretty painful, both physically and emotionally. Exhaustion sets in and instead of getting results you wanted, you just want to give up. Maybe you think ""well, maybe next year"" and old habits resume. Here is the story of nearly every weight loss program ever embarked upon by would-be ""losers"" who just couldn't bear the ""pain"" that comes with making it to the goal. What happens? Is it possible to overcome? Weight loss is painful proportionate to the amount of toxins involved Weight gain is not a health issue so much as a symptom of one. So-called ""foods"" which are ingested that are considered toxic by the body accumulate and create havoc through malfunction internally. The body starts to break down from there. In other words, the body falls out of a state of health due to lack of nourishment. Weight gain is a major symptom of this but other symptoms like aches and pains, tension, stress and many others can also occur. One of the first things that happens when you attempt to lose the weight by eating a more nourishing diet and exercising is that the body begins to let go of those toxins. Here's what happens. When the body is exposed to toxins - whether from the food eaten (chemicals, GMO stuff, excess sugars and refined carbs - the list goes on... ) it can get rid of a certain amount through body function, if that body is relatively healthy. However, the body can only offload a certain amount so, in order to protect itself, excess toxins are coated with fat and deposited in the fatty tissue. That sounds good. But... there's more to it. Caffeine is one of the most obvious examples of an ""addiction"" by the body as evidenced by the withdrawal symptoms experienced when stopping its consumption. Any toxin will have this effect on the body. Toxins from processed foods such as diet sodas and packaged, non-whole foods will need to be expelled for health to be restored and those pounds to come off. Withdrawal symptoms abound in many cases. Here's what happens. When you start losing weight, the body starts detoxifying - the toxins locked up in the fatty tissue are released back into the bloodstream. Whatever those toxic particles are connected to - for example getting drunk in a bar and having a fight with your spouse and/or getting beaten up - whatever the incident is - those emotions, discomforts (physical or emotional) will be re-experienced, unknown to you. For some people this can be very intense or very uncomfortable or even painful. That's when many give up the weight loss decision. Withdrawal doesn't have to be very painful at all One of the characteristics of withdrawal is the depletion of minerals from the body. Deficiencies are created by the detoxification process which is where all the pain and discomfort can come in. This is where calcium and magnesium, once again, come into play most vitally. Maintaining these levels is ever more important in the detoxification process as well as recovery from exercise. This is paramount because here we have the foremost reasons people give up on weight loss. These mineral levels can be the difference between success and failure. How to achieve weight loss for real without quitting While there is still some mental challenge to it, there does not have to be any pain in achieving weight loss and there could be a reduction in the mental challenge too. With proper minerals, exercise and a diet rich in whole foods, not processed, success can be gained and goals can be reached in fact. As a detox specialist, I have seen many people helped to get through these discomforts with the right diet and correct calcium and magnesium in balance and with the right pH.I am always happy to help you. My wish for you is a happy, healthy body. You CAN do it and that's my wish for you."
3,Lose Weight Or Lose 13 Years!,health-fitness," We hear it all the time lose weight for your health. Few people however, realize the extent to which this is critical to their physical well-being and ultimately their life expectancy. In January 2003, the Journal of the American Medical Association featured a study finding that obesity appears to lessen life expectancy, especially among young adults. The study showed an obese 20-year-old white male, (5’10”)178 cm and weighing (288 pounds) 130kg was estimated to lose 13 years of his life as a result of obesity. It is now well research that a Western diet that leads to obesity may actually act to stimulate the growth of cancer cells. It is never too late to improve your health through healthful eating and adopting a more health-giving lifestyle. Here are simple steps to follow which can make an immediate improvement to your health and vitality. To find out your BMI you need to divide your weight (measured in kilos) by your height (measured in metres) squared. If the result is greater than 25, your health may be improved by losing weight. If you eat and drink more calories than your body requires you will put on weight. Learn to control calories and portion sizes, make recipes leaner, and eat infrequently from fast food restaurants. Also learn how to snack with healthful choices. There are seven different color ranges of both fruit and vegetables and by choosing between 5 to 9 daily serves from a wide range of fruit and vegetables, we are extending our consumption of cancer (and other disease) fighting nutrients. Protein provides a powerful signal to the brain providing a longer sense of fullness. The right source of protein is essential to controlling your hunger with fewer calories and necessary to maintain your lean muscle mass. Choices of protein should be flavored soy shakes with fruit; the white meat of chicken and turkey, seafood such as shrimps, prawns scallops and lobster and ocean fish or vegetarians may prefer soy based meat substitutes. If you want to enjoy a lifetime of well being, exercise is a key ingredient. Thirty minutes activity each day that takes as much effort as a brisk walk is recommended for adults. Children should be active for an hour each day. A study, Effects of Internet Behavioral Counseling on Weight Loss in Adults at Risk of Type 2 Diabetes shows that participants who had the support of weight loss coaching lost more weight than those who didn't. The study concluded that the support of a weight loss coach can significantly improve weight loss results. Being overweight or obese has been identified next to smoking, as the most preventable major risk to developing cancer. Even small weight losses have been shown to have beneficial health effects. So its never to late to start and you can never be too young or too old to be concerned about your health and do something about achieving a more healthy weight."

8,Vacuum Hip-Lifting: A New Beauty Treatment,health-fitness," When it comes to beauty surgeries, hip-augmentation is what people often mention. According to the statistics release by American Society OF Plastic Surgeons(ASPS), hip-augmentation treatment sees the fastest growth in plastic surgery, which has doubled since 2013. The well-known beauty treatment in hip is “Brazilian butt lift”(BBL), created by celebrated Brazil plastic surgeon Ivo Pitanguy. In such operation, fat will be taken from one’s body like abdomen and then transplanted into butt(butt implants can be used in some cases) to enhance butts. However, it comes with drawbacks that can not be ignored despite its popularity among people. For those who take this operation for the first time, they may face the highest incidence of complications compared to other plastic surgery as well as up to eight-week downtime. The side effects usually include pains, hydrops and haemorrhage. Added to that, it is quite expensive with an average of about 5 grand. So, it is understandable that many seek to non-surgical treatments. Here is an increasingly popular way to lift butt, vacuum therapy. Unlike aforementioned “BBL”, the vacuum therapy is non-invasive, which means it can help lift your butt without making incisions in skin. What’s more, it is a kind of massage technique similar to lymphatic drainage. It use vacuum cups to help you lift and shape your bottom. As the picture shows, put two small vacuum cups on thigh and hip and put big vacuum cups on buttocks for 30 minutes. This treatment can help with lymphatic drainage, stimulate muscles, and transfer fat accumulation to make buttocks look smoother, firmer and plumper.

9,Easy Way For Weight-Loss,health-fitness," In our daily life, the topic of weight-loss is ubiquitous. It is possible that because of a fancy romantic dinner the night before, the girls started clamoring that they were about to lose weight, just because that dinner means a huge calorie intake. But in the face of alluring cate, most people often have no way to control themselves, so there will be some phased ways to lose weight. The common ways to lose weight in our life activities usually include the following: Keep on a diet: reduce energy intake. The scope of weight loss is the whole body, including the breast and buttocks. The effect of weight loss can be achieved by taking in lower energy than daily. This way is effective, but it is easy to rebound if you stop dieting. Exercise: increase energy output. The scope of weight loss is the whole body, including the breast and buttocks. By increasing the energy output beyond the daily life, the fat volume is reduced. This method is healthy, but it takes a long time to see the effect, and improper exercise methods may lead to excessive muscle development and affect the appearance. It is easy to rebound if you stop exercising. Weight loss drugs: there are many different weight loss drugs on the market, which can be called magic. But along with drugs comes side effect. Personally, this method is the least promising way to lose weight. The drug makes our brain nerves feel full, inhibits energy absorption and promotes defecation. It seems to be the simplest way to lose weight without dieting or exercise. But long-term drugs taking brings a double blow to your mind and body. If I have to choose one from the above three options, I will choose the healthiest exercise to lose weight. However, we now have more options. People in the beauty industry must know Cavitation for weight-loss. Today we will specifically introduce the Cavitation. What is Cavitation weight loss? Cavitation weight loss technology uses concentrated strong sound waves to rapidly vibrate fat cells, creating numerous vacuum holes inside and outside the fat cells, effectively hitting the fat cells, causing the fat cell membrane to burst inwardly, and decomposing triglycerides into glycerol and free fatty acids, then excreted from the body to achieve the effect of weight loss. Common treatment areas include the abdomen, thighs, and buttocks. What are the treatments and precautions of Cavitation machine? The Cavitation 40K only needs 15-20 minutes for one area at a time. Conventional ultrasonic weight loss instruments will be equipped with RF skin tightening, and the time is about 15-20 minutes for an area, so you don’t have to worry about sagging skin after the weight loss if you use them at the same time. So after losing weight, you have a slim and firm body. We need to avoid wearing any gold and silver jewelry decorations during operation. At the same time, our ultrasonic handle cannot be used on the back, because the fat on the back is not so concentrated compared to the fat on the abdomen, and the back is closer to our organs, so this needs to be paid attention to in use. If you have thick fat on your back, you can use negative pressure RF to remove it. What kind of Cavitation weight loss technology is currently on the market? The most common ones on the market now are Cavitation 1.0/ Cavitation 2.0 and the latest Cavitation 3.0. Cavitation 1.0: the noise is noisy, there are sharp tinnitus sounds during operation, and the customer’s experience is not very good. An ultrasound treatment takes about 15-20 minutes, and the customer’s ears will not be able to stand it for a long time. So we upgraded to 2.0. Cavitation 2.0: Silent fat explosion. We reduced the sharp tinnitus during the use of the 40K vibrator handle, which was highly praised by customers. That’s why you can see our 6in1 or 9in1 purple cavitation machines everywhere in the market. Including the follow-on series of MS-22S5SB/ MS-22S9SB are all developed and produced based on Cavitation 2.0 technology. Cavitation 3.0: This is the latest technology developed. Compared with cavitation 1.0 and Cavitation 2.0, we have doubled the energy of the ultrasonic vibrator, making it twice as effective as the previous versions. In addition, the way we hold the handle has also been upgraded to make the experience better, and our beauticians have a better experience as well. Here I would like to share the Cavitation 3.0 instrument. This new technology also has a particularly domineering brand name ""Cavtorm"". I hope you will like my sharing."

12,Keto Desserts,health-fitness," What is Keto Keto stands for ""ketogenic diet,"" which is characterized by a high-fat, moderate-protein, and low-carbohydrate diet. The keto diet's basic principle is to compel your body to cease burning glucose (sugar) for energy and instead burn fat. Carbohydrates are limited to 10% of daily dietary intake, whereas protein is only 20%. The rest is made up of fat. Eating a high-fat, low-carb diet puts your body into “ketosis,” a metabolic state in which your body burns fat instead of glucose for energy. Ketosis is thought to be the best state for losing weight. The ketogenic diet was created to address significant medical issues. The keto diet can help with cancer, PCOS, autism, and degenerative brain illnesses including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. For almost a century, the keto diet has been used to treat epilepsy. As a result, the keto diet is unquestionably a healing diet. Keto, on the other hand, is the most recent diet craze. It's being used to ""hack"" the body to achieve speedier weight reduction, exercise, and body-sculpting gains, in addition to being utilized medically. What are keto desserts? A keto dessert is one that is heavy in fat, moderate in protein, and low in carbs, according to the keto diet requirements. The following are some common keto dessert components (with links to the best sources): •	almond flour and coconut flour •	coconut cream/full-fat coconut milk •	heavy whipping cream •	full fat cream cheese, preferably cultured •	nuts or seeds, preferably soaked or sprouted •	berries, cranberries, lemon, and lime •	cacao powder, cocoa butter, and stevia-sweetened chocolate chips •	unsweetened, shredded coconut •	almond, peanut, and pecan butters •	eggs •	fats like butter, ghee, coconut oil, and avocado oil The absence of grains or grain-based flours, as well as any sort of sugar, whether white sugar or a complete sweetener like honey or maple syrup, distinguishes keto sweets. 5 Reasons Why I Eat Keto Desserts… Even Though I’m Not Keto Whether you agree with all or none of my reasoning, I hope you'll think that dessert isn't necessary for us in terms of nutrition. No one has ever gone hungry because of a lack of desserts. These reasons aren't ranked in any particular order. Maintaining my gut health, for example, is just as crucial to me as keeping my blood sugar in check. Here are the 5 reasons why I eat keto desserts even though I’m not keto 1 — I care about my gut health. Sugar allows harmful organisms in the stomach to multiply by feeding them sugar. Candida, SIBO, H. Pylori, and general digestive pain such as bloating, gas, and constipation are all symptoms of an excess of pathogenic organisms. If your microbiome already has an overpopulation of pathogenic bacteria or yeast, every time you take sugar, you're feeding the bad guys. Yes, even raw honey, coconut sugar, or maple syrup are unrefined, whole sweeteners. Those harmful organisms aren't picky. Sugar feeds harmful germs and yeasts, whether it's high fructose corn syrup from your Coke or raw honey from your backyard bees. 2 — I care about my blood sugar. My grandmothers were both diabetics. Diabetes runs in families, it's no secret. In addition, I've had my fair share of hypoglycemia. (Do you suffer from a blood sugar imbalance? Hypoglycemia is defined as a lack of glucose in the blood (low blood sugar). Headaches, intense hunger, dizziness, eyesight issues, weakness, irritability, nausea, and tremors are some of the bothersome and frequently frightening symptoms. The abrupt peaks and falls in insulin — the hormone that regulates our blood sugar — are caused by processed carbs and sugar in sweets. 3 — I care about inflammation. All types of sugar, except raw honey, are forbidden on any therapeutic diet, including AIP, GAPS, keto, low-FODMAPs, and Whole30. Even raw honey is restricted or not included at all, as is the case with Whole30. Why? Sugar is inflammatory, thus it's important to avoid it. When your blood sugar levels rise, your body produces cytokines, which are pro-inflammatory chemicals. The more sugar you consume, the more insulin your pancreas must produce to maintain a constant blood sugar level. Your cells get resistant to all that insulin over time. Insulin resistance is also a risk factor for diabetes. Excess sugar is deposited as visceral fat (i.e. belly fat) as a result of insulin resistance, which produces inflammatory chemicals. Sugar also works against the body's anti-inflammatory processes and anti-inflammatory nutrients. So, even if you eat all of the turmeric, kale, and coconut oil in the world, if you still eat a sugary dessert, you're undoing the benefits of those superfoods 4 — I care about my hormones. As I previously stated, healthy carbs are necessary for the creation of hormones in women. Carbohydrates are required by our adrenal glands. Carbohydrates are required by our ovaries. Carbohydrates are also necessary for our brains. I'm not sure why both sweet potatoes and refined sugar are referred to as ""carbs."" Doesn't it appear perplexing? It also drives us to categorize carbohydrates as ""good"" or ""evil,"" which is problematic. I don't believe in categorizing anything as ""good"" or ""evil."" So, let's divide carbs into those that help our hormones and those that don't. Hormone-supporting carbs are complex carbs: •	root veggies like carrots, beets, celeriac, and potatoes •	winter squashes like butternut squash, delicate squash, and pumpkin •	brown rice and wild rice •	soaked or sprouted beans •	soaked, sprouted, or soured gluten-free grains like oats, quinoa, buckwheat, and sorghum •	sweet potatoes Carb sources that do not support our hormones: •	sugar — in ALL forms •	whole sweeteners: coconut sugar, maple syrup, secant, evaporated cane juice, and honey •	processed foods like toaster waffles, breakfast cereals, “instant” anything, frozen pizza, commercial ice cream, deep-fried carbs 5 — I care about making every bite count. Be there wherever there is food. Comparing it to others on social media, your friends, or your favorite food bloggers is a bad idea. Simply be in the present moment. I used to follow the 80/20 rule, which stated that you should eat good, real food 80 percent of the time and binge on junk food the other 20% of the time. Again, if that's where you're at, accept it and move on. It's not about trying to be more like myself. I've discovered something incredibly liberating by eating intuitively and asking my body what she needs on a daily basis: I don't need to go crazy, ""be terrible,"" or do anything else with my diet 20% of the time. I don't even have the want or the need to do it. That yearning existed as long as some meals were considered ""off limits"" in my thinking. I'm currently focusing on eating healthful foods approximately 100 percent of the time. I'm concerned with making each bite count. Every food either nourishes or malnourishes me; it either feeds my best self or feeds disease. Keto desserts are nutrient-dense because to their emphasis on healthy fats, high-quality protein, and the absence of sugar. Even if it's dessert, those are the bits that matter. Why shouldn't dessert provide us with nourishment as well? This is why I avoid sugar, don't drink alcohol, and only dine at two carefully selected restaurants. It doesn't feel restrictive or rigid because I'm confident in my ability to eat healthily all of the time! About Keto After 50 The Keto After 50 program from Nutrition Hacks helps men and women over 50 lose weight while adhering to the keto diet. Nutrition Hacks claims to have tested its Keto After 50 program on ""thousands"" of beta testers and received rave reviews.

13,10 Tips to Help You Lose 10 Pounds in a Month,health-fitness," Losing ten pounds in a month is a difficult task, but it is achievable if you follow the appropriate tactics. The idea is to avoid crash diets, calorie deprivation, or excessive activity, and instead focus on developing healthy habits that you can maintain in the long run. Keep in mind that losing weight requires eating a balanced diet and sticking to a regular exercise regimen in order to burn more calories than you consume. We'll go over how to do precisely that in this article. You must consume fewer calories than you expend in order to lose weight. The quantity of calories you need to consume each day to lose weight is very varied and is determined on your age, current weight, height, sex, and degree of activity. You must first determine how many calories you require to maintain your weight. You can figure out how many calories you need by looking at the chart from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which breaks it down by age, gender, and amount of exercise. You can use a calorie tracker to get a more precise number because it takes into account more variables and allows you to track your calorie consumption. You'll need to deduct your daily calorie maintenance number from your daily calorie loss number to get your daily calories for weight reduction. If you want to lose 10 pounds in a month, and the month is around five weeks long, you'll need to cut or burn 1,000 calories per day. Eating more fiber-rich foods (such as fruits and vegetables) will help you feel fuller while eating less calories and lose weight. According to a February 2015 study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, simply aiming to eat 30 grams of fiber each day will help you lose weight as successfully as a more sophisticated diet. Fiber-filled foods include: •	Acorn squash •	Avocados •	Beans •	Berries •	Edamame •	Green peas •	Lentils •	Seeds (chia, flaxseed) •	Sweet potatoes If you're trying to lose weight, don't cut back on protein; in fact, a meta-analysis of 18 studies published in Advances in Nutrition in December 2019 suggests that you should increase the quantity of this nutrient in your diet. Protein keeps you full and helps you lose weight while maintaining your lean muscle mass. Aim for 1.3 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (a kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds). For example, if you weigh 200 pounds, you should try to consume roughly 118 grams of protein each day. The formula is as follows: (Your body weight / 2.2) x 1.3 = grams of protein per day To be mindful of calories, choose lean foods high in protein, such as: •	Chicken breast •	Ground turkey •	Lentils •	Salmon •	Tofu •	Low- or nonfat yogurt Soda, we're talking about you (and other sweetened beverages). Sugary drinks don't provide any nutrients, but they do add a lot of calories to your day. Indeed, a study published in Obesity Reviews in August 2013 proved conclusively that sugar-sweetened beverages cause weight gain. Replace calorie-dense beverages like soda, energy drinks, and the like with water or unsweetened seltzer. Make sure you're drinking lots of water to stay hydrated, which helps your body perform at its optimum (which includes calorie burning), according to the American Council on Exercise. According to a study published in the journal Obesity in August 2015, consuming a full glass of water around a half hour before each meal may help you avoid overeating. A decent general rule of thumb is to drink half your body weight in ounces each day. If you weigh 200 pounds, drink around 100 ounces of water every day. Ultra-processed foods (those with large ingredient lists full of strange terminology) have been related to weight gain and obesity in studies, thus restricting or eliminating these items may help you lose weight. The main culprits, according to a review published in Current Treatment Options in Gastroenterology in November 2019, are: •	Potato chips •	Sweets and desserts •	Sugary drinks •	Refined grains (white rice and foods made with white flour, like white bread and crackers, for example) •	Red and processed meats Changing your diet isn't the only way to lose weight. You'll also need a fitness regimen if you want to lose 10 pounds in a month. The CDC suggests obtaining at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio (walking, biking), 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity cardio (running, swimming), or a combination of both per week to reach (and maintain) a healthy weight. It does mention, though, that some people may need to do more to see the scale shift. Choose an aerobic exercise that you enjoy and that you can undertake for at least 30 minutes most days of the week. Here are some suggestions: •	Running •	Brisk walking •	Hiking •	Swimming •	Cycling •	Rollerblading If you want to lose 10 pounds, you should include high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in your workout routine. This entails alternating high-intensity activity (ranging from 20 to 60 seconds) with short, lower-intensity recuperation periods. According to a February 2018 review in Sports Medicine that looked at 39 studies on the topic, HIIT workouts are an effective strategy to burn fat and lose weight. The best aspect is that they are quick. In a January 2017 study published in the Journal of Diabetes Research, people who completed HIIT for 36 minutes eliminated the same amount of body fat as those who did moderate-intensity exercise for 68 minutes. You don't want to do HIIT every day, though. Try doing it two or three times per week, and space out sessions. Cardio workouts burn calories in the short term, but strength training is superior for long-term weight loss and maintenance since it helps you build muscle, which burns more calories than fat, as previously stated (aka supports a higher metabolism). At least twice a week, the CDC recommends undertaking full-body muscle-strengthening activities. So, if you aim to lose 10 pounds through exercising, a pair of dumbbells can be a good investment. You could ruin your weight loss if you don't get enough sleep. According to a research published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in October 2010, cutting calories when you're sleep deprived causes you to lose more lean muscle mass rather than fat. Furthermore, according to a November 2019 study published in the Journal of Lipid Research, people who don't get enough sleep accumulate fat faster and feel less satisfied after eating (which can lead to overeating and weight gain)."

However, taking the improper supplements can sometimes result in a harmful chemical imbalance in the body. That's right: certain supplements can have a detrimental impact on a person's ability to lose weight. That is why we have come. Meticore is the subject of our review today. The supplement is precisely created to assist people enhance their ""core body temperature,"" according to the Meticore official website. The site explains that body temperature is a contributor to weight reduction ability that many consumers overlook, citing various major study studies in the scientific sector. In fact, two studies discovered that women with “unexplained weight gain” shared one trait: a low core body temperature. What is Meticore? Meticore is a weight-loss supplement that users can take without dieting to help them achieve their weight-loss goals. There is no need to exercise because the regimen just takes one capsule every day. In a nutshell, the Meticore weight loss diet supplement is designed to aid rather than hinder weight loss. Losing weight appears to be a difficult task for anyone, and it may appear that the only thing a person is losing is their mind. Everyone loses their willpower before they even see a reduced clothing size because there is so much confusion about what to eat and what not to eat. Taking supplements has become a popular way to make a difference, and Meticore requires no more effort from the user. Meticore focuses on assisting people in controlling their hunger with minimal effort (beyond a daily dose). Even if there are a few limitations, the formula is relatively user-friendly. Users will feel changes in the functioning of their major organs as they take the formula, as well as an increase in energy levels as their body loses weight. Customers will also notice improvements in their digestive system as a benefit. How does Meticore Work? Meticore isn't just a diet pill, for starters. It's a fully functional dietary supplement. It operates on the premise of a boosted or triggered metabolism, which effectively accelerates the rate at which the body burns fat, flushes toxins, and replenishes energy reserves. Have you ever observed someone who can eat everything they want, as often as they want, yet not gain a pound? If you're obese, on the other hand, you might just think about food and gain a few pounds. (Of course, we're joking.) The heightened metabolism of these persons is the explanation for their lack of weight gain. People who are overweight now have a lower core body temperature than those who are thinner. An increase in core temperature stimulates cellular activity, which boosts the body's metabolic rate. Meticore operates on this concept. When ingested on a daily basis, it raises your body's core temperature and activates your metabolism, causing you to burn fat more quickly. Along with this, it’s ingredients – •	Contain anti-inflammatory properties •	Support Skin and Hair Health •	Support Joint Health •	Support the health of your heart. •	Support Blood Sugar Levels •	Are completely safe with no side-effects •	Are completely plant-based and vegetarian friendly How to determine if I have a slow Metabolism? There are ways you can determine yourself if your body’s metabolic rate is not optimum. Some of them are – Weight Gain – People with slow metabolism often see a continuous weight gain. Minor indulgences can result in those extra pounds. Difficulty in Losing Weight – People with slow metabolic rate also have difficulty in losing weight despite dieting or exercises Indigestion, Constipation, or Acid Reflux – Slow metabolism can result in your digestive system not working to its optimum levels, which results in frequent indigestion, constipation, or acid reflux issues. Fatigue – A common sign of a slow metabolic system is fatigue. Other Symptoms – A few other symptoms may include hair fall, brittle nails, and dry skin. P.S – The symptoms listed above are not just limited to slow metabolic rate – it is best to consult a medical professional. Why is Appetite Control an Effective Form of Weight Loss? Meticore, like many other weight-loss formulations on the market, focuses on the impact of appetite control on weight loss, but why? Controlling appetite sends a message to the brain that it doesn't need to eat all the time to meet the body's needs. Because many people gain weight as a result of ingesting too many calories, the first step is frequently to reduce those calories. Because tracking calories can be a time-consuming and stressful endeavor, using supplements to curb hunger can help. The chemicals in Meticore don't inherently help a person feel less hungry, but they do reduce the tension that might lead to emotional eating. When the body's cortisol levels are high, the individual naturally looks out ways to feel better. Chocolate, for example, can cause the release of ""happy"" hormones in the brain, swiftly transforming one's mood. That is why, in order to please themselves, people turn to sweets and other delights, and why so many individuals struggle with food addictions. Reduced hunger and reduced stress are two simple methods to overcome the habit of always reaching for unhealthy foods to deal with life's hazards and challenges. As a result of the adjustment, customers are consuming fewer calories than they would normally, resulting in a natural deficit. Because the body doesn't have as many calories to burn, it naturally compensates by obtaining the nutrients it already has. The body begins to lose weight as these calories are used up. However, because there are no extra calories to contribute to the body, it also prevents new weight growth. Meticore customers do not need to follow any special diet or begin any exercise program in order for the process to work for them in terms of weight loss. While these behaviors might magnify the impact, Meticore's effects automatically lower weight by simply establishing a deficit."
15,Manage Your Diabetes Naturally,health-fitness," There is a wealth of information on type 2 diabetes available. Google searches will provide pages and pages of information regarding the causes, treatments, and consequences of not treating the condition. With all of this information available, the way type 2 diabetes is addressed in popular media and consumer health venues is shockingly inconsistent. The majority of articles or news reports regarding type 2 diabetes have a similar structure: they indicate the percentage of people who have been diagnosed with the disease, how the rate of type 2 diabetes diagnoses is increasing, and all of the health complications that come with it. These figures and facts are invariably described as ""astonishing"" and the consequences as ""dire."" Many will go on to say things like ""type 2 diabetes is a perfectly preventable ailment,"" making anyone diagnosed with the disease feel completely responsible for their condition. They go on to lay out a series of stringent dietary and exercise guidelines that you must follow in order to manage your condition. They'll be presented as ""simple"" or ""easy,"" but they'll almost always be completely unrealistic and so unsustainable. Finally, they'll threaten that if you don't follow the instructions, you'll be executed. While there are efforts that can be taken to lower the chance of having diabetes, it is impossible to totally remove the risk. Furthermore, if you already have diabetes, it isn't ""all your fault,"" and maintaining type 2 diabetes doesn't have to be a full-time job. So, here are the steps you can follow easily. It's normal for people who have been diagnosed with diabetes to assume that they can no longer eat a wide variety of meals. Many patients claim that after being diagnosed, they were ordered to avoid ""anything white,"" such as white bread, white pasta, white rice, white potatoes, and even bananas. Others feel that sugar-containing foods, such as desserts and many fruits, must be avoided. The idea is that certain foods have a higher carbohydrate content than other foods, hence they will have a greater impact on blood sugar levels. It's true that when significant amounts of carbohydrate are ingested all at once, the bodies of people with diabetes have a harder time absorbing them. That isn't to say that high-carbohydrate diets are no longer acceptable or ""bad"" for the body. Carbohydrate is still an important food for people with and without diabetes since it is a source of energy. It simply implies that someone with type 2 diabetes's body may require more assistance in utilizing this carbohydrate as efficiently and effectively as possible. BALANCED MEALS ARE KEY TO NATURALLY MANAGING DIABETES Aiming for balance in meals is one way we may provide such help. I'm not going to give you a formula for what constitutes balanced eating since there isn't one. Rather, balanced eating is a set of concepts that can be applied in a variety of ways. It basically entails preparing meals that include the majority of the major food categories the most of the time. •	Carbohydrate is the most vital fuel for the body, and it is found in starchy vegetables and grains. Potatoes and winter squash, as well as bread and rice, are all good choices. •	Dietary fiber included in fruits and vegetables helps to slow the release of carbohydrate from the digestive tract into the bloodstream. •	Protein-rich foods (meat, fish, eggs, and beans) aid to decrease the absorption of carbohydrates into the bloodstream while also controlling the hunger hormone ghrelin. Slower glucose release allows the body to respond more quickly to the incoming carbohydrate. All of this leads to more constant blood sugar levels, which leads to a more stable appetite and can even help lessen food cravings. The takeaway here is that combining carbohydrate with other foods, particularly those high in fiber and protein, aids overall blood sugar regulation by limiting carbohydrate absorption from the GI tract. Instead of focusing on what you need to eliminate from your diet, consider what you may add to help your health. Balanced diet helps to alleviate emotions of deprivation in addition to addressing the body's basic needs. One common issue is that when people believe they ""shouldn't"" eat carbohydrates, their desire for the banned meal grows. This can lead to eating habits that aren't good for our physical or mental health in the long run. The ability to resist temptation lessens as those sensations of deprivation grow stronger. We eventually “give in” and eat the forbidden because we have “already blown it” — we say to ourselves, “What the hell, I might as well eat it all and start over tomorrow. This becomes an unpleasant, repeated cycle which can compound our physical health issues and lead to a tormented mental state regarding food. Finally, we've included some fun meals because enjoyment is an important aspect of a well-balanced, health-promoting diet. Fun foods are those that don't have a lot of nutritional value but taste great and are something you love eating. That means eating a dish of ice cream after dinner, having birthday cake at a birthday celebration, and bringing potato chips to work are all OK and even encouraged. Because it's much easier to eat these things in ways that are good for our bodies when we make them permissible. It's beneficial to feed the body in a consistent and predictable manner throughout the day. This is true for everyone, but it is especially beneficial for diabetics. Providing the body with enough fuel and a variety of nutrients throughout the day helps to maintain blood sugar levels and appetite hormones, which aids in appetite regulation. When we go lengthy periods of time between meals or skip meals entirely, the hormones that control our hunger fluctuate, and our blood sugar levels drop. These changes cause the body to warn us that we're running out of gas and that we'll need to fill up soon. The more we delay, the more pressing the need becomes, the stronger the signs get, and the less at ease we become. The acute hunger pangs that continue to afflict us may make us irritated, unable to concentrate, and distracted. Our demand for high-carbohydrate foods grows as well. In these circumstances, we will naturally seek for items that can help us spike our blood sugar and meet our immediate energy needs. Foods with a high carbohydrate and fat content (such as candy bars and potato chips) are ideal for this. As a result, we eat them. And we frequently overindulge in them. Because once we start eating, we tend to eat quite quickly. Again, our bodies are communicating an urgent need to us through unpleasant sensations, and we want those sensations to go away. The faster we eat, the quicker we can get rid of our discomfort. Except that we frequently experience discomfort in the opposite way, since once our bodies have had time to catch up and absorb all we've eaten, we realize we've overcompensated and over devoured, leaving us feeling uncomfortably full. Because there is little there to assist slow down the digestion and absorption of the carbohydrate that was consumed so quickly, a person with diabetes may find that their blood sugar levels spike, meaning they rise extremely high, extremely quickly. Mindfulness is defined as paying attention in the current moment without making any judgments. It's being able to notice and respond to our experiences, in this case the sensations in our bodies surrounding hunger, fullness, and appetite. When we can become more attentive to moderate hunger, we can intervene before it becomes intense hunger and the previously described chain of events is set in motion. Furthermore, as we get more attuned to pleasant fullness, we will be able to respond to it (if we so choose) before being uncomfortably full and our blood sugar levels becoming too high. Move over, as we get more aware of our bodily hunger and fullness cues, we become more aware of our non-hunger cues to eat as well. Emotional cues (such as stress, anger, grief, and so on), physical cues (such as weariness, pain, hormone fluctuations, thirst, and so on), and environmental cues (such as certain people, places, or activities, and so on) all contribute to our desire to eat. The core of the urge for food in these circumstances isn't a physiological requirement for sustenance, but some other need that we're attempting to meet with food. What role does this play in blood sugar control? When it comes to eating, mindfulness can help us eat in a way that is more in line with our bodies' true requirements. We are better equipped to make decisions that support our general well-being, including blood sugar control, when we pay attention to cues. Because diabetes treatment entails more than just what we eat, it's also crucial to consider how we move. We emphasize the value of joyful exercise at Green Mountain at Fox Run. That is, movement that feels pleasant in the body and accepts that everyone's ""correct"" movement is different. For far too many diabetic women, exercise has become a necessary evil for maintaining physical health. The problem is that, when we consider mobility in this light, it is nearly hard to sustain it over time. We begin to despise it. Because of the unpleasantness we associate with it, we eventually give up on it completely. We may build a movement habit that we actually keep to and, dare I say, even look forward to and enjoy if we adjust our mindset from ""exercising because I have to"" to ""moving because it feels good."" Movement is helpful for women with diabetes because it helps to regulate blood sugar levels by encouraging the body to use up blood sugar as a fuel source, and improves the body’s cells sensitivity to insulin, meaning less insulin is needed to return blood sugar levels to normal. And, when we do something that feels good and that we appreciate, it releases a large number of feel-good neurotransmitters. These may not have a direct effect on blood sugar levels, but they can indirectly reduce stress and motivate us to continue acting in ways that benefit our general health and well-being. Stress has the ability to affect blood sugar levels regardless of what you eat or drink. When we are under stress, our bodies go into fight-or-flight mode. In order to fight or run, the body releases stored energy, including glucose, into the bloodstream, resulting in substantial and rapid spikes in blood glucose levels. Because the body of a person with diabetes is less able to handle large influxes of glucose, those levels can remain elevated in the blood for a long time. Chronic stress can cause persistently increased blood glucose levels that are unrelated to diet. And, it is prolonged elevated glucose levels that contributes to many of the associated health risks. Furthermore, because we are so focused on our immediate needs and experiences when we are stressed, it can be difficult to make decisions that are in the best interests of our long-term health. For example, we may be aware that some eating patterns (such as indulging in a huge piece of concentrated sweets all at once) are detrimental to blood glucose regulation, yet when we are stressed, we rely on food to help us meet an urgent need: coping with the stressor. What about medications for diabetes? Some people can control their blood sugar levels by making dietary and lifestyle modifications. Others, though, are not. Medications can play a vital and necessary role in type 2 diabetes management, and there is no shame in using them. They can also be a great addition to other tactics, such as those outlined in this article, for those trying to reduce their pharmaceutical usage."
16,Ketogenic Diet,health-fitness," What is a ketogenic diet? The ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-fat diet that resembles the Atkins and low-carb diets in many ways. It entails substantially lowering carbohydrate intake and substituting fat. This decrease in carbs causes your body to enter a metabolic state known as ketosis. Your body becomes very effective at burning fat for energy when this happens It also causes fat to be converted to ketones in the liver, which can be used to provide energy to the brain. Ketogenic diets can lower blood sugar and insulin levels significantly. This, combined with the increased ketones, offers a number of health advantages. The ketogenic diet comes in a variety of forms, including: •	Standard ketogenic diet (SKD): This is a very low carb, moderate protein and high fat diet. It typically contains 70% fat, 20% protein, and only 10% carbs. •	Cyclical ketogenic diet (CKD): This diet involves periods of higher carb refeeds, such as 5 ketogenic days followed by 2 high carb days. •	Targeted ketogenic diet (TKD): This diet allows you to add carbs around workouts. •	High protein ketogenic diet: This is similar to a standard ketogenic diet. The ratio is often 60% fat, 35% protein, and 5% carbs. •	However, only the traditional and high-protein ketogenic diets have been thoroughly researched. More advanced ketogenic diets, such as cyclical or targeted ketogenic diets, are largely employed by bodybuilders and athletes. •	Although many of the same concepts apply to all variations of the ketogenic diet, the information in this article largely refers to the standard ketogenic diet (SKD). What is ketosis? It's a metabolic state in which your body burns fat instead of carbohydrates for energy. It occurs when you drastically restrict your carbohydrate intake, decreasing your body's availability of glucose (sugar), which is the cells' primary source of energy. The most effective strategy to enter ketosis is to eat a ketogenic diet. In general, this entails restricting carb intake to 20 to 50 grams per day and focusing on fats such meat, fish, eggs, nuts, and good fats. It's also crucial to keep your protein intake in check. This is because if you eat too much protein, it will be turned to glucose, which will slow down your ketosis. Health benefits of keto The ketogenic diet was originally developed to treat neurological illnesses like epilepsy. Studies have now proven that eating a healthy diet can help with a wide range of health issues: •	Heart disease. Body fat, HDL (good) cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels can all benefit from a ketogenic diet. •	Cancer. Because it may help limit tumor growth, the diet is currently being researched as an additional cancer treatment. •	Alzheimer’s disease. The keto diet may assist to alleviate Alzheimer's disease symptoms and halt the disease's progression. •	Epilepsy. The ketogenic diet has been found in studies to help children with epilepsy have fewer seizures. •	Parkinson’s disease. Although additional research is needed, one study found that the diet can help with Parkinson's disease symptoms. •	Polycystic ovary syndrome. The ketogenic diet can aid in the reduction of insulin levels, which may be important in polycystic ovarian syndrome. •	Brain injuries. According to some studies, eating a healthy diet can help people recover from traumatic brain injuries. A sample keto meal plan for 1 week To help get you started, here’s a sample ketogenic diet meal plan for one week: Monday •	breakfast: veggie & egg muffins with tomatoes •	lunch: chicken salad with olive oil, feta cheese, olives, and a side salad •	dinner: salmon with asparagus cooked in butter Tuesday •	breakfast: egg, tomato, basil, and spinach omelet •	lunch: almond milk, peanut butter, spinach, cocoa powder, and stevia milkshake with a side of sliced strawberries •	dinner: cheese-shell tacos with salsa Wednesday •	breakfast: nut milk chia pudding topped with coconut and blackberries •	lunch: avocado shrimp salad •	dinner: pork chops with Parmesan cheese, broccoli, and salad Thursday •	breakfast: omelet with avocado, salsa, peppers, onion, and spices •	lunch: a handful of nuts and celery sticks with guacamole and salsa •	dinner: chicken stuffed with pesto and cream cheese, and a side of grilled zucchini Friday •	breakfast: sugar-free Greek, whole milk yogurt with peanut butter, cocoa powder, and berries •	lunch: ground beef lettuce wraps tacos with sliced bell peppers •	dinner: loaded cauliflower and mixed veggies Saturday •	breakfast:  cream cheese pancakes with blueberries and a side of grilled mushrooms •	lunch:  zucchini & beet “noodle” salad •	dinner: white fish cooked in coconut oil with kale and toasted pine nuts Sunday •	breakfast: fried eggs with and mushrooms •	lunch: low carb sesame chicken and broccoli •	dinner: spaghetti squash Bolognese Always aim to rotate your vegetables and meat, as each type delivers various nutrients and health advantages.

20,Importance of Embryo Grading in IVF,health-fitness," IVF is a technique that has gained popularity worldwide to treat infertility. IVF involves various steps. The first step of IVF treatment is to stimulate the ovaries to produce mature eggs. Then, eggs are retrieved from the ovaries, and sperms are bifurcated from the semen sample. The eggs and sperms are mixed for fertilization to form embryos. Once embryos are formed, some of them are transferred to the uterus for conception. But before this, embryo grading is done to choose the best quality of embryo for a successful IVF cycle. Embryo grading is a process that helps embryologists to determine, the best day of embryo transfer, the quality of embryo to transfer, and the suitable number of embryos to transfer. Embryo grading is a subjective matter and depends on the discretion of the embryologist to judge the quality of the embryo. It is done on Day 3 (Cleavage stage) and Day 5 (Blastocyst stage) of the fertilization. Experts decide the grading of an embryo based on the appearance of the embryo, the patient's age, fertility history, and medical history. Why Embryo Grading is performed? Dr. Shivani Sachdev Gour – the best IVF Specialist in Delhi explains the following importance for performing embryo grading. Embryo grading helps to identify the quality of embryo to transfer. Using the healthiest embryo for conception reduces the chances of IVF process failure. It checks whether an embryo has the potential for development or not. For this, all the components of the embryo must examine to ensure a successful pregnancy. How Embryo Grading is done? Grading is done by the embryologists in the following two stages of embryo development. •	Cleavage Stage: This stage is reached on day 3 of the fertilization. In this stage, the embryo starts dividing (cleaving) into cells. However, the embryo has not developed in the size. Embryologists determine grading by checking the grade of fragmentation along with the appearance and number of cells. The following grades are there for embryo assessment. Grade A: The embryos with 6-8 equally sized cells. It must have no or less than 10% fragmentation. Grade B: The embryos having cells of uneven or irregular shape with 25-50% fragmentation. Grade C: The embryos having an unequal size with 50% or more fragmentation. Grade D: It is the lowest grade and poor-quality embryo. It has less possibility to grow further. Grade A and B have the highest potential to develop further. Blastocyst Stage: This stage is reached on day 5 of the fertilization. In this stage, embryos start to enlarge to tightly confine the zona pellucida (the membrane surrounding an ovum). Grading in this stage is more accurate. It depends on the degree of cavity expansion, the appearance of inner cell mass, and the trophectoderm that creates the placenta. The first part of this grading is a number from 1 to 6, where 6 is the most expanded cavity. The second part is letters from A to D, where A is tightly packed cells; while D has few cells. The third part is another letter that signifies the quality of the trophectoderm. For successful IVF treatment, contact SCI IVF Hospital – the best IVF center in Delhi NCR."

2,Me and My Menopause,health-fitness," Surgical menopause can be a daunting prospect and many of the experiences shared online are negative. Here’s my own more encouraging story of how I managed surgical menopause successfully. “Will I still be me?” Sitting in my hospital gown, waiting to be taken to theatre, I begged the surgeon for reassurance. Surgical menopause followed a shock diagnosis of womb cancer at 42. Slim, fit and healthy, I never imagined that some abnormal bleeding was a sign of cancer. Still in shock after my appointment with the gynaecologist to get the results of my scan and the action plan, I took the pile of leaflets the specialist nurse handed me to take home and read. And, out of all that pile, the most frightening was easily the one about menopause. Surgery, I could cope with that. Cancer, well the surgery would fix it anyway. But the menopause symptoms were more than just daunting. By the time I’d finished reading through the list, I could already see my future. Not only would I have the hot flushes I already knew about, but I was also going to become a fat, wrinkled, feeble, moody creature with sagging breasts, dry hair, no sex drive, and probably osteoporosis, who couldn’t concentrate anymore. I told myself the leaflet was just giving worst case scenarios and turned to the internet for reassurance. But it only made it worse. The forums were full of people comparing the problems they had after menopause. Nobody had anything positive to say. Weight gain, especially, was something nobody had escaped. I think it was the potential mood and personality changes that scared me most. As the surgery date got nearer, I got more and more panicky. Would I lose my friendliness, sense of humour, and wit? Would I be grumpy and boring? On the morning of my surgery, I even texted all my friends to say that if I became horrible suddenly, they shouldn’t take it personally. Surgery over and a good night’s rest, and I seemed to be the same person mood-wise. Now to see what I could do to try and prevent some of the other ravages of menopause. I wasn’t going to go down without a fight. I read up everything I could find and embarked on a full-scale battles. Inactivity increases the risk of weight gain. From 48 hours after surgery, I was already trying to limit how much time I spent in my bed. As soon as I could manage it, I went for daily walks, slowly progressing from around the block to my usual twice daily half-hour walks. After a few months, I even added in another walk at lunchtime. To be on the safe side, I also stopped eating junk food when I got home from work each day – a habit I had developed in my previous and very stressful job. Snacking on junk was limited to weekends only. Sagging breasts are due to the loss of collagen but a tip I read was to work on the chest muscles which could then help to hold them up a bit better at least, and keep them moisturised. I bought some weights and began using them every morning, and applied moisturiser to my breasts regularly. I started a daily facial moisturising regime, and I bought a shampoo designed for dry hair. Specialist vaginal moisturisers didn’t help for me at all, and lubricant alone wasn’t enough. After I developed a sore area where the skin was breaking down, the consultant advised using Dermol cream and that did the trick. I tried not to think about cognitive or memory issues because I didn’t want the power of suggestion to make it happen. I just carried on with work. Keeping my mind active was probably the best thing to do. I took note of when the hot flushes happened and linked a lot of them to postural triggers, such as bending over or moving my left shoulder forward. Identifying those triggers helped me to avoid some of them. I lift my foot onto the bed to tie my shoes. I keep my phone on the left side of my desk so I don’t end up moving that shoulder forward when I’m looking at it. Etc. At night, I found that if my shoulders were bare, I was cooler, so I began wearing sleeveless pyjamas. I also invested in a cooling gel pillow. Results? I ended up happier, healthier and fitter than ever before. Caring for my body was great for my self-image and all the exercise was great for my mood. Cutting out the junk food got my (Type 1) diabetes better controlled and I didn’t gain weight after all. All the extra exercises I started doing to strengthen my muscles improved my figure, my posture is better and my breasts don’t sag. My hair looks like it always did. I’m still working and even doing some studying as well so I guess my brain is okay. When I went back for my four-week follow-up, the specialist nurse was amazed at how good I looked. Three years later, I would say not only am I still me, I’m an improved version, thanks to the healthy habits I developed to combat the effects of menopause. And you can be the same. Don’t be discouraged by the negative experiences highlighted in forums."

6,Could diabetes be a side effect of Covid-19?,health-fitness," It is believed that diabetes is an increased risk factor for COVID-19 infection. New clinical data and experiments show that this can work in the opposite direction: scientists are recording new cases where COVID-19 has sharply provoked type 1 diabetes in humans. The World Health Organization considers diabetes to be one of the existing diseases, on a par with respectable age, which can make someone more vulnerable to a severe COVID infection. Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease with metabolic disorders in children or adults, which consists of a deficiency of insulin, along with an increase in blood glucose levels. The illness is accompanied by weakness, constant thirst, poor healing of wounds on the skin, weakened immune system, complicated by obesity, hypertension, heart and kidney failure. COVID-19 belongs to a viral infection of the genus Coronavirus, which is poorly understood today and which causes unpredictable consequences. If a healthy body is still able to cope with the disease or its consequences, then people with diabetes mellitus and coronavirus, as well as other severe chronic diseases are likely to be at risk of severe health problems, up to death. Why is diabetes dangerous with coronavirus, how to protect yourself from complications? ""Diabetes is like dynamite if you get COVID-19,"" said Paul Zimmet, a scientist at Monash University in Australia. Zimmet believes that diabetes not only increases the risk of complications from the coronavirus but also COVID-19 can cause a sharp development of the disease. HOW DOES COVID-19 AFFECT DIABETES? Any severe illness in diabetics, including coronavirus, is characterized by: -low resistance - the body is unable to cope with the pathogen; -difficult recovery after any disease; -concomitant complications of the cardiovascular, respiratory system, central nervous system. HOW IS DIABETES DANGEROUS ABOUT COVID-19 AND DIABETES? In diabetic pathology, the new viral strain poses a serious threat for the following reasons: -higher risk of blood infection, -complex prolonged course of pneumonia, -as well as a high probability of respiratory failure. When tested positive for COVID-19, it is important to control blood sugar levels, timely adjust the glycemic index. Otherwise, a favorable environment is created for the reproduction of pathogenic microflora, pneumonia is difficult to treat, literally exhausting the already weakened body. To date, a direct link between the deaths of patients with coronavirus in type 1 or type 2 diabetes has not been reliably determined. The statistics are relentless: -more than 10% of deaths are patients with COVID-19 with background cardiovascular pathology; -about 7-8% - for patients with coronavirus and type 2 diabetes; -2-5% of mortality is registered in patients with other severe pathologies of internal organs and systems. WHAT DO PEOPLE WITH DIABETES NEED TO DO AT THE PEAK OF THE EPIDEMIC AND IN QUARANTINE? Due to forced self-isolation, it is important to anticipate possible risks and follow these recommendations: -make a supply of insulin for replacement therapy; -regularly monitor blood sugar levels; -treat hands and glucometer with antiseptic before performing a blood test; -follow a diet; -adhere to a plentiful drinking regime; -to control the intake of immunomodulatory drugs to stimulate systemic immunity; -adhere to the regime of self-isolation, without the need to leave the house, regularly ventilate the room; -take vitamins, all drugs prescribed by a doctor; -call a doctor at the first alarming symptoms. TO SUM UP There were no registered cases when diabetes was a side effect to COVID-19 patients. However, patients who are already diagnosed with diabetes mellitus should be especially careful as the virus is more dangerous to them than to healthy people due to the weakened immune system. Take care and follow all your doctor's recommendations, try to limit your social connections, and immediately report to the hospital staff about any suspicious symptoms. Do not be indifferent.

8,Why drinking 8 cups of water daily can really harm you,health-fitness," According to a study conducted by Tamara Hew-Butler, an Associate Professor of Exercise and Sports Since at the Wayne State University, she uncovered that drinking 8 cups of water on a daily basis can actually kill rather than save lives. Excessive water intake can be strenuous for the kidney to deal with. Because total body water balance, or what we exercise scientists call homeostasis, is complicated, mammals survive by making real-time adjustments at the kidney. That’s why when it comes to hydration, our kidneys are king. There is an undercover network of aquaporin-2 (AQP-2) water channels inside each kidney – we only need one (we are born with a spare just in case) – that react to the hormone arginine vasopressin. The primary anti-diuretic (water retention) hormone in the body. The posterior pituitary gland secretes it in response to nerve signals received from advanced brain sensors that detect subtle changes in water balance. Circumventricular organs are the name for these complex sensors. The kidneys will make molecular adjustments to both underhydration and overhydration within 40 seconds in response to any upset in the water balance. These adjustments result from the mobilization armies of AQP-2 water channels, numbering about 12 million per collecting duct cell. This is why when we drink more water than our body needs {8 cups of water} – above thirst – we immediately have to pee out any excess water. Or when we forget our water bottle during practice, we stop peeing to conserve body water. This quick coordinated action between the brain, cranial nerves and kidneys is far more efficient and precise than any phone app, gadget or personalized recommendation available. Is there anything good to come out of this? According to research, drinking about two liters of water a day prevents the development of kidney stones in people who have previously had kidney stones and reduces the amount of bladder infections in people who have previously had bladder infections. Increased water intake does not appear to improve skin tone, kidney function, or constipation, according to science. Water alone does not help children lose weight because it replaces the consumption of higher-calorie drinks like soda or helps people feel ""full"" before meals. Image Some people's mental health can be affected by drinking water. Some studies show that the water intake improves cognitive efficiency, while females with anxiety say that compulsive water consumption makes them feel better, possibly due to the activation of reward circuits that increase dopamine. Many schizophrenic patients claim that ""voices"" order them to drink and that drinking water silences these voices. It's worth noting that brain imaging studies show that excessive drinking is uncomfortable and takes more muscle activity than drinking when you're thirsty. Since “social polydipsia” induces chronic peeing (polyuremia), our brain tends to prevent chronic overdrinking, or polydipsia. Is it enough to drink eight glasses of water a day? Unless you're thirsty, drinking more water is unlikely to improve your wellbeing, but it's also unlikely to hurt you. If kidneys could chat, they'd say that hydration problems are nothing more than well-publicized peeing competitions."

10,Breast Cancer goes from 0-150 mph in under 9 seconds,health-fitness," Breast Cancer goes from 0-150mph in under 9 seconds ‘Don’t Wait for the Green Light’ is Andy’s sometimes humorous but highly emotional new book about her fight to get back on the race track. Perth, Western Australia, July 2020: Andy Kahle turned her blog – written to keep her family up to date while she was undergoing cancer treatment – into her new book, “Don’t Wait for the Green Light”. Instead of being your standard Breast Cancer survival story, this book is a collection of emotional and often humorous situations that Andy found herself in while she put her motor racing on hold to fight a disease that affects 1 in 8 women. “Everyone needs something to inspire them to keep fighting, and mine was the knowledge that I would get back in my race car. ” While superstition says that back luck comes in 3’s, Andy didn’t allow this to sway her “need” to race down the quarter mile in Australia’s first compact car – the Holden Torana. First she blew up the transmission the day before she was supposed to get her racing license, then her husband – Mick – slipped in the shower and impaled himself on the tap, that very same evening. And if you’re waiting for the other shoe to drop … just as the racing season was coming to a close, and hubby was on the mend, Andy was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of breast cancer, forcing her dream on hold. There is a saying in drag racing, that if you wait until you see the green light before you leave the start line, you will miss out. So is the case in real life. Sometimes it’s better to put your foot flat to the floor and accelerate to where you want to be. While Andy’s book “Don’t Wait for the Green Light” starts with the uncertainty of a life changing diagnosis, Andy takes this as an opportunity to look at everything with her trademark wry humour. Situations such as the mood lighting and 70s style attire while getting a mammogram, or the nervous foot jiggling, plastic chair wobbling of her husband while she read outdated magazines in the doctors waiting room, Andy has managed to maintain the gravity of her journey while still demonstrating the importance of enjoying every moment and focussing on her ultimate goal of racing again. Available in paperback or e-book, via Amazon, Andy has also provided the option to purchase a signed copy of “Don’t Wait for the Green Light” direct from her charity race car website – Therapy on Wheels. (www.TherapyonWheels.asn.au) Despite being told she had a high risk of recurrence, at the age of 51 Andy Kahle has now been cancer free for over 10 years. Andy has also continued to race since the completion of her cancer treatment and now has a new race car on the way. This one has been custom built to allow Andy and her team to raise funds and awareness for the fight against breast cancer by offering passenger rides down the drag strip … but that’s a whole other story."
11,Weight loss Advice,health-fitness," Introduction The weight loss industry is worth an enormous amount of money with women being the target of advertisers. It is important for those intending to go on a diet to question their motives and ask themselves, ""Am I doing it for myself or am I being fat-shamed into doing it?"" It is important to just be happy being you before you consider changing anything in your life because unless you are content there will always be something that you need in order to be happy. Just be yourself The human race is like licorice all sorts, you never know what you are going to get. There are as many personalities as there are people and there are a variety of shapes and sizes. It is therefore to accept who you are but at the same time change what you can change. You may have no control over your build but you can choose what you put in your mouth. You may have no control of what talents you have been given but you have control over what you do with what you have been given. The world puts unrealistic expectations on people and especially young women. They are expected to look as glamorous as those who appear in the glossy women's magazines. Is it any wonder that so many women suffer from low self esteem? If women think that they have too much pressure on them to look as fabulous as a Hollywood star, many of them expect men to have the perfect physical body. Let me tell you my story: I have always been skinny; all through my life I meet women from time to time who say ""You're too skinny,"" and so on. Once a young lady was telling me about her boyfriend and how he looks after himself. He had a good physical body. She was having a dig at me. At the time I was jogging six miles+ per day and was competing in athletics every weekend. Sometimes on both Saturday and Sunday. As with all of the comments that have been made about me being skinny I have never taken offence nor suffered from an inferiority complex or low self esteem because of it. My shape has never bothered me. I have just accepted it as who I am. But... I can understand why women would have their self-esteem attached to their weight when there is so much pressure on them to have a nice figure, but what they are really doing is living to please others rather than accepting who they really are. It is important to accept who you are and not let your body shape determine your self worth. You shouldn't allow comments by others to determine your self worth either. If others cannot accept who you are then that is their problem not yours. The bottom line is that you can only live your life according to your own circumstances and not compare yourself with others because it will be similar to comparing apples to pears. Your value is not determined by what others say about you. It is not determined by your dress size, or by your achievements. You may see the achievements of high profile sports people being applauded on TV but this will all pass. There are thousands of unsung heroes whom society takes for granted but they do their work day after day without complaint and without even a modest round of applause. My suggestion is to focus on a ""healthy eating"" mindset rather than a ""lose weight."" It is far easier to achieve a goal based on what you eat and how much you eat rather than it is to lose weight. Like all things in life worth striving for, losing weight takes effort and sacrifice and only you can decide whether the outcome was worth it all."
12,Why People Smoke Cigarettes - Five Reasons That Might Surprise You,health-fitness," Why People Smoke Cigarettes - Five Reasons That Might Surprise You Cigarette smoking is a personal choice. However, if you are considering stopping smoking, you may already realize that quitting requires more than willpower or scaring yourself with statistics of why smoking is bad. Conventional smoking cessation systems often don't work in the long term because they do not address the real reasons that people smoke. Listed below are five often unidentified reasons that people smoke. These reasons might surprise you. Before you engage in your stop smoking process, take some time and identify the important underlying motivations of why you choose to smoke. By understanding those real reasons, you can generate a personalized stop smoking plan that incorporates new strategies of coping and dealing with life. For many people, smoking is a reliable lifestyle coping tool. Although every person's specific reasons to smoke are unique, they all share a common theme. Smoking is used as a way to suppress uncomfortable feelings, and smoking is used to alleviate stress, calm nerves, and relax. No wonder that when you are deprived of smoking, your mind and body are unsettled for a little while. Below is a list of some positive intentions often associated with smoking. Knowing why you smoke is one of the first steps towards quitting. Check any and all that apply to you. Coping with anger, stress, anxiety, tiredness, or sadness Smoking is pleasant and relaxing Smoking is stimulating Acceptance - being part of a group As a way to socialize Provides support when things go wrong A way to look confident and in control Keeps weight down Rebellion - defining self as different or unique from a group A reminder to breathe Something to do with your mouth and hands Shutting out stimuli from the outside world Shutting out emotions from the inside world Something to do just for you and nobody else A way to shift gears or changes states An way to feel confident A way to shut off distressing feelings A way to deal with stress or anxiety A way to get attention Marking the beginning or the end of something The habit of cigarette smoking is often used to tranquilize emotional issues like anxiety, stress, or low self-esteem. In addition, smoking provides comfort to people with conditions of chronic pain and depression. Smokers with emotional stress or chronic pain often turn to smoking as an attempt to treat their pain. For instance, they may use it to reduce anxiety, provide a sense of calmness and energy, and elevate their mood. Some evidence does suggest that nicotine has some pain-relief benefits. Nicotine releases brain chemicals which soothe pain, heighten positive emotions, and creating a sense of reward. However, any benefit from smoking only eases the pain for a few minutes. Cigarettes contain many other chemicals shown to worsen healing ability of bone, tooth, and cartilage. The mental association between smoking and pain relief can make quitting quite difficult, as can the increased short-term discomfort that quitting smoking adds to a person already suffering with chronic pain, depression, or emotional distress. What are effective ways for people with chronic pain - whether physical or emotional - to make the decision to quit smoking? First, evidence shows that in people who suffer chronic pain, smokers have more pain than nonsmokers do. Also, accept that smoking cessation may indeed make you feel worse in the short run, but may be key to regaining enough vitality to live fully with pain. Smoking is a way to avoid feeling unpleasant emotions such as sadness, grief, and anxiety. It can hide apprehensions, fears, and pain. This is accomplished partly through the chemical effects of nicotine on the brain. When smoking, the release of brain chemicals makes smokers feel like they are coping and dealing with life and stressful emotional situations. Nicotine brings up a level of good feelings. Cigarette smokers are aware when nicotine levels and good feelings begin to decrease, and light up quickly enough to stay in their personal comfort zone. However, they may not realize that avoiding their feelings is not the same as taking positive steps to create a life of greater potential and meaning. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) reports that people suffering from nicotine withdrawal have increased aggression, anxiety, hostility, and anger. However, perhaps these emotional responses are due not to withdrawal, but due to an increased awareness of unresolved emotions. If smoking dulls emotions, logically quitting smoking allows awareness of those emotions to bubble up to the surface. If emotional issues aren't resolved, a smoker may feel overwhelmed and eventually turn back to cigarettes to deal with the uncomfortable feelings. Smokers often say that lighting up a cigarette can calm their nerves, satisfy their cravings, and help them feel energized. Indeed, nicotine in tobacco joins on to receptors in your brain that release ""feel good"" chemicals that can make you feel calm and energized all at once. Smoking acts as a drug, inducing a feeling of well-being with each puff. But, it's a phony sense of well-being that never produces a permanent satisfying or fulfilling result. Smoking lures you into believing that you can escape some underlying truth or reality. However, smoking doesn't allow you to actually transform your day-to-day life and live connected to your deeper hopes and dreams. Instead, when you smoke, the carbon monoxide in the smoke bonds to your red blood cells, taking up the spaces where oxygen needs to bond. This makes you less able to take in the deep, oxygen-filled breath needed to bring you life, to active new energy, to allow health and healing, and bring creative insight into your problems and issues. If you previously quit smoking, and then resumed the habit once again, consider the idea that perhaps you are in the midst of some ""growing pains."" Perhaps you were feeling dissatisfied with some aspect of your life and contemplating making change. However, developing spiritually, emotionally, and physically brings with it the experience of discomfort. Old beliefs rise up, creating sensations of hurt, pain, sadness, anxiety, and uneasiness. You were feeling dissatisfied, restless, ready to change, but then felt the fear that change often ignites. Smoking provides an escape from those uncomfortable feelings. However, smoking also brings an abrupt halt to personal transformation and the evolution of self. Although painful, these feelings are necessary in your personal development. Learning to accept feelings in a new way can help lead you out of disempowering or limiting beliefs, and into a life filled with greater happiness, satisfaction, contentment, or purpose. When you stop smoking and start breathing conscious, deep, smoke-free, oxygen filled breaths your evolution will start up once again. However, the most important thing here is to find the right solution if you can not get rid of smoking. There are some solutions that allow you to keep smoking without any regret, get rid of that persistent cough within five days, show your loved ones that you actually care, help recover your lungs while giving you more energy and don't stain your teeth and fingers."

3,LIFE-SAVING MOBILE MEDICAL CLINIC ARRIVES IN NORTHERN QUEENSLAND,health-fitness," A mobile medical clinic has arrived in northern Queensland, bringing life-saving specialist medical services to a number of remote and regional communities for the first time. Heart of Australia’s new truck, HEART 4, is on its inaugural trip taking city-based medical specialists to towns stretching from Cooktown to the Mackay Region. Heart of Australia Founder and Cardiologist, Dr Rolf Gomes, said the program has expanded through a $12 million boost from the Australian Government. Together with existing partners, the fourth mobile medical clinic is starting a new northern route. “We are very excited about the new era, opening new frontiers for Heart of Australia and helping address the imbalance for people in the bush when it comes to access to high-quality healthcare,” Dr Gomes said. “Heart of Australia will bring specialists in cardiology, sonography, and sleep diagnostics to residents in Cooktown, Ayr, Sarina, and Proserpine.” Dr Karam Kostner, Head of Cardiology at Brisbane’s Mater Hospital, has worked with Dr Gomes and Heart of Australia since the first truck launched in 2014. He said: “It certainly saves many lives and it’s very important. Personally, I’ve seen many patients on my rotations who would not have been saved if it wasn’t for the truck.” “We’ll do ECGs, blood pressure monitors, Holter monitors, sleep studies, CPAPs, a whole range of supporting services and supporting diagnostics,” Chris Wilson, Heart of Australia Medical Aide said. HEART 4 is a 34-wheel custom-built, B-Double road train. It departed Brisbane last Sunday in preparation for the first-ever clinic in Cooktown today (Thursday, July 1, 2021). Heart of Australia now services 29 towns across Queensland and has two static clinics in Weipa and Palm Island. “HEART 4 is a multi-million-dollar truck that needs to arrive at the right time, in the right place in order to save lives, and it’s my job to get it there,” Simon Crawford, Multiple Combination Driver said. Heart of Australia has travelled more than 500,000 kilometres, seen more than 11,000 patients, and saved more than 400 lives. Dr Rolf Gomes mortgaged his home to build the first truck seven years ago. “Our aim is to close the gap between healthcare services available to people in the city and those living in the bush.  Every Australian deserves access to quality health care regardless of where they live,” he said."
4,Self esteem and Weight loss,health-fitness," The weight-loss industry is a huge one worth billions of dollars annually but there is more to your well-being than what you eat. Your own self-esteem can be more of a factor than you may think. If you can work on this then dieting and weight-loss will become easier. Did you know your own self esteem may be a contributing factor to some of your problems? Let's look at weight loss for example. We all know that the weight loss industry is a multi billion dollar per annum business and who do the advertisers target? Women! In order to encourage women to join their weight loss plan they highlight their insecurities in their advertising copy. ""What insecurities are these,"" you may be asking. You may have heard of the term ""fat shaming."" Women are shamed into feeling guilty even if they are just a few kilos heavier than last year. Is it any wonder that so many of them suffer from insecurities. My advice to women is this: 1 Stop comparing yourself with others It is silly to try and be somebody you are not. Instead of trying to be someone other than yourself you must ask the question, ""What makes me tick,?"" and set your goals accordingly. 2 Do it for you and not for others. If you are taking on a new diet do it for yourself and not for others. Don't be a people pleaser and try to impress others for the sake of it. 3 Your value is not measured by your dress size. What makes you unique is what values you. It is what you do with what talents you have been gifted that gives you value. It is important to use your talents for the benefit of others. That is real value! 4 Ditch the ""If only,"" mind set. Many women and men for that matter think, ""If I lost xx amount of weight, got, a new car, a better house, had a new husband/wife, or whatever then I will be happy."" Life does not work that way. Joy comes from within and has nothing to do with outward appearances or the opinion of others. Many people after they have acquired what they thought would make them happy are still not content with their life. The novelty soon wears off then they have their eye on something else. 5 Work on your self-esteem. It is important to work on your self-esteem otherwise people are going to push you around. The key is to be assertive and not allow unkind comments to affect. Assertiveness is not just sticking up for yourself. It is recognising the television advertising for what they are; to make you want to buy their products. I am not saying you should not go on one of these diets but to do it for the right reasons. The bottom line is that a low self-esteem will undermine your dieting plan. How? Have you heard of the expression ""Comfort eating?"" Enough said."
5,Why is AED training important?,health-fitness," Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) are used to treat sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). A sudden cardiac arrest is when the victim’s heart stops beating, they will collapse, lose consciousness and will stop breathing. SCAs strike without warning and leave the victim in need of urgent medical intervention. The use of an AED can improve survival rates by 50 to 75%, combined with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and using an AED gives an unresponsive person, who is not breathing, the best possible chance of survival. New portable AEDs  can now be found in prominent places such as leisure centres, post offices, schools, community centres and even converted telephone boxes, to enable people to respond in a SCA medical emergency. The use of AEDs has a dramatic affect in strengthening the chain of survival as they are able to restore a normal heart rhythm prior to the emergency services arriving. Every minute without a defibrillator reduces the chance of survival by 7 to 10%. So, the proliferation of AEDs within communities can most definitely save lives. An AED is designed for use by non-medical personnel, so even an inexperienced person can operate one accurately and with ease. Models vary slightly but most are similar in appearance, and all have simple easy to follow instructions and prompts. As simple as AEDs are to use, a few hours training is desirable and the more people in the community who can respond to a medical emergency by providing defibrillation quickly and with the confidence training provides, the greater improvements we will see in sudden cardiac arrest survival rates. If your business, school, club or local community want to ensure they are prepared to help cardiac arrest victims, our Automated External Defibrillator Course will give you the knowledge and confidence you need. On the course you will be shown warning signs to look out for, how to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and the correct way to use the AED equipment. AED courses can be attended at Centaur’s training facility in Leyland but is also available to be booked by a minimum of 8 people to run at a time and place to suit your needs, whether that is at your company headquarters, the village/community hall or local school. We also run a wide scope of First Aid courses, some of which are available in a e-learning format."

You may have attestations about food, exercise, musings and whatever else that will help you move toward achieving your objectives. There is no restriction to how long your rundown of assertions can be. You choose how long you need to go through with them every day, with five minutes twice day by day being the base. You ought to present your certifications once upon first awakening and afterward by the day's end not long prior to resting. It is useful to look at yourself without flinching while at the same time saying your attestation. You can do this, obviously, with the utilization of a mirror. Look at yourself without flinching, like trying the individual in the mirror to debate the reality of what you are saying. Rehash your confirmations with energy and conviction twice day by day. On the off chance that you can fit them in a third time around lunch, far better. Then, you need to invest some energy investigating your food triggers those things that expeditious you to eat some unacceptable food sources and to eat when you are not eager.

15,Weight Loss Vs Fat Loss - Yes There is a Difference!,health-fitness," In order to lose weight, your body must burn more calories than it takes in, but keep in mind that your body needs calories for energy and when you exercise your body needs even more calories. Before I talk about energy, the first thing you must understand is that losing weight and losing fat is not the same thing. Just because you lose weight, does not mean you lose fat, and just because you lose fat, does not mean you lose weight. When people talk about losing weight, what the really want to do is lose the excess fat on their body and obtain an attractive figure. When you eat, the body uses most of the calories for energy. If you eat more calories than the body uses, it will get stored as fat. If you do not consume enough calories per day you will lose weight, but you will also lose energy. When you do not consume enough energy (calories) for your body, it will start using up your energy stores to make up for the energy deficiency. Unfortunately, the energy stores used is not your stored fat, but instead it's protein and carbohydrates (carbs) that will supply most of the energy (stored fat makes up a very small percentage). Your body will take the protein and carbohydrates from your muscle cells; causing your muscle mass to reduce (say goodbye to that toned attractive look) which forces your metabolism to decrease (a low metabolism = slow or no fat burning). When this happens your body requires less energy to maintain its new lower body weight (remember the body weight is lower because you loss muscle), which is why your body conserves energy by slowing down the metabolism. In other words, the body has adapted to the new lower energy (calorie) intake which means that you will no longer continue to lose weight. Keep in mind that the weight you had lost in the first place was mostly water weight and you will eventually gain it back in the form of fat, not muscle (in order to get your muscle mass back to the way it was before, you have to work on rebuilding it). When carbohydrates and protein that are already in your body are used as the energy source, your body will lose water weight because both carbohydrates and protein hold water in the cells. In essence, you are dehydrating yourself to lose weight. So yes the scale will go down, but approximately 75% (if not more) of it is water instead of fat. And just so you know, exercising while consuming a small calorie intake just makes the situation worse. This is because when you exercise, you start burning off more energy and the more you workout, the more energy your body needs. I already told you above where the energy comes from, and if you do not give your body the energy it needs, it will just feed on your muscles even quicker now that you are exercising. So eat more food! In addition to this, when you cut down too much on your calorie intake, your body will start storing calories because it doesn't know when you will eat again. The calories that are stored will be stored as fat. So in other words, when your body is storing energy, it's basically storing more fat. To summarize my point: Not eating enough calories results in muscle loss, dehydration, slower fat burning, and your body will always adapt to a lower calorie intake. Bottom Line: if you can't maintain that lower calorie intake for the rest of your life, you will gain your weight back when you get tired of starving yourself! To lose weight properly (burning fat) you must increase your metabolism (weight training) and your need for oxygen (aerobics) while eating enough calories each day (nutritious diet) to give you energy and maintain the protein in your muscles because protein helps build muscles, which indirectly burns fat. This brings up another good point: When you build muscle your weight will increase because your muscles are made up of mostly water, but your body fat percentage will decrease because building muscles increase your metabolism (in other words, muscles way more than fat, but take up less space than fat). So keep in mind that losing body fat can't be measured by a scale; use a measuring tape and also look at yourself in the mirror, and then you will see the true results. One of the best ways to know if you are losing more body fat than water is by using a body fat analyzer. Make sure that you focus on fat loss not weight loss. Your goal should be to lose weight by burning fat, not losing water from your muscles. Remember this when you choose your weight loss program. Ultimate Fat Burning Secrets is dedicated to exposing fat burning secrets that weight loss companies are keeping from you."
16,Why Physical Education is necessary,health-fitness," Some people are very lazy and very weak. People are supposed to be active in life to be healthy. Physical education is made to keep people fit and active. Kids, as well as grown-ups, get advantages from doing standard exercises frequently.  There are a lot of advantages to doing standard exercises. Some of the advantages are that standard exercises make our muscles stronger, gives us calcium to strengthen our bones. Our hearts, muscles, and bones need calcium to work properly. Standard exercises also increase our stamina and allow us to not get tired easily. It prevents us from falling sick or get a certain disease. Physical education can be done anywhere. Some must be done in the field, but some can be done at home. Example of physical education games is soccer, handball, ultimate frisbees and many other activities that give us more energy and keeps us strong. Many children do not have a great amount of participation level. Physical education can help to increase the participation skills of a person. Physical Education came from the 1800s and is very essential to know its history too. This is because the games we have now are mostly invented from the past and it explains the hard work people did to motivate them. So, physical education plays a very important role in our life. History of Physical Education The history of physical education goes long back to the 1800s. Physical education was started as a course in approximately 1820. There used to be sports like gymnastics, long jump, high jump, and way more games that took a lot of hard work. There was still a benefit to the people doing physical education. From then on, special sports events were held to encourage physical education. People like Diocletian Lewis created institutions where physical education could be practiced. In the olden days, only men could do sports. In physical education competitions, only men were allowed to participate. There was a lot of restriction for women. Diocletian Lewis was the one to create institutions that women were allowed to go in. From this time, women were allowed to participate in tournaments. In the 1920s, physical education became a part of a course for girls, especially those who were in high school. There are more games that women participate in than men do. The physical education course that we use currently is way different than the one they used in the olden times. There are other sports like soccer that help them too. Very few people play games like long-jump or even games like the high jump. There are a few changes in the system itself in physical education over these years. There used to be a lot of people doing P.E together. There was not a lot of equipment to use before. There used to be no care about health in P.E. The only purpose of P.E used to be the type of skills people had. The Influence of physical education on children Physical education has an impact on children in many ways. The first way is physical. Physical education helps children to comprehend the importance of health. It also helps the student to understand that physical education can lead them to a healthy life, and they could get better skills and it would help them in improving their participation level. Physical education can be good for anxious and nervous people. The other way that physical education has an impact on children is social. Physical education helps a child to interact with other children. According to Lee Schafer and Derek Wasyliw, physical education helps children to learn skills like “communication tolerance, trust, empathy, and respect for others. They also learn positive team skills including cooperation, leadership, cohesion, and responsibility”. Children also get to learn to collaborate with others, they also learn how to give guidance and it encourages them to involve in other activities. The last way that physical education has an impact on children is emotional. Physical education gives a mental advantage to your mental health, it relieves your stress level and worries about anything that keeps you worry or makes you sad. Physical education also helps us to be patient. In addition, it helps us to our emotions like you will not get furious fast. It also increases your self-confidence. Risks and Hazards of physical education and how to be safe There are a lot of risks and hazards while doing physical education. Everything has good effects and bad effects. Even though physical education is necessary for life, it is also dangerous. It is only dangerous when people do not focus and do not follow instructions. A person that is in a physical education course needs to be very careful and pay attention to what their trainer is saying. When a person gets distracted and does not focus on what he is doing, he loses balance and falls. One more reason for no focus is too much food. When a person does physical education after eating food, they cannot run a lot or do something that will require their energy. Sometimes they also lose balance because their stomach does not allow them to balance and in the end, they just fall. People that do not have self-confidence in themselves cannot do any exercise because they do not trust themselves and cannot succeed. Physical education’s most major injuries have been fractures, sprain, and ankle twist, and muscle tearing. Most of these injuries also happen because of the tool that people use incorrectly. Some ways can prevent you from getting injured. These details are meant for both people and their trainers. Physical education can be done very peacefully with calmly. We just need to put our focus on what we are doing and keep concentrating on it. We should be very disciplined in what we are doing. The second thing that should be done is that there should always be the usage of the right equipment on the right field of playing. You might get injured if you play soccer with a basketball. Trainers and other teachers should always have their first aid kit ready no matter what happens. The field should be double-checked before playing on it. The equipment that people use should always be double-checked and be repaired. In conclusion, physical education plays an extremely important role in our lives. Every one of us should be doing regular exercises every day with the right equipment on the right field. Physical has a great impact on children and other people. Physical education was made in the 1800s and women started doing the course of physical education around the 1900s. Physical education has a great change from the physical education thought now and physical education thought now. Always remember to do the course of physical education to make your life healthy and powerful."

20,7 Benefits of The Keto Diet,health-fitness," 7 Benefits of The Keto Diet When you hear about the ketogenic diet, the first thing you perhaps think of is what could possibly make it as good as people say. The answer is, there are enough benefits to change your life. What exactly is a ketogenic diet? The keto program recommends a diet that is low on carbs, moderate on protein and high in fat. The idea is to fine-tune nutritional intake in order to send the body into the metabolic state known as ketosis. The body enters a state of ketosis when it no longer has stores of glycogen sugar to fuel its energy needs. With sugar out of the way, the body has no choice but to tap its stores of fat to get by. The liver converts fat reserves into ketones to present to the body as an energy source. This is why the keto program is a good way to lose fat. 7 benefits of the keto diet Unlike other diets that offer practitioners a weight loss benefit and little else, the keto diet comes with several benefits. Weight loss Without a doubt, weight loss is the primary goal of the keto diet. It works because it makes the body look to its fat reserves to power its metabolism. It can be interesting to go deeper into the process, however. When the body is deprived of carbs, it enters a state of ketosis. Blood sugar and insulin levels fall when that happens. As the body taps the energy in fat cells, they release considerable quantities of water, making for some great weight loss. The fat cells are then able to enter the bloodstream and make their way to the liver, where they are turned into ketones for energy processing. As long as your diet allows you to stay in a caloric deficit, you get to enjoy the weight loss benefits of the keto diet. It takes the edge off your appetite When your diet isn't heavy on carbs, you'll find that you don't crave as much food as before. Many people who get on the keto diet are able to fast most of the day, and only eat at mealtimes. They are simply not as hungry as before. Improved ability to focus When you choose a regular diet that puts carbs into the body, your brain has to deal with the rise and fall in sugar levels that happens as a result. Inconsistent energy levels can make it hard for the brain to focus. With the keto diet, however, the energy source is constant and consistent. The brain is better able to stay focused. You feel more energetic When you are on a regular diet, your body is always on the verge of running out of energy. You need to constantly eat and refuel. With a keto diet, however, the body taps its fat reserves, a nearly unending energy source. The body, then, is able to maintain constant energy levels throughout the day. The result is, you end up feeling a lot more energetic. It helps you fight diabetes When you suffer from Type II diabetes, your body experiences high levels of insulin. Since the keto diet takes excess sugar from your diet, it helps stabilize HbA1c counts, and reverse Type II diabetes. You get improved levels of good cholesterol HDL cholesterol helps get rid of the body's bad cholesterol reserves. When you're on keto, your body's triglyceride levels fall and your HDL cholesterol levels rise. You get better blood pressure When you're on the keto diet, it drops your blood pressure. Many people on the keto diet find that they are able to stop taking blood pressure medicine altogether. The keto diet can change a person's life. It isn't a difficult diet to get on, either. There are plenty of great recipes for the keto diet. All it takes is the willingness to give it a shot."

1,"Pandemic shows risk of obesity, and challenge of weight loss",health-fitness," Jennifer Bergin was already obese and pre-diabetic prior to the pandemic, and the discovery that she also had high blood pressure made her fearful of how sick she would become with COVID-19. She started walking three hours a day and lost 60 pounds. Bergin, a 50-year-old Charlotte resident, said, ""I just knew I was a strong target for having it and not recovering."" She is no longer obese at 170 pounds and 5 feet, 4 inches tall, but she would like to continue to improve her health. Obesity and related illnesses, such as diabetes, have been identified as risk factors for severe COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. It was another reminder of the numerous underlying health conditions typically associated with obesity, as well as how difficult it may be to maintain weight loss over time. Despite the dangers, it's unclear how prevalent Bergin's extreme weight loss is. Countless people of all sizes have gained or lost weight as a result of the pandemic across the country. For some, such as Bergin, not having to go to work meant more time for walking, less dining out, and more control over what she ate. Others, however, found that being stuck at home meant moving less and eating more as a result of stress, worry, despair, or simply being close to the kitchen. According to Karen H. Yeary, an obesity researcher at the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, N.Y., the range of weight fluctuations highlights the intricacies of obesity, particularly how much a person's circumstances can play in their health. She claims that this contradicts the concept that reducing weight is simply a question of willpower. “It takes a lot of effort and energy to eat healthily and then to lose weight,” Yeary said. Beatima, who stands 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs around 170 pounds, said, ""That really impacted me."" His efforts were aided by the epidemic, which made weight loss easier. He was no longer ordering takeout, going out with friends, or hosting his family's annual feasts. He also found relief in dancing to YouTube videos, and he was motivated by the awareness that improving his health would lower his risk of developing severe COVID-19. “I suppose if I got it when I was 300, it would be a lot more of a fight than if I got it today,” Beatima remarked. Another reason obesity is so difficult to combat is that weight gain occurs gradually over time, making it easier to dismiss as a health problem. In the United States, one out of every four adults is fat, and one out of every three is overweight. Despite the fact that the pandemic brought attention to the dangers of obesity, he claims that people are already accustomed to hearing about how hazardous it is to be overweight. “It usually takes a much larger, life-changing event on a personal level,” he stated when asked what causes people to lose weight successfully. Mickey Beatima, a 29-year-old Seattle man who began trying to reduce weight a few months before the pandemic when his diabetes caused eye difficulties, was one of those people. People are generally motivated to reduce weight only after a severe health concern, such as a heart attack or a significant change in lifestyle, according to Eric Plaisance, an obesity researcher at the University of Alabama in Birmingham. Christian Hainds, a 42-year-old Hammond, Indiana resident, shed around 50 pounds during the pandemic and is no longer considered obese at 180 pounds and 5 feet, 11 inches tall. Over the years, his weight had crept up to roughly 230 pounds. But it wasn't until he was diagnosed with diabetes around the time of the pandemic that he felt compelled to make adjustments, especially since the evidence was mounting that diabetes was one of the illnesses linked to severe coronavirus disease. “All of the long-term terrible things that can happen as a result of obesity were no longer long-term concerns,” Hainds added. For many others, the pandemic's focus on obesity dangers has waned as medicines and therapies have reduced the virus's threat, according to obesity researcher Yeary. This could reduce the sense of urgency that was motivating certain people. The pandemic's circumstances that made weight loss easier for some — more time for long walks, less dining out — are now dissipating. For example, Beatima is spending more time with his family and has regained some weight. He isn't concerned, though, that it would derail his overall fitness goals because, According to him, the epidemic taught him how his weight was linked to what he valued, such as being able to spend time with his nieces and nephews for many years to come. “That new ground is appreciating the worth of my physical, social, and mental wellbeing,"" he explained."
2,Early Warning Signs of APPENDICITIS and Its Urgent Treatment,health-fitness," The inflammation of an appendix (a small finger-shaped pouch on the right side of the abdomen connected to the colon) or also be referred to as ‘Appendicitis’, is one of the most common serious conditions worldwide, where people usually misunderstood it as common gastric pain in the first place. There are many cases of appendicitis patients who have initially buy their own medicines to relieve their abdominal pain, but later coming to the doctor when they have reached the late stage of appendicitis. At this stage, the pain is severe enough and the appendix had almost burst or worse, it had burst, in which an urgent surgery is crucial to be done instantly. As the appendicitis signs may show up as quickly as within 1-3 days after the onset of the early symptoms, it is important to take note of the early warning signs seriously so that the doctors can remove the appendix right away before it ruptures and increase the risk of fatality. Sometimes, different patients can present with different symptoms but usually, there is a common pattern that at least people can be aware of. In the early stage, patients usually will come to see a doctor because of fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea or constipation, and bloated feeling. Some patients may have all these symptoms, and others may only have some. These early symptoms of appendicitis have similar symptoms as other abdominal or pelvic-related diseases like gastric (stomach) problem, urinary tract infection, intestinal obstruction, etc. That cause appendicitis is hard to diagnose at first. Important to understand here, a patient will never be considered an appendicitis patient until a doctor diagnoses the condition as appendicitis, the same goes for other medical conditions. Each disease or medical condition has its own methods to be confirmed as a diagnosis before proceeding with its treatment and management. Thus, to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis, the doctor will do some simple physical checkups. One of them is by doing some palpations, especially on the patient’s abdomen. If there is the presence of sharp pain at a specific point (called Mc Burney’s point) over the right lower abdomen where the base of the appendix usually located, this will be referred to as the most important sign in a patient with appendicitis as what had been focused by Dr. Sandy Craig, a Gastroenterologist, in Medscape. Whereas for a pregnant woman, the sharp pain usually is referred at the right upper abdomen. Right after the sign can be seen by a doctor, the patient will be asked or sent promptly to a hospital for urgent treatment. However, in some cases of appendicitis, this important sign is not presented yet at the beginning. Due to the insufficient sign, the doctor cannot diagnose the patient as appendicitis, therefore has no right to send their patient to any hospital even to be warded for early action, unless other serious or sudden symptoms had shown up. Therefore, it is common for appendicitis patients initially to be diagnosed with other disease such as gastritis, and concerning that, they will also receive some medicines to reduce the pain and treat the symptoms that appeared. In this case, the patient can look at how their body is reacting to the medicines. If the pain did not change and the symptoms become worsen, it might give a clue that their body is suffering something worse. Because patients usually misunderstand appendicitis as common gas pain, Dr. James Roland who is a Family Medicine Specialist had given an important reminder in a Healthline article to note that if patients think their abdominal pain is caused by gas in their abdomen, but it lasts for more than 24 hours, the pain may be a sign for other serious problem. Thus, that patient needs to see a doctor as soon as possible. Once the appendicitis patients get warded in any hospital, they can feel a bit of relief because at least their condition will be monitored by the nurses and doctors. Because this case is usually included in an emergency case, surgery is always the best choice. Dr. Sandy Craig in his same writing within the treatment section had also appointed that the surgical removal of appendix or called appendectomy remains the only curative treatment for appendicitis, but in some different cases, the management can be varied. In order to perform the surgery, the doctors will need to perform first a laboratory test and imaging test to get a clear diagnosis, only if appendicitis is caught early in the patient. In conclusion, appendicitis is a serious condition that mostly needs to be treated as early as possible. Since life is a one-time offer, you cannot go back and change the beginning, but you can start from where you are and change the ending. As a bit of advice, always be conscious of anything changes on your body's health, do not hesitate and procrastinate to meet a doctor when notice any problem and finally trust your doctors and nurses and try to give good cooperation to help them save your life."

4,Frequently Asked Questions Concerning Hypnotherapy,health-fitness," Hypnosis – questions and answers Hypnosis performed by a medical practitioner aka Hypnotherapy – uses guided relaxation, intense concentration, and focused attention to achieve a heightened state of awareness, sometimes referred to as a trance. In this state, the person’s attention is so focused that everything that happens around the person is temporarily blocked or ignored. Q: What is hypnosis? What is Hypnosis Therapy A: That’s a difficult question to answer promptly and also precisely. Some people think that it is a ‘transformed state of awareness, however, since there is currently no concurred interpretation of consciousness this debate can go around in circles. When we discuss hypnosis we frequently tend to be either speaking about the loosened up, concentrated, taken in feelings related to a ‘hypnotic trance state’ (although some people do not like the term trance), or we tend to be discussing the intriguing things people can do when hypnotized – these are the items of ‘tip’. For more detail, a great location to begin reading is the interpretations page, or else follow the links on the left for additional information about the study in hypnotherapy as well as its usages. Q: Is hypnotherapy genuine? A: Short answer: yes! Hypnotic recommendations can alter individuals’ experiences as well as assumptions. For example, hypnotic tips can be utilized to create vibrant hallucinations or modify your perception of discomfort. Studies that gauge brain tasks have revealed that hypnosis and also hypnotic tips alter the way that the brain refines info. Randomized regulated medical tests have revealed that hypnotherapy can be an effective treatment for discomfort, and an effective part of therapies for various other conditions. People frequently doubt whether hypnosis is real since it would certainly be very simple to ‘phony’ a hypnotic response, as well as while this is true, there are likewise genuine measurable impacts. Q: Can anybody be hypnotized? Can anybody be hypnotized A: Yes, everyone is hypnotizable somewhat – some greater than others. Vulnerability to hypnosis can be determined with a hypnotic sensitivity scale (see ‘dimension of hypnosis’. Scientists have a tendency to identify individuals as ‘highs’, ‘mediums’, or ‘lows’. Regarding 80% of people remain in the ‘tool’ band – suggesting that they can experience a lot of the impacts of hypnotic suggestion, as well as are likely to gain from its medical usage if needed. About 10% of the populace are considered highly hypnotizable – implying that they can conveniently experience rather dramatic changes in feeling and assumption with hypnosis. About 10% are categorized as ‘reduced’ – implying that they have actually not reacted strongly to hypnosis (although there are some skills programs that intend to increase sensitivity to hypnotherapy). Some clinicians, especially Milton Erickson, have actually really felt that everyone can be hypnotized however that the hypnotherapist must customize the design or material of what they do. Nevertheless, considering that the only method we have of determining suggestibility is to take a look at exactly how individuals reply to recommendations, as well as considering that suggestibility is seldom gauged in scientific setups, it is hard to bring any proof to bear on this disagreement. Q: Can Hypnozability be customized? A: Educating programs have actually been created which intend to raise exactly how well participants react on tests of suggestibility. Some scientists have argued that raises produced through this technique are not genuine as well as are merely the result of individuals being urged to respond without needed experiencing their feedback as spontaneous (a standards Weitzenhoffer set as a ‘true’ response to recommendation). However, various other researchers have actually argued that the subjective responses of such ‘experienced high suggestible’ participants are equivalent to participants who were ‘normally high suggestible’ without training. Some medications have likewise been discovered to be effective in increasing suggestibility. See changing suggestibility for more in-depth details. Q: Is hypnosis dangerous? A: Hypnosis is not by itself an unsafe treatment, however, there are concerns that if it is not used correctly then it can bring about negative reactions. The risks associated with hypnotherapy (as an example, participants really periodically experience a mild frustration) have actually been revealed not to vary from those associated with attending a university lecture (Lynn, 2000). Problems may occur as a result of faulty technique on the part of the hypnotherapist or due to misunderstandings on the part of the subject pertaining to hypnotherapy. For a fuller conversation on the possible threats of hypnotherapy read this area of Campbell Perry’s discussion of hypnosis on the False Memory Syndrome’s website. Q: Can hypnosis make me do things I don’t want to do? Can hypnosis make me do things I don't want to do A: The basic solution is no, you can not be made to do anything you don’t intend to carry out in hypnosis. In hypnotherapy, you keep power over your ability to act on tips, although if you do allow yourself to act on a recommendation you may feel as though the impacts are taking place by themselves. Orne & Evans carried out a research study to discover if they can make hypnotized topics do antisocial acts, such as throwing a container of acid in the face of a study aide (for safety and security the container didn’t actually contain acid, however, the topics in the experiment didn’t know this). They discovered that 5 out of 6 high hypnotizable individuals did toss the ‘acid’, however, that 6 out of 6 low hypnotizable participants who were asked to mimic remaining in hypnotherapy threw the ‘acid’ as well. This experiment reveals that it’s not something unique regarding remaining in hypnosis which can make individuals carry out antisocial acts, yet instead something regarding the social scenario the experiment was performed in. The reasoning of the experiment is that if you can obtain people to dedicate antisocial acts without hypnotherapy (the reduced hypnotizable that was being asked to claim) that there is no demand to use hypnotherapy to discuss what individuals are doing (to learn more on experiments including authority reviewed Stanley Milgram’s well-known experiment below). Q: Is hypnosis like sleep? Is hypnosis like sleep A natural, altered state of consciousness much like sleep, highway hypnosis, or daydreaming. A heightened state of suggestibility. A state of highly focused attention in which external stimuli are distended and suggestion becomes more effective. A dissociated state involves some degree of disconnection between conscious & unconscious processes. A: The short answer is no. Although the word hypnotherapy is originated from the Greek god of sleep, Hypnos, researches have shown that hypnosis and also sleep differ. Researches of mind tasks have actually revealed that although there are characteristic patterns of mind tasks related to rest the very same has actually not been shown of hypnotherapy. To viewers hypnosis may appear to be like rest due to the fact that pointers of leisure are commonly given as part of a hypnotic routine, however, hypnotized people remain in a state much more similar to wakefulness (and hypnotherapy has also been caused in individuals riding workout bikes – so-called ‘energetic alert’ hypnosis). Q: What does hypnosis seem like? A: The answer is that hypnosis possibly feels different for everyone. Numerous hypnotists (scientists & medical professionals) utilize aspects of relaxation treatments, so individuals frequently link a feeling of relaxation with hypnotherapy. Different people have all sorts of physical reactions to leisure guidelines – some really feel as though their body is really hefty, whereas some can really feel really light, nearly as if they were floating. Psychologically, again people have all sorts of feedbacks. People normally report feeling extremely focused or absorbed, often easily so. Given that guidelines for images are typically used people can have extremely vibrant imaginative experiences – numerous record feeling ‘as if they were there. Erika Fromm created an excellent publication on self-hypnosis, based on the outcomes of a substantial study, which includes plenty of intriguing descriptions from participants in her studies. Q: Can I get ‘stuck’ during hypnotherapy? A: There is no evidence that anybody can end up being stuck in hypnosis. The most awful that could occur could be that you fall asleep – as well as awaken unhypnotized! Orne & Evans carried out a well-known research study where individuals were hypnotized, and also the experimenter leaves the area under the pretense that there is an issue he needs to take care of, the participant is after that observed (without his understanding) to see what takes place. The result was that participants automatically got up, the high hypnotizable taking a little longer to do so. Q: What conditions can hypnosis deal with? What conditions can hypnosis deal with A: Hypnotherapy isn’t a therapy in its own right, but when made use of by a certified medical professional, dental practitioner, or psychotherapist hypnotherapy can be practical in treating: discomfort, anxiety problems (including fear, panic, PTSD), anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, and also many more. See the hypnotherapy section for more details. Q: I would like hypnotherapy to be part of my treatment, who can I see? A: Different nations regulate hypnotherapy and psychotherapy in different means as well as in numerous countries no specialist training is needed in order to call oneself a ‘hypnotherapist’. The International Culture of Hypnotherapy advises that the only specialists making use of hypnotherapy must be those who are already qualified in professional self-control (such as medicine, dentistry, psychology, or psychiatric therapy). To estimate Martin Orne: “If an individual is not properly qualified to deal with something without hypnosis, after that they’re not certified to treat something with hypnosis, either. First, you look for that professional certificate on the wall– physician, dentist, clinical psychotherapist, or whatever. Then your search for the certificate of hypnosis.” Q: Is NLP like hypnotherapy? How NLP works A: NLP, or Neuro-linguistic programs, is a set of techniques that are planned to promote personal growth. A few of these methods were developed from the work of effective hypnotherapists, especially Milton Erickson. NLP continues to be scientifically unvalidated and is not a part of mainstream academic psychology. There is a fantastic account of NLP on Skeptic, the doubter’s dictionary. Much more hesitant accounts of NLP are offered at Michael Load’s site as well as on Wikipedia. Q: Are some words more symptomatic than others? A: Careful use of language is absolutely crucial when using hypnosis, yet it’s hard to claim whether a particular word is more symptomatic than another. It is currently usually accepted that exactly how well an individual responds to suggestion is a lot more to do with their private characteristics (suggestibility, desire, absorption) than to do with the power or authority of the therapist (e.g. 3). A medical professional’s design of hypnosis can vary from authoritarian/direct (” when I click my fingers you will really feel … “) to permissive/indirect (” as I continue to chat you could start to notice that the sensation ends up being …”), and the indirect tip has actually been popularized by fans of Milton Erickson. Experiments have been performed to compare the impacts of these kinds of suggestion however results do not enable us to conclude that is a lot more efficient than the various other (4 ). (Concern submitted by a confidential individual). Q: Can hypnosis aid me to stop drinking alcohol? Can hypnosis aid me to stop drinking alcohol A: There’s truly very little proof that hypnosis is an efficient therapy for alcoholism. In an evaluation, Nash & Benham claim that alcohol and drug addiction do not react well to hypnosis, as well as two research studies that I can locate which compare hypnosis (or self-hypnosis) therapy to various other types of therapy such as psychotherapy or stress management do not reveal any kind of persuading advantage for making use of hypnosis (Jacobson, 1973; Pekala, 2004). (Concern sent by an anonymous customer). Q: Can hypnotherapy create rest conditions? A: There are no recorded situations of hypnotherapy causing or contributing to the development of a rest disorder. As a matter of fact, there is much proof that hypnotherapy can really play a valuable role in treating sleep disorders such as sleeping disorders (Borkovec, 1973), sleep-terror as well as sleepwalking (Hurwitz, 1991). Q: Is hypnosis scientifically researched? A: Science is a technique of discovering expertise: it’s really a process of subjecting your suggestions to an empirical test to see whether they are sustained by proof (see the Wikipedia entrance for a far more comprehensive summary). Many researchers take a scientific method to studying hypnotherapy: they create research study questions (hypotheses), after that, they systematically check them to see whether they are supported. Our understanding of hypnosis advances due to this: individuals made use of to think that the impacts of hypnosis resulted from a mystical magnetic fluid; we currently think that the results are the result of an interaction in between hypnotherapist as well as topic which can affect the way the mind processes info. Research study psychotherapists want what hypnotherapy is, and also physicians and also medical psychologists want what impacts hypnotherapy can have upon clinical and also mental conditions. Their research study is released in journals, and you can browse the database utilizing online devices like PubMed or Google Scholar. So there are certainly scientists thinking about hypnotherapy, and also you might claim that there is a science of hypnotherapy. Hypnotherapy is the name we offer to make use of hypnotherapy to deal with psychological and medical conditions, and there matters research regarding making use of hypnosis to deal with the disease. However, ‘hypnotherapy’ is a controversial term. Expert organizations such as the ISH, ASCH, and ESH think that just appropriately qualified specialists (such as doctors, dental experts, psychologists) ought to use hypnosis, which they should use as a tool alongside their various other professional skills. In their sight hypnotherapy isn’t a therapy in its own right, so a clinician would certainly claim “I’m a psychologist/doctor/dentist who makes use of hypnotherapy” as opposed to” I’m a hypnotherapist”. Individuals who call themselves ‘hypnotherapists’ don’t (as a whole) have a tendency to have any health care credentials besides hypnotherapy training, and they do not have a tendency to release much research. Given that, it might be reasonable to say that there is a science of hypnosis, yet that ‘hypnotherapists’ do not add much to it. (Concern sent by a confidential user). Q: I often drop comfortably asleep when making use of self-enhancement hypnosis CDs. Are the tips on the CD still reaching my subconscious mind or does the truth that I am sleeping and not in hypnosis avoid this? A: The idea that we can find out while we are asleep, so-called ‘hypnopedia’, was preferred throughout the 1950s. That is additionally the moment when a lot of the research was done. Outcomes do not appear to be really encouraging though: one study by Emmons & Simon) located that participants who had actually been played recordings while asleep did not far better than control participants at identifying words from a list. Not much study has been done given that which indicates that this is possibly not a fruitful subject of the research study. More modern research study has analyzed whether it is feasible for individuals undergoing basic anesthesia to find out. In these experiments really basic ‘finding out’ is examined: much simpler than the sort of deep level learning that you might want from a hypnotherapy CD. The signs are that it could be possible for really basic organizations to be formed, however, that the complex definitions of occasions are not really found out (Deeprose, 2006). To recap, the proof until now appears to point towards hypnotherapy requiring the individual to be awake. (Concern submitted by a reader). Q: Under hypnotherapy, do individuals address truthfully the concerns you ask? A: No more or less than they do when they are not under hypnotherapy. Hypnotherapy cannot oblige people to do points they don’t wish to do, and also it can’t force them to be sincere either. Pointers given during hypnotherapy can purposely or unintentionally influence memories, as well as consequently hypnotically-assisted memory recall is not admissible in court in most countries. Q: Can negative behavior be caused under hypnotherapy without my free will? A: See the solution above regarding whether hypnotherapy can make individuals do points they do not want to do. The short answer is no: hypnotized participants typically have the capability to refuse a tip. (Inquiry sent by a confidential individual). Q: When doing past life regression, when should I start asking questions? Sometimes I have actually noticed REM as well as other trance signs which is when I ask inquiries, yet I locate they abruptly awaken or have actually already gone to sleep. When and how should I start asking inquiries regarding youth memories or past lives? Past life Regression A: I do not know what context you’re operating in, however, unless you’re appropriately qualified I would think it ideal not to ask inquiries regarding youth memories or past lives while customers are hypnotized. Although hypnotherapy is typically used to re-visit occasions from an individual’s past, there is no proof that hypnotherapy can aid individuals to recall memories from childhood years with any type of special accuracy. When refrained properly you risk producing false-memory syndromes, which can be particularly purposeless in individuals with backgrounds of trauma. There is no clinical evidence supporting the existence of past lives, as well as no proof that it is practical to present the principle in therapy. The only time I ever give tips for past lives is as a mentor presentation, to demonstrate how creative people’s imaginations are. If patients/volunteers are quickly awakening or going to sleep, as well as do not do so for other parts of a hypnosis session, it would certainly indicate to me that they are not comfy with what is occurring and have actually not agreed to the procedure. Unless you really know what you are doing I would advise you not to use regression methods. (Concern submitted by a reader). Q: I have listened to that there are 3 types of people that are un-hypnotizable: the very first is drunk, the second is individuals that are high on medicines, can you tell me the 3rd one? A: The stylish response is “people who don’t want to be hypnotized”, however it’s worth clearing up a few misunderstandings. Researchers measure Hypnotisablity on a continuum – it’s not that a person can or can’t be hypnotized. A far better inquiry is “how hypnotizable is he or she?”. Hypnotizability complies with a typical distribution, so a little percentage of people are ‘highs’, a tiny percentage are ‘lows’, and also the bulk can experience some impacts of idea in hypnotherapy. It’s simple to be ‘un-hypnotizable’, simply do not enable yourself to be hypnotized – no one can be hypnotized against their will. Interestingly some medications such as laughing gas (laughing gas) and alcohol appear to raise Hypnotisablity. It depends on the drug, however, others such as diazepam don’t seem to have any type of result. See the web page on modifying Hypnotisablity for additional information. (Question sent by a reader). Q: Is the idea of hypnosis being a unique state of awareness revoked by highly motivated individuals forging hypnosis? A: No greater than it revokes the concept of a ‘damaged leg’ if someone makes believe to be harmed. The fact that it is feasible to make belief be hypnotized makes it an actually fascinating sensation. Stage hypnotherapists do not actually care significantly whether their individuals are fabricating or not, as long as the target market is chuckling. Researchers have a more challenging time ironing out the actual reactions from the pretenders, however, they have actually created some intriguing devices. One strategy is to utilize the real/simulator style. In this design, you supply the same pointers to people low and high in Hypnotisablity, with the lows told to act ‘as if they were hypnotized. If both groups do the exact same after that your outcome is possibly not as a result of hypnosis, but if the highs perform differently then it is assumed that several of the suggested results were real. More just recently, mind imaging techniques have been made use of to test the ‘genuineness’ of hypnotic impacts. (Inquiry submitted by a reader). Q: Is hypnotherapy ever is a one-session “quick fix” for a problem? A: The answer to this will depend a great deal on what ‘the issue’ is. It is simple to visualize that someone is most likely to, say, quit smoking after a solitary session than they are to recuperate from a more serious psychological illness such as chronic clinical depression or trauma (PTSD). Regarding cigarette smoking, there is some proof that a percentage of people will certainly become sober after one session of hypnosis. In one research 23% were abstinent two years after a single session of hypnotherapy. However, the evidence additionally seems to indicate that hypnosis is not a lot more reliable than other smoking cigarettes cessation treatments – so it is likely that roughly this percentage of people would certainly be aided to quit cigarette smoking after a single session of any type of therapy, which makes hypnosis appear rather less unique. Regarding single-session therapies for various other mental issues, there does not seem much strong proof for the efficiency of such treatments. There is a ‘short therapy’ motion (commonly called ‘service concentrated quick therapy’) for which there is some proof of performance for sure conditions. Within the short treatment, movement is some specialists that want ‘single-session psychotherapy’, but there is extremely little regulated evidence to recommend that it works. As opposed to single-session therapies there are thousands of randomized controlled tests for making use of cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for the treatment of psychological problems. These regulated studies normally suggest that a minimum of 6-20 sessions of psychiatric therapy are necessary for the treatment of light to modest difficulties. Thinking a lot more generally about the context in which much therapy is provided, CBT is widely used in lots of financially constrained medical solutions worldwide. The reality that CBT has advised shows that it is most likely among one of the most efficient treatments around: this judgment is also sustained by treatment review bodies such as the National Institute for Health and also Professional Excellence. If quick treatment or solitary session therapy is really effective after that the obligation is on the experts to demonstrate it using regulated studies, this stays to be shown. Q: Do specific differences in “imaginative suggestibility” supply a less complex description than dissociation in explaining responsiveness to hypnotic suggestions? A: Dissociation concepts of the hypnotherapy (e.g. Hilgard’s neodissociation concept, Woody & Arbor’s dissociated control theory) suggest that hypnosis creates ‘splits’ or dissociations in systems of cognitive control. Consistent with this there is evidence that Hypnotisablity is higher in patients with ‘dissociative’ problems such as trauma. Nevertheless, dissociation concepts additionally forecast that healthy people who dissociate extra in everyday life ought to also be a lot more hypnotizable. This does not seem to be the instance: studies associating hypnotic suggestibility with scores on the dissociative experience scale (DES) aren’t substantial. (e.g. Dienes et alia, 2009). Provided this, it doesn’t seem as though dissociation is horribly beneficial when attempting to explain responsiveness to hypnotic tips. On the other hand, scores of creative suggestibility (non-hypnotic suggestibility) tend to correlate really extremely with hypnotic suggestibility (Kirsch & Braffman, 2001). This suggests that both belong, but there are two issues staying: Some individuals argue that ‘hypnotherapy’ encompasses a broad domain of suggestion, in which hypnotic and non-hypnotic recommendations are essentially the very same point. Ok, you might have clarified variance in responsiveness to hypnotic suggestion, however, you have not described the device through which individuals react to non-hypnotic suggestion. What seems to be needed is a concept to discuss exactly how individuals respond to non-hypnotic tips. Kirsch & Braffman (2001) say that these aspects include: feedback expectancy, attitudes in the direction of hypnotherapy, dream proneness, absorption, as well as go/no-go reaction time. Nevertheless, they warn that these variables do not make up every one of the irregularities in non-hypnotic suggestibility. It is feasible that there is a hidden capacity, maybe with a genetic contribution to suggestibility (Raz, 2008), or organizations in between suggestibility and the dimension of specific mind regions (Horton et al, 2004). (Inquiry sent by a reader). Q: Does the reality that very inspired subjects can phony hypnotic effects invalidate the notion of hypnosis as a unique state of awareness? Why, or why not? A: Does the fact that a motivated individual can phony a busted leg revoke the idea of broken legs? Or does the fact that someone can phony anxiety invalidate the idea of anxiety? Even if something can be forged does not make it any less actual. I think the bit I would certainly differ with is the “one-of-a-kind state of consciousness”. Scientifically it’s extremely tough to distinguish between different ‘states of awareness’. We’re respectable at determining whether individuals are • awake, • asleep, or • in a coma. Yet the scientific research isn’t great at distinguishing between more subtle states of awareness. As opposed to general ‘states of awareness, it is possible to consider even more particular mind activity related to hypnotherapy and also hypnotic impacts. There is a great deal of neuroimaging evidence to suggest that there is something unique about the impacts of the idea given in hypnosis and that it generates genuine results. For example, a hypnotized individual provided ideas for discomfort relief can feel much less discomfort, as well as this, is related to decreased activity in the network of brain areas involved in discomfort.

5,Homeopathic Acne Treatment,health-fitness," Treatment for acne Treatment for acne depends on the severity of acne as well as its cause. Treatments for acne vary and there are different treatment options available from over the counter drugs to natural remedies. Listed below are the most popular and effective treatments for acne. Acne treatment is always a popular subject in medical journals and women’s magazines. Acne is a broad term for different skin rashes like pimples and deeper pustules, which are clogging pores. In some instances, when the process goes too deep into the skin, acne leaves permanent scars. Over the Counter Medications Once you have discovered the cause of your acne, you can have the option of using over the counter medications such as creams, ointments, lotions, and other anti-bactericidal products that contain benzoyl peroxide. Other Treatments for Acne Prescription medications are also available if you want a sure way to treat your acne problems. It is also best when you combine oral medications with antibiotics. However, natural remedies for acne are the best way to treat acne without leaving scars on your skin. Also, if scars already developed, natural remedies for acne are the best treatment for acne scars. What is acne? Acne is a common predominant skin disorder that affects all nations, races, and genders regardless of their ethnic background’s geographical location, or environmental conditions. The resulting impact is even more troublesome. According to a recent survey done in the US, about 25% of adults and 31% of teens surveyed said that acne sometimes keeps them from participating in social activities. Today, dermatologists have a consensus that only a few people survive their teen years without suffering at least an occasional acne break-out. For many, acne continues into their adult years, causing embarrassment and prompting the sufferer to search the cosmetic counters for means to cover the spots. Acne is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that causes spots and pimples, especially on the face, shoulders, back, neck, chest, and upper arms. Whiteheads, blackheads, pimples, cysts, and nodules are all types of acne. Acne is an inflammation of the sebaceous glands as well as hair follicles. This skin disorder usually affects young people during puberty (it is usually between the ages of 10-11 and 24-25 years). While in puberty the human body produces an uncommonly high level of sex hormones. This upsurge of hormones subsequently happens in both girls’ and boys’ organisms and results in the creation of enormous amounts of sebum (an oily product of the sebaceous glands). This oily component irritates and clogs the pores resulting in blemishes that get infected and convert into boils. Usually, after puberty, the level of hormones diminishes however in a woman’s body the upsurges of progesterone may happen on a monthly basis after ovulation and as a result, this hormonal “spike” initiates flair up of premenstrual acne. Acne is a skin ailment that impacts oil glands and hair follicles. The particular reason for acne is unidentified; however, there are several associated processes that may cause the development of acne. Physiological cycles that normally change hormonal production (menstrual cycles, puberty, etc.) hypothetically are accountable; An increase in the level of male sex hormone androgens stimulates the production of the sebum by the enlarged sebaceous glands; The Same upsurge of progesterone during pregnancy can stimulate acne development; Inheritance or genetics is another factor that causes acne. Scientists accept as true that the predisposition for acne may be genetic and may come from either parents or even previous generations; The buildup of dead epidermal cells may clog pores and stimulate acne; The body becomes allergic to microorganisms that develop colonies in the skin pores; Skin injuries, scratches, or irritations may activate the inflammation of hair follicles; Taking birth control pills changes the hormonal balance; Some pharmaceutical drugs; Some kind of cosmetics and makeup. Acne is a comprehensive term that includes different forms of skin rashes. The list of skin disorders that fall under the term Acne includes: Acne vulgaris: usually initiated prior to or during puberty, most common localization – face, shoulders, chest; Acne rosacea: A red skin elements mainly on the skin of the face; Acne keloidal is nuchae: Acne as a result of shaving with blades; Acne conglobate Chronic carbuncles initiated in sweat glands; most common localization - underarms, buttocks, and groin; Acne fulminant: The most aggressive form of acne conglobate; Acne cosmetic: Skin rash as a result of the use of some type of cosmetics; Acne medicamentosa: Acne appears at the beginning or the ending of taking some pharmaceutical drugs. Homeopathic medicine approaches acne treatment using a “like cures like” philosophy. It heals the individual as a whole system rather than particular skin elements and rashes. The homeopathic acne treatment process centers on the individual as a person that has its individual physical and emotional properties as well as on the patient’s pathological state. That’s why homeopathic remedies are carefully chosen as a result of complete medical and psychological assessment along with case analysis. The assessment always takes account of medical history, somatic,  psychological, and constitutional signs, the miasmatic tendency (predisposition/susceptibility), etc. Signs and symptoms of acne Acne is a huge term and the signs and symptoms of acne usually come in four forms Pustules Blackheads Whiteheads Pustules being the inflammatory form, while blackheads and whiteheads are the non-inflammatory forms. Pustules, also commonly known as pimples or zits, are red, inflamed, and tiny swells that occur due to the walls of hair follicles that rupture for some reason. Blackheads are formed when the skin pores are clogged. This form of acne does not usually cause inflammation, hence, they do not develop into pimples. Being close to the skin surface, the melanin (the pigment in our skin that provides its color) on the clogged pores is oxidized resulting in the black coloration. Thus, it cannot be washed away by water and soap and it is not true that these are caused by dirt and poor skin hygiene. On the other hand, whiteheads are more likely to be inflamed and develop into pimples. Unlike the blackheads, these are formed when the skin pores are clogged in the deeper part of the skin, and the lack of an exit point will lead to whiteheads formation Another signs and symptoms of acne are cysts, these are larger than pimples but also red and inflamed. These symptoms signify a more serious type of skin condition. Those signs and symptoms illustrated above are caused by excessive oil production by our sebaceous glands and skin pores that are clogged by dead skin cells. And the skin that undergoes this condition is typically oily and has large skin pores. Teenagers are more affected by this because, during the puberty period, the glands that secrete the sebum are overactive due to hormonal changes in the body. Causes of acne Although the causes of acne are unidentified, doctors recognize that there are factors linked to its causes. Causes of acne on the chin are the same as acne at any other part of your body. Inflammations of the skin on the chin are generally the result of hormone instabilities that can occur during puberty or the menstrual cycle. However, chin pimples can affect anyone of any age. Listed below are the most common causes of acne Hormones Androgens or male hormones that surge during puberty are said to have a major effect on acne breakouts. In women, the hormonal changes involved in menstruation and pregnancy may also flare up acne. Hormonal birth control pills are also one of the Causes of acne on the chin. The reason behind this is that hormonal contraceptives may alter the regular hormonal cycle of women which may contribute to having acne. The solution for this is to change from hormonal to non-hormonal contraceptives. Stopping a hormonal treatment (such as testosterone) may also contribute to hormonal imbalance, and in turn, be a reason for what are the Causes of acne on chin. Genes Indeed, studies have shown that school-aged children who have acne have family members who have had or are still having zits. Environment The environment contributes largely to acne breakouts. Those who are residing in tropical and humid countries may experience breakouts, as opposed to those living in cold countries. Other Factors Stress is one of the factors that contribute largely to having acne. Another factor that causes acne is skin irritants. These include oil-based cosmetics, as well as harsh handling of the skin. Natural treatment for acne Natural treatments for acne aim to both reduce the pimples and blemishes that characterize acne, as well as treating the scars that are left behind on the skin by acne.

Homeopathic acne treatment - #1 natural treatment for acne The remedies for acne treatment listed below point to the therapeutic similarity; however, it is not a comprehensive and certain instruction for homeopathic acne healing. Moreover, the symptoms shown for each remedy not necessarily unswervingly linked to acne since in homeopathic medicine both wide-ranging symptoms and constitutional signs are taken into consideration for picking the right medicine. Sulphur It is probably the medicine that most commonly designated for acne treatment and other skin problems, especially in chronic form. In order to prescribe Sulphur, a homeopath should find skin bumpy and firm.  This acne patient will complain about constipation. Patients who benefit from Sulphur feel aggravation from water and that’s why they prefer to avoid washing their face and taking a shower. Other indications for Sulfur are pale face with cloying color, hot, dotted irritation, and wide-open black pores. The Itching in Sulphur patients usually intensifies in the late afternoon hours. It’s also become worse from warmth. The Acne punctata is the form of this skin disorder that most closely links to Sulphur. Sanguinaria It is one more beneficial homeopathic medicine for acne treatment, mainly in females with light and short menstruation and unbalanced blood circulation, with areas of stagnation. Other homeopathic medicines for acne that develop as a result of a woman’s sexual hormonal misbalance are Calcarea carbonica and Aurum Muriaticum. Kali Bromatum Acne that would yield to this remedy located on the face, front and sides of the neck, and upper shoulders. We often see acne in patients who have been treated with high doses of bromides due to epilepsy. Kali Bromatum is most similar to Acne simplex and Acne indurata, and mainly in hyper-aesthetic females. Other symptoms that link Kali Bromatum to acne patient are: The face is reddened; Pustules Acne on a face; Intellectual deficiency – significant memory loss, melancholia; Numbness of the mucous and skin; Suicidal desires, tremulousness; Skin rash main localization: face, upper shoulders, and chest. As per Dr. J.H. Clarke, “In instances of a vulgar form of acne Kali Bromatum 30C is the most useful and efficient.” Antimonium crudum This remedy requires very specific symptoms and generalities: The Antimonium crudum acnes are always in a form of small pustules Acne in patients with alcohol addiction and stomach disorders, The patient is dehydrated with a white-coated tongue. Face with depressed appearance, agitated, annoyed, and grumpy; Antimonium crudum patient cries when looks, washes, or touches acne. These patients are also euphoric, pensive, and emotional. Antimonium Tartaricum. Stubborn medical cases of acne, with a predisposition to pustulation, are curable with Antimonium Tartaricum. Natrum Muriaticum This famous homeopathic remedy pinpoints its power mainly to sebaceous glands and is a very beneficial medicine in an acne treatment clinic. To select Natrum Muriaticum homeopathic physician must focus particularly on the individual’s constitutional signs. Personality, temper, propensities, and other common signs are much more significant than the simple topical symptoms. Belladonna This remedy is best suited for Acne Rosacea. Rawness and whiteness of the skin replace each other. In Belladonna patients, the skin is dehydrated, hot, inflated, and puffy. Pustules mainly localized the skin of a face. A face suddenly turns red and then suddenly pale. Belladonna patients are usually overweight, with blond hair, blue eyes. Their intellectual level is above average. Hahnemann in his Materia Medica mentioned that Belladonna doesn’t work on patients with low IQ. Also, all symptoms in Belladonna patients are acute and they happen unexpectedly There are many more homeopathic remedies that are effective for different forms of acne if used based on “like cures like” principles. Routine hygienic procedures - a vital component of any type of natural treatment for acne Along with the use of homeopathic remedies, personal hygiene is very important for fast and effective acne treatment. I recommend to my patients the following hygienic procedures: Gently rinse the skin of the face using most mild cleansing products at least twice a day and after any activities that may cause It is essential to wash hair on a regular basis. If the hair is oily, wash them more often. Rinse your face with plain water 5-6 times a day. Do not scrub and touch skin lacerations. Scrubbing and touching increase blood circulation and gives a vehicle for bacteria to travel around your body. Any actions on blemishes (squeezing, picking, punching), especially without the use of sterile materials, may result in advance of infection and further progress of scars or dark marks. Careful shaving is very important. Both blades and electric shaver may cause symptoms of deterioration. Be careful when selecting the right cosmetics products. Read reviews about each product you are planning to use. Avoid cosmetic products that contain any scrubbing ingredients If common hygienic procedures and over-the-counter creams have not accomplished good results after a few months and skin elements still present or became even worse, contact your family doctor, dermatologist, or homeopath.

6,In what consist aesthetic orthodontics?,health-fitness," Cosmetic orthodontics, or often called cosmetic orthodontics, involves using certain types of fixed or movable orthodontic appliances to improve the appearance of permanent teeth. One of the most demanded treatments is to put the teeth straight or that they are all joined. There is a great and growing demand among adults for cosmetic orthodontic treatments that provide the same results as conventional orthodontics, but with a more aesthetically pleasing process that is not as visible as iron braces. For example, today in cosmetic orthodontic treatments, the braces used are usually ceramic to match the natural color of the teeth, or even transparent braces that are much less visible. Aesthetic orthodontics has the same effectiveness as traditional orthodontics, although its main difference, regardless of the aesthetic or image factor, is that they are a little more expensive than traditional braces, depending on the materials chosen. One of the most used treatments today is invisible Invisalign orthodontics, which is a novel technique that consists of the use of different transparent splints that change weekly or biweekly depending on the case until the tooth is placed or the desired position is reached. It is the system with the best relationship between aesthetics, comfort and price, as it is composed of splints it is totally removable and therefore, the most hygienic technique that exists in the market today, does not cause friction and is not composed of elements that can become detached and cause discomfort to the patient. The braces used to treat the teeth are usually made of plastic or various metals such as titanium or steel and generally do not differ much between the patient's teeth. There are several material options that can be used: ceramic, zirconia, sapphire, or plastic. In Idiáquez Dental Polyclinics in San Sebastián they are specialized in orthodontic treatments so they can recommend the best treatment if you are looking to improve your smile. Aesthetic and conventional orthodontics are used to correct tooth problems such as: •	When there is a malocclusion, that is, the upper and lower teeth are not aligned, so that they do not fit when chewing. •	 Malpositions, when there is a tooth that has grown incorrectly, preventing proper chewing. •	Dental crowding, in case there are several teeth together that do not have space between them. Certain appliances can correct these dental problems in adults and improve the position of both the teeth and the jaw. Aesthetic orthodontics achieves effective results while maintaining the appearance of the patient's smile throughout the orthodontic process. Preparation for the treatment The first thing is to go to a consultation with the specialist who will recommend one type of treatment or another and for how many months. Every month or every two months the orthodontist will make revisions and change the braces if necessary. It is important to take into account oral hygiene during treatment, for this it is recommended: • Remove previously the accessories of the appliance that are movable, such as the rubber bands. • Clean each tooth separately, dedicating the necessary time to do so and gently brushing both sides (inside and outside), from top to bottom and towards the interdental spaces. • Do mouthwash often to kill any bacteria. Care after cosmetic orthodontic treatment Proper oral hygiene should always be maintained, although in cases where the person uses orthodontic treatment, it may be even more important. Once orthodontic treatment is complete, the use of a splint is sometimes recommended. It is a type of appliance, similar to a night guard, that is placed on the teeth to provide support and reinforce long-term results and that is worn at night."
7,How to Keep Your Head Cool When Wearing Wigs in the Hot Summer Months,health-fitness," During the hot summer months, keeping your head cool while wearing a wig could be a challenge if you do not know the right way to do it. The way you prep your real hair to install a wig in the hot months all depends on your hair type. Your hair’s thickness will determine the best way(s) to prep your hair before installing your favorite wig. To summarize, the longer and thicker your hair is, the more prepping you may need to do. This ensures that there will be no unnatural and unsightly looking bumps and humps which alter the shape of your head when you place the wig while keeping your head at its coolest. For short thin hair, the process is its easiest. If you are wearing a non-lace wig, try wearing those which have ventilation, preferably the capless type. This will give your scalp the most ventilation possible. There are different types of wig caps you can wear under a wig. Some people prefer stocking caps, but these are not ideal for the hot months as they will make your head very hot and if you sweat in your scalp, stocking caps will make sweating occurrences worse. To keep your head its coolest, wear a wig cap that is mesh based. One with lots of holes which will allow for a high level of ventilation. If the wig is lace front or human hair, you may not have a capless option. This takes away some of the ventilation because you have solid fabric on your head on some, most or all areas of the wig, depending on the wig type. In this case, just use the mesh cap and this should keep your head as cool as possible. Also, when it’s hotter, try wearing shorter styles or if the hair is long, wear in updo styles which have parting in some areas of the style to allow for some ventilation of the cap. If you have very long or thick hair, you should braid the hair flat in cornrows before applying the wig cap. In the cooler months, you may get away with just putting your real hair in a ponytail before you put on the wig cap, but in the summer, this will add head to your scalp as it reduces ventilation. You would want to braid the hair in flat small cornrow braids or small single braids connected together if you cannot braid cornrows. This will ensure that your real hair sits flat underneath the wig, allowing for as natural a look as possible, while providing the maximum ventilation to the scalp. After braiding, apply the mesh cap, then apply the wig. These tips will keep your head the coolest in the hot months. If you are wearing a lace wig, make sure you position the wig’s hairline just in front of your real hairline and secure. This ensures that none of your real hair shows through the lace of the wig."

This is one thing modern medicine cannot boast of right now. How many people have suffered financial hardship, just because they attempt to access quality healthcare for themselves or loved ones? They cost of consulting a doctor, running laboratory diagnostics or purchasing drugs is up the roof and a lot of people don’t have that much money lying around for medical care or emergencies. What if I tell you there is good news, that you don’t have to pay out of pocket again to access quality healthcare – most of you won’t believe me, and frankly speaking I don’t blame you because this country e get as e be! The sector has its issues – yes! Below are some advocacy models I propose to increase uptake of health insurance services ·        Advocacy visits to relevant religious, political and traditional rulers and stakeholders. ·        Health insurance fair; typically modelled after a trade fair, different HMOs and prospects brought together. HMOs would sell their offerings to prospects (large organizations, SMEs, NGOs and individuals) and prospects would then make informed decisions before shopping for a plan. ·        Creation of radio dramas and jingles that are relatable, in different languages and themes, targeted at different audiences, all with a clear message talking about Health insurance. ·        Purchase of various air times on radio (different radio stations), continuously talking about health insurance, with different themes, topics and twists to make each episode seem refreshing and also educative. ·        Creation of TV series starring great and popular actors and crew members, with health insurance as a strong theme, hence partnership with production houses for tv series, web series and movies that would not only show mainstream but also online taking advantage of online streaming platforms. ·        Partnerships with popular artists to sing songs about the importance of health insurance in a refreshing and trending manner. ·        Town hall meetings. ·        Educational competitions between students; secondary and tertiary institutions about health insurance, with outstanding prizes such as health plans for winners and their families, a friend, a neighbour and a teacher/lecturer. ·        Grants to business men/women (market men/women) who can show proof that they have enrolled with their families for any health insurance plan for at least one year. ·        More symposiums and public awareness campaigns. ·        Press conferences organized to carry the press and public along. ·        Taking great advantage of social media. ·        Closed door meetings between NHIS, HMOs and other relevant stakeholders to drive public private partnerships. Getting a health insurance plan provides you the luxury of options that poverty has taken away. A health insurance plan is not just a cover, but a shield, defense and one way ticket to freedom. Not getting cover goes beyond lacking a premium, it a situation that makes every other issue/problem in your life much more prominent. Investment in healthcare is not a waste of money or luxury reserved for certain people. Having health insurance did not seem like much of a big deal to me at a certain time, because com’on that is the smart thing to do, every enlightened person knew the importance and had a health insurance plan (in my mind, lol). My bubble burst when reality set in, I had resigned from work a couple of months’ back and the good thing that the health plan purchased for me by my previous workplace was still valid. So here I was, out of work and dealing with life and boom! the doctor's report got to me that I needed to get a major surgery done. It was a mixture of several emotions and I knew for a fact that I had to deal with each emotion differently, but the one thing I was grateful I did not have to worry about was the money required for the surgery (my plan covered most of it). This personal experience did not inspire this article, but rather it fuelled the urgency to speak my truth and spread the message of the health insurance gospel. Our society is so diverse and complex; healthcare, including health insurance has never been a priority for the government and so many individuals, because of the difficulty of trying to survive day to day in an already difficult society. Health insurance is a thrust in the achievement of Universal Health Coverage (UHC2030). A lot of people would argue that achievement of UHC2030 is mission impossible, I would say that your dream of obtaining a PhD in 5 years’ time, getting married next year or even owning a thriving farming business in 4 months’ time is also mission IMPOSSIBLE, if you don’t put in the WORK! I recommend believers in this school of thought change their lens and look at it like aiming for the stars and if we don’t achieve completely what we set out to achieve, then we fell to the clouds. We aimed for the stars, fell to the clouds but most importantly we never remained on the ground. Fortune favors the bold but the future favors the insured, get your plan today before you have need of it. #uhc2030 #healthinsurance #sdgs2030 #undp #sdg3 #unicef #publichealth"
9,The classical Periodontal treatment protocol,health-fitness," The classical Periodontal treatment protocol is generally divided into 4 stages： 1.Initial phase (or cleaning phase) 2.Assessment phase 3.Surgical phase 4.Maintenance phase As periodontitis usually occurs in the context of untreated periodontal disease, it is essential to carry out periodontal treatment of the whole mouth prior to oral implant placement or treatment of periodontitis. In the initial phase of treatment, a non-surgical approach is usually used. The patient's oral hygiene is effectively controlled and dental calculus and plaque are removed by subgingival scraping and ultrasonic scaling. This is followed by the use of the S3 dental diode diode laser with a 980nm wavelength, set at 2.5W and a 50Hz pulsed output. The laser fibre tip is extended into the periodontal pocket and slides along the implant surface while emitting the laser. Frequent visual checks are required to check that the fiber tip is not contaminated with coagulated tissue debris and that it is removed promptly by means of a wet cotton ball. This has the advantage of preventing excessive tissue temperature due to the absorption of laser energy by the optical fibre tip. During each treatment session, three 30-second laser sterilisation exposures are performed for each implant. During these 30 seconds, the laser can be fired for 2-3 seconds and then paused for 2-3 seconds, for a cumulative laser exposure time of 30 seconds. This is done in order to strictly control the excessive temperature of the tissue. As the pigments carried by the bacteria are strongly absorbed by the semiconductor laser, the inflamed cells are destroyed and broken down. However, the surrounding normal tissues are not affected by the high temperature and the 650nm biostimulating effect of the laser is carried out, achieving a twofold effect. In the following week, the laser sterilisation treatment is repeated two more times. If there is still no significant improvement after the third laser treatment, it is time to consider preparing for the surgical phase. If clinical improvement is evident, the patient can return in 6-8 weeks for the evaluation phase. The goal of the initial phase is to reduce the inflamed tissue as much as possible. The advantage of the dental laser in this phase is the dual effect of sterilisation thoroughness and biostimulation. During the evaluation phase, the hygiene of the periodontium and the recovery of the gums after the initial phase of treatment need to be assessed. Only if the patient's condition has effectively improved should he/she proceed to the maintenance phase, and if bleeding gums and purulent fluid are still present, preparation for the surgical phase should be considered. It is important to note that although many patients with peri-implantitis are already severe enough to require surgical intervention at the time of consultation, it is still important to start with the initial phase of treatment, and laser therapy is a more effective method than conventional treatment. The aim of the surgical phase is to gain access to the entire surface area of the implant. This allows for the complete removal of the stones and the application of laser sterilisation. The surgical intervention is aimed at patients who have had little success in the initial phase of treatment. The entire implant surface is exposed through an internal flap. The granulation tissue around the implant is carefully removed and if stones are seen adhering to the implant surface, they can be removed by ultrasound or erbium laser. Subsequently, the remaining material on the implant surface is sterilised by laser irradiation. A power of 2 W is irradiated in continuous mode for 10 seconds, moving the fibre tip quickly to avoid excessive temperatures on the implant surface. The maintenance phase is designed to maintain the effect of the treatment over a relatively longer period of time. The examination depends on the length of the follow-up interval. If there are slight signs of inflammation recurring around the implant, the diode laser can be used again for sterilisation and biostimulation."
10,What You should Know About Urogynaecology,health-fitness," Urogynaecology focuses on pelvic floor disorders. The pelvic floor in women is important as it helps the pelvic organs such as the uterus, bladder, rectum and vagina to be supported both in terms of anatomy and function. It is typically weakened and damaged from pregnancy, childbirth, ageing and menopause – hence most women are vulnerable to developing problems associated with their pelvic floor in various stages of their life. Pelvic floor disorders, if left untreated, can reduce your quality of life and affect your relationships significantly. It is important to note that many women can suffer from different types of pelvic floor disorders at different stages of their lives, or more than 1 type of pelvic floor disorders at any 1 time. If you suspect that you may be having a pelvic floor disorder, it is best to consult a urogynaecologist as opposed to a general gynaecologist, as he/she is a trained specialist with specific expertise in diagnosis, investigation and treatment of women’s pelvic floor disorders. Common pelvic floor disorders include: This refers to a drooping of the uterus, bladder or rectum into and beyond the vagina. It is more common in older women, affecting 1 in 3 women who have had children. 1 in 10 women will need surgery in their lifetime for POP. The main cause of POP is weakened pelvic floor muscles from damage sustained during pregnancy and childbirth as well as weakening from ageing and menopause. Another major cause of POP involves chronic increased pressure on pelvic floor muscles e.g. obesity, chronic cough, chronic constipation, jobs that involve heavy lifting/straining. Symptoms of POP include feeling a lump in the vagina, or a heavy dragging sensation, bleeding after menopause, urinary issues, constipation or painful sex. Treatment options for POP include non-surgical and surgical. Non-surgical options include Kegel exercises to strengthen the weakened pelvic floor muscle tone, lifestyle changes and vaginal pessaries (which are soft, removable devices that is inserted in your vagina to support your prolapsed pelvic organs). Surgery for POP is individualised and performed by a urogynaecologist who will advise you based on the severity of your pelvic organ prolapse, age, general health, medical conditions, surgical history and sexual activity. This is when one leaks urine involuntarily under various circumstances. This can include when you are physically exerting yourself e.g. laughing, coughing, sneezing, jogging, jumping, or when you feel the urge to go to the toilet but are unable to make it there in time. This can occur even in young women e.g. during pregnancy or shortly after childbirth, all the way to menopausal women. The causes of urinary incontinence include weakened pelvic floor muscles (damage sustained during pregnancy and childbirth, weakening from ageing and menopause, obesity), weakened bladder muscles (from ageing and nerve damage), medications. Factors that worsen urinary incontinence include caffeine, certain medical conditions and smoking. Treatment for urinary incontinence often involves conservative lifestyle changes including maintaining a healthy weight, adjusting diet or fluid intake, cutting down on caffeine, bladder training, taking scheduled toilet breaks, avoiding smoking and constipation, Kegel exercises. In certain cases, surgery may be recommended by your urogynaecologist. This is when you find yourself feeling the urge to urinate and needing to visit the toilet frequently. If this happens at night while you are sleeping, it is termed nocturia. This can be disruptive to your social activities and work as you may find your life revolving around the toilet. The main cause of OAB is bladder muscles squeezing to try and empty urine out when you don’t intend to. Sometimes this can be caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI) that goes away after some time. In other cases, this can be caused by damage to the nervous system e.g. older age or medical conditions such as diabetes, stroke, dementia etc. Other causes include weakened pelvic floor muscles, medications and caffeine. Treatment of OAB involves first-line lifestyle changes similar to that of urinary incontinence. Medications for OAB can usually prescribed in addition to the lifestyle changes above. These relax your bladder muscle and allow you to increase the intervals that you need to pass urine. Finally, 2nd line invasive options include Botox injection into the bladder (this is done through a scope into the bladder under local or general anaesthesia) and nerve stimulation. These are reserved for women who have failed to improve despite all measures and usually need to be repeated as their effects last for 6 months."
11,A Beginner's Guide to Pilates,health-fitness," Pilates is an all-natural, low-impact form of exercise that has been used for rehabilitation, sports training, and general health maintenance since the 1970s. Pilates is ideal for people who have a variety of different health conditions, including chronic pain, arthritis, back pain, neck pain, and other conditions that affect the soft tissues of the body.

Spirulina, being rich in protein, is an excellent source of essential fatty acids, which are vital for cell creation and maintenance. It is also rich in vitamin A, B vitamins, and iron. This makes spirulina a good source of essential fatty acids for a diet, especially for pregnant women and children. Spirulina also contains many other nutrients that are beneficial to our health. Spirulina is often consumed as a supplement because it has a wide range of health benefits. It is said to be the most nutritious multivitamin, mineral and antioxidant available. It has been used for centuries in the South Pacific by people who recognize the many benefits it provides. The spirulina taken will help to lower blood sugar levels because of the high iron content. High blood sugar levels increase the risk of contracting diabetes. People with diabetes should consider taking spirulina for its ability to lower blood sugar levels naturally. Spirulina may also help to prevent the onset of cancer, especially colon cancer. Cancer that starts with an elevated blood sugar level is more difficult to treat and may also prove to be a fatal cancer. For this reason, people suffering from high blood sugar should consider taking spirulina."
13,The extra advantages of jump rope,health-fitness," If you are looking for a workout equipment that costs less than RM10, portable enough to be carried anywhere, can be shared with family members and friends, also enhance cardiovascular fitness while bulking up muscle, a jump rope is the answer. A jump rope, also known as skipping rope, is a tool used in the jumping rope or skipping exercise, in which one or more individuals jump over a rope swung under their feet and over their heads. Jump ropes come in a variety of type including basic rope, speed rope, weighted rope, beaded rope and the list goes on. Jumping rope exercise has numerous advantages, ranging from weight loss to severe diseases prevention such as coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Therefore, here are several benefits of jumping rope exercise including burn calories effectively, strengthen the bone and improve coordination of the body. To begin with, jumping rope is an effective way to lose calories in a short amount of time. Jumping rope is classified as a thermogenics exercise which means that it generates a lot of heat in your body since it engages most of the main muscle groups. To generate this energy, your body must burn more fuel, which results in a large number of calories being burned. According to celebrity trainer Jillian Michaels, founder of The Jillian Michaels Fitness App, jumping rope burns more calories than any steady-state cardio, such as rowing, jogging, walking, and swimming. According to Science Daily, this aerobic exercise will also reach a ""burn rate"" of up to 1300 calories per hour, with around 0.1 calories burn per hop. Jumping rope for ten minutes is approximately equal to running a mile in eight minutes. Evidently, jumping rope is one of the most effective forms of exercise when it comes to burning calories compared to other cardio exercises. Subsequently, jumping rope exercise is able to increase the bone mineral density hence strengthens your bones. Bone density is a measurement of bone strength; the more nutrients, such as calcium, in your bones, the less brittle and prone they are to crack. According to a report, published in the Public Library of Science in 2017, girls aged 11 to 14 who engaged in weekly jump roping had higher bone density than those who did not jump rope. Moreover, during the jumping rope exercise, you are putting more pressure on the bones than most other forms of exercise. When the body is under tension, it remodels the bone to make it thicker and denser. However, patients with serious osteoporosis and those who have previously fractured a bone should use extreme care. High-impact exercise or activity, notably jumping rope, can trigger compression fractures in the spine, as well as wrist and other bone fractures if undesirable scenario such as falling while doing so. Thus, you should seek for medical advices from a certified doctor before doing this exercise. A part from that, the jumping rope's steady cadence and tempo can help improve coordination between your eyes, feet, and hands. Based on a research reported in the Research Journal of Pharmacy and Technology in 2017, jumping rope helped autistic children improve their motor coordination and balance, which they often struggle with. Jump rope sometimes seems simple and straightforward, but the process of constantly twisting the rope around the body while jumping at precisely the right moment for the rope to clear the feet necessitates the whole body in synchronization for an extended period of time. Furthermore, this exercise necessarily requires a high level of coordination, particularly as you progress to more advanced moves. For instance, Boxer Skip, Criss Cross, Double Under and Double Under Criss Cross. Finding the rhythm does take practice, but once you do, it is as if you have discovered your physical potential. Additionally, this exercise also involves rapid tapping motion of the feet up and down. During the jumping rope exercise, you are moving your feet up and down with a swift tapping motion. As a result, it is ideal for sports like basketball, boxing, and soccer, which require constant changes of direction. As well as any other sport that necessitates a great deal of full-body coordination. To sum up, there are numerous benefits of jumping rope exercise which are burn calories effectively, strengthen the bone and improve coordination of the body. So, here are some tips and advice that may be helpful to those who are interested in including the jumping rope exercise as a part of their workout routine. First, do not forget the warm up and cool down session before and after the exercise, respectively. Spending about five to ten minutes for each session should be enough to help reduce muscle pain or soreness after exercising. Secondly, it is crucial to choose the right shoes. A decent pair of shoes will cushion your feet so you do not hurt or injure yourself. Thirdly, ever do this exercise on a slippery mat to prevent unpleasant situations like slipping and causing a bad injury. Last but not least, take your time. It is impossible to turn yourself into an expert jump roper within a day. Begin by going at a slow and steady pace. Then, subtly and gradually increase the pace day by day. Remember, Rome was not built in a day!"

16,When is an orthodontics treatment necessary?,health-fitness," Orthodontics is a treatment that has been very popular for several years and it is very common to see many adolescents wearing braces on their teeth to correct their bite or change the position of their teeth. Because of this, orthodontics is often associated with adolescents, so you may be surprised to learn that seven-year-olds can already benefit from early orthodontic treatment, as there are now increasingly earlier diagnoses of orthodontic treatments that will be very beneficial for children's dental health in their future. When orthodontic treatment is recommended When orthodontic treatment is needed it is usually because there is a problem that will significantly worsen in the future if it is not solved at that time. This includes problems such as underbites and crossbites that can develop into painful malocclusions (misalignments) and cause joint and jaw pain, as well as problems chewing. Orthodontic treatment is also recommended when the teeth are positioned in a way that recession of the gums occurs and is likely to worsen. There are also differences between boys and girls. Many of the girls start having this treatment at 13 and 14 years old as they adapt much better to braces than later when they are 15 or 16 years old and feel more self-conscious and in their mid-teens. When orthodontics is optional In general, orthodontic treatment is an optional treatment when you have a functional bite, but it would improve the aesthetics of the teeth and make them straighter or in line. Of course, having straighter teeth has benefits such as increased confidence and a better self-image. It can also be easier to keep your teeth clean if they are straight and therefore less likely to develop cavities. However, it is still important to understand that orthodontic treatment in these circumstances is optional and not of vital importance. Aesthetics orthodontics treatments can be done over the years and not necessarily during adolescence. Treatment and early diagnosis is the best Orthodontists are trained to detect problems early, so that treatment can be done before braces or surgery are necessary. At Políclinicas Dental Idiáquez in San Sebastián, you can consult with your orthodontists and the treatment that is most appropriate in each case. In general, it is best to have a good diagnosis as soon as possible, as early treatment generally makes the whole process simpler, even more cost-effective, and helps ensure a better outcome going forward. As we age, the jawbone stops growing and hardens, so orthodontic treatment, while still possible, becomes a bit more difficult and sometimes the expected results are not achieved. If treatment begins at an early age such as eight and nine, there is an opportunity to guide the growth of the jawbone and to be able to change the position and width of the jaw bones. Unfortunately, this is not possible for adults and alternative solutions may require surgery or the extraction of many teeth in order to correct the bite. This is not to say that all seven-year-olds should automatically see an orthodontist, but it is very important that they attend regular check-ups with their dentist. In addition to going to regular check-ups, your dentist will be attentive to any problems that may require early orthodontic intervention."

A biopsy is required to diagnose this illness. A bronchoscope is frequently used to take a biopsy of the lung. Other body tissues may be biopsied as well. The following tests can be performed in the laboratory: Calcium levels are high (urinary, ionized, blood) a full blood count Immunoelectrophoresis is a technique for detecting antibodies. Tests of liver function Quantitative immunoglobulins are immunoglobulins that are measured in terms of their quantity. Mix and match Angiotensin converting enzyme is a type of enzyme that converts angiotensin to (ACE) Symptoms of sarcoidosis often improve on their own over time without therapy. Corticosteroid medication is frequently suggested if the eyes, heart, neurological system, or lungs are affected. The medicine will most likely need a period of one to two years to be used. Drugs that inhibit the immune system are sometimes employed as well. Some persons with end-stage lung or heart disease may require organ transplantation in rare situations. Predictions (prognosis) Many people who have sarcoidosis aren't critically unwell and can recover on their own. Within three years, around half of the people become better without treatment. Lung injury can occur in those who have lung involvement. Sarcoidosis has a low overall mortality rate of less than 5%. The following are some of the causes of death: Bleeding from the lungs Damage to the heart causes heart failure and irregular cardiac rhythms. Lung scarring is a condition in which the tissue of the lungs becomes scarred (pulmonary fibrosis) Complications that could occur Sarcoidosis can lead to the following complications: Infections of the lungs caused by fungi (aspergillosis) Uveitis causes glaucoma and blindness (rare) High calcium levels in the blood and urine cause kidney stones. Osteoporosis and other side effects can occur if there is a Long-term use of corticosteroids. Hypertension in the lungs' arteries (pulmonary hypertension) When should you seek medical help?

With an eyeliner pencil of various colors, preferably black, this eyeliner goes over the upper eyelid and extends outside the limits of the eye to the extent that is preferred. It is a very modern style, but it easily combines with all types of wedding dresses and with the wide variety of hairstyles that exist. To complement, eyelashes are worn with a lot of volumes, including placing false eyelashes. In addition to the eyeliner, it is necessary to use some eye shadow to generate much more depth in your eyes. The blending technique is the favorite of the season to acquire this effect. It can be done with dark shadows, ideal for the night, or with shades in earth tones or pastels for use during the day. The shadows, in turn, must be placed in an ascending way, accompanying the outlined and trying to make the eyebrows as straight as possible. Your eyes will make everyone fall in love! The natural and illuminated style is another of the trends in makeup for brides. The idea is that the skin is seen with a certain brightness, for which a type of makeup called ""glowy"" is used, which brightens and illuminates, very subtly, certain features of your face, such as your cheekbones or your nose. The glow tone that you apply to your skin will depend on the time of your wedding day: for the day, we recommend whiter tones, while for the night, you can apply golden tones with glitter to make it even more glamorous. Since the makeup trends for brides give great relevance to the eyes within the whole set, for the lips, we will bet on nude tones so that they can be seen as naturally as possible. The matte lipsticks, in the great diversity of nude tones that are available on the market, are preferred for two reasons: they are very durable (something essential for a wedding) and increase the thickness of your lips without delineating out. Another of the key elements to be a very stylish bride is having very bushy eyebrows, although neat. If you naturally have little hair on your eyebrows, you can choose to highlight them with a pencil or with shadows, always making sure that they look as little makeup as possible. There are also specific treatments to repopulate eyebrows, such as hair by hair treatment. Ideally, the eyebrows should extend the length of your eyes, which will make them look even more beautiful and with more prominence. Finally, if you are not a fan of pompous makeup, we tell you that a natural style has also emerged as one of the trends for brides this year and next. It's about just applying a base with the tone closest to your skin and focusing only on one of the points on your face: light-colored shadows, lips of neutral color, or simply applying a little mascara."

20,Laser therapy for peri-implantitis,health-fitness," It is well known that the popularity of oral implants is increasing every year as people's living standards improve. The number of patients with peri-implantitis has increased rapidly in recent years due to the treatment conditions and the lack of awareness of patient protection at a later stage. If peri-implantitis is not treated promptly and effectively, it can lead to the loss of the implant. Peri-implant infections have a similar etiology to periodontal infections, so is the treatment similar? Conventional treatment options for peri-implantitis without flap reversal have a poor chance of success. When we treat peri-implantitis after flap treatment, the outcome is much better. Although the flap allows better access to the implant, the sterilisation of the implant surface is much more complex than with normal subgingival scraping. The complex structure of the implant surface, although a good facilitator of bonding during implantation, is a headache trap for peri-implant infections. As a result, the tools utilised in the treatment of periodontitis have difficulty in completely removing the bacteria and infected tissue from the implant surface, making their use much less effective. Laser-assisted periodontitis treatment options ： Using the properties of oral laser wavelengths and biological tissue absorption, lasers can act as bacterial killers and biostimulators. In particular, the wavelength of the semiconductor laser is in the near infrared band, so the 980nm wavelength has a good absorption effect on the melanin carried by bacteria and can be more effective in killing them. In addition, the 650nm wavelength has a biostimulating effect and accelerates tissue recovery, making it the tool of choice for peri-implantitis treatment. Objectives of peri-implantitis treatment Reduce implant infection Strengthen the bond with the bone In order to achieve this goal, the implant surface should be free from any foreign bacterial or toxin infection. If cleared, previous tissue inflammation will recover quickly and the patient's own healthy cells will re-attach to the implant surface. The key to the treatment of peri-implantitis is the removal of infected material and toxins from the implant surface. Traditional cleaning methods including the use of scrapers or ultrasound devices are limited in the treatment of peri-implantitis. If laser treatment is used in addition to the traditional treatment modalities, it can be very sterilising, disinfecting and biostimulating. Stay tuned, in the next chapter you will read about the PIOON S3 blue 3-wavelength dental laser for periodontal treatment."

1,What to do when a tooth moves and it becomes loose?,health-fitness," One of the worst nightmares is losing a tooth, since after having lost baby teeth, adult teeth have to last us for a lifetime, something that is increasingly difficult and that actually costs a lot. That a tooth lasts a lifetime is one of the missions of a dentist, but it is quite difficult given the amount of work that our teeth have to endure on a daily basis. Fortunately, there are always treatments that will allow a tooth to stay as long as possible, such as endodontic treatments. Even with daily brushing and regular dental checkups, an adult tooth can loosen and move. This can happen slowly or suddenly. When a tooth moves it is usually a sign of some dental problems and it is advisable to go to the dentist as soon as possible. If you don't, the worst consequence is losing the tooth and maybe even some other teeth along with it in the worst case. In this article we are going to talk about what can be done when a tooth is loose. What Causes a Moving Tooth? There are many different causes for when a tooth moves and the treatment needed will depend on the cause. If you suffered a fall or injury, the tooth may have dislodged from the root requiring dental surgery to put it back in place. On the other hand, having a loose tooth without a sudden drop or hit can be a sign of a bigger problem like advanced gum disease. This is especially the case with loose teeth that simultaneously have a bad taste in the mouth, painful gums, or persistent bad breath. How long does it take for a loose tooth to heal? In any case, you should not wait for the tooth to stop moving and the main thing is to go to the dentist as soon as possible. If you have a tooth that moves, at Idiáquez Dental Polyclinics they can give you the best treatment and do a check-up on the causes that have caused the tooth to move. Some of the treatments you may need are: -Dental splint: wearing a dental splint for a few weeks will make the ligaments heal and the loose tooth will get stronger. This process can take a few weeks until the teeth is totally cured. -Using a dental night splint: This mouth guard or splint is designed is for people who grind their teeth and therefore wear when sleeping. People who grind their teeth at night put great pressure on their teeth, gums, and the mouth in general. By wearing a night splint, you may notice improvements in a few weeks. -Treat gum disease: If the cause of the loose tooth is due to gum disease, the most important thing is to seek treatment as soon as possible. This is a more serious condition that requires more intense treatment as deep cleaning will be needed to remove infected tissue and bacteria from the gums, mouth, and teeth. Prevent tooth loss and loosening One of the first steps in preventing tooth loss and loosening is to have good daily dental hygiene and try to brush twice a day in addition to flossing. Other than that, regular check-ups and cleanings can also prevent tooth loosening. If you regularly practice sports such as soccer or basketball, a good idea is to wear a protective splint. It should also be borne in mind that people who have bone diseases such as osteoporosis and other diseases such as diabetes are also more susceptible to problems with tooth loss."
2,Top Tips To Succeed In Weaning,health-fitness," Weaning is the process of accustoming an infant to foods other than breastmilk (or formula milk). While this is an exciting journey, it can sometimes leave a new parent confused and anxious. It is indeed an emotional phase for both mother and baby, but with the right approach you can make it a hassle-free one. The question I frequently get asked ; When is the right time to start weaning my baby? Or how do I know if my baby is ready to wean? Here are some clues; –        The baby can stay in sitting position with his head held steady at least for a few seconds –        Enough hand-eye coordination for the baby to look at food, pick it up and put it in his mouth –        The baby has lost the tongue-thrust reflex, allowing him or her to swallow food instead of spitting out. Usually babies attain these skills when they are around 6 months old. So once you have decided that your baby is ready for weaning , how shall you start weaning? We have compiled some top tips to consider when you wean your baby. First foods Start with foods that are easily digestible such as mashed rice mixed with your breastmilk or formula milk. Move on to tastier offerings gradually such as pureed apple, pear, carrot, sweet potato and broccoli. Avoiding salt and sugar on baby’s early foods will help them to develop a better relationship with their food and they could influence eating habits of the child when growing up. When serving finger foods avoid giving hard and small pieces of fruits and vegetables, also avoid whole grapes and nuts to reduce the risk of choking. Babies should not be given honey before the age of one year, as it may contain the food poisoning bacteria botulism which can make them extremely ill. Take things slow Introduce solid food slowly into your baby’s diet, start with one serving per day. Get your timing right by choosing a time when both of you are relaxed. Meal during mid-day is ideal since the baby could be too hungry in the morning and too tired at night. One new taste at a time Offer one new taste every couple of days. Don’t settle into a routine, introduce new foods and start mixing different foods together developing baby’s taste buds. Changes in stool Once you have started to wean, a baby’s stool will be different in both looks and smell. As feeding develops, the baby’s stool will get firmer, darker in colour and more stinky. However, if they’re very firm and solid and if your baby is having difficulty defecating, it could be constipated. Make sure the baby is taking plenty of fluids through water and milk. Should the problem prolong, consult a healthcare professional. High allergenic foods Foods such as milk, eggs and peanut butter can be introduced at six months of age. However, introduce them one at a time with a gap of 3 to 5 days between foods, making it easy to identify if your baby is allergic to any of them. Typical symptoms of food allergy are vomiting, diarrhea, swelling, rashes, hives, runny or blocked nose. If there is a severe allergy in the immediate family, it is better to avoid this food until you have discussed it with a healthcare professional. Weaning techniques Going Cold Turkey with breastfeeding is not recommended since this can cause engorgement, mastitis and also an emotional roller coaster. Below are the couple of most used techniques to wean a baby from breastfeeding, can also apply to formula feeds. Don’t offer, Don’t refuse: This is the most recommended breastfeeding approach during weaning. Don’t offer to nurse but also do not refuse when the child desires to nurse. While this method could take longer than other methods in weaning, it takes the child’s need into consideration Drop one feeding at a time: Choose a feeding that is least important and try to distract your child from that feed by engaging with a favorite activity or snack or begin to shorten the feed on that particular session. Keep other feeding sessions as normal and work on reducing one feeding session for 3 to 7 days depending on the progress. Cuddle Time: Babies often nurse for comfort as much as nutrition. While you start to wean, make sure you are still having one to one cuddle time with a favourite book, song or snuggled in a rocking chair. Proper weaning is when your baby is satisfied, finished and ready to move on. The process should move at a pace that works both for mother and the baby. Feel free to write to us your questions or concerns over weaning and do share with us your weaning stories too. We wish you all the best in your weaning journey!"
3,RETIREMENT IS A DEATH IN DISGUISE,health-fitness," It doesn't matter if you are already retired or not. It is what you think of the concept of retirement that matters. Just ask yourself a question - what may be one of the crucial mechanisms that gives us motivation to live? To have this motivation we need to be helpful. We need to feel useful not only for ourselves but for others. That's why we find inner strength when we have some contribution to other people's lives. It may have a form of work for the company or helping our family or friends. Then a strong feeling of worthiness and usefulness arises. A purpose of life. What retirement does is cut all this out from our life. Most people are most useful at work, and when they stop, the whole organism stops. We begin to feel useless and empty. There is no longer a fuel that pushes us to live with purpose. A purposeful life is about doing something for others. Touching retirement age is a moment when you get focused on yourself too much. Doing funny, relaxing things, meeting old friends, and filling your spare time with new random activities is fantastic in the beginning because you never had time for that in the past. But relaxation is not the only thing important in life and unquestionably not as crucial as being useful for the world. No matter the scale, we can be helpful for a few people or thousands of people, but the concept works the same. Feeling useful and needed gives us inner motivation and this motivation influences our biology, justifying our existence. That's why so many many people die or get sick very quickly after achieving the age of retirement. When reading this, you may be younger, and retirement is far ahead, but even accepting the idea of retirement at this moment is working against your life now. You are getting weaker by believing that retirement is natural, and you deserve it after hard work. It's like telling yourself while being a teenager that your future will be tedious and unsuccessful. This approach alone is already exposing your weaknesses, even if you have not yet had time to feel this bitter life in reality. Did you know that in Okinawa, people live much longer than Americans or Europeans? There are people over 100 years old and still capable of riding their bikes or chopping trees in the woods. The concept of retirement doesn't exist there, so they are fully active till death comes. They are like warriors dying on the battlefield but not passively waiting for the end to come. They don't have time to focus on death, so death doesn't focus on them. On the subconscious level, when you decide not to be useful anymore for most of your day, you are sending a message to your organism that you are no longer needed in a society. If you're no longer needed, then what is the purpose of keeping this body alive? Young people have similar problems with being useless. The concept of a ""teenager"" was developed in about 1950. Before, there was only a child and a mature human being. People achieved maturity much quicker, started working at a younger age, and contributing to society faster. In current times children are forced to educate for longer, so deep inside they feel like unproductive parasites financially supported by parents or other members of the society. It's like being a boxer who don't have fights in this year or next year or even in this decade, but someone tells him to train anyway, just in case. Training is only a means to something greater, something purposeful. Without it, it's pointless. That's why many young people are frustrated now and have problems deciding what they want to do in life. We live in the age of abundance, theoretically. There are many possibilities to choose from, so deciding what you want to do in life should be easy. But you end up only trying and testing, finding passions or new temporary hobbies. If you are lucky in life, there is a moment of revelation. You find someone who needs something from you. Sometimes it's your uncle or friend of your uncle, and you have the skills to help him, and he will pay you for that favor. In that particular moment, you feel helpful in life! You may be 15 or 8 years old. It doesn't matter. What matters is you felt useful, something fundamental has happened in your life. Somebody had a need, and you fulfilled that need and started to feel validated as a human being. It is impossible to find this feeling just by studying at school because a vision to become useful in 10 or 15 years from now doesn't give you a daily dose of motivation. Moreover, it may lead to depression, and depression is very popular among teenagers. All of this is an effect of being useless for too long. After formally retiring, better find more engaging activities than taking care of your grandson twice a week for two hours, because it still leaves you useless for the rest of your time. After a few months you will be a sad version of yourself. Be prepared for life after your boss will send you on “retirement.” and treat it like a job change."
4,Common Examples of Medicare Medicaid Fraud,health-fitness," Medicare, Medicaid Fraud Examples and Steps to Ensure You Don’t Commit It A medical doctor invoiced his patient’s Medicare insurance for both the services he actually delivered and for services that were not delivered. He fabricated his patient’s medical records to indicate office visits and treatments that never took place. A gerontologist obtained the outcomes of medical testing executed by a diagnostic firm for her interpretation of the results. She billed the patient’s Medicare insurance as if she performed both the testing and interpretation of the tests. A family physician worked at a medical center where low-income and needy patients were enlisted to submit to needless exams. While he consulted with few patients, medical records were forged by a physician’s assistant to support the billing of Medicaid for medical procedures never performed. Patients with Alzheimer’s disease were sitting unsupervised inside a small room of a medical psychological care facility watching the movie “Forrest Gump” for the umpteenth time. Granted, it’s a great movie, but each time the patients sat in front of the tube watching it, the facility submitted insurance claims to Medicare for providing “group therapy.” *These are examples of fraud as it relates to Medicare and Medicaid. Medical fraud is the intentional deception or misrepresentation of healthcare transactions by the provider for the sake of receiving unauthorized benefits or financial gain. Healthcare fraud is committed when a dishonest provider intentionally submits, or causes someone else to submit, false or misleading information for use in determining the amount of healthcare benefits payable by an insurer. Many leading, medical groups calculate fraud to amount up to 10% of all healthcare costs. Most healthcare fraud today is being committed against Medicare and Medicaid, both funded with U.S tax payer dollars. Medicare pays out over $800 billion a year for claims. Medicaid also has enormous budget, providing $615 billion a year. Their sheer size makes these goliaths a target for those groups committing fraud. Plus with such volume, the U.S. Government is unable to police fraudulent claims. They rely on whistleblower. However, a ton, if not most goes undetected. These programs process millions of claims per day, but it’s estimated that an extremely small percentage of them are audited. They are vulnerable to fraud due to underfunding and lack of oversight. Put simply, there just aren’t enough people on staff to check things out regularly. Some of the More Common Examples of  Medicare or Medicaid Fraud include the following: Paying “kickbacks” in exchange for referring business “Kickbacks” are customary in healthcare fraud cases. State and federal laws by and large ban payments to individuals who refer patients to a particular hospital or medical provider. Medicaid fraud prosecutions have been brought, for example, against unethical physicians for splitting fees in return for rent, demanding cash payments for Medicaid patients or taking money in exchange for patient referrals. Phantom services Itemized medical bills are long and contain dozens of items the patient may not recognize. It’s tempting to throw an extra procedure onto the bill, while charging Medicare or Medicaid for services not rendered. The longer the bill, the simpler it is to slip in a fraudulent charge. Phantom charges also spread to durable medical equipment covered by Medicare Part B. Medicare is often charged for new DME even when the patient accepts used equipment. Some doctors even charge for equipment that was never supplied to the patient. Fraudulent providers also “upcode” various medical procedures. For example, when a patient sees a doctor, they may be unmindful of the scope of services that were delivered. If payment is made by units of time, the time can be extended. A minor service could also be “upcoded” to a more labor intensive or expensive service through fraudulent means. Another example, a bill sent for a healthcare service could be priced higher than it normally would be, based on the service that was performed. Purposely misdiagnosing a patient Here practitioners purposely misdiagnose patients, generally claiming their illness or injuries are more severe than they actually are, so they can bill for more costly treatments and procedures. Regrettably, the elderly and mentally disabled make easy targets for these schemes as they are less likely to have reservations about a physician’s diagnosis. Unbundling Physicians and hospitals often bundle services as a way to offer patient savings. Fraud occurs when the healthcare provider bills each item separately. Under Medicare and Medicaid guidelines, certain mandatory procedures are meant to be bundled together, but by separating them, physicians earn hundreds of extra dollars per patient. Here’s a prime example. A patient has an appendectomy that costs $2400 total. Instead of billing Medicaid for the entire bundle, the hospital bills for each individual step of the procedure resulting in a medical bill of $4300. Billing for a non-covered service as a covered service An allergy physician was providing a treatment that was considered experimental and therefore not approved by Medicare. With a few taps on a keyboard, the allergy doctor presented claim forms and still got paid for utilizing the experimental treatment. This was accomplished by calling (and coding) something else that was covered by Medicare. Overutilization of services This usually includes billing for services that aren’t necessary. Unprincipled providers might use this scheme on hypochondriac patients. Tests and exams can go on indefinitely or at least as long as a patient still has coverage. Substance abuse facilities are ripe for such overutilization. There are other examples, but you get the point. Charges of Medicare and Medicaid fraud can create serious legal headaches including massive fines, loss of healthcare licenses and even prison time. Even mere allegations of fraud can do considerable damage to the professional reputation of a healthcare practice. Such fraud (or perceived fraud) is not always premeditated. However, it can arise as a result of negligence, sloppiness, mistake or oversight. What steps can you take to ensure that you and your staff do not unintentionally cross the lines of Medicare and / or Medicaid fraud? Understand healthcare laws and regulations As a prime example, the False Claims Act bars medical practitioners from submitting insurance claims for substandard and overpriced goods and services, identifying individuals who do not report their knowledge of such claims as perpetrating fraud. The federal government may fine offenders up to three times the disbursements, plus $11,000+ for each false claim. Ensure accurate billing To avoid inadvertent fraud, healthcare providers must maintain accurate billing practices to steer clear of inaccuracies such as overcharges or claims for undocumented or undelivered services. Maintain updated and proper documentation Medical providers need to maintain accurate records to help assure that future treatments deliver the best possible patient outcomes. Detailed records can also assist providers in defending themselves against malpractice suits. Keep track of your licenses Check regularly to ensure your licenses and your staff licenses are up to date. If your license was expired at the time you performed medical treatment, then you may actually be charged with fraud, regardless of the fact you actually performed the procedure billed. Create and follow a compliance plan Medical providers can avoid fraudulent activity by creating and observing a compliance plan, a practice that the Affordable Care Act mandates to remain Medicare and Medicaid eligible. The Office of the Inspector General publishes the Compliance Program Guidance for Individual and Small Group Physician Practices to assist medical providers in establishing such plans."
5,Canadian Scientist Designed Electrically Heated Reusable Face Masks-Solution to the Pandemic,health-fitness," Sterviral™ has announced the launch of its patent-pending wearable device, ITHAS, an electrically heated reusable face mask, as a response to COVID-19. ITHAS was invented and developed by a Toronto-based scientist and entrepreneur William Tan. It uses a microchip to intelligently control and form a seamless thermal barrier around the nose and mouth area. The hot air can also be breathed in and out. The temperature reaches as high as 55°C – 90°C in the core of the mask, but you never feel uncomfortable on your skin. It is well known that high temperature and humidity can kill or deactivate almost any live bacteria and viruses. Therefore, Sterviral’s mission is to protect people from viruses and their future mutations. Besides the heating, ITHAS has all the benefits of an existing face mask. ITHAS comprises 5+ different layers, ensuring maximum bi-directional protection against particles (as tiny as PM2.5), droplets, and pathogens. Thanks to heat-sealed air circulation, the ITHAS mask is much more breathable (more oxygen) and comfortable to wear (less vapor) for a longer time. The centrally-open design makes the filter change extremely easy and fast. A newly introduced face cover cloth can be washed and replaced every day. A lipstick-sized portable power bank provides electricity. The luxury kit provides two power banks, so you can use one while charging the other for easy switching and uninterrupted protection. Though we believe the vaccine might eventually work in the long run, you should still mask up even after you have received it. The side effects of a GMO-ed vaccine may only become known after several generations. Besides, the virus is mutating faster than vaccine development. ITHAS is a physical solution that guarantees to work without any side effects. Sterviral ITHAS face masks are always made of high-quality 100% silk and heavyweight organic cotton. “It may be the best, if not the only solution! “advises William Tan, “ITHAS face masks are reusable and substitute to disposable masks that may lead to environmental problems. ITHAS is reliable and durable, so after many uses, it is one of the cheapest solutions on the market.” Sterviral is a subsidiary of TAACAM INC., owned by William Tan, who also founded PatentK.com, VRNoble.com, Canadian Inventors Association, HouseSigma.com, Digizig Media, and Pyxish.com.

6,What to do when you loose a tooth?,health-fitness," One of the things that worries us the most and gives us the most anxiety is the loss and loss of a tooth. Many times a tooth can fall out suddenly when you are eating and without having had any previous symptoms. So the most important thing in a situation like this is to call the dentist as soon as possible. At Policlínicas Dental Idiázquez they will be at your disposal with any query related to the loss of a tooth, and also, whenever possible it is advisable to take the piece of a fallen tooth to the dentist and show it to him. The steps to follow when a tooth falls out are the following: • Try to get your missing tooth back. Although this may be difficult, if you have a piece of your tooth be sure not to lose it and save it as shown in the steps below. • Rinse the tooth: for this you must use water, milk or a saline solution to clean the tooth. If you use saline, make sure it is sterile. Do not clean or rub the tooth, just put it in a container with some of these liquids. • Reinsert the tooth into the cavity: Sometimes the simplest solutions work, and you can try to put the tooth back in the original place, so if it remains to be able to stay there, you can keep the root protected. You can also use a medical gauze and bite it with the tooth so that it puts pressure and does not move as much. After a few minutes you can check if the tooth has stayed in place or if it falls out again. • Protect the tooth: if the reinsertion does not work, it is best to try to keep it in the best possible condition, and for this, what works best is to place the tooth in a glass of milk or with a saline solution. Water will not serve to preserve your tooth by itself. • Call and go to the dentist as soon as possible: the faster you get to your dentist, the more likely it is that the tooth will have a better chance of reattachment and success. In case there is no dentist available, you can also try going to the nearest hospital emergency dentist. The loss of teeth in adults can lead to a situation of great stress and anguish. There are many ways a tooth can fall out and for a variety of reasons, from root decay to accidental injury while playing sports. Many athletes have falls or bumps and end up falling or breaking their teeth instantly. A missing tooth is not only bad for your smile; It is also bad for overall oral health. A hole in the gums can lead to a high risk of infection and the teeth closest to that space can also move towards that place, to fill and have more space. One of the most important long-term effects of tooth loss is that it in turn leads to bone loss in the jaw, as teeth stimulate the growth of bone tissue. When one or more teeth are missing, the bone in that area no longer receives the stimulation it needs to grow, resulting in bone loss and may lead to a bone tissue transplant in the future. It is very important, therefore, to make regular consultations and go to the dentist to check the teeth and prevent tooth decay through cavities. Also, it may be the case that you feel that your tooth is moving and swaying from one side to the other, if you feel that, it is best to visit the dentist as soon as possible since it is usually a symptom of cavities or root infection. of the tooth. The most common causes of sudden tooth loss The most common are usually due to gum disease and tooth decay. Gum disease develops when excessive plaque builds up on the gum line and causes the tissue to become red and swollen. If left untreated, it could lead to loss of bone mass. In the case of tooth decay, the food particles that remain on the teeth and stimulate the bacteria in the mouth to produce acid, which damages the enamel and causes cavities. Both conditions can cause the loss and loss of teeth suddenly, in addition to many athletes who play sports such as soccer, basketball, or wrestling, where many accidents are reported with sudden tooth loss due to impact. Your dentist will be able to advise you on the best way to replace a lost tooth and the best solution in each case."

8,Different Hand Tools Within a Dental Practice,health-fitness," Dental tools or instruments are used inside a dental clinic to give proper dental treatment to the patients. These tools are used for examining, manipulating, treating & removing teeth. By understanding what each tool accomplishes, you will be more confident visiting the dentists, every time the dentist goes near your mouth. Here is a brief summary of the tools used during dental practice. These tools are classified into two categories: Cutting tools & Non-Cutting tools. Hand Instruments used in Dental Practice: Cutting Tools: 1-Excavators: a-Ordinary Hatchet: This tool has a unique cutting head of the blade directed in the same plane as that of the long axis of the handle. This instrument is specially used for anterior teeth for preparation of retentive areas & to sharpen internal line angles. b-Hoe Excavator: Hoe excavator has primary cutting edge of the blade in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the handle. This instrument is used for planning tooth preparation walls & making line angles. c- Angle Former Excavator: It’s mon-angled & has the primary cutting edge at an angle other than 90 degrees to the blade. It is usually available in pairs (left & right). It is particularly used for sharpening line angles. Its is also used in placing a bevel on enamel margins. d-Spoon Excavator: Spoon excavator has slightly curved blades while the shanks may be bit-angled in order to facilitate accessibility. Spoon excavators further has two categories one is discoid & one is cleoid. In discoid the cutting edges are circular while in cleoid the cutting edges are claw like. 2-Chisels: a-Straight Chisel: The straight chisel has usually a straight blade, with its bevel on one side. The axis of the handle is perpendicular to the primary edge. b-Curved Chisel: The curved chisel has usually a curved blade with a bin-angled blade of the chisel. c-Enamel Hatchet: Enamel Hatchet is almost similar to Ordinary Hatchet Excavator the only difference lies in the fact that Enamel Hatchet has a larger, heavier & beveled on one side. Its cutting edges in a plane that are parallel to the axis of the handle. It is usually used for cutting the enamel. d-Gingival Margin Trimmer: Gingival Margin is similar in shape & design with Enamel Hatchet only difference is that its blade is curved. It has further two types right & left types. Right pair is for distal gingival margins & left pair for distal margins. It is used for beveling of the gingival margins, beveling of axiopulpal line angle & performing a gingival lock. 3-Other Cutting Instruments: a-Scalers: Even after regular brushing a plague gradually builds up. Plague develops when you eat or drink something. It combines with saliva to produce bacteria that become acidic afterwards & results in breaking of tooth enamel. Plague hardens into a tartar & it adheres to the surface of the teeth. It is visible in yellow color as a stain. Dentist gently removes the tartar with the use of scalers by carefully scraping deposits from the surface of each tooth. There are usually two types of scalers powered & hand-held scalers. Powered scalers use ultrasonic frequencies to remove plague. We spray air & water in your mouth to keep the instrument cool. This is relatively a comfortable method. Whereas hand held scalers are metal shaped. We use these to remove deposits surface of the teeth. b-Carvers: Carvers are the dental instruments with a sharp edge for working purpose usually used for removing excess material & contour surfaces. Non Cutting Tools: a-Amalgam Condenser: It’s a dental instrument used for compacting silver amalgam in a plastic state, used for restoring the natural contour of the teeth. The Amalgam Condensers come in single & double sized designs. We have various sized & shaped working ends, which may be smooth or serrated. b-Mouth Mirrors: We use a mirror to examine all the surfaces of each tooth, down your throat & roof of mouth. Mirrors allow us to see a proper image of our teeth with all the surface covered next to gum & the gums present at the back of your mouth. We shine a bright light which reflects off a mirror in order to see irregularities, gums, swelling & deposits. It allows us to see decay between your teeth even if you’re experiencing the early stages of gum disease. We basically use mirrors to see or examine the areas of the teeth by holding your tongue, lips & cheeks which are not much visible. c-Probe: A probe is an instrument used in dentistry for dental armamentarium. It is dimensionally long thin & blunted at the end. Particular use of probe is to maintain accuracy. We use probe in order to measure pocket depths around a teeth in order to create state of health of the periodontium. Probes are marked to know about accuracy & readability. d-Autoclave How are these tools sterilized and cleaned for re-used? There is a machine that helps with this as well and it’s a called an autoclave. This device is a simple steam pressure “oven” that helps kill all microorganisms, bacteria, and other infected materials inside the chamber. This is the safest and most sanitized way to re-use these dental tools. Conclusion: In this article we have discussed about basic tools used in dental practice. Their types depending on their functionality & properties accordingly. Information about these tools is necessary to educate patients about particular procedures before visiting dentist."
9,7 Benefits of The Keto Diet,health-fitness," When you hear about the ketogenic diet, the first thing you perhaps think of is what could possibly make it as good as people say. The answer is, there are enough benefits to change your life. What exactly is a ketogenic diet? The keto program recommends a diet that is low on carbs, moderate on protein and high in fat. The idea is to fine-tune nutritional intake in order to send the body into the metabolic state known as ketosis. The body enters a state of ketosis when it no longer has stores of glycogen sugar to fuel its energy needs. With sugar out of the way, the body has no choice but to tap its stores of fat to get by. The liver converts fat reserves into ketones to present to the body as an energy source. This is why the keto program is a good way to lose fat. 7 benefits of the keto diet Unlike other diets that offer practitioners a weight loss benefit and little else, the keto diet comes with several benefits. Weight loss Without a doubt, weight loss is the primary goal of the keto diet. It works because it makes the body look to its fat reserves to power its metabolism. It can be interesting to go deeper into the process, however. When the body is deprived of carbs, it enters a state of ketosis. Blood sugar and insulin levels fall when that happens. As the body taps the energy in fat cells, they release considerable quantities of water, making for some great weight loss. The fat cells are then able to enter the bloodstream and make their way to the liver, where they are turned into ketones for energy processing. As long as your diet allows you to stay in a caloric deficit, you get to enjoy the weight loss benefits of the keto diet. It takes the edge off your appetite When your diet isn't heavy on carbs, you'll find that you don't crave as much food as before. Many people who get on the keto diet are able to fast most of the day, and only eat at mealtimes. They are simply not as hungry as before. Improved ability to focus When you choose a regular diet that puts carbs into the body, your brain has to deal with the rise and fall in sugar levels that happens as a result. Inconsistent energy levels can make it hard for the brain to focus. With the keto diet, however, the energy source is constant and consistent. The brain is better able to stay focused. You feel more energetic When you are on a regular diet, your body is always on the verge of running out of energy. You need to constantly eat and refuel. With a keto diet, however, the body taps its fat reserves, a nearly unending energy source. The body, then, is able to maintain constant energy levels throughout the day. The result is, you end up feeling a lot more energetic. It helps you fight diabetes When you suffer from Type II diabetes, your body experiences high levels of insulin. Since the keto diet takes excess sugar from your diet, it helps stabilize HbA1c counts, and reverse Type II diabetes. You get improved levels of good cholesterol HDL cholesterol helps get rid of the body's bad cholesterol reserves. When you're on keto, your body's triglyceride levels fall and your HDL cholesterol levels rise. You get better blood pressure When you're on the keto diet, it drops your blood pressure. Many people on the keto diet find that they are able to stop taking blood pressure medicine altogether. The keto diet can change a person's life. It isn't a difficult diet to get on, either. There are plenty of great recipes for the keto diet. All it takes is the willingness to give it a shot."
10,ADOPTING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE WITH  INTERMITTENT FASTING,health-fitness," The term “Intermittent Fasting” (IF) may have been heard by almost all people around the world. Nevertheless, many of us tend to ignore this awesome method because we think that IF was designed for obese or those who want to lose their weight. If only we know the incredible benefits of IF, we will never miss the chance to adopt this method. What is Intermittent Fasting? IF is an eating pattern that regulates the cycle of eating and fasting. There is no specific food that we need to consume, how much calories intake and all. Basically, we can eat anything during that eating period but once we start fasting, we can consume only a small calories food or nothing at all. Not to worry, we can still drink water or zero calorie water like a black coffee or green tea during the fasting period to avoid hunger. There are so many ways to practice intermittent fasting. For example,16:8 method, alternate day fasting, 5:2 diet and so on. But, the most prominent practice is 16:8 method, where we need to fast for 16 hours and eat for the next 8 hours. For example, if we start fasting at 8 p.m. today, then we can have our very first meal at 12 noon of the following day and the cycle repeats. You may think that 16 hours fasting period is too long but bear in mind that these 16 hours period is also comprised of 6-8 sleeping hours. Hence, we are fasting for around 8-10 hours only. There are too many reasons on why most people love intermittent fasting. Firstly, it comes with several method. As mentioned earlier, IF can be done in various ways. We can choose any type of IF method that perfectly suit us. Most people love 16:8 method because it is simpler and easier to practice daily, as compare to alternate day fasting also known as every-other-day diet. This approach requires a-day-fasting for several days per week while eating what we want on non-fast days, which might be harder to follow. Thus, we can choose any method we prefer. Furthermore, IF is flexible and not restricted to a fixed method. For instance, while practicing 16:8 method, but there is a family party or dinner invitation by friends, we can happily join them without worrying our IF schedule. This is because we can cover it back with 24 hours fasting on the following day to keep us back on track. In comparison to other diet type such as high protein diet, we may need to spend a lot of money to buy those high protein foods which normally quite pricey. With IF, we can just eat anything that we have in the kitchen. It does not matter what kind of meal or dishes i.e., our mother cooks, our own DIY recipe or food given by others. We can just eat them all. After all, what are the benefits and good purposes of intermittent fasting? As a normal human being, we always do something to gain back something better. We will never sacrifice ourselves for something useless right? So first and foremost, of course IF has been acknowledged to successfully contributed to losing one’s weight. Moreover, intermittent fasting also play a role in reducing risk of diseases. Intermittent fasting will keep us away from many diseases for example diabetes mellitus and any heart problem. These are among the top chronic diseases in Malaysia. Back to our eating and fasting cycle, noticed it or not, we are reducing our calories intake. In contrast to our normal daily life, we may consume an excess carbohydrate, fat, protein, salt and so on. Excessive carbohydrate will cause a condition named as ‘insulin resistance’ which may lead to the diabetes mellitus. Insulin is a hormone that regulates the action of carbohydrate in our body in the form of glucose. If we have excess glucose, insulin will convert them into a molecule named glycogen to be stored in the body cells hence reducing our blood glucose level. Thus, reduced the risk of diabetes mellitus. If we consumed a lot of carbohydrates or sugar, these insulin would become resist, likely they become inactive and could not do their work properly, causing high glucose level in blood. Hence, we will be diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Moreover, fasting will reduce the bad cholesterol level in the body and as a result will not cause any harm to the heart. Besides, there are several studies that run experiments on rat or mice to observe their brain performances while getting IF practice. They found that intermittent fasting will keep the brain active and healthy because IF will increase brain hormone, namely Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that is vital to the survival, growth, and maintenance of neurons in the brain. Hence, IF will keep the brain to stay healthy and reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. In the similar setting experiments, the results also showed that the fasting mice or rat survived a bit longer than the other mice. Hence, we could say that IF may extend our lifespan if we practiced IF since our early age. As a concluding remark, always keep in mind that intermittent fasting is just another way to live a healthy life. It works differently on different people. Above all, there is no harm in trying. Initially, we may face some difficulties to adopt a new lifestyle, but just keep it going and train our mind to see the best and beauty of it. If the method suits us well, then embrace it. Contrarywise, do not push ourselves too hard. There are a lot more ways for us to give a try. Just remember that everything is going to be fine. All the best for your journey in finding a healthy lifestyle that suits you!"
11,How To Lose Belly Fat (Backed by Science),health-fitness," Belly fat is more than a nuisance that makes your clothes feel tight. It’s seriously harmful. One type of belly fat — referred to as visceral fat — is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other conditions . Many health organizations use body mass index (BMI) to classify weight and predict the risk of metabolic disease. However, this is misleading, as people with excess belly fat are at an increased risk even if they look thin Though losing fat from this area can be difficult, there are several things you can do to reduce excess abdominal fat. Here are 5 effective tips to lose belly fat, backed by scientific studies. Soluble fiber absorbs water and forms a gel that helps slow down food as it passes through your digestive system. Studies show that this type of fiber promotes weight loss by helping you feel full, so you naturally eat less. It may also decrease the number of calories your body absorbs from food What’s more, soluble fiber may help fight belly fat. An observational study in over 1,100 adults found that for every 10-gram increase in soluble fiber intake, belly fat gain decreased by 3.7% over a 5-year period . Make an effort to consume high fiber foods every day. Excellent sources of soluble fiber include: flax seeds shirataki noodles Brussels sprouts avocados legumes blackberries Trans fats are created by pumping hydrogen into unsaturated fats, such as soybean oil. They’re found in some margarines and spreads and also often added to packaged foods, but many food producers have stopped using them. These fats have been linked to inflammation, heart disease, insulin resistance, and abdominal fat gain in observational and animal studies . A 6-year study found that monkeys who ate a high trans fat diet gained 33% more abdominal fat than those eating a diet high in monounsaturated fat . To help reduce belly fat and protect your health, read ingredient labels carefully and stay away from products that contain trans fats. These are often listed as partially hydrogenated fats Alcohol can have health benefits in small amounts, but it’s seriously harmful if you drink too much. Research suggests that too much alcohol can also make you gain belly fat. Observational studies link heavy alcohol consumption to a significantly increased risk of developing central obesity — that is, excess fat storage around the waist Cutting back on alcohol may help reduce your waist size. You don’t need to give it up altogether, but limiting the amount you drink in a single day can help. One study on alcohol use involved more than 2,000 people. Results showed those who drank alcohol daily but averaged less than one drink per day had less belly fat than those who drank less frequently but consumed more alcohol on the days they drank. Drinking apple cider vinegar has impressive health benefits, including lowering blood sugar levels. It contains acetic acid, which has been shown to reduce abdominal fat storage in several animal studies In a 12-week controlled study in men diagnosed with obesity, those who took 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of apple cider vinegar per day lost half an inch (1.4 cm) from their waists . Taking 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL) of apple cider vinegar per day is safe for most people and may lead to modest fat loss. However, be sure to dilute it with water, as undiluted vinegar can erode the enamel on your teeth. You will find the video link in the resource box"
12,When should we take a child to the dentist?,health-fitness," The dental health of a child is also very important and that every parent should take into account. Although many will wonder when is the ideal time to take children to the dentist. In this article we are going to talk about when children should go to the dentist. In fact, it is not common for many children to go to the dentist until they are 10 or 12 years old for the first time, and actually dental associations recommend that children be taken to the dentist as soon as their first teeth appear. This usually occurs by six months of age. Although it can wait until your first birthday to have your baby's first teeth checked. Yes, babies can also and it is advisable to go to the dentist, since, in this way, the dentist can check that there is nothing abnormal in the appearance of the teeth.

Pediatric dentists also have a specially prepared space for examining children. In addition, the rooms are adequate, and the décor of the examination room should also be attractive to young people, such as brightly coloured décor and attractive murals. Games, magazines or comics are also important for children in waiting rooms. Children's gums can be washed from the first year of age. But it is also important to know that children should not use fluoride toothpaste until they are at least two or three years old, as it can lead to fluorosis.

14,Cancer survivors,health-fitness," Positive Thinking Is Powerful During and After Cancer Treatment Directing confidence during your malignancy venture isn't just about living longer — it's tied in with living better. In the fall of 2018, Teri Cettina started feeling a secretive agony around her ribs. ""I thought I had done an excessive number of stomach muscle practices at the rec center,"" says the 55-year-old wellbeing author from Portland, Oregon. At the point when Cettina visited her primary care physician, her blood and pee tests returned typical. Yet, throughout the following a little while, the torment declined. Persuaded her muscles were messed up, she saw an actual advisor who did a 10-minute test and told Cettina, ""This isn't musculoskeletal; it is anything but a rib thing. It's more profound — you need to see your primary care physician today."" Soon thereafter, Cettina had a CT filter and gotten a determination: pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Cettina's tumor was especially upsetting in light of the fact that it was snared in her veins and parts of the aortic conduit, making careful evacuation basically unimaginable. Such horrid news would send even the most confident self assured person into a spiral. Disease and discouragement are biochemically connected, which muddles patients' capacity to remain positive. ""Something about the improvement of the malignant growth prompts a substance awkwardness in the mind that shows as gloom,"" says Dr. Allyson Ocean, partner educator of medication at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City. Left untreated, melancholy can meddle with patients' capacity to battle the illness. ""Gloom is a deactivating condition, which means you tend not to get things done,"" says Dr. William Dale, the Arthur M. Coppola Family Chair in Supportive Care at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, California. ""In case you're discouraged, you're bound to avoid an arrangement or miss a drug and more averse to eat well, practice and invest energy with individuals who cause you to feel better."" In spite of intense chances and harmful therapies, individuals do endure pancreatic adenocarcinoma. ""There might be a solitary digit endurance rate for this determination, yet that implies at any rate one individual endure,"" Cettina says. ""I simply remain quiet about saying, 'What one individual can do, someone else can do.'"" Learns about whether idealism, for example, Cettina's improves malignant growth results are generally uncertain. It's not satisfactory whether a glass-half-full attitude can assist patients with malignancy live more. What researchers can be sure of is that there are a lot of advantages to positive reasoning — some of which have nothing to do with endurance rates."
15,Is Selenium Critical For Good Health?,health-fitness," Selenium is an amazing element and we have outlined a few of its salient qualities: Selenium, along with iodine are critical minerals for proper thyroid activity. Selenium deficiency is a major reason for thyroid problems in people. It is required for so many enzymes that it's not possible to count them all. Selenium is required for the activity of certain areas of the brain that open a person to higher emotions and higher thought. In this sense, selenium is the mineral that allows higher thought in human beings. For this reason we call it a spiritual mineral. It is one of the major minerals needed for mineral balancing. Not all sources of selenium are equally bioavailable.  This is very important to know! The best sources, in our view, are sardines, blue corn, onions and a few other cooked vegetables. Everyone needs more bioavailable selenium. Increasing selenium in the body is a goal of all mineral balancing programs. The recommended foods contain a large amount and it is often given in supplement form, as well. FOOD SOURCES WE RECOMMEND Most foods, especially refined and processed foods, are very low in selenium.  Also, low in selenium are foods such as most meats. Therefore, we are dividing this section into foods we recommend and those we do not recommend. The Best Sources Of Well-Utilized Selenium Onions are excellent sources of well-utilized selenium!  This is why we recommend eating at least three kinds of onions with every meal. Sardines are another excellent source, especially sardines that have the skin and the bones. Blue corn that has been made into blue corn tortilla chips is another excellent source of available selenium.  Other blue corn products don’t work as well. White and yellow corn also have some selenium, but are not as good as the blue corn variety. Almond butter is an excellent source, particularly if it is made with organically grown almonds. We prefer almond butter to eating whole almonds because it is much easier to digest. Horse Radish is a preferred vegetable and a good source of the selenium compounds needed for mineral balancing and development.  However, it is slightly toxic, so only have a teaspoon once daily. Garlic is also a good source.  Garlic is a little toxic, so we only recommend eating one table spoon twice a week. Ginger root contains selenium compounds. However, it is somewhat toxic, so only have a small amount like a teaspoon about twice a week. Raw dairy products such as raw cow or goat milks, some raw cheeses, yogurts and kefir.  Dairy products often contain some selenium.  We don’t recommend eating much dairy products because they don’t contain many of the nutrients needed for mineral balancing. Dairy products must not be pasteurized or homogenized for their selenium to be most biologically available. Arrowroot powder.  This contains some well-utilized selenium.  Arrowroot is a thickener used in soups and in other dishes, in Oriental cuisine.  It is more costly than corn starch, but also far more nutritious.  A little can be added to any meal during preparation in which a thickener is needed or can be used. FOOD SOURCES WE DO NOT RECOMMEND The selenium compounds found in the following products do not support mineral balancing, so we do not recommend them: Brazil nuts and other nuts contain some selenium. Raw nuts are difficult to digest which makes it hard to utilize and absorb the minerals. Seafood and some fish contain some selenium but are very contaminated with toxic metals such as mercury and others.  As a result, we cannot recommend eating them.  The exception is sardines which are less toxic because they are smaller and carry very small amounts. Liver and Kidney are also good sources.  However, organ meats are usually contaminated with toxic metals, even grass fed and organic meats. Alfalfa and Some Mushrooms are also good sources, but not recommended for regular use.  Mushrooms are somewhat toxic.  Alfalfa flakes or powder used in ‘green superfoods’ are also very yin. Spirulina, chlorella, cilantro and other chelators contain some selenium.  However, all these products are somewhat toxic, and their selenium is not well-utilized by most people.  For these reasons, we never recommend them.  We avoid these products strictly even though some holistic practitioners recommend them for chelation therapy. If one follows a mineral balancing program, chelators are not required.  In fact, they can get in the way because they are yin and are somewhat toxic.  A mineral balancing program eliminates toxic metals efficiently without them. NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS We prefer a food-based selenium supplement such as the one you can purchase at Endo-met Laboratories and other stores online.  Another common product is sodium selenite, which is not absorbed well. SOURCES OF TOXIC SELENIUM Some selenium compounds are quite toxic.  The most common source of toxic selenium is selenium-containing dandruff shampoos. Please read the labels closely. Avoid these and any other selenium-containing hair products. PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLES OF SELENIUM Selenium has many roles that affect the functioning of the thyroid gland. Selenium is required to produce thyroid hormone, called tetraiodothyronine or T4 and is required for the conversion of T4 to the more active form of the hormone, called triiodothyronine or T3. It helps get rid of Hashimoto’s disease also called Hashimoto’s autoimmune thyroiditis. It counteracts the ocular or eye dysfunction of common hyperthyroidism.  This is also called Grave’s disease orbitopathy, and characterized by exothalamus (protrusion of the eyeball), and proptosis (movement outward of the eye). These occur in response to swelling and inflammation of the muscles and structures behind and around the eyeball. DETOXIFICATION Selenium is required for glutathione synthesis.  Glutathione is one of the most important substances in the human body.  It is produced in the liver and elsewhere and is required for detoxification within the liver. Glutathione production depends on the availability of several amino acids, along with available iron and selenium.  A low level of glutathione results in impaired detoxification throughout the body. Selenium also functions as an anti-oxidant substance.  This means it helps scavenge or neutralize singlet oxygen atoms in the body.  These cause oxidant damage, which just means oxidation or mixing with oxygen. A well-known example of how oxidation damages metal is rusting.  A similar activity can occur in human bodies. Selenium enhances the immune response.  This has to do with all of the roles above. Selenium, along with silicon, helps impart a relaxed and happy quality to the personality and can improve mental health. Selenium is absolutely essential for development.  This is the expansion of the human energy field and fulfillment of the full genetic potential of a human being. DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS Selenium deficiency is extremely common today. The reasons are: Most diets are deficient in selenium. Selenium is required for detoxification, and in today's world even more is required. Physical symptoms often include impaired hair and nail growth, fatigue that can be severe, and nervous sensitivity and irritability.  One may also have a tendency for infections and impaired immune response as well as weak adrenal activity.  Other symptoms may include hypoglycemia, allergies, asthma, low or high blood pressure, and arterial disease. Mental or emotional symptoms include irritability, anxiety, feeling hopeless, depressed, and negative. They all have low thyroid function, even if the serum thyroid hormone levels seem normal. SELENIUM TOXICITY Selenium can be toxic if consumed in an incorrect form or if too much is ingested. The most common cause of selenium toxicity in human beings is the use of dandruff shampoos.  These products contain a toxic form of selenium that is absorbed into the scalp. Avoid all selenium-containing shampoos and dandruff products. Read the labels. Toxic forms of selenium cause the human hair level of copper to decrease into the poor eliminator or very poor eliminator ranges.  The reason is that the toxic selenium damages the liver, which is then unable to detoxify copper. A good substitute is Head N Shoulders shampoo, which contains zinc, rather than selenium. HAIR ANALYSIS AND SELENIUM LEVELS Selenium levels can be read in the hair tissue with a fair amount of accuracy.  Blood tests to detect selenium are much less useful. At this time (2021) we use an ideal hair tissue selenium level of 0.12 mg% or 1.2 parts per million.  An acceptable range is 0.05 to 0.12 mg%.  A level greater than this is toxic."
16,Some Common Healthy Activities to Slow Aging,health-fitness," ""We don't quit playing because we grow old; we grow old because we quit playing."" “Aging is inevitable, but no reason to associate it with pain, disability or mental decline.” Researchers in the field of gerontology support the positive effect of the following life activities on our health and aging. Since a high stress environment is dangerous to health and longevity, the practice of mental approaches to reduce stress are the cost effective and safe ways to control stress, and have been proven effective for centuries. An active life---having a reason for living---can prolong life. We know that people who are young have eager, inquisitive minds. They are curious, always seeking and evaluating answers. They are willing to try something new -- a new approach to a job, a new kind of music, a new response to a recurring situation. ""You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream."" Good marriage and social life can prolong life. For example, married couples live longer than single people with an otherwise similar social life. These effects may be due in part to reduced stress as compared to lonely people. Mental exercises such as reading and crossword puzzles, and physical aerobic exercises for about 15 minutes, three times a week can go a long way towards preserving the body and mind. However, exertion can actually shorten lifespan. So the message is to do but don't overdo. Note: Between 1930-1960 the medical profession regarded vigorous exercise as a form of stress that would wear out the body. We know now that in contrast to machines which wear out with use, human organs and tissues develop an adaptive increase in function with use that runs counter to the changes which occur in aging. Seven guidelines, some of which are familiar to us, have been suggested by various health experts to prolong life. These include no smoking, moderate weight, moderate drinking, physical activity, eating breakfast, regular meals, and sleeping seven or eight hours--but not less than six or more than nine. An active sex life, in general, is suggested to prolong youthful health. In healthy old men, the sex hormone testosterone has been observed at levels similar to those of younger men and sexual activity is related to hormonal level. Which comes first---the hormone level or active sex life---researchers have yet to determine. Observations on people over sixty have indicated that men and women do not lose their physical capacity for sexual performance (in terms of erection and orgasm). Sex experts believe that sexual activity helps to preserve sexual functioning and youthful feelings. A survey of people over 100 (Parade, October 16, 1988) showed that besides genetic propensity and physical activity, centenarians share characteristics such as: Discipline--set standards and achieve them. Altruism--not self-centered but people-oriented. Optimism--continue to make plans for the future. Spiritual faith--even extra body experience that nothing can really harm and living without fear. Love of life--enjoy simple pleasures with unashamed enthusiasm. In the overall conclusion, safe habits to prolong life include proper nutrition, a diet rich in fiber from fruits and vegetables, and low in animal fat, sugar and refined foods. Certain aging theories suggest a possible role of vitamin E and C and foods rich in nucleic acids as another nutritional aspect of long and healthy living. However, some of the ideas of the eastern world such as yogic breathing for vigor and vitality, postures to keep youthful body flexibility, and the effect of mind on our health and performance, are very important for healthy and youthful living. These ideas of the eastern world that are based on centuries of experience are certainly safe and effective as compared to the modern aging theories which are still in the exploration stage. “I don't believe in AGE.

17,Healthy for Life with Exercise,health-fitness," If people would realize how many health benefits exercise can offer, there would be no hesitation in getting started with some form of exercise. Especially older folks are harder to get motivated, because they think the exercise will cause an injury. At the contrary, exercise will keep there overall fitness level and muscle strength in optimal form. It's a matter of choosing the right form of exercise. Swimming, walking and gardening are very suitable for older people. Swimming has the advantage that their body weight will be partly supported by the water, which makes it possible to exercise without risking any bodily harm. Walking is the best exercise you can have, because it's natural. Good long brisk walks give a lot of benefits- the whole body begins to respond. You breath properly, your circulation and heart benefits, and it's good for the mind and positive thinking. It's only in recent years that fitness gurus have recognized the supremacy of brisk walking. In contrary to jogging, brisk walking provides a lot of benefits without any problems. Walking is almost as important as the right food. You need to eat properly and exercise properly, the two together gives you the best results. The internal organs of the body need tone and for this most of them depend almost entirely on physical activity. Exercise produces big results whether we’re 40, 60 or 80. According to the Human Physiology Laboratory at Tufts University Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, we respond well to exercise at any age. Muscles grow, bones strengthen, and metabolism increases. Our body fat decreases while blood sugar and balance improve. I proved this to myself when I taught strength training at a retirement residence. With modest effort, exercisers in their 80s grew stronger and more vital. We were all delighted. Reduced muscle strength is associated with age-related disability. The most common cause of muscle weakness is inactivity. After three months of high-intensity muscle training, healthy men over 60 experienced gains similar to those reported for younger men training with similar intensity and duration. People who were stronger remained more independent and less burdened by advancing years. Any type of exercise helps, but combining aerobics, strength, and flexibility works best. For most people, aerobic exercise is an easy place to begin. As we breathe deeply, the diafragm – which separates the chest from the abdomen – rises and falls repeatedly, massaging all the internal organs, particularly the stomach, small intestine, bowel, lungs and liver. The stretching and relaxing of the intestines is vital in preventing that widespread form of 'self poisoning' : constipation. Exercise does keep you regular! In the mid-eighties, a vital clue to the right exercise for lifelong health was uncovered by brilliant research in biochemistry. Biochemists established that all cell replication in the immune system and therefore all immune strength is dependent on availability of the amino acid glutamine. Your immune system uses a ton of it. But immune cells cannot make glutamine. Only muscle cells can do the job. So your muscles have to supply large amounts of glutamine to your immune system every day in order to maintain it. That's it! The mitochondria of muscle are the furnaces in which most of your body fat and sugar are burned for fuel. Muscle is what stresses your skeleton to maintain your bones. We also know that muscle is the vital link which also maintain your immunity and hence your resistance to all diseases. Muscle is the health engine. Which so much overwhelming evidence that muscular exercise is essential to health, what are we doing about it? A big fat zero. Muscle is the health engine. It's a proven fact that the right exercise not only maintains your heart, your lungs, your muscles, your bones, a healthy level of body fat and even your intestinal function, but also some more subtle functions, like insulin and your body's dealing with sugar. It has been known for more than fifty years that lack of exercise leads to glucose intolerance. However, not long ago research has shown that getting of the couch and start moving, not only maintain insulin function to deal with the sugar, but it also can reverse decades of damage. Insulin dependent diabetics, for example, using the right exercise program, can increase insulin efficiency so much that some patients, who have used insulin daily for years, no longer need it. In healthy people, the right exercise completely protects glucose tolerance against the degenerative changes in insulin metabolism that lead to adult-onset diabetes. Healthy old men who maintain a lifelong exercise program, have the same healthy insulin efficiency as young men. A high sugar diet, which progressively destroys insulin metabolism, makes it virtually mandatory to exercise if you want to avoid glucose intolerance as you grow older. Most physicians believe that hardening of the arteries, a degenerative process, is inevitable. Dr. Lakatta at the National Institute on Aging Research Center in Baltimore, is showing in ongoing experiments, that regular exercise maintains arterial elasticity and even reverses arterial hardening that has already occurred. I could fill many pages citing numerous bodily functions which are maintained by regular exercise. But I will keep it short. Research recently undertaken has revealed the major way in which exercise protect you against all diseases. It started with the evidence that exercise increases the overall number of white blood cells. Followed by more precise findings that moderate exercise increases bodily production of lymphocytes, interleukin 2, neutrophils and other disease fighting components of the immune system. There is no doubt that the right exercise strengthens your immunity. And it also strengthens your resistance to all forms of damage, decay, bacteria, viruses, toxins and even radiation. Closing with the wise words of Louis Pasteur, the father of modern medicine: ""Host resistance is the key.""

18,anxiety disorder treatment,health-fitness," When faced with potentially harmful or worrying triggers, feelings of anxiety are not only normal but necessary for survival. Ever since the earliest days of humanity, the approach of predators and incoming danger has set off alarms in the body and allowed an individual to take evasive action. These alarms become noticeable in the form of a raised heartbeat, sweating, and increased sensitivity to surroundings. A rush of adrenaline in response to danger causes these reactions. This adrenaline boost is known as the ‘fight-or-flight’ response. It prepares humans to physically confront or flee any threats to safety. For most modern individuals, running from larger animals and imminent danger is a less pressing concern. Anxieties now revolve around work, money, family life, health, and other crucial issues that demand a person’s attention without necessarily requiring the ‘fight-or-flight’ reaction. That nervous feeling before an important life event or during a difficult situation is a natural echo of the original ‘fight-or-flight’ reaction. It can still be essential to survival – anxiety about being hit by a car when crossing the street, for example, means that a person will instinctively look both ways to avoid danger. Anxiety disorder The duration or severity of an anxious feeling can sometimes be out of proportion to the original trigger, or stressor. Physical symptoms, such as increased blood pressure and nausea, may also become evident. These responses move beyond anxiety into an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders occur when a reaction is out of proportion to what might normally be expected in a situation. The APA describes a person with anxiety disorder as “having recurring intrusive thoughts or concerns."
19,Applications of Low-Level laser therapy in dental practice,health-fitness," Low level lasers, cold or soft lasers: These lasers do not produce thermal effects on tissues and induce photoreactions in cells through light stimulation which is called photobiostimulation. Power of these lasers is usually under 250mW. The main point differentiating low level lasers and high power ones is the activation of photochemical reactions without heat formation. The most important factor to achieve this light characteristic in lasers is not their power, but their power density for each surface unit (i.e cm2). Density lower than 670mW/cm2, can induce the stimulatory effects of low level lasers without thermal effects. Low level lasers (therapeutic) used today as treatment adjunctive devices in medicine and dentistry. Numerous studies have been performed on the applications of low level lasers in patient pain reduction. Mechanisms of pain reduction with therapeutic lasers and their application are expressed, and the studies realized in this field are presented. Some of the major benefits associated with Laser Dentistry are: Laser assisted procedures performed on soft tissue may not require suturing through a process called tissue welding. This is a process that uses laser energy to anastomose tissues. Minimizes bleeding by helping tissue coagulation. Minimizes or even eliminates the need for anesthesia in certain clinical procedures. Bacterial decontamination of deep periodontal pockets, root canal systems. Removal of the smear layer after tooth preparations. PDL regeneration? (LANAP protocol) Stimulate healing of injured tissues. Attenuate pain. Enhance remodeling and repair of bone. Applications of LLLT in dentistry LLLT has been used effectively in dentistry for more than four decades, though the magnitude of the positive clinical effects has just started to be documented in double blind placebo controlled studies in the last ten years. Clinically, low-level laser therapy can be used as an adjunct to surgical laser procedures as well as a treatment adjunct to other dental treatments for numerous conditions and applications, some of which are noted below. Some of the most frequently used clinical applications in dentistry include: Post Surgical Laser irradiation will significantly decrease pain, swelling, bruising and inflammation after an extraction thus requiring a decreased (or eliminated) need for post-operative analgesics. The speed of healing of the extraction site will also be increased and there will be a reduced likelihood of a dry socket (although in cases where a dry socket does occur, LLLT will dramatically decrease the pain and stimulate the covering of the exposed bone through the stimulation of fibroblasts). Restorations LLLT is being used by many dentists and pedodontists for analgesia of primary tooth restorations. Application at the apex decreases the conduction of nerve impulses from the pulp and stimulates the release of endorphins, both which contribute to a decreased pain sensation (analgesia).6 Though this technique works best on primary teeth (Figure 2), laser irradiation will allow for comfortable air abrasion treatments and crown & bridge cementations. Without the effect of anesthetic, it is easier to accomplish a proper bite adjustment. Nausea and Gagging Many patients have a sensitive gag reflex making dental work very stressful for both the patient and dentist. Application of the laser to the P6 acupuncture point of the wrist will decrease the gagging and nausea sensations many patients feel during dental treatments, impressions and x-rays.7 The P6 acupuncture point is one of a triad of points that calms your parasympathetic nervous system (Figure 3). Application of these points is also effective for patients who are anxious and nervous. Dental Infections In any case of a dental infection, the laser can be applied to the submandibular lymph nodes to increase the lymphatic flow of the infected area, reduce the inflammatory cells and bring neutrophils to the site of infection for faster healing (Figure 4).8 Laser therapy will not preclude the use of antibiotics in most cases but will help to potentiate the uptake of the antibiotic into the blood stream. Implants Laser irradiation during the preparation and placement of implants will decrease the pain and inflammation of the surgical procedure and improve the integration of the implant into the bone. Many studies investigating the effect of LLLT during implant placement have demonstrated an improved bone formation around the implant with a substantial decrease in post-operative pain.9 Orthodontics In addition to reducing the pain felt during orthodontic treatments, laser irradiation has also been shown to increase the velocity of tooth movement. A recent study demonstrated that over 60 days, the canines on the laser treated side moved 34% more than the control.10 It has been postulated that the increased speed of tooth movement is a result of the stimulation of the osteoblast/osteoclast turnover. Facial Pain/Neuralgia Laser therapy can be used very effectively for facial pain treatment, either acute or chronic. A major complaint a lot of patients have after long dental appointments is facial pain and muscle tension.11 Application of the laser to the masseter muscle after the appointment will reduce or eliminate the muscle trismus and joint pain. In chronic TMJ cases, laser therapy can be used in conjunction with other therapeutic tools to reduce the pain and muscle tension, while stimulating healing within the joint. Dentin Hypersensitivity/Endodontics LLLT can assist with pain and inflammation after endodontic procedures and surgery, treat pulp hyperemia, help diagnose irreversible pulpitis and reduce the need to post-operative analgesics.Further, laser irradiation is very effective in treating dentine hypersensitivity. A recent study demonstrated that combining laser therapy with a chemical agent produced an average success rate of more than 85%.12 Soft Tissue Lesions Soft tissue lesions, such as herpes lesions, denture sores, angular chelitis and lichen planus, respond very well to LLLT. Research has indicated that LLLT can prevent cold sores from erupting if treated in the prodromal stage (when the tingling starts) and speed the healing in cases where the sore has erupted. Clinically, light therapy can be used with ease in a dental office. Because laser therapy is non-invasive and has no significant side effects, the treatments can frequently be done by the auxiliary staff and easily integrated into the practice. Light therapy uses the body’s own natural resources to provide pain relief, muscle relaxation, wound healing and nerve. Low Level Laser Therapy offers a dentist the opportunity to better manage treatments that are often deemed painful by patients while enhancing their practice with improved clinical treatments and patient satisfaction. Is Low Level Laser Therapy Safe? One of the most interesting and useful aspects of LLLT is the safety. Lasers only elicit responses from cells that can utilize the energy produced, thus will have no negative effect on healthy cells.13 In the hundreds of studies done on laser therapy, no clinical side effects have been reported. This puts lasers in the public domain and with very basic training, can be used by the whole dental staff. Conclusion A huge benefit of Low Level Laser Therapy is that patients see their dental practitioner doing something extra to reduce the pain or discomfort that may have been caused during the appointment. The very nature of what dentists do causes pain and inflammation. LLLT requires a paradigm shift; instead of using drugs to treat the pain after it has started, a dentist now has the opportunity to treat the pain immediately in the dental office. In an aging population that is becoming wary of the over-prescription of pharmaceuticals which often carry negative and harmful side effects, laser therapy is an effective alternate or adjunctive tool to achieve improved clinical effects. It is a benefit to the patient and dentist to investigate Low Level Laser Therapy, an untapped resource in the dental industry."
20,Uses Of Dermal Fillers ,health-fitness," Uses Of Dermal Fillers Soft tissue fillers are most commonly used on the face where they can fill in wrinkles and fine lines as well as add volume and plumpness. Fillers can also treat wrinkles in other body areas and to conceal scars. Top brands include. Aquashine, Belotero, Radiesse, Restylane,  Juvederm, Dermalax, Revolax and Ellanse Facial area Dermal fillers are most commonly used on the face to fill in and smooth out age-related wrinkles. These areas include And similar to Botox. Nasolabial folds, which are fine lines running from the nose to the borders of the lips. Marionette lines, which are vertical lines running from the lip borders to the chin. The area between the eyebrows (sometimes used in combination with neurotoxins). The tear trough or the area below the lower eyelid. The chin. Uses for Dermal Fillers You Didn't Know About Depending on the filler, the treatment can last a year or longer. And will not impact a patient’s ability to wear earrings afterward. The procedure can be redone once the filler diminishes over time. And can be put together with other treatments performed on the same day – at your provider’s discretion, of course. As we age, we see signs of skin damage and volume loss everywhere. And our earlobes are no exceptions. Heavy accessories only add to the effects of gravity and volume loss. An increasing number of patients are addressing this concern with injectable fillers. Rejuvenating their lobules in a safe, long-lasting, and relatively painless way. Small earlobes can also be enhanced with dermal fillers. Giving them a rounder look by enlarging the outer portion of the lobule. Knee rejuvenation is trending. Dermatologists and plastic surgeons all over the country are proving that signs of aging above the knees can be masked with Sculptra. The poly-lactic acid filler tightens and improves skin quality in this area. By helping the body recreate collagen that’s been lost over time. Tight, lifted, and wrinkle-free knees could be just the improvement you’re looking for. When you slip on your favorite summer dress – you know, the one that somehow just doesn’t seem to look as good on you as it did 10 years ago. Despite all the squats and lunges you do. Hollowing temples are a common sign of aging, yet often this ever-important area is overlooked during cosmetic consultations. As we age, the bones around the temple area often become more apparent and can, in some ways, make us look sickly and generally unhealthy. There are two main types of fillers doctors use to enhance this particular area: poly-lactic acid fillers (like Sculptra), and hyaluronic acid fillers (like Juvederm). Poly-lactic acid fillers work by inciting collagen growth (a process called fibroplasia) through multiple treatments over several months, gradually producing results that can last as long as 2 years before finally diminishing. The filler is injected between the metatarsal and phalangeal bones of the big toes to add padding that has been lost, therefore reducing pressure and pain. Also, other areas of the foot subject to intense pressure can be injected with filler for the same effect. Risks beyond swelling, bruising, and damage to nearby structures include using an inappropriate filler or “over-filling” the area, which can worsen the discomfort by making it more difficult to walk/stand Again, as with any procedure, make sure to fully investigate the provider you intend to hire for this treatment. Also, remember that many providers have their preferences for certain fillers, whether they be “thin” with low viscosity or “thick” with a higher viscosity. 4. Lines around the neck Many dermatologists and plastic surgeons have been trained in this art of neck filling. However, great caution when discussing the treatment and assessing the provider’s experience level. There is no shortage of complications that can arise, so be sure to fully vet your provider before undergoing this procedure. One of the most common fillers used is Belotero, a “thin” hyaluronic acid filler with a low risk of the dreaded “tyndell effect” (a blueish hue given to skin when the dermal filler is injected too close to the surface). Again the costs range depending on the number of syringes but are usually between $500 and $2,000. The results last anywhere from 9 to 12 months. Also, note that neck filler is not a good option for patients with considerable skin laxity requiring more aggressive tightening. Uses of dermal fillers include butt injections. As discussed previously for temple filling with Sculptra, this versatile poly-L-lactic acid filler helps replace collagen and adds great volume. By discussing your needs with your provider and properly mapping out the areas in which they will give you fullness and lift, the Sculptra filling technique can be utilized to great effect. The biggest challenge is not just preparing financially for the procedure. But finding the provider who is the best trained and most well-versed in the technique. All the more reason to send out your request through Olive Beauty Shop to find a provider who performs the procedure. Radiesse is one of the most common hands rejuvenation dermal fillers. It’s a calcium gel filler that corrects the volume loss and hides the visible veins, tendons, etc. that make hands appear aged. Having a provider injecting the area is paramount, as there are a myriad of adverse effects that could occur if improperly done. Uses of Dermal Fillers include chin augmentation. Before the advent of dermal fillers to the chin area, chin augmentation with implants were the best, and pretty much only, option for patients. However, implants are a one-size-fits-all option that usually isn’t customizable or adjusted based on the patient’s facial profile, ethnicity, or needs. With the approach afforded to providers through fillers, not only can the projection now be addressed from patient to patient, but the shape of the chin can also be changed to give a round face a more heart-shaped look – or anything in between. Ellanse, Juvederm, Restylane, and Belotero are currently the most common fillers for non-surgical chin augmentation procedures. Prices vary between $2,000 to $6,000, depending on the number of syringes. The procedure itself takes anywhere from 5-30 minutes and is only mildly painful. Most patients require several treatments and adequate upkeep. But the results can be life-changing for those who suffer tremendously from acne scars. Results are noticeable after the first session with a trained provider, but since Bellafill works with your skin’s natural processes. Patients can continue seeing improvement over a year after the treatment. This specific acne scar treatment is meant for patients with moderate to severe scarring. Who are not allergic to Bellafill and are at least 21 years old. Common side effects are similar to most fillers: swelling, bruising, and tenderness that resolves usually after a week. Other more severe side effects can also occur and should be discussed with your provider as you further explore this option. Alongside Bellafill for acne scar treatments. Many providers prefer the use of hyaluronic acid fillers (like Belotero and Restylane) in light of their comfort with this type of treatment. They too provide immediate results and continue to modify over months. By breaking up some of the scarred down bands that pucker the skin. The hyaluronic acid fillers will continue to lift the scars for about a year. Generally used in combination with other modalities such as fractional non-ablative lasers and chemical peels."

1,Fatty Liver: The Silent Killer,health-fitness," Fatty Liver: The Silent Killer The top cause of death in Malaysia is due to heart disease.  However, liver diseases seem to chase the number of death and has already reached the epidemic level in our country. As stated by Dr. Rosmawati in Code Blue Health Is Human Right, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is now the commonest liver cancer. Causes of death due to liver cancer in Malaysia have increased by 31.5% from 1990 to 2020. Most killer diseases in Malaysia such as ischemic heart and fatty liver diseases are both related to obesity. According to an interview by Daily Express with a hepatologist, Associate Prof Dr. Chan Wah Kheong said that there are more and more patients coming to the hospital with the common symptoms of liver disease. Therefore, we must anticipate ourselves from developing and having a fatty liver, the silent killer of Malaysians. The liver is one of the vital organs for humans. The liver processes all the food that we eat into substances that can be used by our body. Fatty liver is more common in adults because children and teenagers are rapidly growing and live a more active lifestyle. Hence, their bodies maximally utilize the energy supplied by the foods they eat rather than turning them into fats, which is a form of body fuel storage. In comparison, the adults’ energy utilization is much lower and continues to diminish since their lifestyle gradually becomes more sedentary or less busy than in their early lives. Thus, an adult need to consume less food than other age groups, which is proportional to their energy usage, howbeit, most adults did not reduce their food intake and this leads to fat accumulation in the liver, hence forming a fatty liver. There are many symptoms that may indicate fatty liver such as pain at the right upper quadrant, jaundice and fatigue. However, fatty liver is commonly asymptomatic in the early stage, and becomes symptomatic only when the liver has already reached a dire state. This is why most people did not realize the fact that they have a fatty liver and only seek help by the time it is already too late. Not to mention, a fatty liver does not only diminish its own function but it will also affect other important organs. For example, the diseased liver tends to distribute cholesterols to other cells via blood. Thus, if one with the said liver disease consumes excess cholesterol, he is at a higher risk of developing atherosclerosis, which is a condition where cholesterols build up in the arterial walls and it may then lead to ischemic heart disease. Hence, to obtain a healthy liver, we need to have a healthy and balanced diet, in addition to exercising regularly. This is because, a fatty liver can happen to just anyone but, it is proven that people with obesity have a much higher risk of having it. So, we need to have a normal body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage to lower our risk of getting a fatty liver. Adversely, the Malaysians lifestyle are becoming more and more unhealthy by days. Indeed, Malaysian street foods are too tempting to resist, and this makes it very difficult for Malaysians to cut down their food intake. Not to mention, some people love to spend their weekend doing food hunting to satisfy their craving for viral foods. To make things worse, there are various types of unhealthy trending foods such as chocolate jars, ramen, and cheesy chips that are widely sold and easily accessible in the market. Furthermore, the number of shops selling sweet drinks and beverages are also springing up like mushrooms. These junk foods are indeed undeniably delicious and delectable as it is obvious how regularly they are being consumed. However, too much consumption of them will burden the liver as it is forced to work harder to process the foods. Hence, if one continues this bad habit, it will definitely affect his health in a negative way. Besides our unhealthy lifestyle, the Covid-19 pandemic makes it worse. Due to the pandemic, our government had imposed a complete lockdown in the country to curb the virus from widely spreading. Recreational parks, shopping complexes, workplaces and even schools are forced to close to stop mass gathering. Hence, with nowhere to go, people are more likely to spend their time relaxing at home in addition to restricting and thus, reducing their daily movements and activities. To boot, having not much things to do, people tend to develop the boredom eating habit. If this condition carries on, the percentage of Malaysian citizens with obesity will get higher and this will increase the risk of them to get a fatty liver. Regardless of anything, there should not be an excuse for us not to take care of our health. There are many ways for us to achieve and maintain our physical fitness from home. A simple example would be the fact that we can watch and follow the copious number of exercise videos uploaded on various YouTube channels. It is regrettable to see that most people know that being healthy is necessary yet very few are practicing a healthy lifestyle. Over and above, it is important for us to practice a healthy lifestyle and consuming a balanced diet to ensure our organs, especially the liver are in their best shape for them to play their roles and function best in our body. Lastly, good health is not something that can be bought by anyone, and it is undeniably the greatest blessing a human can have."

This report stated that Muslims can use alcohol-based fragrances, due to the proportion of alcohol in fragrances being low. While the Fatwah stated that cautious Muslims could use oil-based fragrances that are alcohol-free, it also stated that the use of alcohol-based fragrances would not affect the purity of Muslims' prayers. This Fatwah thus encouraged many Saudi consumers to expand their purchase of fragrances to include alcohol-based fragrances from prestigious based global brands. in the Middle East on the issue of perfumery.

11,Cleansing the body with natural juices,health-fitness," Try fasting with fresh juices this spring After a long winter, fasting with freshly squeezed juices is a great way to cleanse the body of toxins. Find out which ingredients are best and how to consume fresh juices. Due to the modern way of life you are exposed to numerous toxins, from the environment, food, water, technology… These toxins accumulate in your organs and tissues and can lead to lethargy, diabetes, obesity, indigestion, chronic fatigue, and a number of serious illnesses. That is why it is extremely important to introduce an occasional detox of the body in the form of fasting. Fasting is not something new. Namely, for thousands of years, people have given up food for good health, vitality, but also spiritual purification. And while some perform a dry fast (without food and liquid), others prefer one with juices and liquid. After a long winter, heavy food intake, and lack of exercise, thanks to the abundance of fruits and vegetables in gardens and markets, spring is the ideal time to cleanse the body with juices! During this fast, you do not consume solid foods and drink only freshly prepared fruit and vegetable juices. Juices as food for cleansing the body By consuming fresh juices, you will simultaneously nourish the body and encourage the flushing of organs from toxins and waste products. By squeezing fruits and vegetables in a juicer, you will extract and preserve all their important phytonutrients that will be perfectly absorbed in your body. Natural and fresh juices will increase the alkalinity of your body and provide you with extra freshness and plenty of energy - even without the intake of solid foods. This form of fasting also contributes to your mental health, especially if you are preparing carrot juice. In addition to being a real tonic for the brain, carrots are also rich in the mineral calcium and vitamin A. Also, don't forget to drink as much warm water as possible with the juices, and you can also make herbal teas. In addition to perfectly hydrating you, water will also help eliminate the false feeling of hunger. Water with lemon By consuming warm water with freshly squeezed lemon, in the morning on an empty stomach, you will excellently stimulate the body's detox. Lemon perfectly stimulates the liver, the largest organ responsible for detox, and provides your body with a lot of vitamin C. You can start the day with a lemon drink, and later, every few hours, consume fruit-vegetable juices of your choice. Fresh fruits + vegetables + herbs Juices that are best for cleansing the body include fresh root and dark green leafy vegetables, fruits, and herbs. From vegetables, you can use, for example, carrots, beets, celery, cucumbers, kale, spinach…, and from fruits, excellent choice are apples, oranges, lemons, limes, berries, pineapple… When it comes to spices, in the first place are ginger and turmeric, which are best used in fresh form, although dried have a good detox effect. Then there are parsley, coriander, mint, and superhealthy powdered algae, like spirulina and chlorella, which you can always add to juices. Cleansing the body is a perfect trio - carrots, ginger, and beets One of the most popular drinks for cleansing the body is carrot and ginger juice, with the addition of apples and celery. You can prepare it only from carrots and freshly grated ginger, but the apple will further enrich and elevate its taste, and celery will enhance its detox effect. Beetroot is another popular ingredient that is great for detoxifying the body and plenty of energy, so feel free to add it to your juices. Green juices - plenty of chlorophyll and health Green juices, which are rich in chlorophyll (and other important antioxidants), along with beets and carrots, should be an essential part of your fast and the best way to cleanse the body. You can prepare them from fresh cucumber, green apple (from organic farming), or pear, with the addition of some green leafy vegetables, such as kale, spinach, or cabbage. If desired, and for an even more intense detox effect, you can add a little parsley, fresh ginger, dill, or celery to the juice. Orange juice - super healthy beta-carotene The base of orange juice can consist, for example, of carrots and oranges, which you are free to enrich with fresh ginger or turmeric. The orange color of the juice indicates the richness of super healthy beta-carotene, which preserves your eyesight and health in general. Juicer and preparation of ingredients These juices are usually prepared in a juicer, but in the absence of a juicer, you can also use a blender (in this case, you will need to chop the harder ingredients yourself and then strain the juice). Before preparing, wash fruits and vegetables well under a stream of cold water and do not peel them (it contains an abundance of vitamins and minerals), so it is important to use all home-grown and organically grown ones. Duration of fasting with juices You can introduce cleansing of the body by fasting with juices once a week or practice it for several days. It is important that you gradually get used to the body. Day 1: This length of fasting with juices is best for beginners to see how their bodies will react. 2-3 days: if you ""do"" a three-day fast with juices, it will really help eliminate toxins, significantly raise energy levels, strengthen your immunity and help you lose extra pounds. 5-7 days: such a long fast is recommended for experienced people who have already tried fasting. With a long fast, the body can be even better cleansed of toxins and waste, reset, and recharged with a new dose of energy. Always prepare and consume juices fresh, you can also prepare them in the morning and cool them slightly in the refrigerator. One day you can only be on green juices, the other only on red (beets, carrots, ginger…), and so on. Or combine multiple multi-colored juices during the same day of fasting. Drink 1.5-2 liters of fresh juices a day. After a few days of detox with the help of juices, slowly introduce solid foods. Cleansing the body and the benefits of fasting with juices: cleanses the body of toxins alkalizes the body (increases alkalinity) revitalizes and refreshes reduces inflammatory processes brings mental clarity raises energy levels increases endurance improves coping with stress stimulates circulation and digestion reduces the risk of cancer (and other diseases) improves skin health contributes to slimness"
12,"""Frotox"" Replacing Botox As Amerca's Go Anti-Aging Solution",health-fitness," Botox has been the world’s favorite noninvasive cosmetic procedure for decades. Known for its ability to take years off in a matter of weeks, Botox has remained unmatched until today. New cryotherapy technology is quickly replacing Botox. Frotox is picking up headlines for its ability to deliver age reversing results instantly and without the needles.  Frotox uses state of the art technology to freeze the face, reaching temperatures as low as -160 degrees. Frotox increases blood and oxygen flow up to four times the average. Aureus Aesthetics, a luxury aesthetics studio located in La Jolla, California is one of the few places allowing guests to experience Frotox. The process involves delivering highly pressurized liquid nitrogen into the nerves. Once the nerve is reached, it turns into gas, drawing heat from the surrounding tissues and creating a controlled cold zone. This causes facial muscles to relax, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles without the use of toxins. Can Frotox Really Replace Your Botox? Similarly to Botox, Frotox takes around 20 minutes to complete. Unlike Botox, Frotox results can last four to six months. This is slightly longer than the toxin. For those who want age reversing effects without the needles, Frotox is a natural alternative to Botox.  No toxin is injected into the skin. Frotox works by using freezing temperatures. Will Frotox Affect Botox? Studies have shown Frotox can increase the longevity of your Botox. For best results, it’s recommended to get Frotox in a package of three completed weekly or biweekly and then followed up by monthly maintenance. Since Frotox has an immediate tightening effect, results can be seen once you leave the chair. The freezing effect will also trigger the production of elastin and collagen for a healthier glow and more youthful appearance."
13,What is genetic counselor?,health-fitness," What is a genetic counselor? We explore the role, and importance of a genetic counselor in the diagnosing of a rare disease. We also highlight their crucial role in supporting rare disease families through a diagnosis and beyond. What are the main roles of a genetic counselor? A genetic counselor is a genetic expert, with medical training, who is also able to counsel and emotionally support rare disease families during their diagnostic journey. Theirs is an unique role, in that they bridge the medical and non-medical words, and support both medical teams and rare disease patients and families. The main roles of a genetic counselor include: ●	Providing information and knowledge about the causes and symptoms of rare diseases. There are over 7,000 rare diseases, and most people’s understanding of them is limited. Even many doctors, who do not have a background or training in genetics, have limited knowledge about many of these rare diseases. Genetic counselors however know and understand rare diseases, and are able to explain this understanding to patients and families facing a rare disease or genetic diagnosis. ●	Recommending genetic testing, based on the needs of an individual or family. Genetic counselors are able to understand which specific type of testing is right for each individual. Whether it’s carrier screening for parents-to-be, or amniocentesis for a pregnant mother, genetic counselors are able to explain the process of each test, if there are any risks involved, and what the possible results of the test might be. ●	Explaining the results from genetic testing, and what they might be in the context of a rare disease diagnosis. If they confirm a rare disease, what are the options for the patient in terms of potential treatments and long term care management. If the results are inconclusive, a genetic counselor can recommend further testing and screening. ●	Providing emotional support. For some families the rare disease diagnosis process can be a long, stressful and frustrating one. The role of genetic counselors is to accompany patients throughout the entire process, providing emotional support the entire time. Genetic counselors are therapists also, and will also connect rare disease families with support groups and networks of support for during and after a diagnosis of a rare disease. ●	Coordinating all of the medical professionals, and teams, involved in diagnosing and caring for a rare disease patient. This can mean bringing together a team of genetic experts in order to receive a diagnosis, but also following a diagnosis, it can mean, bringing together a multidisciplinary team of medical specialists. Many rare diseases present with multiple symptoms, which can affect multiple parts of the body. For some patients their care needs are complicated, and involved in different medical teams. Genetic counselors can help ensure continuity and consistency of care. This is especially important for patients with multiple health and medical issues. ●	Genetic counselors are also able to help translate medical information, diagnosis, and other important knowledge received from medical teams and genetic experts, to patients. The world of genetics is a complicated one, and genetic counselors play a crucial role in helping families understand it a little better. Finding a genetic counselor Finding a genetic counselor can be tricky, depending on where a patient lives. For those living in remote, rural areas, it can be even more difficult. Access to genetic experts is a challenge in a field where awareness and support are key. Many rare disease families face long journey times to reach a genetic counselor, and often long wait times for an appointment too. This can delay access to what is an essential service for many families, and this delay can slow down the entire diagnostic process, leaving families stranded in a diagnostic odyssey. Genetic counselors available online In response to many of the obstacles facing access to crucial genetic counseling services, the last few years has seen the development of online genetic counseling platforms and services. Moving genetic counselors online has the potential to open up their specialist support services and knowledge to more and more families, who so desperately need their support. Online genetic counseling removes location obstacles. Expert genetic counselors can be reached from anywhere in the world. All that is needed to access an online genetic counselor is a connected device, with video. This makes it much easier for genetic counselors and rare disease families to connect, regardless of where they are in the world. This in turn removes most, if not all, of the current obstacles facing rare disease families. Genetic counseling is an essential service for rare disease patients and their families. Ensuring more families are able to access it, benefits everyone."

17,How do implant doctors use dental laser effectively,health-fitness," In the field of oral implantology and its surgical procedures, the dental laser offers numerous advantages over conventional tools. In particular, the bactericidal and cutting properties of the dental laser allow the implant surgeon to treat in a more flexible, efficient, minimally invasive, and rapid manner and to meet the patient's requirements for a rapid post-operative recovery and reduced pain. Continuous and stable soft tissue support is necessary for the long-term success of the implant. The main aim is to improve the condition of the soft tissue around the implant, which includes: labiaplasty, gingivoplasty and gingival mucosal surgery. The main advantages of the oral laser in these procedures are： ● The precise and detailed surgical cutting ● Intraoperative hemostasis for better visualization ● Bacterial killing in the surgical area ● Reduces post-operative edema and scar tissue In the treatment of peri-implantitis, oral laser therapy has even become the treatment of choice. This is because the majority of patients with peri-implantitis have a bacterial infection, and a major cause of this outcome is the continued deterioration of oral hygiene problems Killing bacteria in periodontal pockets is the main focus of treatment for these bacterial infections. The oral laser has been proven to be highly effective in this regard in the literature. After scaling with conventional tools, the surface of the implant and the surrounding soft tissues are sterilized with an oral laser (diode or neodymium laser) and subsequently, the soft tissues around the implant can be aerosolized with an oral laser (diode or erbium laser). Vaporization of the soft tissues around the implant results in a clean implant surface and the removal of the infected biological tissue layer. The aim is to stabilize the peri-implant tissue structure and thus avoid bone loss leading to implant failure. However, due to the progressive increase in the number of implants and the increasing age of the patient, the probability of peri-implantitis increases significantly. With the advent of oral laser therapy, the treatment of peri-implantitis has been extended and offers a completely new approach to maintaining healthy implants."

19,loss weight efficiently,health-fitness," SLIMMING OBJECTIVE : FAST OR EFFECTIVE DIET? You want to lose weight but the diets you have tried so far have not worked? Then maybe it's time to change your method! Good news: I am against overly restrictive diets, I encourage my clients to change their eating habits and exercise, and this is the only method with which I have obtained lasting results. The bad news is that my method does not allow for rapid weight loss, such as ""losing 10 kilos in 1 week"". I prefer a slower weight loss but on the long term without a yo-yo effect. So which slimming programme should you choose: those that recommend taking your time or those that promise immediate results? What if I told you that it was possible to lose weight quickly and well, even allowing yourself a few deviations from time to time... The trick is to have a programme and to be well informed. ➔ Nutrition programme ➔ Sport Program 3 fundamentals for a successful diet 1- Motivation The first prerequisite for losing weight is to be motivated. Whether it is about your diet or sport, you will always have the urge to flinch. At these times, remind yourself why you are doing this and what your motivation is. The first week can sometimes be difficult but you'll see that the first kilo lost is encouraging! 2- Realistic goals Set yourself goals and stick to them, BUT don't set your goals too high - that's the best way to lose motivation. A goal of losing 1 kilo per week is already very good! And you don't need to get on the scales twice a day to look for progress. Once a week is enough, on a fixed day, for example every Sunday. And if the weight loss is less than you expected, don't panic, it happens! 3- Go gradually Take it one step at a time, don't go from nothing to nothing overnight. The human body is sensitive and needs time to adapt; it does not like changes that are too sudden. This advice applies to both physical exercise and diet. If you don't do any sport, don't force yourself to do 1 hour a day every day. Three types of body fat There are three types of adult body fat: subcutaneous fat (between the skin and the abs), visceral fat (behind the abs, around the internal organs) and body fat depending on the sex of the individual. Each of these types requires a specific control strategy. As the name suggests, visceral fat is mainly stored in the abdominal cavity, pushing the stomach forward. The more obese a person is, the more of this type of fat they have. And it is precisely the visceral fat that gives the individual an apple shape. Cardio exercises are the most effective against this type of fat. All those who claim to have succeeded in losing weight considerably by running have mainly got rid of visceral fat. If you are able to pull in your stomach, you have little of this type of fat. Subcutaneous fat accounts for about 40-60% of body fat. This is the fat you can feel under the skin. Aerobic exercise has less impact on the removal of subcutaneous fat. Apart from that, one should follow a low-calorie diet. On average you can lose 400 to 700 g of this type of fat per week(4), which is equivalent to a deficit of 500 to 900 kcal per day. The body is unable to burn this fat faster. If you reduce your calorie intake even more, you will mainly lose muscle and not fat. The third type of fat is the one that is defined by our gender. This fat is located on the lower abdomen in men, and on the hips and buttocks in women. The fight against this type of fat is possible if you only have a certain amount of subcutaneous fat. Unfortunately, this fat is the most problematic, since the body uses it last, after getting rid of visceral and subcutaneous fat. The strategy to combat this fat requires complex solutions. NUTRITION: CHANGE YOUR EATING HABITS The best way to lose weight sustainably is by changing your eating habits. This will depend on where you are starting from and what you are currently eating. If you regularly drink soft drinks or alcohol and eat fast food, you can imagine that these are the first things to banish when trying to lose weight. Generally speaking, the first thing to do is to reduce your consumption of sugars and fats, and eat more fruit and vegetables. It is necessary to know how to choose the least energetic foods, I advise you to learn to read labels and thus know the approximate nutritional value of common foods. If you find it difficult to choose your food and understand the labels, I invite you to try the Yuka application. I did an article on it that you can check out, but in a few words it allows you to scan all your food products and get a quality index based on its nutritional properties and sugar/fat/salt content. Foods to choose One thing I have noticed with my clients is that they do not eat enough fish. Fish is very healthy, a good source of protein and generally low in fat. It's definitely an ally in your diet, so try to eat fish 2 to 3 times a week. Yes, but fish is expensive; it's true but there are always ways to find cheaper fish, go to Lidl for example, fish is much cheaper, or buy it frozen. Just avoid breaded fish For meats, prefer lean meats and poultry. Remember that you don't have to eat meat (or fish) at every meal, you can replace it with other sources of protein such as eggs, legumes (soya, lentils), quinoa, etc. Vegetables: as much as you like! Vegetables and raw vegetables are recommended at every meal. Fruit is also highly recommended but limited because of its sugar content. Prefer low-sugar fruit. Recommended cooking methods Meat: grilled or roasted; Fish: grilled, baked, microwaved or in foil; Vegetables: steamed, stewed or microwaved Seasoning and sauces Add flavour to your meals but use the least fatty seasonings and sauces possible: you can use extra virgin olive oil, lemon, soy sauce, herbs and spices. Of course, avoid all ketchup/mayonnaise, and use as little butter as possible. A simple tip for healthy eating is to avoid processed products, rich in food additives. This technique, used for example in the Paleo diet, consists of favouring fresh products and abandoning the ""ready-made"" foods that you find in the supermarket: packets of cakes, tins, ready-made meals, etc. Basically, anything that does not come from a farm or a small village. In short, anything that does not come directly from nature. In addition to being very healthy for the body, you will find many benefits other than weight loss: reduced risk of disease, better sleep, feeling of well-being, increased energy, etc. If your budget allows it, choose organic farming, which is richer in nutrients and more nourishing than the processed and impoverished products of the food industry Contrary to what we have always been told, dieting does not have to be synonymous with not eating enough. Even if some methods such as fasting recommend skipping a meal during the day, I think that as long as you only eat healthy food, there is no reason to deprive yourself and not eat enough (without excess either, it's like everything else). You won't get fat by eating green vegetables! Reducing quantities too drastically and not reaching our daily calorie requirements presents a real risk of nutritional deficiencies. Our body needs to be supplied with nutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, fats, fibre, vitamins and minerals). That's why it's important to eat your 5 fruits and vegetables a day. Tip: don't hesitate to eat your vegetables frozen if you don't have the time to prepare them, contrary to some preconceived ideas they are very good! Don't confuse frozen vegetables with frozen ready meals. If you have vitamin and mineral deficiencies, you can make up for them with food supplements in the form of courses. The risks of a quick diet Even though we're always eager to see results, the sustainable diet is the most effective. If you still want to try a magic diet to lose weight quickly, here are a few things that might (hopefully) make you not want to: Guaranteed yo-yo effect: A diet that is too deprived conditions your metabolism for the next ""attack"". As it is no longer used to receiving fats, at the first deviation or return to normal it will store more fats than before to face possible future periods of dieting. Result: you get fatter. When you see that you have gained weight again, you go back on a diet, and so on. You never get out of it. With a drastic diet you will not provide your body with its daily needs in vitamins and minerals, which will result in increased fatigue and a decrease in your immune system (you will fall ill more often, etc.). Deficiencies make your nails and hair more fragile. Loss of muscle mass: Even if the aim is to burn fat quickly, your body will often burn muscle mass first. The result: you lose your shape (=flat buttocks). To avoid this, you need to eat a balanced diet rich in protein and do sports to build up muscle mass. You are more prone to stress and psychological problems. obviously, it is better to follow a training course which will be much more complete than my article it has been proven that using a paid subscription increases the probability of succeeding in your diet by 45% (obviously if this subscription is effective), which is why I recommend this one which has been tested and approuved by me: bit.ly/control-your-health have a nice day and hope that this article has very been very useful to you! © 2021 Lara Romane"
20,Global health issue,health-fitness," Antimicrobial resistance is a global health issue that poses a significant danger to the operative prevention and management of the growing variety of infections caused by bacteria. The modern medicine is under substantial threat since antimicrobial resistance has rendered most of the previously effective drugs useless. An example is the CDCs assertion that drug resistant TB is anticipated to rise in the highest burden countries in the next two decades. Currently, there are over 480,000 cases of development of multi-drug resistant Tuberculosis annually according to WHO. The expenditure on antibiotic-resistant infections has increased at the continent level thus making governments donate a large amount of financial recourses on healthcare.

Deaths due to drug-resistant infections have also negatively affected the economy of several states and countries because of the lack of labor force and skilled personnel. In sum, antimicrobial resistance seriously threatens the management of bacterial infections all over the world. However, the global healthcare systems can resolve this problem collaboratively. In this case, various units have unique roles to play to suggest a long-term solution to the issue of antimicrobial resistance and address the disappointing statistics. Collaborative efforts from all units should ensure that people are sensitized on the best ways to use antibiotics. They should also introduce antibiotics stewardship practice in places such as long-term care facilities and other health care institutions. The respective bodies on the level of continents, regions, states, and countries can establish approved antibiotic prescribers with the help of the Office of the Global Affairs. Such individuals must adhere to the local and territorial guidance to prescribe the correct and appropriate dose and establish the right duration. Healthcare system's professionals should embrace the prevention and control practice at their localities in order to reduce transmission of drug-resistant pathogens. Overall, the solution to this issue lies in the collaborative efforts of the healthcare systems aimed at ensuring that antibiotics usage is managed centrally by the professionals, who adhere to the provincial and territorial guidance.

3,How to lose weight and keep it off!,health-fitness," Not all what works for others can work for you, since our bodies respond differently to different foods depending on genetics and other health factors. So finding what works for you requires time, patience, commitment, and some experimentation with different foods and diets. A diet after all is something people go on to go off. Most people think of a diet as a means to an end, and few who go on a food-restricted diet to lose weight expect to have to eat that way indefinitely. And therein lies the rub, with the current unchecked epidemic of obesity as the sorry result. Here are 4 popular weight loss strategies: Cut Calories When you cut calories ,you drop weight for the first few weeks, and then something changes. You eat the same amount of calories but you lose less or no weight at all. That's because when you lose weight, you lose water and lean tissue as well as fat, your metabolism slows. So in order to continue losing weight you need to continue cutting calories. Cut Cabs When you eat a meal, carbohydrates from the food enter your bloodstream as glucose. In order to keep your blood sugar levels in check, your body always burns off this glucose before it burns off fat from a meal. If you eat a carbohydrate-rich meal (lots of pasta, rice, bread, or French fries, for example) your body releases insulin which prevents your fat cells from releasing fat for the body to burn as fuel and creates more fat cells for storing everything that your body can't burn off. The result is that you gain weight. Most low-carb diets Advocate replacing carbs with protein and fat, which could have some negative long-term effects on your health. If you do try a low-carb diet, you can reduce risks and limit your intake of saturated and trans fats by choosing lean meats, fish and vegetarian sources of protein, low-fat dairy products, and eating plenty of leafy green and non-starchy vegetables. Cut Fat If you don't want to get fat, don't eat fat. Go to any grocery store and get reduced-fat snacks, and packaged meals. So why haven't low-fat diets worked for more of us? Because healthy or ""good"" fats can actually help to control your weight, as well as manage your moods and fight fatigue.

Control emotional eating. We don't always eat to satisfy our hunger, we often eat when we're stressed or anxious which can ruin any diet and pile up more weight. So make sure to help yourself get rid of stress or anxiety by finding healthy ways to calm yourself such as yoga, meditation, or soaking in a hot bath. You should also practice mindful eating, and avoid any distractions which can lead you to eat more than what you want. Instead pay attention and eat slowly, and stop eating before you are full.

To stay motivated, find a cheering section; seek out support whether in the form of family, friends, or a support group to get the encouragement you need.

Most of us consume unhealthy amounts of sugar and refined carbohydrates, such as; white bread, pizza dough, pasta, pastries, white flour, white rice, and sweetened breakfast cereals. Since your body gets all it needs from sugar amounts to nothing but a lot of empty calories and unhealthy spikes in your blood glucose. Fill up with fruit, veggies, and fiber You don't have to eat less food just because you're cutting calories. Fruit, vegetables, beans, and whole grains are high in fiber and take longer to digest, making them filling and beneficial for weight loss. Eat as much fresh fruit and non-starchy vegetables as you want—you'll be happy before you've consumed too many calories. Rather than frying or breading vegetables, eat them raw or steamed, and season them with herbs and spices or a drizzle of olive oil. Blueberries, strawberries, and chopped bananas are good additions to low-sugar cereal. You'll still get plenty of sweetness, but you'll consume fewer calories, sugar, and fiber. Add lettuce, tomatoes, sprouts, cucumbers, and avocado to your sandwiches to make them more substantial. Instead of high-calorie chips and dip, munch on carrots or celery with hummus.

Start your meal with a salad or vegetable soup to help you feel fuller and eat less of your main course. Take charge of your food environment Take control of your food environment by controlling what you eat, how much you eat, and what meals you have on hand. You can prepare your own meals at home. This gives you complete control over portion size as well as what goes into your meal. Restaurant and packaged foods typically contain significantly more sugar, unhealthy fat, and calories than food prepared at home, as well as greater portion sizes. Smaller servings are better for you. Make your portions look bigger by using small plates, bowls, and cups. Don't eat from big bowls or food containers because it's impossible to tell how much you've eaten. Eat first thing in the morning.

Store unhealthy meals out of sight if you share a kitchen with non-dieters. Get Moving. Although the extent to which exercise aids weight loss is debatable, the advantages extend far beyond calorie burning.

Begin by gradually increasing your daily physical activity. You'll find it easier to become more physically active as you lose weight and gain energy. Find an activity that you want to do. Try going for a walk with a friend, dance, hiking, cycling, playing Frisbee with your dog, picking up a game of basketball, or playing activity-based video games with your kids.

While there isn't much hard evidence to back this up, it is true that many weight-loss plans fail over time. This is also due to the fact that overly restrictive diets are difficult to maintain over time. However, That isn't to say that your weight-loss efforts will fail. Quite the contrary. The National Weight Control Registry (NWCR) in the United States has tracked over 10,000 people who have lost substantial amounts of weight and kept it off for extended periods of time since it was established in 1994. Participants who have maintained their weight loss have some common strategies, according to the research. Following these habits, regardless of the diet you used to lose weight in the first place, may help you keep it off: ● Keep yourself in shape. In the NWCR study, successful dieters walked for about 60 minutes. ● Keeping a food diary is a great way to keep track of what you eat. It's easier to stay accountable and motivated if you keep track of what you eat every day. ● Every day, you should eat breakfast. Cereal and fruit are the  most popular in the study. Breakfast speeds up your metabolism and keeps you fuller for longer. ● Eat a diet that is higher in fiber and lower in unhealthy fat than the usual American diet. ● Check the scale on a regular basis. Weighing yourself once a week may help you detect any small weight gain, allowing you to take corrective action before the problem worsens. ● Reduce the amount of TV you watch.

7,Fingernail disease,health-fitness," Nails give us much information about our body health. By looking at the nails, we can know what disease we have. We do not need to see a doctor for this. Now let’s know something about this. Thyroid: If your nails become loose or detached from the nail bed, it is called ONYCHOLYSIS. This ONYCHOLYSIS often occurs on the ring finger and little fingers of the hand. These disorders called ONYCHOLYSIS can occur if a person has an increased thyroid disorder. If too much space falls on the nails dirt and dirt can enter and cause diseases in the nails. Similarly, cavities in the nails are also a sign that there is a thyroid problem.

8,The Benefits of Indoor Golf,health-fitness," According to golfers, one of the most frustrating things is that they don’t usually get the chance to play golf as much as they’d like. Outdoor golfing courses usually have course hours during which you can play. Now, it happens quite often that those hours overlap with work hours. So, the lack of free time to play is just one of the setbacks of golfing outdoors. This – among other things – brought forth the need to create indoor golfing simulators. Indoor golf has been around for quite some time now and it’s only continuing to gain popularity. That being said, here are some of the greatest benefits of indoor golf. Don’t let bad weather ruin your play IF you’ve ever played golf outdoors, you probably already know just how frustrating having to abandon your play due to bad weather can be. However, with indoor golfing, bad weather is simply not an issue. No matter if it’s pouring rain or scorching heat outside, you will get the chance to play at an optimal temperature no matter which indoor golf center you choose. So, don’t let the bad weather prevent you from enjoying your favorite game. Instead, look for indoor golfing centers that fit your preferences and have fun playing golf even when the weather outside is terrible. Choose your tee time Another obvious benefit of indoor golfing is the fact that you can choose your own tee time. As mentioned earlier, golfers state the lack of free time as one of the biggest hindrances. So, instead of having to adjust to course hours, you can nowadays play golf when it suits you. An additional perk of indoor golf is that you can even play it once the sun goes down, which is not possible in an outdoor court. The majority of indoor golf centers have controlled conditions promising you optimal temperature and proper lighting throughout the day. So, you can’t deny that being able to play golf whenever you feel like is an obvious advantage. Improve your skills No matter if you participate in competitive golfing or you’re simply playing for your pleasure, constant practice will help you improve your skill. Now, there are a lot of places in the world where it’s simply impossible to golf at an outdoor court throughout the year. Luckily, you can nowadays find an indoor golf center almost everywhere in the world. For instance, if you live in New York, check out your local indoor golf New York centers and keep practicing year-round. Again, if you take part in competitive golfing, being able to hone your skills year-round will put you at a serious advantage over your competition. Get valuable feedback When playing golf outdoors, you absolutely can receive lessons and learn how to do it properly. But, compared to indoor golfing, perfecting your skill will probably last a bit longer. Most modern indoor golf centers have state-of-the-art equipment that can offer some valuable feedback. With the use of the latest technology, you can easily gather data on your overall performance. You can then use this data to assess your performance and see whether you need to fix or correct something with your posture, alignment, aim, or swing. Having access to this type of information can be of great use, especially for people who are there not only to have fun but learn as well. Try it at home Now, in case you have a spare room at your home, you can also check out indoor golf setups you can install right at your home. With such tech solutions being more and more easily accessible, you can choose golf impact screens of various sizes. What’s best, this setup can be placed in even the most limited of spaces. That being said, however, you can never expect to get the same quality from a home indoor golf setup as you will in any indoor golf center. On top of that, even though the equipment is easy to find, don’t expect it to be affordable. Save money In the end, we simply can’t be talking about the benefits of indoor golfing without mentioning the price. In the past, golf was most commonly enjoyed by people with very deep pockets. However, nowadays, indoor golf centers make this sport more accessible and affordable to anyone. Depending on the type of indoor golf center you choose, you’ll be paying either a daily, a weekly, or a monthly fee. These fees are usually quite easily affordable, which means that you’ll be able to play golf whenever you feel like it without compromising your budget. With all of this said, it becomes quite clear why indoor golf has become so popular and why it only continues to grow. Being able to choose when you want to play and not having to worry about the weather, getting the opportunity to perfect your skills, and save money are just some of the most prominent benefits of indoor golf."
9,Shed that weight with HB5 supplement,health-fitness," Weight loss with HB5 supplements Dr. Wood is an expert on hormonal blocks and their effect on weight gain. He has developed the HB5: a supplement that helps metabolism to go up a gear and burn fat. This knowledge about hormonal blocks helps remove the guilty complex attached to weight gain. The adverse side effects of weight gain, if well modified, can save lives. A heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease are tell-tale events that follow obesity. These life-events can be financially and emotionally draining. The way out of this mess starts when the exact origin of the problem is known. We know that there are hormonal blocks, five of them, that modify our metabolism and often lead to weight gain. They are hormones produced in the body. Thyroid hormones, such as T3 and T4 are substances that help change and fat into energy. When they don't function properly, the body metabolism stores the calories as fat. The brain could be the next to take the hit as flat thyroid hormones won't allow the release of energy to brain cells. Brain fogginess could result afterward. Cortisol: This hormone often called the stress hormone is released when one experiences stress. The experience one gets when you are being chased by a 200 pounds, pounding lion. This same type of stress could be brought up by day-to-day activities such as a demanding job, a rocky relationship, and a challenging child. The brain is programmed to interpret all these events as stressful. It ends up turning off the switch of your metabolism, and digestion. Fat accumulates, and weight gain sets in. Estrogen: This hormone is often in a state of imbalance with progesterone. Estrogen is a promoter of fat deposition especially around the waist and the lower abdomen. This imbalance comes up especially as women age. High estrogen levels will pull down the effects of thyroid hormone. The 4th hormonal block is one hormone you might have heard before and that is insulin. Insulin is produced by the pancreas and its levels are increased after a meal. Insulin deposits sugar as glycogen in the muscles, however, once these muscle stores are filled up, the body starts to deposits excess glycogen as fat. This worsens the weight loss cycle. Leptin is the 5th hormonal block. It can do a lot of harm to fat metabolism when it works in an unguarded fashion. When it functions normally, the feeling of satiety comes after a normal meal but when its functions become erratic, due to fat deposition from the other 4 hormonal blocks, the brain stops processing leptin signals. This finally leads to poor control over excessive feeding. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT Weight gain often leads to a feeling of depression and self-degradation. The sleepless night, the low-energy periods, the times of brain fogginess, and the labile moods are attributable to the recently explained hormonal blocks. The hormonal blocks explain them all; the origin of weight gain and the inability to control weight despite drug therapies, lifestyle changes, and dietary discretions. SOLVING ALL FIVE HB The simple way to go about addressing this situation will be to target all the hormonal blocks. Nature has provided a wide array of food substances that have abundant supplements. These supplements help improve and stabilize the function of all the hormones we have highlighted. Iodine is found in kelp and it promotes the efficient production of copper, iron, zinc, magnesium, and selenium all help the movement of thyroid hormone into the bloodstream. Rhodiola; a flowering plant helps to modulate the productions of less excess cortisol. Red Ginseng another HB5 ingredient also helps to decrease cortisol levels and reduce stress. Diindolylmethane occurs naturally in vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. Estrogen is broken down into better alternatives when diindolylmethane acts on it. This improves metabolism and promotes weight loss. Cinnamon has been studied over the years and has shown that its diet supplementation helped increase fat burning and reduced waist circumference drastically. African mango when ingested leads to great improvement in leptin levels. This ultimately leads to improved awareness of fullness and reduces the consumption of unhealthy meals.

A few indications (regularly called ""warning"" manifestations) may recommend that the back pain has a more genuine motivation. These incorporate fever, ongoing injury, weight reduction, a past filled with malignancy and neurological side effects, like deadness, shortcoming, or incontinence (compulsory loss of pee or stool). Back pain is regularly joined by different indications that may help highlight its motivation. For instance: Back sprain or strain – Back pain normally starts on the day after a weighty effort or an action that requires contorting. Muscles in the back, rump, and thighs are frequently sore and solid. The back may have territories that are sore when contacted or squeezed. Fibromyalgia – notwithstanding back pain, there are typically different territories of pain and firmness in the storage compartment, neck, shoulders, knees, and elbows.

Analysis Your PCP will get some information about your side effects and your clinical history. The person will inspect your back muscles and spine and will move you to certain approaches to check for pain, muscle delicacy or shortcoming, solidness, deadness, or unusual reflexes. For instance, in the event that you have a plating issue, you may have pain in your lower back when the specialist raises your fixed leg. Your side effects and the actual assessment may give your PCP enough data to analyze the issue. Nonetheless, with back pain, your PCP may just have the option to reveal to you that the issue isn't not kidding. On the off chance that your PCP confirms that your back pain is brought about by muscle strain, stoutness, pregnancy or another reason that isn't critical, you may not need any extra tests.

11,A Deeper Dive Into Green Tea's Benefits,health-fitness," Although it has been known for a very long time that green tea is beneficial, very few people actually know what the benefits of this beverage are. It's good to keep in mind though that if you don't drink it, maybe this article will persuade you to! Before I talk of the benefits, I always like to start such articles with the usual advice: take everything in moderation.  I like to drink a hot cup of green tea in the morning, and that's enough for me.  It's never the case that more of a good thing makes you ""healthier"" - everything is always about balance. With that out of the way, let's look at the three major benefits green tea can give you. First of all, let's take a look at what green tea has in common with a lot of other drinks. It's got caffeine. This isn't much of a surprise, but you'll want to be aware of how that caffeine can help you. What happens when you drink a lot of coffee? That caffeine doesn't give you a great night's sleep - so avoid green tea in the evening. When you have a higher level of caffeine in your system, you feel more alert and more energetic, as well as having more energy to deal with the stress levels in your life. As you're digesting your food more quickly, your body will get the calories needed for energy quicker too. You'll probably be familiar with the cholesterol problem that we all face, as well as the health problems that this condition causes. By consuming more green tea, you'll be making your body less susceptible to these conditions, as well as making it healthier overall. Lastly, there's the positive effect that it has on your skin. People like celebrities and actors who are concerned about their appearance have been using green tea to enhance their appearance. They're not alone in doing this either. Studies have shown that it has many benefits for the skin, particularly when it comes to dull skin. Research has shown that it can help eliminate free radicals, which are helpful antioxidants, and even boost collagen production in the skin. It can do this because it's natural source of catechins, or epigallocatechin-3. So there you have it, three green tea benefits that you'll find quite useful. Even if you're already drinking it, you'll find yourself appreciating it even more as time goes by."
12,Cycling: the Most Convenient Form of Exercise,health-fitness," If you are looking to increase your individual health or fitness levels, cycling is ideal. This is because it's so convenient! It can be done anytime and anywhere with the least amount of disruption. Cycling also allows you to get away from the stress of everyday life.  Furthermore, it's another mode of transport, so you can get fit getting to and from work. There are myriad other benefits to cycling: it's environmentally friendly, it's essentially free, and promotes good cardiovascular health. So you get to shrink your carbon footprint while saving yourself transport costs, and improve your cardiovascular health - two...err, three birds, one stone! Morever, regular cycling will increase your metabolism - thus, you will burn more calories throughout the day. This is of course important if you are trying to lose weight. Cycling provides a calorie-burning metabolism if you cycle regularly. Cycling has been shown to improve your immune system too. This allows you to fight off the harmful effects of air pollution and reduces the risk of getting ill because of contaminated air. In addition, cycling helps to protect against the negative effects of age. It can help you feel younger as you travel through the many miles that you cycle each day. I've not even mentioned the greatest benefit yet (well, in my humble opinion)! Cycling allows you to enjoy the great outdoors. There's no better way to enjoy nature than by cycling.  I prefer it even to walking, since it's easier on your feet and back (trust me, I've been on LONG walks...and cycling is more forgiving).  You can cover longer distances with a bike, so you can turn a countryside meander into a bit of an odyssey over 20km to 50km, if you're feeling up to it (just bring plenty of food and water). In addition, cycling will provide you with a sense of independence from the usual day to day activities. For example, if you are working on a project, you can avoid distractions and think more clearly when cycling. This is particularly important when you need to stay focused. Whether you are a beginner or an expert, cycling is the perfect exercise that will keep you healthy, fit and active."
13,A Look at the Benefits of Fasting,health-fitness," Fasting is a process in which the body goes without food for a period of time. It has been practiced for centuries by various cultures throughout the world, but it has recently gained popularity as a dieting strategy - people have found it effective as a way to lose weight. There are several other benefits of fasting. One of the most well-known is that it can be used to increase your energy levels. During the fasting period, your immune system functions normally.  Fasting encourages a process called autophagy.  This process helps clear away dead cells an encourages cellular and tissue rejuvenation.   Fasting also gives your digestive system a break - this helps it rest and recover for the next meal. Another good reason to consider fasting is the fact that it could help you reduce the risk of certain diseases. Some of the known diseases that are believed to be reduced by prolonged fasting include Alzheimer's disease, asthma, diabetes, obesity, and cancer. Although the truth behind some of these claims is not fully established, it is common sense that extended fasting would have positive effects on your body and mind. The body's mechanism of sensing food is disrupted during a fasting period. When you eat a snack, your body is reminded of food and it ""awakens"" the senses that provoke the pangs of hunger soon after the food is digested.  For this reason, many doctors recommend the use of fasting or dieting in order to control unhealthy eating habits. Many people are put off by the idea of fasting.  It seems like we're going to lose our energy and motivation during the fasting period.  Some people lead busy lives and can't afford to lose their energy.  Well, that's where intermittent fasting can help.  Many people choose a period of 12 to 16 hours each day to fast.  This period includes sleep, so it's not as long as it sounds.  Quite often it could be an 8 hour sleep bookended by 2 hours of not eating before bed, and 2 hours of not eating after awaking.  Not so hard, right?  My advice is to take baby steps with fasting.  Do not jump straight into something extreme - try intermittent fasting first, even if it's just a case of not eating two or three hours before sleep. As you can see, fasting can have a number of benefits. While the mere act of fasting alone may not be enough to completely aid you in your quest to achieve optimal health, it is a good thing to practice from time to time."
14,Meditation - What Gardens Teach Us About Spirituality?,health-fitness," The month of March brings with it the excitement and joyousness of spring. As the snows of winter fade into the past, May brings hope that spring has finally arrived. Signs of its arrival are everywhere. We see the spectacular colors bursting forth from flowers, bushes, and trees. The world looks like a painting, with rich hues of red, pink, orange, yellow, blue, violet, purple, and white blossoms, surrounded by a variety of green-colored grasses, stems, and leaves. Birds singing joyously as they flit about from flower to flower and tree to tree. The luscious fragrance of apple trees in blossom fills our senses. With the warmer weather, we shed our coats and can feel the cool breezes of spring against our skin. It is a time of happiness and joy with hopes of wonderful days ahead. There are many spiritual lessons we can learn from the blossoming gardens that will benefit us on our spiritual journey. They teach us how we can nurture the seed of our soul so that it may blossom and shine in its pristine glory. Nurturing the Seed of the Soul In the gardens of the world, seeds need fertile soil, water, air, and sunlight to grow. The soul is like a spiritual seed that lies dormant within us, until we nurture it. The seed lies dormant at the seat of the soul, between and behind the two eyebrows. When we learn to meditate on the inner Light and Sound of God, our soul experiences God’s love for itself, and the sleeping seed of our soul is awakened. Through connection with the current of Light and Sound, the seed of the soul is watered. This current is the divine power emanating from God that brought all creation into existence. It reverberates in all forms of life, from humans, to animals, to plants. It is lying within us, but we do not see or hear it until our sleeping soul is awakened. As a plant needs sunlight to grow, so does our soul need to focus on the inner Light. Once connected to the Light and Sound within, we need to concentrate on it to experience spiritual growth. Daily meditation is the daily sunlight our soul needs to grow. Plants also need the carbon dioxide that we give off. Then, the plants utilize the carbon dioxide and water and give off their waste, which is the oxygen we require to breathe. Similarly, the seed of the soul needs the breath of God’s grace to help it grow. This divine grace is the boost that helps our soul soar into the spiritual realms beyond.  Thus, we can nurture the seed of the soul by sitting in meditation. There are also many life lessons we can learn from the garden. These lessons help us grow and thrive on our spiritual journey. The Art of Patience Once we learn to meditate, we need to practice it diligently. Unfortunately, many grow impatient when they do not see instant results. We live in an instant society. We want instant coffee, instant pudding, and instant oatmeal. We want our computers to boot within microseconds or we get impatient. When we plant a garden, we expect to see the sprouts within a day. If we do not see the sprouts shoot up immediately, we become impatient. Similarly, when we are growing the inner garden of the soul, we need to keep tending it, day after day, with meditation, even when we do not instantly see the dramatic results we want. Yet, with patience and diligence, we are ultimately rewarded when we start seeing new growth. When we see the sprouts of Light shoot forth within and hear the faint whispers of the inner Sound calling to us, we realize that our efforts sprinkled with God’s grace are bearing fruit. Then, the steady growth of the plant reveals that all was not wasted. Our efforts have borne fruit and we grow spiritually. We do not see the seeds in the ground through the long winter, yet with proper care, they sprout into buds and then flowers. Similarly, we may not see the fruits of our meditation right away. But with diligent practice, we will find that the blossoms will appear. We will be blessed with the inner vision and inner hearing of the divine Light and Sound that will carry us into the inner realms until our soul merges back into God. Trust in God The plants and trees in the outer gardens of the world cannot move or act on their own. They cannot talk, so they cannot ask for what they want. They cannot walk, so they cannot go out on their own to get what they need. They are planted in one place with no ability to communicate, move, or take action. They are at the mercy of Nature and God. Yet, everything is provided for them. God provides them with soil, sunlight, air, and water. Whether they are in a tended garden or out in the wild, God has provided for them for ages. If God can provide for every blade of grass on this planet, can’t we trust that God is going to provide for us also? From the garden we learn the lesson of trust in God. There is a plan for each of us. When we do not realize how much of our life is provided by God’s plan for us, we spend a tremendous amount of time worrying over things that are bound to happen anyway. If we could learn the lesson of trust in God, much energy that we waste in worrying could be used for more productive endeavors. Do Your Best and Leave the Rest Since we do not know what is planned and what is not planned at our physical level, we need to do our best in all circumstances. We need to take the best possible action, but then leave the results to God. Even if we do our best, but another result was destined, then we need to let go. We can be confident we did our best, but God may have another plan for us. When something is not going our way, we need to accept that there is another plan for us and let go. We did what we could, but we should leave the rest in God’s hands. In a garden, when we have given our seed fertile soil, water, sunlight, and air, we know we have done our best. How the plant grows then is not in our hands. It is in the hands of God. If the plant does not turn out the color we wanted, the size we wanted, or the shape we wanted, we know there was something beyond our control. We do not blame ourselves for we know we did our part. Then, we know that God had a different plan for that plant. Similarly, we do our best in all circumstances, and then leave the results to God. In this way, we free ourselves from blame, guilt, or regret. We need to do our best and trust in God to take care of us. Lesson of Humility From the plants we learn the lesson of humility. If we watch the trees and bushes on a windy day, what do we see? We find that trees that resist the wind, crack and split. Trees that bend low to the ground with the wind do not break. When the wind passes, the trees spring back up to their upright positions. Often when challenged by the winds of other people or winds of change, we push back. We resist or fight back. We get into arguments. We may even push back physically and get into a physical fight. We may push back verbally and say things that cause altercations or a vicious exchange of words. We may even keep quiet, but mentally go into an outburst of negative thoughts towards the person, which the person may not directly hear but can feel through the strong vibrations of anger we spew out. Thus, we intensify their initial attack with our own response, and the cycle of violence continues. We should learn to observe how those trees, bushes, and flowers that go with the flow of the wind are able to prevent themselves from breaking and cracking. This is the secret of humility. Let us learn from the garden the secret of nurturing the seed of our soul with meditation on the Light and Sound of God. Let us learn from the garden the value of patience, trust, and humility. We will then experience the eternal springtime as we bask in God’s blissful garden."
15,What is Gynaecology?,health-fitness," What is Gynaecology? Gynaecology means the ‘science of women’. This relates to the health of reproductive organs. Women need highly specialised medical care for their gynaecology issues. This is a large area of medical practice. Equally, gynaecology is a large contributor to medical negligence claims. Various problems can occur during treatments, such as perforation of the womb. Perforation can occur during insertion of a coil, or during a pregnancy termination procedure. Investigative procedures, called ‘hysteroscopy’, can also end up with injuries. Failures to measure the length of the vagina and womb can lead to instruments being inserted too deeply. Routine hysteroscopy procedures can also be conducted by those less experienced in their field. Perforations can be repaired IF recognised at the time of injury. Perforations can lead to infertility issues. This is because delays in recognising the injury can make the problem worse. Delays can lead to infection and sepsis. Sepsis can lead to the loss of the womb (‘hysterectomy’). Even if hysterectomy does not result, women can be left with shrunken (‘atrophied’) wombs after serious infection cases. This can mean that they can no longer carry a baby to term, or deliver a baby safely. It can even mean that a lady cannot opt for egg retrieval to allow for surrogacy as egg retrieval becomes too dangerous for the lady wishing to have a baby. Issues of consent are important. Full advice should be given about the removal of pelvic organs. A properly signed consent should be taken for a surgical procedure. During a hysterectomy procedure to remove the womb, it would be wrong to also remove the ovaries unless a patient has been advised about this and has given written consent. Why does Sterilisation go wrong? Sterilisations are commonly successful, but these procedures tend to be left to more junior doctors. It is not uncommon for a junior surgeon to mistake surrounding tissues for the fallopian tube. This can lead to the sterilisation clip being applied to a ligament. Sterilisation clips should be applied to the fallopian tube. Is this happens, it will lead to an unplanned pregnancy, usually within 12 months of the surgery. If pregnancy occurs later than a 12-18 month period after sterilisation, then this will usually be down to bad luck, rather than a surgical error. The fallopian tube can regenerate itself by forming a tube around the clip and finding its way back to the ovary (‘tubal lumen regeneration’). However, this does take time so tends to happen after uite a few months.q What can I claim when sterilisation goes wrong? If treatment goes wrong in sterilisation, there are various claims that can be made: •	Wrongful conception. An action in contract may arise if the sterilisation procedure was performed outside the NHS in the private sector. •	Negligence. A breach of duty arises when an operation is not carried out in accordance with the practice accepted as proper by a reasonable body of gynaecologists. This is also referred to as the Bolam test. •	Negligence also occurs when there is failure to give full advice in pre-operative counselling. •	Wrongful birth. This is where a mother would have opted for lawful termination of pregnancy had she been properly advised about risks of pregnancy. It also covers situations where properly advised, she would have avoided getting pregnant at all. Women are entitled to recover compensation called ‘general damages’ for pain and suffering during pregnancy and delivery, and loss of earnings during pregnancy. However, a judgement in the year 2000 held that the costs of bringing up a healthy child can no longer be claimed (as per, McFarlane v Tayside Health Board). This includes excluding associated loss of earnings."
16,What Clinical Symptoms Does Prostatitis Have And How To Treat It,health-fitness," Prostatitis is a relatively common disease for middle-aged and elderly men, and the incidence of the disease will also increase with age. What are the common symptoms of patients with prostatitis? There are usually four main types. Type I prostatitis often occurs suddenly, mainly manifested as fever, fatigue and other systemic symptoms, accompanied by perineal and pubic pain. Patients may have symptoms of frequent urination, urgent urination, rectal stimulation and even acute urinary retention. The clinical symptoms of Type Ⅱ and Ⅲ prostatitis are similar, both of which feature pain and abnormal urination. These similar clinical symptoms are collectively known as prostatitis syndrome, which includes pelvic sacral pain, abnormal urination and male dysfunction. Abnormal urination is mainly manifested as frequent urination, urgent urination, painful urination, dysuria, nocturnal urination and milky secretion from urethral opening after urination or defecation. It can also cause sexual dysfunction, low sexual desire, premature ejaculation, ejaculation pain, weakened erection, impotence and other phenomena. Type IV prostatitis has no clinical symptoms and the evidence of the inflammation can be found only through examination related to prostate gland. When this type of prostatitis appears, the patient should go to the nearby hospital to examine prostatic fluid immediately, determine what caused it and receive proper treatment in time. Therefore, what should the patient pay attention to when treating prostatitis? 1.Persist in the treatment, and do not casually change or stop the treatment plan. The patient should follow the doctor’s advice, and don’t take drugs blindly or take any other medicine without the doctor’s permission during the treatment. 2.Treat prostatitis correctly, and keeping a good attitude is the golden rule. The patient should avoid and transform negative emotions as far as possible, such as depression, sadness, anger, anxious and fear. 3.Drink more water at ordinary times and enhance the number of urination, both of which are conducive to the discharge of inflammatory secretions. 4.Avoid spicy food, tobacco and alcohol during the treatment, and eat more light foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables. 5.Avoid sitting for a long time and avoid riding a bicycle for too long. It is suggested to adhere to physical exercise while avoid excessive exercise. Jogging and rope jumping are good options. 6.Keep regular sexual life and avoid frequent masturbation. Keep yourself away from unclean sexual intercourse and pay attention to good personal hygiene. 7.Keep bowels open and insist in taking hot water bath or applying hot water bag on the private parts. Can the patient with prostatitis be completely cured? 1.For acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis, the majority of patients can be totally cured after timely treatment. In very rare cases, it can be accompanied by prostate abscess, which should be treated through surgeries, such as incision and drainage. 2.If the treatment of acute bacterial prostatitis can not be completely finished, it will gradually turn into chronic prostatitis. So both getting treated in time and sticking to the treatment are always significantly important. 3.Chronic prostatitis can also be cured, for which the herbal medicine Diuretic and Anti-inflammatory Pill is often recommended. Its strong bactericidal action can effectively react on chronic prostatitis. Besides, it features no side effects or drug resistance. Therefore, all patients can take the pill safely during the long-term treatment. 4.In some cases, there are always some patients with recurrent symptoms, which are usually related to the patients' living habits, eating habits and work habits. To avoid the reoccurrence of prostatitis, male friends should keep good habits through their lives as far as possible."
17,A Look at the Health Benefits of Himalayan Salt,health-fitness," Himalayan salt is one of the most magical and versatile minerals for everything from seasoning your food, to a deep relaxing bath, to even cleaning your teeth.

Himalayan salt has all 84 essential trace elements required by your body, while sea salt cannot make the same claim. Himalayan salt is typically mined from the deposits in the Himalayas, which are miles deep and much higher than the sea level. The process of mining is arduous and can take months before a sufficient amount of crystals are ready to be harvested. In the meantime, it's mixed with other minerals to produce a mineral mixture that's exactly what a person would use for their own kitchen countertop or for making their own salt bath. This unique crystal and temperature sensitive mineral salts have many benefits and are used extensively as a source of the highly sought after white salt crystals. The minerals found in this mineral have an amazing ability to absorb light, heat and other energy forms. When exposed to light or to heat, the water molecules carrying the salt crystals becomes ""naked"" which makes it possible for them to absorb the energy forms that would otherwise escape or be wasted. The crystals can also absorb the light or heat from candles and lamps because of their high absorbing power. Adding Himalayan salt  to food can enhance the taste and texture of a dish and can even add flavor without the need to add actual seasoning to the food. You can also make the salt scents at home and put these scents into fragrances to create the perfect fragrance for any situation. A unique part of this mineral is its ability to create body scents that are truly wonderful. Many individuals are currently using this mineral to create bath salts and body soaps to give themselves a delectablespa experience. Himalayan salt creates a unique fragrance that is made for the body and bath area that is soothing and invigorating. As a natural water softener and de-mineralizer, the salt works very well to cleanse the bath. It's wonderful for whitening laundry as well as removing stains. It also gives the room a special and refreshing feel. Because it has a clean and refreshing effect, it can be used in any type of water, from bath water to running water in your shower to your outdoor garden hose and any other form of water you may wish to use. Finally, it can be used to replace some of the calcium and magnesium present in our body from foods and drinking water. It can actually dissolve plaque which can occur in between teeth. Not only can it help clean the teeth, but it can help prevent future cavities, as well. This means it can go a long way in improving overall oral health and preventing the onset of tooth decay. So as you've learned Himalayan salt has many health benefits you can enjoy for just a few dollars for a salt shaker that can last two or three months."
18,Pearls—The Skin Brightening Ingredient From The Sea,health-fitness," Often thought of as a classic gemstone that adorns the body, most people overlook the powerful properties and skincare benefits of pearls.

19,Apple Cider Vinegar for Weight Loss - Is It Really Effective?,health-fitness," Do you already appreciate the benefits of apple cider vinegar  to season your sauces? You will appreciate it even more after reading this article. Among the many benefits that apple cider vinegar (not to be confused with white vinegar) provides to our health, is weight loss. And YES! Apple cider vinegar for weight loss, (IS) really effective? Here's WHY? Many scientific works indeed attempt to demonstrate one of the virtues recognized for centuries as a grandmother's remedy. By controlling hunger, consuming it causes a feeling of satiety, all thanks to the malic acids it contains and its main component, pectin. The acid contained in apple cider vinegar helps stimulate the basal metabolism . The body actually burns more fat when apple cider vinegar has been absorbed. In addition, it prevents the absorption of starch by the body. Apple cider vinegar prevents bloating sensations after certain meals and thus helps us keep a flat stomach and get a chocolate wafer  by targeting abdominal fat. Its poor energy value - it contains less than 15 kilocalories per 100 grams - and its low glycemic index make it possible to season our dishes without overdoing it. In fact, foods with a high glycemic index have the disadvantage of raising blood sugar levels, which will eventually turn into fat. It is therefore the ideal companion for those who want to get rid of a few unwanted pounds . Not every dietitian will recommend it to you. It is therefore part of the family of ""fat-burning foods"" which help to refine our silhouette! So forget about appetite suppressants and other lozenges supposed to make you lose pounds, this slimming ally is completely natural! {For optimal efficiency, choose a vinegar of very good quality, organic and artisanal if possible!} What's the best way to use apple cider vinegar for weight loss? Many believe that drinking apple cider vinegar throughout the day or replacing certain meals are good ways to reach your ideal weight. However, vinegar is not an appetite suppressant and does not fill the stomach. Then, be careful not to abuse it and not to drink it pure , the vinegar, being acidic, could damage the walls of the stomach and cause ulcers as well as heartburn. {For this reason, it is not recommended for people suffering from gastritis and prone to ulcers.} Finally, know that drinking vinegar alone is not enough to lose weight. So it's not about drinking vinegar and keeping bad eating habits on the side. Its effectiveness also depends on a balanced diet. This is why we advise you to follow the advice of a dietitian or naturopath in parallel. Its basics being recalled, here are 3 ways to consume apple cider vinegar. First, it is advisable to consume 2 to 3 spoons of vinegar diluted in a 25 cl glass of lukewarm water , to drink preferably half an hour before meals . Lukewarm water has a greater draining effect than cold water. This method will facilitate the feeling of fullness and digestion. {Taking this mixture as is on an empty stomach, upon waking, will activate your digestive system before the first meal.} You can, however, add a spoon of honey to it for flavor, or baking soda to reduce the feeling of acidity. Another solution to counteract the acidity is to add a touch of bitterness with orange peel and a few drops of freshly squeezed orange juice. Another effective method is to dilute 3 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar in chamomile tea. Likewise, this preparation should be drunk approximately 30 minutes before each meal. We end with another way of consuming, and the simplest: apple cider vinegar can be used as the main seasoning in your meals. Vinegar alone can spice up your salads, so there's no need to mix it with oil to make a sauce. For a touch of originality, make a vinaigrette made from apple cider vinegar. For example, you can mix the equivalent of two tablespoons of mustard with two tablespoons of honey, chopped garlic and two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. Add salt and pepper. This is delicious! If you do not manage to get rid of the oil in your sauces, here is a recipe for slimming sauce Two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar a tablespoon of olive oil: *A little lemon *a little salt *A little pepper *a minced clove (Mix all these ingredients and add a little water if you want more quantity.)

How long should you follow an apple cider vinegar cure to lose weight? The effectiveness of this slimming drink can be seen after 3 months of treatment , combined with a healthy lifestyle and a good diet. The method should therefore be followed a few weeks before noticing the effects. Patience! How many pounds can we hope to lose with this cure? It all depends on the eating and sports habits that accompany it. Without changing your habits, the average weight loss is around 3 kilos in 6 months. Combined with a balanced diet and eliminating fat from your diet, the weight loss generated is around 3 kilos per month, and this number rises to 3 kg per week when this diet is combined with a sporting activity. Cider vinegar, wine, balsamic vinegar… what's the difference? Apple cider vinegar is produced in the same way as wine vinegar, in oak barrels. It is in fact the fermentation of apple cider, of which the yeast bacteria, exposed to the air, produce the acids and other components of this liquid. Just like other vinegars, it contains acetic acid which promotes fat burning and boosts basal metabolism and prevents starch absorption. What differentiates it from other vinegars is that it is obtained from apple . Now the apple is a fruit whose slimming properties are known. It contains pectin, a molecule which, by trapping fat, will easily achieve the feeling of satiety. Which apple cider vinegar to choose for this type of diet? It is recommended to use ecological and all-natural apple cider vinegar . Indeed, the acidity obtained by natural fermentation is the best for the organism. So choose organic vinegar from a natural cycle. The variety of these organic apples used in this class of vinegar does not in fact undergo chemical treatment. It is also recommended that the vinegar used be aged in oak barrels and unpasteurized , not containing sulphites. Ideal for dieting. You will thus benefit to the best of the virtues of apple cider vinegar. Target the loss of fat stored in the belly: There are slimming herbal teas in stores containing cider vinegar, tea and honey.

20,"Is it genuine that If you quit eathing sugar, you will lose fat quickly?",health-fitness," Need enduring energy? Less gut fat? More youthful looking skin? Here's all the inspiration you require to part ways with the sweet stuff. Kicking a sugar propensity is testing—in any event, for the most solid willed among us. It's just plain obvious, research has discovered that sugar fools your mind into needing increasingly more of it. However, there's uplifting news. A little pleasantness is OK—accentuation on little. The American Heart Association suggests close to six teaspoons of added sugar a day for ladies. Additionally alright: the sugar found in entire food sources like products of the soil, says Kimber Stanhope, PhD, a dietary researcher at the University of California, Davis. ""These normally happening sugars come bundled with useful for-you nutrients, minerals, fiber, and different supplements."" But on the off chance that you can dial back your admission of added sugar, she says, you'll begin to pile up some astonishing medical advantages. Truth be told, the advantages of the less-sugar life are so acceptable, they may help persuade you to attempt to cut it (generally) out. Say bye-bye to stomach fat Everybody realizes that a day by day sweet soft drink propensity can pack on the pounds, particularly in the belly territory. However, what you may not understand are the potential dangers related with stomach fat. Sweet passage spikes your glucose, setting off a surge of insulin through your body, which after some time urges fat to aggregate around your center. Known as instinctive fat, these fat cells somewhere down in the midsection are the most dangerous kind since they produce adipokines and fat chemicals—substance instigators that movement to your organs and veins, where they welcome on aggravation that can add to conditions like coronary illness and disease. In this way, when you cut back on pop and pastries, you'll begin decreasing gut fat and the risky conditions that accompany it. Drop additional pounds Expanded insulin levels don't simply add pounds to your stomach; they put fat cells everywhere on your body into calorie-stockpiling overdrive. It's simply not such a wonder you need occurring in your body."" Replacing refined carbs and sweet food sources in your eating routine with sound fats helps keep your insulin stable, he says, so less calories get put away as fat. Accordingly, ""hunger diminishes, digestion accelerates, and you can shed pounds with less battle."""

2,Do you really want to lose weight now?,health-fitness," It seems that everybody wants to lose weight unless they are as lean as a chalkboard. Hopefully, my weight loss story will inspire you to achieve your own weight loss goal. For readers who do not know, I am a physician—a pediatrician, precisely. I’ll just point out the obvious: even physicians can get themselves into medical troubles. So, on a visit to my own doctor 10 years ago, I was diagnosed with hypertension because my blood pressure was elevated at 140/90. My doctor wanted to prescribe drugs for my condition, but I quietly disagreed. I had a plan of my own. At that point, I weighed 183 pounds. For a man who stands at 5’ 8”, that gave me a BMI of 27 and put me in the overweight category. I went to work because truly, challenges are the mother of actions. I did some research and found with every 1 pound of weight loss, the upper number in a blood pressure reading could go down by 1 point. A ten-pound weight loss could lower an upper number by 10 points. “Let us do it,” I said to myself. So, within 6 months, I lost thirty pounds. And as a result, my blood pressure was as normal as a teenage boy. My looks changed, too. My cheeks went from puffy to sculpted. My friends and family were both excited and worried. I assured them I was okay, and that I did it for my health. I want my readers to know that I made easy lifestyle changes that did not demand much of my time. For example, instead of frying my eggs, I boiled them. Instead of eating out, I made my own food. Plus, I swapped beer and soda for water and more water. I used the holidays as another occasion to eat healthily and passed on junk food. I traded salt for herbs to season my food. And these little everyday changes made a big overall impact on my weight and my blood pressure. We all have our different stories, our different life journeys, but I believe lessons can be learned from my experience. I was so happy about my accomplishment that I wrote a book about it, and I encourage you to pick it up. People spend thousands of dollars enrolling in gyms they will never attend and exercise equipment they will never use. But $10 spent on my book could be one of the wisest investments you’ve ever made. Why this book you may ask? Because it is easy to read, full of good advice, and written by someone who actually lost thirty pounds. Disclaimer: Please consult your doctor if you suffer from high blood pressure. High blood pressure has many reasons, and losing weight may not cure your own hypertension."

They are-- 	Ischemic stroke 	Hemorrhagic stroke 	Transient ischemic attack (Mini-Stroke) Ischemic Stroke •	Most of the strokes are ischemic strokes (87%) •	When the blood flow through the artery (which supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain) becomes blocked or obstructed then an ischemic stroke happens •	Blood clots often makes the blockages in the artery and those blockings lead to ischemic strokes •	There are a couple of ways by which the artery can be blocked or obstructed Hemorrhagic Stroke •	Affected brain cells stop working •	When an artery in the brain leaks blood, then hemorrhagic stroke happens •	The leaked blood puts too much pressure on the brain cells, which damages them •	Sometimes, the bleeding forms a hematoma that directly damages the brain cells •	It can also cause swelling that puts pressure on the surrounding brain tissues •	Affected brain cells stop their working There are two (2) types of hemorrhagic strokes: Intracerebral hemorrhage Intracerebral hemorrhage is the most common type of hemorrhagic stroke It occurs when an artery in the brain bursts and causes harm to the tissues Subarachnoid hemorrhage It is a less common type of hemorrhagic stroke Between the brain and the thin tissues (that covers the brain), bleeding occurs Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) •	It (TIA) is a short-lived stroke •	It is just like ischemic strokes •	Blood clots often cause Transient Ischemic Attack •	It is a warning sign of the future stroke •	It is a medical emergency, like a major or severe stroke •	It is caused by the loss of blood supply •	It causes a loss of function of the body •	Emergency care is needed •	Most people refer it as TIA or ""mini-stroke"" Risk Factors of Stroke •	High blood pressure •	High cholesterol •	Smoking •	Diabetes •	Increasing of age •	Heart valve defects •	Salt •	Saturated fats •	Trans fats •	Unhealthy diet •	Inactivity •	Consumption of alcohol •	Heart disorders (like- coronary artery disease) •	Using tobacco •	Previous stroke or TIA •	Enlarged heart chambers •	Irregular heartbeats •	Sickle cell disease Causes of Stroke: •	Temporary blockage in the artery that leads or connects to the brain •	Blood clotting •	Blood not flowing to certain parts of the brain •	Atherosclerosis •	Plaque that is built up on the walls of a blood vessel •	Burst or leaking of the blood vessels •	Arteriovenous Malformation •	High blood pressure (hypertension) •	High cholesterol •	Atrial fibrillation Tests to diagnosis of Stroke •	Blood tests •	MRI and CT scan •	EKG (electrocardiogram) •	Cerebral angiogram •	Carotid ultrasound •	Echocardiogram Treatments for Stroke Treatment depends on the types of stroke— TIA and Ischemic stroke Antiplatelet and anticoagulants Aspirin is generally a first line of defense against stroke damage These drugs should be taken within 24 to 48 hours after beginning of the stroke symptoms Clot breaking drugs Thrombolytic drugs are used to break up blood clots in the brain’s arteries These drugs stop the stroke and reduce the damage of the brain Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) Alteplase IV r-tPA Mechanical Thrombectomy In this procedure, doctor inserts a catheter into a large blood vessel inside of the patient’s head A device is used to pull the clot out of the vessel The surgery will be more successful if it’s performed 6 to 24 hours after the beginning of the stroke Surgery Sometimes surgery is performed to remove the blood clot and plaques from the arteries. This can be done with a catheter. Doctor can open an artery to remove the blockage if the clot is too large. Hemorrhagic stroke Coiling Doctors install a coil-like device in the area where the artery wall is weak. It reduces bleeding. Clamping Surgeon can place a small clamp at the base of the aneurysm to prevent the additional bleeding. It prevents a possible broken blood vessel or new bleeding. Surgery If an aneurysm has burst, doctor can suggest to do surgery to clip the aneurysm and prevent additional bleeding. Craniotomy may be needed to relieve the pressure on the brain after a severe stroke. Medications Doctors may prescribe drugs that can reduce blood pressure, prevent blood vessel constriction, lower the pressure in the brain. How to Prevent Stroke? •	Stop smoking •	Do exercise regularly •	Take a healthy diet •	Stop to take alcohol •	Control the high blood pressure •	Control your diabetes •	Take fruits and vegetables regularly •	Try to avoid the illicit drugs •	Control the blood sugar levels •	Control cholesterol levels •	Try to maintain an ideal body weight •	Try to become physically active •	Take your prescribed medicine"
4,Easy WaxOff Ear Cleaning Spiral Review,health-fitness," Our body has given has sufficient means to protect us from problems which we may face in our daily life’s. Ear wax is useful and if excessive can be a problem for our ears. It is a liquid which is secreted by cerumen glands which are present only in the ear canals. If it is not treated it can cause deafness, irritation and soreness to your ear which is not at all pleasant. It is an 'in-house production' and has to be cleared on a regular basis. As soon as there is accumulation of wax, problems can follow. Symptoms of having ear wax Continuous pain in your ears Difficulty in hearing Happen to hear a ringing noise in your ears A feeling as your ears has been blocked due to something Problems with ear wax Ear wax can block the ear which can disturb or reduce the hearing capacity The bacteria is trapped behind the ear wax leading to infection with graver problems There would a short period of deafness while bathing or swimming Some of the methods to remove the ear wax *Ear syringe can be used in your ears to squirt warm water to irrigate the accumulated wax *Use of olive oil in your ears can smoothen the ear wax to be removed easily *Avoid using ear buds which can push ear wax inside rather than removing it *You can also use baby oil which has to warmed up till room temperature and should be done at least twice a day *Avoid picking or poking your ear canal as this may damage your ears *By going to a specialist *You can also use Vaseline which has to be pasted to the outer edges of the ear opening and be cleaned the next day. My Story About Ear Wax Sometimes i don't understand a lot in life, like why people have a television addiction, why some people are afraid of flying, and I don't understand why anyone would eat asparagus. Ear wax is another small thing in life that I don't really understand. I've heard people say that ear wax is for our good, that it is protection for our bodies and that it is natural to have, but I still cannot understand why ear wax really exists or how I am supposed to feel about it. I find ear wax kind of gross and cannot bear to see it in my ears. My hubby is a doctor, so I have had many conversations with her about ear wax and about how I should be dealing with it. She always laughs at me and tells me that I am making a really big deal out of something that is not supposed to be a big deal at all. She tells me that all I need to do is clean my ears out consistently and I won't have a problem with ear wax. I guess my problem is that I hate having ear wax, but I also hate having to clean my ears. My hubby tried this new method (Easy WaxOff ear cleaning tool) with me a few months ago. I was very frightful going into it, but it actually turned out great. I couldn't really feel anything happening except that the inside of my ear felt really warm. When it finished, my hubby showed me how much ear wax that the Easy WaxOff had collected. I was completely disgusted even though I knew that it was very normal. Easy Wax Offer features a spiral silicone tip that consumers can handle entirely on their own. The wax can be removed by gently turning the device in the ear and pulling it away from the eardrum. Dry cotton can irritate the ear canal, while the soft tip won't. Its tip can be cleaned with soap and water after each use, so you can reuse it again and again. It's even safe enough for people of all ages to use it without having any risk, helping consumers take care of their own body and the body of their loved ones."
5,Why Do Health Insurers Require Prior Authorization?,health-fitness," Health Insurers and Prior Authorization Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of prior authorization Medical Utilization Management “This procedure will require prior authorization.” Words that no patient or healthcare provider wants to hear when they are ready to proceed with a doctor-approved procedure for a medical matter. However, it’s one of the utilization management tools that insurance companies have fostered to decide if specific prescribed procedures, services and medications are medically required or whether there is an equivalent useful treatment existing for the patient. Healthcare.gov defines prior authorization as “approval from a health plan that may be required before you get a service or fill a prescription in order for the services or prescription to be covered by your plan.” Importantly, services (medications, imaging studies, etc.) that need prior authorizations require healthcare providers to acquire consent from the patient’s health insurance before the cost of the service is covered by the company. The process can be lengthy and can frequently put off patients getting the care they need. These roadblocks can often trigger frustration and apprehension for doctors, hospitals and patients while adding to the mountain of paperwork doctors and hospitals must complete. What are the effects of prior authorizations on the medical industry? It’s like being on an un-merry-go-round Truth is, one of the more irritating tasks for physicians and other healthcare providers is securing prior authorizations for matters such as testing and prescriptions. In the eyes of some, prior authorizations are not anything more than insurance companies injecting themselves into the provider’s decision-making activity, generating glitches for both providers and patients. Moreover, prior authorizations have produced a restraint on the revenue stream of many healthcare provider organizations. If a treatment procedure doesn’t get authorized, the provider can’t continue with the service. In some instances, such interruptions bring about a loss of revenue since the patient ultimately decides to proceed without the treatment or because such circumstances compel additional negotiations before the insurance company will sanction the procedure. The prior authorization process is often further muddled by a mixture of factors: Plenty of mandatory steps, each presenting the possibility for interruptions and mistakes. Involvement by many people including patients, healthcare professionals, and the patient’s health insurance company. Absence of standards, especially when it comes to payer policies. Shifting payer rules that must be continuously reviewed and amended. Thousands of payers and health plans all competing for a rapid response. Manual assessment of prior authorization requests and medical charts by clinicians. Depending on the complexity of the prior authorization application, the volume of manual work required, and the prerequisites specified by the insurance company, a prior authorization can take anywhere from a single day to a month to process. The AMA’s Prior Authorization Physician Survey disclosed that 26 percent of healthcare providers reported waiting three days or more for a decision. The AMA found, on average, a medical practice will complete 29.1 prior authorization requests per physician per week that take 14.6 hours to process. About half of the requests are for medical services, while the other half are for prescriptions. According to another AMA survey, 75 percent of physicians participating reported that issues related to the prior authorization process can cause patients to abandon their recommended course of treatment. In the same survey, 28 percent reported the prior authorization has led to a serious adverse event for a patient in their care. Says Matthew Hahn, MD, author of Distracted: How Regulations are Destroying the Practice of Medicine and Preventing True Health-Care Reform, “The more hoops a doctor or practice has to jump through to obtain care for their patients, the less likely that care will take place.” He adds, “The burden created by prior authorizations is extremely taxing to physicians and medical practices, creating minutes to hours of work just to obtain basic care for their patients. This translates into added administrative costs for practices, and incredible distraction from patient care, which is difficult even under optimal conditions.” What can be done about prior authorizations to improve revenue? Some physicians who have taken it upon themselves to streamline the prior authorization process have suggested that healthcare practices need to standardize their in-office procedures for processing such authorizations. Adds one such physician, “The real challenge is knowing which services will require prior authorization. We realize that it’s going to be an administrative burden, but if we can approach it as a team so that the providers are not completely overburdened, it makes it seem more manageable.” There are also technologies that can help. Says one healthcare professional, a strategy would be to take advantage of any electronic or automated processes a payer may have for receiving requests and returning determinations. Physicians must also communicate effectively with patients concerning prior authorizations and it’s usually best to tackle the situation proactively rather than wait until a treatment is denied. Once it’s understood that a prior authorization is required it’s important for physicians to educate the patient on the process and the possibility that the authorization might be disallowed. Another physician tells us, “Patients need to understand, up front, that prior authorizations take time, and it could mean a delay in care.” Additionally, make sure the administrative staff are knowledgeable in the coding requirements for the various payers. From time to time, denials take place when a physician or technician enters data without complying with the coding requirements of the insurer. Lastly, the staff should reexamine the prior authorization applications before submission to steer clear of errors. How can a coding and billing firm such as Medwave help with the prior authorization process? Studies show that over 80 percent of reimbursement claims are denied because the healthcare provider did not get the appropriate prior authorization, or the application included errors. Any errors contained in the prior authorization form, from egregious to trivial, may flag it for a denial. It could be that two different specialists both ordered a CT scan for dissimilar purposes, but the insurance company won’t approve both unless a medical necessity is indicated. Or it could be as innocent as a number on a patient’s health ID card may be transposed, a middle initial might be keyed inaccurately, or an address may be half finished. Such a healthcare provider can slash these errors by employing a coding and billing company to help expedite the approval process. Medwave provides a total medical billing solution that can be included with your electronic health records to aid you to better manage your income stream. This makes it possible for healthcare providers to submit claims more promptly, acquire prior authorization quicker so you can provide care straightaway and, of course, get paid sooner."
6,"Is it true that if you stop eating sugar, you will lose fat rapidly?",health-fitness," Want lasting energy? Less belly fat? Younger-looking skin? Here's all the motivation you need to break up with the sweet stuff. Kicking a sugar habit is challenging—even for the most strong-willed among us. See, research has found that sugar tricks your brain into wanting more and more of it. But there's good news. A little sweetness is OK—emphasis on little. The American Heart Association recommends no more than six teaspoons of added sugar a day for women. Also okay: the sugar found in whole foods like fruits and veggies, says Kimber Stanhope, Ph.D., a nutritional biologist at the University of California, Davis. ""These naturally occurring sugars come packaged with good-for-you vitamins, minerals, fiber, and other nutrients."" But if you can dial back your intake of added sugar, she says, you'll start to rack up some amazing health benefits. In fact, the perks of the less-sugar life are so good, they may help motivate you to try to cut it (mostly) out. Say bye-bye to abdominal fat Everyone knows that a daily sugary soda habit can pack on pounds, especially in the tummy area. But what you may not realize are the potential risks associated with abdominal fat. Sugary fare spikes your blood sugar, triggering a flood of insulin through your body, which over time encourages fat to accumulate around your middle. Known as visceral fat, these fat cells deep in the abdomen are the riskiest kind because they generate adipokines and adipose hormones—chemical troublemakers that travel to your organs and blood vessels, where they bring on the inflammation that can contribute to conditions like heart disease and cancer. So, when you cut back on pop and desserts, you'll start reducing belly fat and the dangerous conditions that come with it. Drop extra pounds Increased insulin levels don't just add pounds to your stomach; they put fat cells all over your body into calorie-storage overdrive. It's just not the sort of miracle you want happening in your body."" Replacing refined carbs and sugary foods in your diet with healthy fats helps keep your insulin stable, he says, so fewer calories get stored as fat. As a result, ""hunger decreases, metabolism speeds up, and you can lose weight with less struggle."""
7,Terpene Infused CBD Crystals: Some frequently asked questions,health-fitness," With deregulation and increased interest, the CBD industry has seen a remarkable explosion in ingenuity over recent years. Terpene infused CBD crystals have developed into one of the leading CBD products around today. For those just getting started with CBD, concentrates may seem like something left to the enthusiasts, but CBD crystals can supply some wonderful physical and mental benefits when infused with all-natural terpene profiles. When it comes to CBD, quality matters. The way that your CBD has been extracted will have a huge impact on your experience with the compound. A 100% hemp extract that uses CO2 extraction will ensure that all of those delightful terpenes make their way into your CBD and imbue your experience with the life-changing aromatherapeutic benefits. What are terpenes? Terpenes are a huge part of the natural world, giving plants, fruits and herbs their aromas and tastes. There are over 20,000 different terpenes and if you’ve ever peeled an orange before, you’ll have encountered pungency of terpenes. While they may have gorgeous tastes and smells, terpenes have also been shown to provide unique medicinal benefits. Most people overlook terpenes, choosing instead to focus on CBD and THC. But the standard of terpene in your CBD product can have an incredible impact on the quality of your CBD experience. While many may not have heard of terpenes, the growth in the CBD industry has caused an increase in interest. When CBD has been filtered or distilled and then purified by 99%, the average hemp enthusiast would make the understandable mistake of thinking that as a positive. In fact, a 99% purity removes terpenes from the CBD and results in a tasteless and odourless product. When you have those wonderful terpenes missing, the desired ‘entourage’ effect won’t materialise to nearly the same degree. Some studies have even shown that 50% CBD extract is even more effective than 99% CBD. What is the entourage effect? The entourage effect was created by a prominent CBD researcher name Raphael Mechoulam. The term was used to describe the relationship between cannabinoids, terpenoids and flavonoids. Terpenes have been found to obstruct certain cannabinoid receptors, all while helping cannabinoids bind. Due to this, terpenes play a direct role in how CBD is used in our endocannabinoid systems. If you don’t have the best terpenes in your CBD, your CBD isn’t going to be as effective. With that in mind, terpene infused crystals are the perfect solution. What is in terpene infused CBD crystals? Companies such as HighKind prioritise high-quality methods of extraction to ensure that these terpenes are the best they can be. When CBD crystals are created, the concentrate and terpene profiles are specifically designed to copy the effects and flavour of the strains they were based on. These CBD crystals are also non-psychoactive and contain 0% THC. What are the effects fo CBD crystals? As CBD is entirely non-psychoactive, crystals don’t cause you to have the normal ‘high’ associated with THC cannabis. However, terpene infused CBD crystals supply you with a calming feeling that helps to rid your mind of stress, worry and anxiety. That relaxed feeling is totally unique to CBD, and with premium products, it can feel even more effective. The non-intoxicating element of CBD crystals allows you to be fully functional while staying in a more peaceful state of mind. Whether you’re a CBD beginner or intermediate, delving into the world of terpene infused CBD crystals could have a massive impact on your mind. Make sure to buy from a premium brand and open yourself up to the world of CBD concentrates."
8,How depression can ruin your life,health-fitness," What Is Depression? Depression is a disorder that affects you personally and everything you do daily in life. When it sets in, recovery is not easy. Depression brings you to a low state of mind that takes time before normalcy sets in again. One can indirectly compare depression with sadness. If you are sad, everything around you looks uninteresting. You don’t find joy in living again. The same applies to depression. It is a state of mind that can affect the body because your mind and body are interconnected and dependent on one another. When your mind is not right, your mood changes which affects your mental capabilities. Being a chain reaction, your low mental capabilities invariably affect your physical health. The by-product of depression’s effect on physical health is a gradual process. One might not even notice any changes in one’s life at the beginning. Are You Depressed? How do you know if you’re depressed? Some confuse being sad with depression. Sadness is a bit similar, but it is a short-term condition. One can easily get rid of sadness and be happy within a short time. But depression is directly the opposite. If the feeling lingers for more than two weeks, you likely have depression. Some other symptoms include: •	Being sad or having an empty feeling for two weeks or more. •	The act of feeling hopeless or helpless. •	Lack of interest in things generally. •	Experiencing changes in appetite. •	Experiencing occasional nausea, headaches, chronic pain. •	Experiencing changes in sleeping schedule. •	Isolation from friends and family. •	Concentration becoming difficult. •	Always anxious, and complaining of been stressed. •	Frequent irritability or anger. •	Looks constantly fatigued. •	Thinking of committing suicide. We have a book that can get you out of depression. Read it. It is normal to see People with depression have trouble maintaining a normal work schedule. They might even find it difficult to fulfill any social obligation given to them. This might be due to the inability to concentrate which affects your memory. You can’t be organized when you’re in a state of depression, and making decisions becomes difficult. Some people take temporary solace in alcohol or drugs, while others in food. Some gain weight when they are depressed, while others lose weight. All these might increase the instances of reckless or abusive behavior if not tackled in time. As nobody wants to be sad, so nobody wants to be depressed. During the state of depression, we lose a lot in any area you can think of. That is the reason why it is good to seek help any time one is going through it. How Does Depression Affect You? What you do daily complies with what you do over-time. If depression can affect you daily, it will affect you as long as you’re still depressed. If you’re a business person, it affects your financial level. It does not limit its disadvantages on how you sleep, eat, your education, career, your relationships, health, and concentration. It can also lead you to alcoholism or drug addiction. Here are ways depression can affect us and ruin our life: Digestive System: Digestive system helps our body in the area of food digestion, and assimilation of the digested food nutrients into our bloodstream. When depression sets in, it negatively affects our appetite. Some people tend to overeat, while others have a low appetite. Those that overeat might likely develop obesity because of weight gain. It can even lead to hyperglycemia if the appetizing food is not a balanced diet. Hyperglycemia is a high blood sugar level in the bloodstream. And if it is not controlled, it can lead to diabetics. Depression symptoms of low appetite might result in either malnutrition or hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is a condition where you have a low sugar level in the body. It is also possible to experience stomach aches, cramps, and constipation when you’re depressed. Cardiovascular/Immune System: Depression is a condition that prompts mental stress. Mental stress affects the brain and causes stress hormones to be released. This stress hormone narrows the blood vessel, thereby restricting blood flow. Since blood is the transport system of the body, and there is a restriction to its function, other parts of the body will be affected. This restriction of functionality caused by the stress hormone can be damaging to your cardiovascular system and can lead to heart disease. Blood pressure tends to become high with increased pulse rate. Over-reaction of these stress hormones for a long time can also result in a weakened immune system. The immune system helps the body to fight any strange body. If it’s low, then opportunistic infection sets in. Sleep Disorders: Depression most times leads to sleep disorders. Your sleeping pattern is impaired. You might experience difficulty in falling asleep, and sometimes, difficulty in staying asleep. This condition is called insomnia. Insomnia and depression are interrelated, and insomnia is very common among depressed patients. Not refreshing sleep is also common with depressed people. Memory Loss: Memory loss in a depressed person can be due to the stress hormone that is released into the system during this state. It constricts the flow of blood in blood vessels. The circulation of blood is impaired. Less blood reaches the brain through the capillaries. This is a chain reaction that results in temporary memory loss and is linked closely to your emotional and mental state. When your body is in a state of stress or anxiety or being depressed, it will be difficult to maintain focus or think clearly. Seeking Care The first step in seeking care is to talk to your primary healthcare provider. Your doctor is trained and equipped to help you determine the best care you need to come back to living happy, healthy life again."
9,7 Reasons Why Infertility can ruin Your Marriage.,health-fitness," Marriage is the union between two parties i.e. man and woman. Children on the other hand supposed to be one of the products of marriage and not marriage by itself. But depending on the mindset of the couples, some did not see it that way. As human beings are different, so their purpose in marriage is different. The coming in of a child according to some couples boasts the relationship and it also brings them closer together. It also enhances some couples to have a joint focus on how to keep the new arrival to the family union. But for some, they might be married for years without children, and it does not disturb their relationship. Also, some prefer not to have children at all during their marriage. This is agreed upon even before getting married. It all depends on the goal the marriage wants to achieve. We are interested in pointing ways to why infertility might run marriages for those who want to have children. The cultural pressures in our society make new moms and dads ignore their marriages act because of infertility, especially if it lasts for a long time. Infertility itself creates tension in an individual, not to talk of your spouse. Here are 7 ways why Infertility can ruin your marriage. 1: Not Protecting Each Other When Infertility creeps into a family, especially the newly wedded couples who want children, the unexpected hearing starts coming in. Already tension has been built inside you because of your expectant. Family and friends are naturally also expecting to see changes. Good friends might come politely and ask questions, while others will not. Some family and friends might decide to say it at your back, thereby labeling you barren. Some of these words you and your spouse will hear others you will not hear. What are you doing with the negative words you hear? Is it bringing you down, or motivating you? The cause of infertility might be either way. How would you answer those awkward questions from families and friends? How would we defend sensitive comments from strangers? If you don’t agree on protecting each other because of sensitive comments, it would hurt your spouse. Care and caution have to be taken so that such negative comments shouldn’t lead to divorce. 2: When Desperation Creep In Infertility comes with various thoughts in one’s mind. You think that time waits for no one. You think, “will I be able to ever be fertile”? If you’re a woman, you think about whether you can ever carry a baby in your womb. The thought of when the treatment will last will always come into your mind. Anytime you see children playing, it touches your mind. All these forms of thought can prompt one to be desperate. When desperation comes in, tension also sets in. Tension because of the underlining factors of desperation can lead to being frustrated that one might put the whole blame on your spouse. Continuous frustration and blame can lead to divorce. 3: Goals in Marriage Are Affected Some couple’s goals in marriage are to live together as husband and wife and also to have children. While some just prefer living together without children. Children are supposed to be the blessing of marriage and not marriage itself. What if the blessing does not come, how do the couples manage their married life? Nobody wants to be sad, and nobody wants to be infertile. Depending on the couple’s agreement before marriage determines how they will cope if children do not come in. Supposing you have agreed with your spouse before getting married to have children, and unfortunately, it is not forthcoming. This can split the marriage. 4: It Stops Romance When infertility creeps into a marriage, the joy of the marriage has been impaired. The genuine closeness of the spouse will not be like before. Each party is tensed up and anxious. Romancing which is an act that comes naturally has been withdrawn. It comes any time you have been programmed to have sex because of getting pregnant. Sex becomes mechanical, the same as romance. Couples can overlook this act thinking that it will soon be over. But continuous performance can lead to frustration on any of the spouses and ultimately divorce. 5: Communication Breakdown Communication breakdown is very common with couples that can’t manage infertility in their marriage, especially if they need a child. After much medication and patience, while treating infertility, either of the couples might decide to be negative in his/her approach to solving the issue. In the process of not hurting each other, either of the party might decide to be silent about it. This can lead to communication breakdown and if not handled well with maturity, can also prompt divorce. The need of having a child after series of medical help has been undergone naturally brings depression. The changes in your mindset when you’re depressed lead to tension. Before the arrival of every monthly menstrual cycle, both parties will be expecting something to happen. Tension even makes it harder for the woman to get pregnant. Tension leads to irritability and with any small misunderstanding, any of the party might flare up. The end product might be a probable divorce. Infertility that leads to divorce is not the best, but do you blame them ?"
10,Why Rheumatoid Arthritis Is Common In Women?,health-fitness," Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that occurs when the body's immune system attacks and damages the joints and, sometimes, other organs. This is unlike the most common arthritis like osteoarthritis which is a specific disease of the cartilage in joints. RA is a chronic and inflammatory disease that causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function in the joints and other areas of the body. RA often presents itself in a symmetrical pattern, meaning that it attacks both the left and right sides of the joint involved. If one knee or hand is involved, the other one will be attacked too. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) seems to affect more women than men probably because of the actions of female hormones in their body mechanism. Since women’s role in the reproductive area requires some specific hormone to enhance it to functions properly, and this type of hormone is quite different from the male fertility hormone. These play a major role in the onset of the disease. Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms occur mostly the same way in men and women, but the differences lie in when, how, and why they first appear. One common feature of RA is that the symptoms come and go. At the time people with this condition might experience flare-ups when their symptoms are worse. They can also experience remission when the disease is less severe. The genesis of RA is not too clear, but there are noted histories of environmental and genetic risk factors which can be overweight and smoking. Although hormonal factors also contribute to around 75 percent of people who have RA are women. Some set of people relate old age to RA, but this is not the case. According to the statistics given by Arthritis Foundation, the average onset of RA is between the ages of 30 and 60 years old, and children can also get it. It is easier to diagnose RA early in women than men. Women can be diagnosed as early as when they are in their mid-30s and then again after the mid-40s. The symptoms of RA can spread around many different parts of the body if not tackled in time. Why Is Rheumatoid Arthritis More Common In Women? Rheumatoid Arthritis is a more common phenomenon that occurs in women more than it is in men.  There is no clear-cut scientific reason why this is so, but some school of thoughts refers to the nature of women and their role in reproduction. Out of 27 million Americans with osteoarthritis, about 60 percent of them are women. Age factor plays a role when you talk of arthritis in general. It is common for men to be affected from the age of 55. The number of women of the same age surpasses the number of men. And from 55 upwards, the women with the symptoms of arthritis are on the upward movement. But rheumatoid arthritis which is an autoimmune disease can occur earlier in both sexes. RA affects the joints mainly, but other parts are also affected. Before the menstrual flow of a woman, during the flow, and after the flow, there are always hormonal changes in the system. Also, hormonal changes that occurred before and after giving birth can affect a woman’s risk of developing RA. In most women, there is a link between hormonal changes and the onset of RA. Since hormones are agents of actions in our body. Their balance maintenance is very important for good functionality. Hormones are complex chemical structures in the body, and what triggers their role in RA remains unclear. Depending on the level of hormone balance in each one and the level of body defense tolerance in fighting infections might determine the onset in each individual. Here is what can influence Rheumatoid Arthritis in women compared to men: The blood volume increases and the packed cell volume decreases. The immunity level might also decrease depending on the prenatal care. And when the immunity level decreases, it might give chance to any opportunistic infection to set in. Postpartum: Postpartum is a stage women go through after giving birth. Some school of thought believes that some women tend to develop RA in the first year after giving birth. This might be due to the rapid change in hormone levels in the body at this time, especially if postpartum medication, hygiene, and personal care are not adhered to. Breastfeeding: Full breastfeeding deactivates and inhibits the fertility hormone from being active. If done for up to 1 year may decrease the risk of developing RA. But some rheumatologist experts are divided on this issue. Menopause: Menopause is a condition when a woman stops to see her monthly flow. Before menopause, hormonal changes occur in women and they complain of different kinds of symptoms. The level of estrogen tends to decline after the age of 40, and women have a higher risk of developing RA after 40. Some experience early or late menopause, but those who experienced theirs early tends to be at more risk of having RA Endometriosis: Endometriosis occurs when endometrial tissue grows or is present in areas of the body other than the uterine cavity. Rheumatologist expert relates some female-specific hormones to be involved in stimulating the growth of this lining. Women who have endometriosis are also linked with low immunity and may be more at risk of developing RA. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): PCOS is known to affect and changes the hormone levels in the body, thereby causing irregular menstrual periods and fertility problems. It can also increase the risk of developing RA, but the actual link is complicated. Hormone medication: Fertility hormones are supposed to be balanced. Any case of low or high will affect the fertility of the woman. Some hormones are used to treat various conditions relating to women. For example, anti-estrogen medication can help treat infertility, breast cancer, and osteoporosis after menopause. It can also increase a woman’s risk of developing RA depending on the dosage used. Conclusion: All the above are likely ways of developing RA which is specific to women. Women are unique, and all these conditions listed above are unique to women. Men also develop RA, but the frequency is high in women. It is not common to see a man with RA at the early age of say 30-40, but for women, it is not so with them."
11,"Lumbar Hemilaminectomy - Types, Goals & Success Rate of Spine Surgery",health-fitness," Overview A lumbar hemilaminectomy surgery is a minimally invasive surgical procedure performed to widen the spinal cord by removing a part of one or both laminae on a vertebra. It helps patients in alleviating neck and back pain. Here in this blog, we will discuss the types, causes, and steps of performing hemilaminectomy. Summary ●	Hemilaminectomy surgery is performed to remove lamina that may get thickened because of a traumatic injury or degeneration. ●	The most common hemilaminectomy and microdiscectomy types include bilateral hemilaminectomy and unilateral hemilaminectomy. ●	There may be several causes to suggest a hemilaminectomy surgery, including acute neck pain, radicular pain, and shooting leg pain due to pinched nerves in the spinal cord. ●	Lumbar hemilaminectomy recovery time depends on the type of surgery performed by the doctor. ●	Laminectomy is used to narrow the spinal canal, whereas your damaged or herniated disc is removed or repaired by the doctor in the microdiscectomy procedure. ●	Several studies suggest that 85-90% of patients with lumbar central spinal stenosis get relief from leg pain after hemilaminectomy surgery. ●	Hemilaminectomy's primary objective is to relieve neural tissue compression and improve the leg's functionality. Define Hemilaminectomy A Hemilaminectomy, also known as Laminotomy, is one of the most common back surgeries. Neck or back pain that affects routine activities may require surgery for treatment. The lamina may get thickened because of a traumatic injury or degeneration, compressing the spinal nerves leading to severe pain or disability. A hemilaminectomy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure of the spine performed by a neurosurgeon to widen the spinal cord by removing a part of one or both laminae on a vertebra. Types of Lumbar Laminectomy for Spinal Stenosis Neurosurgeons may utilize one of the following types for hemilaminectomy surgery depending upon the lamina's amount that needs to be removed: ●	Bilateral Hemilaminectomy In bilateral hemilaminectomy, both sides of the affected vertebra's lamina are removed by the surgeon. He performed this procedure with or without widening of the intervertebral foramina or removal of adjacent bone and tissue. ●	Unilateral Hemilaminectomy In unilateral hemilaminectomy, the neurosurgeon removed a part of the complete lamina with or without adjacent tissues. The surgeon may also perform unilateral hemilaminectomy by utilizing an endoscope (a small tube) that is minimally invasive and needs a smaller incision than open surgery. When You Need a Laminectomy? One of the primary reasons for having hemilaminectomy surgery is a herniated disk in the spine. Patients suffering from acute neck pain, radicular pain, numbness in legless, and shooting leg pain due to pinched nerves in the spinal cord need laminectomy. Loss of bladder control from pressure in the cervical or lumbar spine also usually requires surgery. Additionally, if conventional treatment options, including spinal injections, physical rehabilitation or physical therapy, occupational therapy, weight loss (if overweight), and smoking cessation, have failed to relieve pain, the last available option is hemilaminectomy. Comparison Between Microdiscectomy & Laminectomy Laminectomy is utilized to narrow the spinal canal for relieving the symptoms that occur due to nerve root compression. In comparison, microdiscectomy is a minimally invasive procedure used to repair or remove a damaged or herniated disc in your spine. Microdiscectomy usually takes less recovery time than a traditional discectomy and helps the patient quickly return to daily routine activities. Step-By-Step Process for Hemilaminectomy Surgery Neurosurgeons perform laminectomy surgery from the back. The patient is instructed to lie down during the whole procedure, generally on a Jackson table. A Jackson table keeps the stomach free and the hip slightly raised, recreating a standing position. During the process, the free abdomen helps prevent the blood vessel's compression and epidural bleeding throughout the surgery, while bending the hip helps the doctor better evaluate the degree of neural compression from spinal stenosis. Generally, the neuro spine surgeon performs the below-mentioned steps while performing the surgery. ●	A patient is instructed to lie in a face-down position, and general anesthesia is given to him. ●	A 2-5 inch long incision is made in the back's midline. ●	The neuro spine surgeon pulls the left and right muscles gently to get entrance to the laminae. ●	Intraoperative radiographs are utilized for identifying the exact vertebral level. ●	Now the laminae are cut or removed by the doctor depending on the condition's severity. This procedure increases the spinal canal space for the neural elements. ●	The next upper level follows the same set of steps if needed. ●	After completing all the steps, the muscles come back to their original position. If you had a minor hemilaminectomy surgery, lumbar hemilaminectomy recovery time might start within a few days or weeks. But recovery time may prolong for the patient undergoing a spinal fusion with laminectomy, i.e., two to four months. Goals of Lumbar Laminectomy Surgery The primary purpose of laminectomy surgery is to accomplish the below-mentioned goals: ●	Relieve Neural Tissue Compression The patient may experience compression in the spinal cord, spinal dura, cauda equina, and thecal sac. Neurogenic claudication (leg agony while walking or bending the spine backward) may occur due to the compression of any of these structures, usually affecting both legs. Laminectomy helps alleviate these neural tissues' compression by widening the spinal canal. ●	Improve Leg's Functionality You may have decreased mobility due to pain and weakness in one or both legs. Laminectomy helps decrease pressure on the nerves, reduces leg pain, and potentially improves the lower back and legs' functionality. It is essential to understand that hemilaminectomy's primary purpose is to treat leg pain symptoms instead of lower back pain. Patients may experience back pain even after the surgery because of the agony from the ongoing degenerating process or due to unrelated reasons that may cause nerve or spinal cord compression. Success Rate of Lumbar Laminectomy for Spinal Stenosis To relieve leg pain resulting from spinal stenosis, the most recommended neurosurgery with a high success rate and guaranteed results is a lumbar laminectomy. According to numerous studies: ●	85-90% of patients with lumbar central spinal stenosis get relief from leg pain after hemilaminectomy surgery. ●	Research suggests that 75% of patients are satisfied with the surgery results. ●	About 10-20% of patients may undergo surgery again due to postoperative complications. Before recommending laminectomy, your doctor should consider a wide range of options for preventing future complications. Some of the most common reasons for hemilaminectomy surgery failure may include improper diagnosis, smoking, and physical deconditioning before and after surgery."
12,Arthritis Gloves Do They Work?,health-fitness," Arthritis is commonly known as joint pain. We have different types of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease that mainly affects the joints and other parts of the body. Development of each differs from each other, but all types can affect the hands. Hand arthritis causes pain and usually inflammation. With time, the use of the muscles in your hand might be affected. Arthritis gloves are usually used as part of the management tools for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis (IA). Some of these gloves apply pressure on the hand thereby relieving pain, stiffness and improving its function. The gloves are usually tight, often fingerless, and are meant to improve symptoms? But are they effective? Yes, they do depend on the usage. How Do Arthritis Gloves Work? Arthritis gloves mode of operation falls into these three categories. They are:- Thermal gloves provide warmth to the hand. This makes you feel comfortable and eases some of the pain. Some gives extra support to the hand. These types are called glove splints. Compression type of glove provides pressure on the fingers and hand joints. When you’re having a flare in the fingers and joints, this can be very uncomfortable. The compression gloves can help reduce the swelling. It can also help ease some joint stiffness as well. The gloves are designed to be worn for 8 hours. Some prefer to use it during the day while some prefer using it during the night while they sleep. Anyhow it is being used, it has to be used well to enhanced good performance regarding your Swelling, hand pain, joint stiffness, and the use of your hand. Rules for Using Arthritis Gloves •	The gloves have to fit your hand well. Too tight or too loose will not produce good benefits from using it. •	It is an 8-hour rule of usage, stick to it. How Should l Wear Arthritis Gloves? Wear the one that fits well into your hand. Too tight or too loose is not recommended. Before you can get good relief from the symptoms, you’ve got to wear the arthritis gloves for some time. Wearing the gloves for an hour or less will not give you a good result. Also wearing it on and off without maintaining the 8-hour rule will not give you a good result. You might wear the glove at night to sleep, or during the day. It all depends on you. Depending on what you do during the day, the downsides of wearing the gloves might be taking them on and off to perform one task or the other. In the case washing of your hands, you have to be careful about getting them wet. If the warm type of arthritis glove seems to be too hot for your hand during the day, depending on the weather, you might choose the compression type and use the warm type during the night. It all depends on your choice. The overall advantage of using the arthritis gloves is that it can make patients feel more relaxed and calm with a reduction in symptoms."
13,Can Enlarged Prostate Cause Erectile Dysfunction?,health-fitness," Old age comes with its goodies. It is normal for someone to get mature and to grow old. Naturally, as you mature in age, your cells/tissues/organs experience changes. Their functions will not be as when you are young. One of the changes in question is prostate enlargement. The by-product of the enlargement can cause erectile dysfunction? This enlargement is natural for most men, and it leads to what is called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). This condition is a non-malignant disease, meaning it is not cancerous. After being diagnosed with BPH, men are always worried about their sex life. Their thought is whether they will be able to perform well in bed again as before. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a condition where men find it difficult to maintain a stable erection before or during sex. The problem of Erectile Dysfunction (ED) often develops gradually. Erectile dysfunction symptoms might include, difficulty having an erection, keeping an erection, and reduced sexual desire. In case you witness this kind of symptoms, please visit your doctor in time. Enlarged Prostate and Erectile Dysfunction Relationship:- `The relationship between BPH and ED are similarly related in the area of age. Both are conditions that impact men's life through age maturity. Though they are separate and distinct, they do have connections. The majority of men with enlarged prostates (BPH) might have experienced erectile dysfunction sometimes. Ejaculatory problems might be associated with it. Similarly, men with BPH, coupled with lower urinary tract symptoms, might also be linked with erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction is not directly caused by BPH, but the treatment of it with some specific drugs is responsible. Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms are also associated with BPH. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) occur with elderly men over the mature age of 50 that have BPH. LUTS can manifest in men with BPH in form of nocturnal urination, frequent urination, urgency in urinating, and incomplete emptying of the bladder. Unfortunately, both BPH and erectile dysfunction increases with age. Enlarged Prostate and Erectile Dysfunction Link:- Maturity in age plays a major role when it comes to having an enlarged prostate (BPH) and erectile dysfunction (ED). Research studies were carried out on the similarity, differences, and the link between BPH and ED. One of the most interesting clinical trials to me was the Male Cologne Survey, which involves 4,489 men. These men were aged between 30 and 80. The survey and the statistics reveal that a high percentage of men who had lower tract symptoms due to BPH also had erectile dysfunction. In the Multinational Survey of the Ageing Male (MSAM-7), 14,000 men aged between 50 and 80 years were surveyed. The result findings of the Male Cologne Survey were compared with MSAM-7. Both studies confirmed high percentage of people with BPH associated with LUTS is linked with an increased risk of erectile dysfunction. How Does BPH Treatment Cause ED? There are two pharmacological classes of drugs used to treat BPH. They are: - Alpha-blockers and 5-alpha reeducates inhibitors Alpha- blockers: These are drugs used mainly for the treatment of high blood pressure (hypertension). It is also used in the treatment of enlargement of the prostate. (BPH) These drugs lower high blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels. Thereby enhancing free blood flow in the circulatory system. In the case of prostate enlargement, alpha-blockers function by, (1) relaxing the muscles of the bladder. (2) By also relaxing the muscle that surrounds your prostate gland so that you can pass urine more easily. Alpha - blockers include alfuzosin, doxazocin, tamsulosin, and silodosin. This drug is useful in the treatment of BPH. What of the noted side effects like erectile dysfunction(ED), dry organism (retrograde ejaculation) calls for concern? The side effect of alpha-blocker can even lead to a decrease in the production of seminal fluids. I suggest medical practitioners let their patients know of the side effect before administering the drug to them. 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors: 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor is a category of drugs used in managing enlarged prostate BPH). Also useful in managing the male type of hair loss called (Androgenic alopecia). The two widely used drugs in this category are dutasteride and finasteride. These drugs are considered safe and effective for treating BPH, but what of the side effects? The scare in using 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors for the treatment of BPH is the sexual problem it promotes. Both drugs used in treating BPH, especially the Alpha-blockers works by relaxing the muscles surrounding the prostate. Because of the drug action, the elasticity and the real function of the muscle cells/fibers are affected. This leads to chains of problems around the prostate area, which eventually ends up in erectile dysfunction(ED). Surgery: This is another form of managing the treatment of the prostate. This type of surgery is called a Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP). The surgery is carried out in such a way that the inner portion of the prostate is removed. Later this can lead to retrograde ejaculation. Although retrograde ejaculation is not harmful, the problem is that semen fluid comes out of the bladder alongside urine. When you have a derangement in the functionality of a system, it affects the end product of that system. TUIP, which can lead to retrograde ejaculation, might affect the male fertility hormone. If any of the male fertility hormones are disarranged, it affects the male organ to function properly. Conclusion: Either the TUIP or Alpha- blockers or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors used for the treatment or managing BPH, all have sexual side effects. And it can lead to Erectile Dysfunction(ED). Therefore, it is mainly the treatment of prostate enlargement (BPH) that causes erectile dysfunction, and not the condition itself."
14,Everything You Need to Know About Collagen,health-fitness," Collagen- the new “Superfood” in town. If you’re health-conscious, you’ve surely heard of Collagen. If not, then you’re missing out on something amazing. So, let’s take a deeper dive and know what Collagen exactly is! VItal Proteins Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body. It’s the significant building block of bones, ligaments, tendons, and muscles. You can think of it as a glue that holds things together in our body. It also has various other important roles such as providing texture to the skin and helping in the blood clot. Isn’t that amazing? Our body naturally produces its collagen by breaking down dietary protein into amino acids. We receive our collagen from a healthy protein-rich diet. There are at least 16 different types of Collagen that provide texture and structure to our body. It forms about 70% of our skin structure. Recently, Collagen has gained popularity as a nutritional supplement and as an ingredient in body lotions that makes your skin ‘glow’ and it has found use in shampoos. You might be curious about natural food sources of Collagen. Right? Natural Food Sources Animal products such as fish, chicken skin, bone broth, gelatin and pork skin are extremely high in Collagen. Also, Vitamin C rich fruits can help you with a good amount of Collagen. Now the question arises, whether we should take supplements or increase the consumption of such natural food sources. Don’t worry, we will make your task easy. Let us first know how the protein works in our body. When you consume protein, it breaks down to amino acids and then it gets reassembled. And so, the collagen you eat wouldn’t translate directly into higher levels in the body. Also, there’s a debate on whether consuming collagen-rich foods directly increase the levels of it in our body (As there’s no research that proves that). Consuming it as a supplement sounds wise, Isn’t it? Important fact: After the age of 20, the production of collagen starts decreasing by 1% every year and that’s where the consumption of it as a supplement becomes important. You can help your body preserve and protect collagen by avoiding too much-refined carbs, sugar, smoking and intense sun exposure. Collagen supplements are easily absorbed in the body which help in increasing the Collagen level directly as they are large protein which are broken into small peptides. Significant benefits of collagen It improves skin health It prevents bone loss Boosts muscle mass Stimulates your hair and nails to grow longer Helps relieve joint pain Improves heart health Bovine vs Marine Collagen- which is better? Bovine collagen is primarily made from cow hides and marine collagen from fish skin and scales. While Bovine Collagen is rich in Type 1 and 3 Collagen, which help in building and healing the body, Marine Collagen is rich in Type 2 Collagen which primarily helps with skin health and glow. So, the best collagen is the one that supports your health goals! Hydrolyzed Marine Collagen however has a faster absorption rate compared to other collagen supplements. For best results, consume collagen that is Hydrolyzed and that should be your pick!"
15,Alcohol and weightloss,health-fitness," If you are trying to lose weight, it is highly recommended not to drink alcohol. This reasoning is based both on the fact that alcohol contains a high concentration of unhealthy sugars and empty calories and on the knowledge that alcohol in general causes you to compromise your habits, which may lead you to eat the wrong foods if available. is. However, if you want a nightcap, it's recommended that you drink alcohol in moderation and opt for a low-sugar red wine instead of a high-carb beer. Alcohol is generally consumed in social situations, such as with a meal or a party. In general, one or two extra glasses are offered when drinking one glass. Since you are in a social situation, it can be difficult to forgo it, at least in terms of the parameters of your diet. If you have a weight loss partner and are in a situation where alcohol is consumed together, the two of you can share the responsibility of helping each other avoid unwanted glasses. Each additional alcoholic drink increases the number of calories you consume per day, as well as the amount of sugar passing through your bloodstream. Many people feel uncomfortable declining a drink in a social situation. They don't want to be partygoers by reminding friends about their diet or they don't want to appear stiff in front of others. If you find yourself in a situation where it is difficult not to have a drink, consider ordering a Diet Coke on ice. A Diet Coke does not contain calories or grams of fat but comes in a nice glass that resembles an alcoholic drink. If you must consume wine, opt for a deep red wine. Red wines are wines that generally contain less sugar than white wine or beer. Red wines are made while preserving the skin of the grapes, which also makes the wine richer in minerals than its white wine counterpart, which is made only from the core of the grape. Also keep in mind that drinks such as beer contain yeast, fat and sugar. There's a reason frequent beer drinkers get a beer belly - they consume massive amounts of beer, but don't finish it right away. Like fruit, it is also a good idea to consume wine when you are eating too. The meal helps regulate the spike in your blood sugar so your body isn't shocked by the addition of new alcohol calories or sugars. Keep in mind that while alcohol consumption may be unavoidable for you, the munchies and the desire to consume high-fat and high-fat foods should be controlled. If you do find yourself in a situation where you have had too much wine, it is important that you do not consume extra calories from food. Moderation and education are the two keys to effective weight loss when it comes to wine consumption and the hunger that follows."
16,10 secrets that will keep your family fit,health-fitness," It's no secret that many parents and their children are overweight. These 10 simple ""secrets"" can help you change your family's lifestyle so you can all get fit and healthy. Processed and refined grains, such as white bread, white rice, cereals, pasta, and other foods made with white flour, have a high glycemic index, low fibre, and fewer vitamins and minerals than foods made with whole grains. Making the switch to whole grains, including whole-wheat bread, whole-wheat pasta, brown rice, and grains made with whole grains, is an easy and healthy way to make your family's diet more nutritious. Soft drinks and fruit drinks have low nutritional value and a lot of calories. At about 150 calories per 12-ounce serving, your kids will gain an extra pound about every 3 weeks if they drink just one can of soda every day. Cutting back or eliminating soda, fruit drinks, and even fruit juice can be a great way to get rid of a lot of extra calories and leave room for your kids to eat more nutritious foods. Most kids don't eat enough fruits and vegetables, and that usually means eating different, less nutritious foods. With a high fibre content and many vitamins and minerals, fruits and vegetables are an important part of a healthy diet. And because they are high in water, eating fruits and vegetables can help you feel full and fulfilled so you don't overeat. A common mistake people make when trying to lose weight is to stop drinking milk, eating cheese and yoghurt. Calcium is important for building healthy bones and for losing weight. You should encourage your children to drink low-fat milk, eat portioned amounts of cheese and yoghurt to lose weight and maintain a healthy weight. Everyone knows that part of the cause of the current obesity epidemic is that people are much less active than they used to be. Involving children in organized activities, which can be a team or individual sports, and reducing time in front of the TV, computer, and playing video games, will burn calories and improve fitness. Family activities are also a great way to be more physically active. Even simple things like walking across a parking lot, using stairs, and going on short family walks or bike rides can make a big difference. While you don't necessarily need to count calories daily, you can keep a journal of what your family eats for a few days so you can see where the extra calories are coming from. Are your kids overweight because of the calories they get from a bedtime snack or those two glasses of Kool-Aid or soda they drink? Or maybe because his portion sizes are too big? Knowing where your kids' calories are coming from will help you know where to make changes and how to cut back, especially on foods that are high in empty calories. Carbohydrates get a bad wrap, especially with all advocates of high-protein diets, such as the Atkins and South Beach Diet. Not all carbohydrates are created equal. While it's a good idea to avoid refined foods such as white bread, foods made with white flour, and foods and drinks sweetened with sugar, other carbohydrates should be part of a balanced diet. Instead of avoiding all carbs, just learn how to choose foods with ""good"" carbs, such as fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains. Like carbohydrates, there are ""good"" and ""bad"" fats. Instead of making the mistake of trying to stick to a low-fat diet and simply replacing other foods that often have the same amount of calories, eat foods that contain ""good"" fat. This includes foods with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. On the other hand, you should avoid saturated and trans fats. Even if your family is eating healthy at home, if you eat super-sized fast-food meals a few times a week, they are likely still at risk of becoming overweight. If you eat out a lot, check out the nutrition facts from the restaurant's menu and watch your portion sizes. Calories and fat add up quickly when you eat out! Most people know what to do to be healthier, but eating healthy and exercising is not easy. Education about the specifics of a healthy diet, involving and documenting the whole family"
17,What Birth Control method is best for me?,health-fitness," Birth control is simply a way of preventing pregnancy. There are many methods used to achieve birth control. It can also be called family planning, fertility control, or contraception. They all mean the same thing. There is no best birth control for anyone. It all depends on your choice and which one is best compatible with you. Birth control methods depending on the type, work in various ways. But mostly function to prevent ovulation and fertilization of the egg. Some actions of birth control methods may be reversible or irreversible, but the majorities are reversible. Because of individual body resistance or tolerance, no birth control product is best for everyone. Before thinking of the best birth control of choice, it will be of good knowledge to know how they work in the body. Types like condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and contraceptive sponges’ helps in preventing sperm from getting to the eggs. Types like birth control pills, patches, shots, vaginal rings, and emergency contraceptive pills help to prevent ovulation. IUDs, devices that are implanted into the uterus also work to prevent ovulation and fertilization. This can be hormonal or non-hormonal and the implant can be in the body for several years. The irreversible type of birth control is called Sterilization. It permanently prevents a woman from getting pregnant or a man from being able to get a woman pregnant. Some methods are more effective than others, and the surest way to avoid pregnancy is not to have any sexual contact. What to think when choosing birth control: •	How sound is your health? •	Do you have any intention of making babies again? •	What is your mindset about pregnancy? •	How frequently do you have sex? •	How many sexual partners do you have? Are they more than one? •	How effective or accurate is the birth control method of choice? •	What of the use, how easy and convenient it is? •	Will it prevent sexually transmitted diseases? •	Have you thought of the cost? •	Does it offer additional benefits? . Which birth control methods have minimal side effects? The side effects of birth control methods depend on the individual. Your tolerance level is quite different from others. Therefore the decision to use birth control and the method of choice is one’s perspective. However, the doctor has to guide the decision and advise which method may be best for each individual. The best birth control method that has the least side effects is to stay without sex i.e. if you can. The condom which most people don’t value has a big role to play apart from preventing pregnancy.

The best choice of birth control methods differs from person to person. The best for you might not be right for everyone, and individual needs may change over time. So the best birth control method for you is the one that suits your goals."
18,Causes of insomnia: what are they?,health-fitness," Sleep is a necessary part of life. A number of mental or physical health complications can arise when you don’t get adequate sleep. According to numerous studies, adults need an average of 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night but get a least an hour or two less than that. A common cause of sleeplessness is insomnia, and numerous things can induce it. Knowing the cause of your sleepless nights can help you and your doctor find the best treatment for it. Medical Condition Chronic insomnia (lasting for a few months or years) is typically caused by a medical problem such as chronic pain, hyperthyroidism, or rheumatoid arthritis. Treating the underlying medical condition will, oftentimes, resolve the insomnia. In some cases, though, the insomnia may need to be treated independently. Illicit Drug or Alcohol Use A common misconception is that alcohol induces sleep. In reality, alcohol is a sleep disruptor. While it is true you will fall into unconsciousness after drinking, alcoholic substances prevent you from moving into deeper levels of sleep (like REM) and you will wake up feeling tired. Stimulant drugs like amphetamines increase blood pressure, heart rate, and neural activity which will keep you awake as long as the substance is active in your body. Withdrawal from drugs and alcohol during detoxification can also cause acute or short-term insomnia. Prescription or Over-the-Counter Drugs Many prescription and over-the-counter medicines from a pharmacy have side effects, of which insomnia is one. If you begin to experience sleepless nights after starting a new medication, chances are good that the medication is the problem. Sometimes the insomnia will pass after your body becomes accustomed to the medication. Other times, you may need to change medications or take a sleep aid to combat the effects of the drug. Stress Stress can lead to either acute or chronic insomnia depending on the stressor. Life events such as birth of a child or death of a loved one, mental or emotional tension, work issues, financial problems, and a host of other things that cause stress can also lead to the onset of insomnia. Making lifestyle changes to reduce stress oftentimes resolves an insomnia problem. Psychological Issues Several mental health problems can cause insomnia including depression, anxiety, mania, and schizophrenia. This may be due to chemical changes that occur in the brain that cause the disorder or be the result of dealing with the disorder. For example, a person suffering from depression may be unable to sleep because of an imbalance of chemicals in his or her brain that cause the depression or feelings of despair over his mood disorder. Hormonal Changes Changes in hormones can upset the chemical balance in the body needed for sleep. This is why adolescents and menstruating, pregnant, and menopausal women all have a high risk of experiencing insomnia. Typically, the insomnia will pass when hormone levels normalize. Other Disruptions in the circadian rhythm (jet lag, graveyard shift work), snoring sleep partners, parasomnias, exercising before bedtime, poor hygiene, and abuse of sleep aids can also lead to the onset of insomnia. Treatment of Insomnia: No matter what the cause is, you can buy sleeping pills for a good night sleep. We researched lots of sleeping aids and found few that do help sleep well without leading to addiction or causing side effects. Read all our reviews of our sleeping pills on pharmacyrxs"
19,Reasons Why You Feel Sleepy All The Time,health-fitness," In general, we all need sleep for 8-9 hours a day so that we can give our body complete rest and keep its overall wellbeing intact. Sleep contributes an important element to our health factor. It calms down the exhausted body and helps in re-energizing it. Whenever we get sick, we are suggested to take rest and sleep as much as possible so that we can recover from the ailment quickly. Besides, sleeping also helps in improving our learning capabilities, strengthens our immune system, and boosts our memory power. However, all this happens only when we sleep for a fixed time and follow a sleep schedule. Sleeping excessively can bring plenty of other health issues and can disturb your lifestyle extensively. Anything in excess is not good at all, and the same goes for sleep as well. Here are some of the reasons that can cause excessive sleep issues in a person. Poor sleep habits The most common reason for feeling sleepy or drowsy during the daytime is because you are not getting enough sleep at night. This may happen due to your poor sleeping habits. The pattern of poor sleeping habits in you might include factors like: •	You don’t know how much sleep you require exactly. •	You are not sleeping enough due to the work and social obligations that are leading to sleep deprivation. •	You might be sleeping in an environment that is not conducive for sound sleep, such as leaving the television on at night. •	You might be having an absurd bedtime routine that does not prepare you well for sleeping at night. •	You consume too much of caffeine, alcohol, and other stimulants close to bedtime, which might be disturbing your sleep at night. Sleep apnea Sleep apnea is a disorder in which you breathe partially, frequently, or completely stops during sleep.  It can occur a few dozen or hundred times at night while sleeping. It is mainly characterized by loud snoring that happens due to the disorder, and you briefly wake up and gasp for air. You might wake up completely and fall asleep immediately without even remembering anything about it. The fragmentation in sleep during the nighttime leads to poor sleep quality, which results in daytime sleepiness in the person. People who have a severe condition of sleep apnea can even fall asleep while driving. It is a risky health complication and needs medical attention. Narcolepsy It is a sleep disorder that causes excessive daytime sleepiness in people. It is a disorder that mainly happens due to a problem with the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. The main symptoms of narcolepsy include sleep paralysis and cataplexy. These issues can be extremely disturbing and can interfere with your regular lifestyle. The treatment of narcolepsy is done with the help of nootropic medications like Modafinil, which promotes wakefulness in users. Chronic fatigue syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome is a condition that can make you make you feel tired and exhausted, or sleepy. It is mainly characterized by worsened fatigue that happens after exertion. It is also related to sleep deprivation and frequent joint and muscle pain."
20,Vestibuloplasty Procedure using Dental Diode Lasers,health-fitness," Introduction - The shallow vestibule was one of the mucogingival problems cited by Friedman in the late 1950s that required apicocoronal dimension of gingiva. Problems with shallow vestibule includes, - Unable to perform intra-sulcular cleaning or modified Bass method, as it requires placement of tooth brush bristle into the gingival sulcus. In patients with reduced vestibular depth this couldn’t be possible. Thus it interferes with oral hygiene procedures causing ineffective plaque control.  It compromises the denture retention and stability, predisposes the gingiva to recession which compromises the esthetics and often leads to dentinal hypersensitivity and root caries on exposed root surface. Vestibuloplasty is a mucogingival procedure that aims at the surgical modification of the gingiva-mucous membrane relationships including deepening of the vestibular trough, altering the position of the frenulum or muscle attachments, and widening of the zone of attached gingiva. It is indicated to halt the progression of gingival recession, to regain the width of attached gingiva, for effective plaque control procedures, better esthetics, to improve denture retention and stability, and to prevent inflammatory alterations and tissue recession around implants. It is contraindicated in areas showing bone loss due to chronic periodontitis or traumatic extraction and in cases with ridge resorption around implants. Treatment Modalities - A variety of vestibuloplasty techniques have been advocated in literature such as Clark’s vestibuloplasty, Edlanplasty, Kazanjian vestibuloplasty, etc. Most of these techniques have been used as pre-prosthetic procedure to enhance the vestibular depth related to edentulous denture bearing areas. Major drawbacks of these conventional vestibuloplasty procedures were the severe pain and discomfort and the delayed healing with the high chances of relapse making them less acceptable. Laser vestibuloplasty with the Diode laser represents a contemporary non-invasive alternative to conventional scalpel method. PIOON Laser offers different wavelengths like 450nm, 810nm/980nm which can either be used in contact or non-contact manner to perform this procedure. In this case wavelength of 450nm was selected and 400 micron initiated tip was used in non-contact/slightly contact mode, starting at the mucogingival junction with a horizontal stoke directing the laser parallel to the bone slowly relieving the muscle fibers till the desired depth. Laser safety glasses were worn by the clinician, assistant and the patient and proper precautions were taken. According to a study by Carlo Fornaini et al 2016, blue light lasers provide minimal discomfort to patients with little traces of carbonization in the histopathological investigation. Again an interesting study by C. Fornaini et al 2017 suggested decreased excision time with a blue diode laser (wavelength 450nm) with much lesser rise in temperature. Rationale behind Use of Lasers  Lasers offer an array of advantages over the traditional scalpel in providing a clean sterile field with excellent hemostasis for the clinician and by providing less pain and swelling postoperatively for the patient. Conclusion - Lasers prove to be a viable, safe, and minimally invasive alternate to scalpel in vestibuloplasty procedures with better patient compliance and more predictable outcomes.

1,Contentment: The Path to True Happiness,health-fitness," There is a saying that “the grass is always greener on the other side.” This means that we always think that what others have is better than what we have. It also means that we are always thinking that our neighbor has more than we have or is happier than we are. While we are thinking in that way about our neighbors, they are also thinking the same way about us. We want what they have and they want what we have. Living in a state of discontent Lord Buddha taught the lesson of desirelessness. “Be desireless,” he would say. Desires lead us to a state in which we are always seeking that which we do not have. We begin to feel unhappy and dissatisfied as long as our desires are not fulfilled. In this state we cannot truly enjoy that which we do have. The desires keep us focused on their fulfillment and we spend a lot of energy trying to attain them. Each day that we do not have them fulfilled is another day of unhappiness for us. Thus, people live their lives in this state of discontent. It is only when we are content with what we have that we are truly happy. The secret to desires is that it is not the object we desire. It is the mind’s tendency to always be in a state of desire. It leads us into attachment to things of this world. It distracts us from the true purpose of our human life—to bring about the communion of our soul with God. That is the only true and lasting happiness. All other desires for things of this world only lead to unhappiness because nothing is permanent in this world. Learning to control desires We ultimately lose that which is worldly through separation, destruction, decay, or death. Even people whom we love are not permanent because we must leave this world or they leave the world through physical death. Nothing and no one in this world is lasting. Only our soul and God are lasting. All else is illusion. If we devote our time to seeking that which is not permanent, we may gain it for a while, but it will not last. That same amount of time can be devoted to bringing about the union of our soul with God. That alone is a lasting gain. With it comes eternal peace, bliss, and contentment. In living a life of contentment, we take joy in whatever comes our way. We thank the Lord for whatever God sends us and keep our thoughts absorbed in finding God within. We relish the time we can spend in meditation, in doing service for others, and in loving all humanity. We derive joy in seeing the smiles on the faces of others whom we have helped or to whom we have shown some kindness. We feel a sense of satisfaction knowing that we have done our best each day to help others as well as to help ourselves find God through meditation. Let us resolve to develop contentment. Let us develop the habit of thanking God for everything we have. Let us develop the control to eliminate desires. The highest state is to say, “Not my will, but Thy Will, O Lord.”"
2,"Be an Example, Get the Covid Shot",health-fitness," Be an Example, Get the Covid Shot Today, I got the first dose of the Covid vaccine. I should have received it 4 weeks ago but passed the opportunity to do so. I blame the delay on a few people I met by chance, as well as my internal debate fueled by my insight as a physician. For me, it was a roller coaster decision. While walking down the hospital corridor to get the vaccine 4 weeks ago, I encountered a hospital administrator. After we exchanged pleasantries, he asked, ""What are you up to this morning?"" ""Going to get the Covid vaccine,"" I told him. Leaning in close as if he did not want anybody else to hear, he said, ""Do you believe them? I do not."" ""Listen, doctor,"" he continued, ""you better buy AstraZeneca stock; it is going to get approval soon."" Then, he was on his way. Right there and then, I changed my mind about getting the vaccine. Instead of walking toward the vaccination room, I turned around, walked into the doctor's lounge, and grabbed some bananas and a couple of small red apples that were put out for breakfast. Two doctors were in the lounge when I entered. I asked them if they had gotten the Covid shot. One of them lifted his left arm to show me his band-aid. ""I got mine a couple of minutes ago,"" he said. ""I fear getting the shot,"" I admitted. ""Come on, now,"" he said to me, ""you know us Africans! When we were small children, our mothers dragged us to the doctors to be vaccinated. And they did so without asking any questions, without knowing what was in the vaccines, and nothing happened to us. Go get it."" Since he was convincing and because I admired him as a friend and colleague, I promised that I would go and get the vaccine immediately. With my banana and two small red apples in my pockets, I walked towards the vaccination room. Two women were waiting for patients when I came in. One was the vaccine inoculator, and the other was handing out paperwork. Briefly, I asked myself, ""Am I lucky to be the only person here? Or are others skeptical as well?"" Both women looked at me quizzically. ""I am here for the Covid vaccine,"" I said to them. Across a small desk, three or four papers were handed to me to read and sign. Maybe I should have, but I did not consider signing consent forms before the shot. Nobody on television—not the commentators, not the infectious disease experts, not even Dr. Fauci—talked about signing consent papers. This piece of advice may look trivial, but it turned me away from getting the vaccine the first time it was offered to me. To the disappointment of the two women, and indeed to my disappointment, I left. I told them I was taking the papers home to carefully read before getting the shot. But really, I was looking for an excuse not to get vaccinated, and this scenario presented a perfect opportunity for me not to do so. A week passed, and another week passed, and I still had not looked at the papers. One morning as I drove into a parking space at my pediatric office building, another physician, a 70-year internist, was arriving at the same time. ""Did you get the vaccine,"" I asked him. ""Yes, I did,"" he answered. ""I work in a nursing home, and it is mandatory I get it. But I was sick afterward. It is a bad vaccine. I should not have gotten it."" ""It could be because you had a Covid infection months ago,"" I reminded him. ""Perhaps, but let me tell you, it is not a good vaccine,"" he repeated. The internist's personal experience got me thinking in another direction. I wanted to know if I had contracted a Covid infection in the past without even realizing it. I wanted to do a blood test to determine if had antibodies against the Covid virus. After all, what was the point of getting the vaccine if I had natural immunity, I wondered? At least, let me know what I have before I receive any shot. It took me one week to obtain a Covid antibody test. ""Oh my God…I do not have any antibodies,"" I thought as soon as I saw the results. I was like a sitting duck waiting for the virus. With all the children I see in my practice, and with all their parents that come with them, it is just a matter of time before I get attacked by the virus. What a motivating factor for me to get vaccinated. Also, when I told my son about how I was trying so hard to slink off from getting the shot, he exclaimed in disbelief, ""What Dad? You should at least get it to show an example."" Pictures of famous people getting the shots in public were only transitory motivating for me. But my son's words sunk in—I needed to be an example. Rushing against the virus, I called and scheduled to be vaccinated at one of the Connecticut hospitals where I hold privileges. There, today, as shown in this picture, I got my first Covid shot—the Moderna one. Like other patients who had the shot that day, I waited for 15 minutes. Nothing happened. Everybody else was okay. The shot itself was not painful, but my left arm was sore and heavy for 48 hours. People have different experiences with the shot. But from my experience, I think it is a good shot. So, I think people should get it when they can unless they have a medical reason not to. I am eager to get my second shot in 28 days."

6,Are You Imprisoned In Your Mind,health-fitness," The mind is such a powerful and fundamental tool at our disposal that so many aren’t even aware nor able to grasp the fundamental truth so near at their finger tip. The mind is the greatest tool that man has been blessed with upon his sojourn on earth and it is supposed, I repeat supposed to be a handy man and a means to an end for man to handle any and all the challenges and problems that man maybe thrown at in the course of his life experiences. Yet again man isn’t fully aware of this amazing yet simple truth that is available to him. He is so caught up and totally wrapped up in the schemes and mechanics of his mind that he is lost to the real person inside – his real reality and true essence. Why? He think and believes that he is his mind! Everything that is thrown at him he accepts, hook line and sinker and believes he is the thinker of the thoughts. He doesn’t even stop for a moment to even take a step back ask himself if he really the one bringing forth these thoughts or someone or something else within himself. He is totally so wrapped up in his play acting and being in a semi state of reality where he thinks he is in control but in reality, he is not in control of anything.  Neither his life nor reality for his choices in thoughts, words and actions. This whole thing then begets the question – are you imprisoned by your mind? The one tool that should be a helper and a servant to you the master and controller. This creates the obvious reality in the world all around us where so many aren’t even aware that they are conditioned and controlled and ultimately imprisoned in their own minds. They slumber on carrying out their daily activities which they think yet again is their own doing and conscious thought, but do not realize that it is till yet a part of their subconscious programming that has been set in place and motion from childhood. We are conditioned and programmed to wake up in the morning and go through our usual routine of everyday life and at night, close our eyes in sleep and rest and to awaken the next day to the same routine, practically the same thing for the rest of our lives. How many of us are even aware of the fact that we haven’t really consciously chosen our life the way it is and that all that we think is normal routine is unconscious subconscious programming that has been set in place from past lives to the present one and to childhood. In childhood we are trained and conditioned to observe, follow and mimic people and their actions and suppose and believe, that this is the way things should be. We assume that since its family and loved ones that whatever they do is the right way of life and the right thing to do and as such imprint that into our mind over and over and over again until it becomes a solid core belief and starts working out as a reality in your life. Even when these actions are wrong and morally incorrect, who is there to guide you and show you that such is wrong and can only lead to destruction and fatality? Take the case of children who are born into homes where domestic violence is the norm and the order of the day and they actually witness their mothers and sister and other females being brutalized, who is there to show these young ones that this act is born of fear and anger and not love. Who is there to show them that love embraces all and only acts in the best interest of all its beloved and can suffer and endures all things for them and for their sake? Nobody is or nobody cares enough! So the child registers this in his subconscious and it becomes a belief and habit and as he continuously and constantly observes more and more of this scenario in his life, his belief grows more and more that this is the way to be and the way of life. His subconscious takes up this view of reality and starts manifesting it in his life when the time comes after it has solidified over years of silently and unconsciously cementing it for subsequent manifestation in his life. When these cycles then manifest and play out in his life later as a reality, society labels him and gives him names that are erroneously incorrect haven forgotten the roles played my family and loved ones in perpetuating this sad reality. He is humiliated, disgraced, embarrassed and subjected to trial and subsequent imprisonment without a fair hearing that is unbiased and free of criticism and resentment. They forget that he is just a victim of circumstances and failed parenting and is subsequently imprisoned in his mind as he believes he is acting in the right way and would uphold this view no matter what and defend himself as best as he can. If people and the society at large would but take a moment to critically review this case and see things objectively and from the standpoint of the whole, rather than in parts that the law courts always have cases involved in, they would marvel and be less critical and condemning of these people. They would realize that society failed them as custodians of the law to train them into responsible citizens, guidance to guide them in making the right choices and understanding that in life you have a choice but are not oblivious of the consequences associated with whatever choice or choices made. The family unit as a whole also has the responsibility of pointing the child in the right direction so that the he understands what he is doing and can make the right choice confidently. But alas society has yet to understand that crimes of passion and most cases of domestic violence are actually people imprisoned in their own minds and guided by their subconscious programming from childhood which they haven’t outgrown. In most cases, it is false and wrong images they carry in their mind from childhood, that no-one has taken the time to help them correct and which they grow with into adulthood believing such to be true and the right choice. In closing, i believe the wisdom below will serve you in life: “Thank you God, for this beautiful day today. Help me to always see your love reflected in each and every moment, no matter how challenging life may be. Remind me to always look to my heart for the LESSONS and BLESSINGS in life”. Jean Voice Dart! These words of Inspirations from the enlightened ones will serve you even more: “I wish I could show you when you are lonely or in darkness, the astonishing light of your own being”. Hafiz “Within you is the light of a thousand suns, within you is unimaginable beauty”. Robert Adam “Don’t you know it yet, it is your light that illuminates the worlds”. Rumi “I am the light of the world. You are the light of the world”. Jesus “Your heart is the light of the world, don’t cover it with your mind”. Mooji Taking responsibility and recognizing that we cause all of our core issues is not a reality for most people. Taking responsibility to see life differently without justification, judgement and blame, rejection or anxiety, fear or anger would really help you in the long run. Every condition, disease or disorder is a spiritual condition that has come up for review and to be dealt with and taken care of. Once the lesson is truly learnt and absorbed, the conditions or situation reverses itself and clears out and that’s when we say a healing has occurred and a miracle has happened. Every problem preludes a negative thought and mindset so watch your thoughts and emotions carefully and guard them jealously. Nothing can stop you if you have the courage, commitment and the discipline to move through your limitations. ‘Let yourself be drawn by the stronger pull of that which you truly love’ The purpose of life is to discover who you really are, know and create yourself and experience yourself as who you really are (not the body that houses you) as a part of the divine source to give and receive love and serve all creatures of the divine. As long as you don’t or you refuse to see yourself as a victim then life becomes a challenge that you can overcome with commitment and consistent work and it will pay you back handsomely. A lesson you avoided in a past life will be forwarded to the current life until you get the lesson right or understood the reason for it. Each time the lesson is more intense, than the last experience until you recognize it. This is an interactive universe where we all work together in each other’s lessons and life whether we want it or not or whether we are aware of it or not. Our fears always surface when we least expect it and when it does, its better to face the lesson and conquer it. You can take back control of your life and drive it the way you would rather want it to be and have things and have things the way you want it to be. It takes taking responsibility for all the wrongs that have happened in your life because whether you agree or not, you are held responsible for all your: THOUGHTS WORDS ACTION Nobody wants to listen to your cry of wolf or denial or victim mentality and it won’t take you far except you sit still, take stock of your life and determine and desire to turn it around and that’s where and when the answers or solutions come in. If and when you are now truly ready to take back control and look out for the patterns and lessons in your life to understand the mind aberrations that are causing your problems and have taken control of your life. That’s when the creative centers open within and you can finally have the tools to help you change the course of your life and manifest your destiny. To succeed in life, you must refuse to see yourself as a loser no matter what the prevailing situation or condition might be and you evaluate what you can do to succeed. The most important qualities are self-esteem, self-worth and self-confidence and that you understand that you are entitled to abundance in your life. You can do anything you want to and be anything you want to, provided you believe that it is possible. Victims do not hold that belief! So ask yourself – are you a victim? Sometimes a little help from a Therapist or Mental Health Consultant like myself and a host of others can help guide you on this journey into an amazing life that is yours and yours only."

8,Which vaccinations are recommended during pregnancy?,health-fitness," Pregnancy is a special period in a woman's life. Each future mother would certainly like to be prepared as best as possible for its challenges. And just as we care about the health of our loved ones, so it is also worth taking care of the health of our future family member before they even come into this world. How can this be done? Vaccinations can help. What are vaccines? Vaccines are specialized biological preparations, most often consisting of one or more antigens, which are obtained from live or dead microorganisms. Purified fragments of microorganisms and products of bacterial metabolism can also be used for the production of vaccines. In addition, vaccines contain stabilizing substances and preservatives. How do vaccines work? Vaccines induce an immune response similar to the natural immunity obtained by the body after going through a disease or microorganism infection. Then is it worth vaccinating, if we obtain similar immunity after going through the disease? Vaccinations help weaken the disease, helping us avoid its most harmful effects and possible complications that threaten not only health but also life. Vaccines consisting of live microorganisms elicit a strong immune response in the body, therefore providing immunity to a given antigen after a single dose. In the case of inactivated vaccines, i.e. vaccines created on the basis of dead microorganisms or their purified fragments, it is necessary to administer several doses to obtain immunity. Which vaccinations should a mother-to-be decide on? Before a planned pregnancy, it is worth taking care of your immunity. The following vaccinations are recommended in order to protect against infections that are dangerous for both the pregnant woman and the fetus: •	rubella, •	mumps, •	measles, •	chickenpox, •	whooping cough, •	hepatitis B, •	flu. Only inactivated (dead) vaccines may be given during pregnancy. It should be remembered that after vaccination with a preparation containing live microorganisms, a woman should not become pregnant for at least 1 month. Live vaccines include vaccines against rubella, chickenpox, mumps, and measles. Vaccinations recommended during pregnancy include: •	flu vaccination - you can get vaccinated regardless of the gestational age, preferably in the 2nd or 3rd trimester, when pregnant women are most often hospitalized after infection with the flu virus, •	whooping cough vaccination with the DTaP vaccine (against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis with a reduced content of pertussis and diphtheria antigens) - recommended in every pregnancy between 27th and 36th week, thanks to which protective antibodies, passing through the placenta, protect the child in the first few months after birth. Other vaccines (however, they must be inactivated) may be administered in particularly justified situations of exposure to infection, for example before traveling to distant countries. Such vaccinations include those against: •	hepatitis A, •	hepatitis B, •	polio, •	meningococci, •	pneumococci, •	Japanese encephalitis, •	rabies - after exposure to infection, i.e. after being bitten by an animal, regardless of the gestational age."
9,How can I treat a dry throat and esophagus?,health-fitness," Dryness in the throat and esophagus can be eliminated by moistening them with, for example, mouthwashes, syrups, or sprays containing, among others, marshmallow root, hyaluronic acid, and Icelandic lichen. It is also worth avoiding spicy and salty dishes and drugs, drinking plenty of water, and using chewing gum. Dry throat - causes Dry throat, formally known as xerostomia, is a group of symptoms that occur because of reduced or absent saliva production. The causes of this condition include: Breathing through your mouth, dehydration caused by fever, vomiting, or diarrhea, inflammatory condition of the mouth, throat, or salivary glands, abnormal functioning of the salivary glands, e.g. as a result of an injury or medications, diabetes, deficiency of B-type vitamins or iron, unintended interactions between medications, smoking, too little water consumed during the day. A dry throat can also be caused by snoring and breathing through your nose at night. It can also accompany acid reflux. People who work with their voices, e.g. teachers, actors, singers, as well as those staying in air-conditioned rooms are particularly vulnerable to xerostomia. Dry throat - symptoms Insufficient saliva production not only leads to an unpleasant feeling of dryness but can also cause ailments such as: scratchy throat, sore mouth, difficulty swallowing and speaking. Let's remember that the substances contained in saliva participate in the initial digestion of food and have a protective effect on your teeth and gums, therefore you should not underestimate the dryness in your throat and esophagus. Dry throat – how do I treat it? To treat a dry throat, you need to maintain proper oral hygiene. It is recommended to use soft brushes for brushing your teeth, tongue, and the inner part of the cheeks. It is equally important to provide the throat with adequate hydration. In this case, the following products can greatly help you: mouthwashes, sprays, syrups, herbal lozenges special lollipops - especially for young children. These products usually contain: marshmallow root – traditionally used as relief for irritation of mucous membranes thanks to its protective and coating effect. It very effectively protects the mucosa and facilitates expectoration; Iceland moss (Cetraria islandica) - thanks to its high content of polysaccharides and mucilages, it has a protective effect and reduces inflammation; mullein flower (Verbascum) - thanks to the content of saponins, it has a protective and fluidizing effect; linseed - contains mucilage and fatty oil that has a coating effect on the throat and esophagus; stays on the mucosa for a long time, thus preventing irritation. On the market, you can also get preparations containing mucin - a glycoprotein found in saliva that binds water and creates a protective layer on the mucosa. The action of such preparations lasts for up to 3 hours. The products recommended for dry throat can also contain: olive oil - contains sterols with anti-inflammatory properties, has a coating and moisturizing effect on the mucous membranes; vitamins A and E - have regenerative and antioxidant properties; aloe - supports regenerative processes; hyaluronic acid - stimulates cell renewal and is used for the treatment of vocal cord diseases. In addition, to treat a dry throat, it is recommended to: drinking enough water; limiting or completely giving up drinking coffee, alcohol, and smoking; limiting the consumption of spicy and salty foods; using chewing gums since they stimulate the production of saliva."
10,Trap Bar Deadlift,health-fitness," The trap bar deadlift (especially with low handles) is a great exercise to add to your routine. It’s a compound movement that works the glutes, the lower back, the quadriceps, the hamstrings, the trapezius, the abdominal muscles, and the forearms. While it’s more common to see someone do a deadlift with a barbell, the trap bar deadlift it has gained in popularity in recent years, and most gyms now have a trap bar. ​ There are more similarities between the barbell deadlift and trap bar deadlift than there are differences. Both are lifted from the floor. Both involve hinging at the hips. The weight people can lift is similar for both. People tend to be able to lift a bit more weight with the trap bar, but people lifting a huge amount more with the trap bar you'll often read about on the internet are people using the high handles which reduces the range of motions. If you use the low handles, which are the same height as the barbell deadlift, the difference is much smaller. The trap bar uses a little more quads, and a little less hamstring and back compared to the barbell deadlift. Benefits of the Trap Bar Deadlift Over the Barbell Deadlift The barbell deadlift is also a great exercise. This article isn't about one being better than the other, they are just different. I’m going to discuss some of the benefits of using a trap bar. Easier to Learn: The trap bar deadlift is easier for most beginners to learn. The main reason being that with the barbell the weight is in front of you with makes it easier to lose your balance and round forward. While with the trap bar your hands are by your side. I don’t think the potential problems with the barbell deadlift are hard to avoid if you're coached properly, and doing deadlifts with a barbell isn’t that technical, or even hard to learn, but beginners do tend to pick up the trap bar deadlift and able to do them safely quicker than with a barbell, especially when they aren't receiving coaching. Easier on the Lower Back: Trap bar deadlifts can be easier on the back, assuming your bracing and using good technique. The trap bar was invented in the 1980s by a powerlifter called Al Gerard. Al Gerard had many back problems, and he wanted to find a way to lift heavy weights with his bad back. The barbell deadlift is also good for your back if you're healthy, but some people who have back issues find that they can trap bar deadlift without pain while they can't with the barbell. There is less chance of being pulled forward and having spinal flexion with a trap bar. if you’re finding using a barbell is giving you back problems then using a trap bar could be a good option. This also makes the trap bar easier to use safely while doing high reps. Low Handles and  High Handles: Most trap bars have low and high handles. The vast majority of people only use the high handles. In fact, I've never seen anyone use the low handles apart from myself and my clients. If you search for #lowhandletrapbardeadlift on Instagram, you'll find only twenty videos, and three of them are me. Why do people mostly use high handles? Mainly because of ego and they can lift more weight with it. However, there are some good reasons to use the high handles. A lot of people don’t have the mobility in the hips to get into the correct starting position with the barbell deadlift or the low handle trap bar deadlift because of previous injuries, or being active for a long time. However, most people can comfortably do a trap bar deadlift with high handles as it requires less mobility. I even have a 72-year-old client who can trap bar with high handles without a problem, but he wouldn't be able to use a barbell. For everyone else, I use the low handles as it has a larger range of motion and carries over to the conventional deadlift better. Grip: The trap bar allows you to use a neutral grip. Using a barbell gripping the bar with a double overhand grip will limit the weight you can lift as your hands can’t hold enough weight. That leaves hook grip, straps and mixed grip (one hand pronated, and one hand supinated). Hook grip is a strong grip but can be very painful on the thumb. Using straps take away the grip strength benefits. A mixed grip is a very strong grip but can lead to small muscle imbalances. It also increases the chance of tearing a bicep on the arm that’s supinated if bad technique is used. The trap bar is easy to grip and avoids these potential negatives. Carryover to the Barbell Deadlift: I’ve personally found it to have a good carryover when using the low handle trap bar to the barbell deadlift. Three years ago, I pulled 230kg with a barbell with the vast majority of my training on the trap bar.   I did deadlifts with a barbell around 5-8 times in my life before I did that. This was back when my one rep max on my squat was only 155kg, so the trap bar deadlift was the main reason I managed to deadlift 230kg. Possible Negatives of the Trap Bar Deadlift The handles might be too wide, or too narrow for some people depending on the trap bar being used. You might occasionally not grab the trap bar in the middle of the handle. This is simple to sort out as you can readjust before the next rep. How to do a Trap Bar Deadlift Step 1: Stand in the centre of a trap bar with your feet roughly hip-width apart and toes slightly out. This is a good starting point. Try a slightly narrower and wider stance to see what works best for you. Step 2: Bending at the hip and letting the knees slightly bend, grab the middle of the handles of the trap bar. Sit your hips back so you feel the tension in your hamstrings. Lift your chest up and flatten your back. Look straight ahead, or slightly down.  While keeping your arms straight, rotate your elbows so they facing the wall behind you and pull your shoulders down. This will help engage your lats. Step 3: From this position you need to get tight and brace. Getting tight and bracing will allow you to lift the most weight you can and reduce the chance of injury. You now need to pull the slack out of the bar. Pulling the slack out of the bar is very simply lightly pulling on the bar and creating as much tension as possible throughout the body. You should be tense enough so that if I was to lightly push you, you wouldn't move. Before lifting you want to take a deep breath from your diaphragm.  When breathing into your diaphragm, your stomach should inflate out.  If you’re chest and shoulders raise while you take your breath you’re not breathing into your diaphragm. You'll need to hold this breath until you've completed the rep. Contract your abs like you’re about to get punched in the stomach, and again hold it for the whole rep. Step 4: Lift the bar driving your feet into the ground, straightening your legs, and thrusting your hips forward. As you approach the top of the movement to squeeze your glutes and push the hips forward to lock out the rep. When you lift it you shouldn't be jerking the bar off the ground. If you do end up jerking it off the ground it suggests that you didn't get tight enough during the setup. Bracing, getting tight and pulling the slack out of the bar Getting tight, bracing and creating full-body tension is important as it reduces the chance of injuring yourself and it allows you to lift the most weight.  You need to be able to transfer the force into the bar through the torso. Make bracing and getting tight a priority when you're doing deadlifts. Before every rep, you need to take a big diaphragmatic breath (breathing into your stomach/obliques) instead of breathing into your chest to create Intra-abdominal pressure. This helps protect your lower back. Your stomach should inflate out when doing this. If your chest and shoulders raise while you take your breath, you’re not doing it correctly. You will hold this breath during the rep. If you need to exhale, do it at the top of the lift or with the bar resting on the ground between reps. Contract your abs like you’re about to get punched in the stomach. This combined with taking a big breath will ensure you’re core is braced. Pulling the slack out of the bar simply  means that you have already put upward pressure on the barbell before you to lift the weight to create tension throughout the body.  You should already be pulling the bar so  when it’s still on the floor that adding that anymore force ill lift it off the floor. You shouldn't be jerking the bar off the floor. If you are, it means you're not pulling the slack out of the bar. ​ Touch and Go vs Resetting Between Reps People have become big and strong using both methods.  Some people argue that it’s better to reset between every rep because when you're doing a one rep max you're starting dead start so you should practice that with every rep. If you're a powerlifter, I would reset between every set so you can practice it. There's nothing wrong with touch and go. Touch and go is a way of overloading the muscles as you'll be able to do more reps with the same weight. I've personally made my best progress doing touch d go deadlifts. Touch and go forces you to do the eccentric part of the exercise which is useful for building muscle. The main problem with touch and go is that most people will do it wrong. They will cheat and bounce the weight up. I wouldn't recommend touch and go to someone who hasn't been deadlifting for a long time. Some benefits touch deadlifts are it will build you grip strength better as you'll be holding the bar for the whole rep. You'll have more time under tension which is good for building muscle I like to get my clients to control the eccentric part of the deadlift and briefly pause at the bottom before doing another rep. By controlling the eccentric part of the lift you'll return the bar to the correct starting position every time which will limit the time spent between reps. Common Mistake Not setting up correctly: The trap bar deadlift is a very simple movement once you're set up correctly. It's The problem is a lot of people don't set up correctly. If something doesn't feel right, or doesn't look good when you record it, look at your set up and check you're doing everything you should be. Good chance that's where your problem is. Jerking the bar off the floor: This is a common mistake, and again it's caused by not getting tight and pulling the slack out of the bar. Jerking the bar off the floor should be avoided as it greatly increases the chance of you hurting your lower back, and it will limit how much weight you're able to lift. Make sure you pull the slack out of the bar and brace correctly. ​"
11,here are simple ways to solve the difficulties of women loosing weight,health-fitness," Here Are Simple Ways To Solve The Difficulties Of Women Losing Weight Winning in the weight loss game A lady and her partner go on a diet together. Are they both inspired? Yes. Do they each consistently count calories? Yes. The guy is most likely to shed more undesirable pounds than his better half. Why? Blame it on your genes, some specialists state. "" We hear this all the time, and it can be irritating for ladies,"" states endocrinologist Ula Abed Alwahab, MD. ""But regrettably for females, their hereditary makeup can make slimming down a bit more difficult."" What elements are at work here? "" Metabolic rate remains in part driven by your muscle mass, and females have less muscle and more fat naturally than males,"" states dietitian and accredited diabetes teacher Dawn Noe, RD, LD, CDE. Breastfeeding does assist with burning calories and weight loss at this phase of life. Menopause. Ladies likewise put on weight in their abdominal area throughout menopause due to a loss of hormonal agents and a slower metabolic process. Some females even have a name for their brand-new potbelly-- meno-pot. PCOS struggles. Between 5 and 10 percent of females have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This is a condition identified by a hormone imbalance that makes weight-loss harder and triggers menstrual abnormality. Regardless of these difficulties, there are a lot of methods to eliminate weight gain and dominate. Here are 3. Increasing muscle mass assists both ladies and males to enhance their metabolic process. Having more muscle mass assists you in burning calories, even when you're sitting or at rest. You can preserve muscle by doing resistance training a minimum of two times a week, for 20 to 30 minutes per session. This is specifically important as you get older. (Your metabolic process naturally decreases and you lose muscle as you age.). There are a number of methods to approach resistance training: Usage of a health club or equipment in your home. Utilize dumbbells or resistance bands. Take part in a physical fitness class, such as Pilates. Utilize your body for resistance by doing push-ups, crouches, and lunges. Females are often reluctant to do weightlifting since they assume it will make them look manly. That is a mistaken belief, as females do not have the quantity of testosterone that males have. Noe motivates females to get comfy with weights. ""Women need to be weightlifting to get the advantages of structure muscle, such as increased metabolic rate and avoidance of osteoporosis,"" she states. A weight-bearing workout isn't just a healthy exercise. As it assists in growing muscle mass, you burn more calories, which reduces insulin resistance substantially and avoids diabetes. If middle-aged males and females are both thinking about dropping weight, the number of calories a male requires for weight reduction is approximately 1,500 each day (depending upon height/weight/level of exercise) however, the lady's calorie requirements will be much less-- generally about 1,200 calories daily, Noe states. Naturally, if they are both working out frequently, those calories might move somewhat greater. For females, progress in your weight reduction might indicate consuming less than males in the long term. Noe frequently suggests a well-balanced strategy such as the Mediterranean diet plan. She likewise tends to utilize lower carb and ketogenic diet plans, particularly for females with PCOS or diabetes who might not endure greater carbohydrate meal strategies. ""Research of weight reduction does not substantiate one eating pattern over another,"" she states, ""and the meal plan you choose should be matched according to your health requirements and consuming habits."". It's crucial to exercise patience. Research studies reveal that the majority of weight-loss strategies tend to produce anywhere from a 5% to 10% weight reduction within a year if you persevere. ""If you’re not seeing progress, talk with your health care group as you may need to apply other strategies that will better fit your way of life,"" she states. Whether you follow a diet plan low in fat, low in carbs, or some other diet plan, make certain meals are well balanced and healthy. Consist of lean proteins, healthy fats like nuts, olive oil, and avocados, restrict empty carbohydrates (no sugar, white bread, sweetened beverages, etc.), and great deals of minerals and vitamins from veggies and fruit. Other nutrition suggestions for ladies over age 50 consist of consuming appropriate amounts of calcium and Vitamin D, either from food or supplements.

12,The Value of Medical Credentialing,health-fitness," Credentialing is Crucial for Healthcare Providers; Here’s Why Truth is, many patients know little more about their physician’s qualifications than what they see neatly hanging from their office wall. While they’re able to access in-depth background information about their auto mechanic, it’s when they are at their most vulnerable, entrusting their family’s health to a qualified healthcare professional, is when they must hope that there’s more than meets the eye behind the sometimes bewildering abbreviations spread across those medical school diplomas. That’s why medical credentialing exists. Put simply, medical credentialing is a process by which medical organizations verify the credentials of healthcare providers to ensure they have the required licenses, certification and skills to properly care for patients. It’s an essential function for hospitals and others which precedes hiring or obtaining coverage by an insurance carrier. However, the procedure is anything but simple, as we’ll soon discover. Why is credentialing so important? It might seem, at first glance, like credentialing is simply a paperwork chore, rather tedious and not nearly as essential as patient care, but it’s an undertaking (with an urgency) that can’t be taken lightly. Medical credentialing provides quality assurance to the medical industry, which benefits everyone involved. Not only does it guard hospitals and other organizations from would-be lawsuits, it’s a safeguard put in place to protect patients by supplying competent, high-quality healthcare providers. More to the point, hospitals and clinics can be assured that the staff they hire will provide care at the standards demanded from them. Plus, insurance companies have an incentive to keep costs down and therefore prefer to insure only those medical providers who demonstrate sufficient competence in practicing medicine. Medical practitioners benefit from credentialing because once they receive privileges to accept clients from insurance companies, they can grow the number of patients who have access to them. Finally, medical credentialing is perhaps most important because it’s the one method that permits patients to place their trust with utmost confidence in their chosen healthcare provider(s). Through a standardized process involving data collection, primary source verification and committee review by health insurance plans, hospitals and other healthcare agencies, patients are confident in their healthcare professional’s ability and experience. Bottom line: The healthcare provider credentialing process works to make sure that everyone from doctor to patient, and everyone in between, is better off. A bit of credentialing history While most of us might think of medical credentialing as a present-day concept, it’s been a part of physicians’ livelihoods dating as far back as 1000 BC, at least in some rudimentary form. In ancient Persia, to qualify for licensure, a physician had to treat three heretics – if they lived, that qualified the physician to practice medicine for the rest of their natural lives. Sound simple enough? By the medieval period, the credentialing process was becoming be more elaborate. In 13th century Paris, the College de Saint Come divided the barber surgeons (surgeons of the long robe) from lay barbers (barbers of the short robe). To become a member of the College, and therefore a surgeon of the long robe, one had to meet specific prerequisites for admission and pass an exam given by a panel of surgeons. Fast forwarding to the U.S in the 1960’s, the Darlington v. Charleston Community Memorial Hospital case established the duty of hospitals to verify their physician and other provider competencies. This landmark suit soon brought about the creation of a credentialing process as hospitals and other organizations sought to shield themselves from comparable lawsuits. Prior to this case, the hospital contended that the attending physician was an autonomous contractor, exempt from oversight. Darling amended this tactic and set the stage for a consistent systematic evaluation of all physicians who asked to practice in the inpatient venue. As such, the verification and evaluation of a physician’s credentials became the standard before inpatient privileges would be accorded. Again, moving forward, it was in the 1990’s that national organizations devoted to the credentialing of medical providers came into being. The most well-known of these is NCQA, or the National Committee for Quality Assurance. This organization sets a range of standards that perform as a guide for how to credential medical providers, including the use of primary source verification which is the process of requesting and receiving verification of the provider’s stated credentials from the college or other entity that issued the diploma or certificate. This includes board certification, education, training, malpractice claims and other factors that can have a bearing on patient care. While credentialing has obviously changed over the years, the heart of the concept is identical– ensuring doctors practicing in a given state or city have obtained the required training and possess the know-how to safely and capably practice medicine. How does the credentialing process work? Basically, there are three primary stages: In the Initial Stage (credentialing on-boarding), a healthcare facility or health insurance plan asks the medical provider for information on his or her background, including education, licensing, etc. Hospitals and similar healthcare organizations have a legal obligation to validate the provider’s identity, education, work experience, malpractice history (if any), professional sanctions and license confirmations to safeguard patients from non-qualified providers. As a prime example, when a physician wishes to practice within a hospital, a surgery center or a physicians’ organization, they are required to complete an application and grant permission to a credentialing authority to examine their professional documents. For a doctor, the National Provider Identifier (NPI), CAQH ProView, professional licenses, diplomas, certificates and professional references are all considered as credentialing documents. Remember, the process of credentialing is to verify the accuracy and precise data in the physician’s documents. Every physician receives one National Provider Identifier (NPI) number in his or her lifetime. It is a 10-digit number given only to healthcare service providers. Each provider is then responsible to apply for and update the information associated with their NPI. In Stage Two, this information is confirmed. This is the “background” work where the facility or insurance company will communicate with licensing agencies, medical schools and other such bodies to validate the provider’s information. More recently, the Affordable Care Act substantially increased physician credentialing requirements for Medicare and Medicaid enrollment in an effort to reduce fraud and abuse. Stage Three is where the provider is presented with credentials from a hospital or other healthcare organization after all required documentation is substantiated and no negative issues are found. The same with insurance companies who can decide to accept a provider as an in-network provider and will pay he or she for treating patients who have its insurance. Keep in mind that with Medicare and Medicaid, medical credentialing is not only concerned with guarding patients, but also deals with providers securing insurance reimbursements. Without insurance credentialing, providers cannot receive patients or clients that are covered by programs including CMS/Medicare and Medicaid, as well as most commercial plans. Who are some of the other major players in medical credentialing? Healthcare provider credentialing involves numerous parties and moving parts. Of course, as we’ve seen, the doctor—and other healthcare providers – all must prove they have the education, training and skills necessary to properly care for patients. At the same time, healthcare oversight organizations monitor the work of hospitals and other healthcare providers to assure they are meeting the standards put forth. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations both require that healthcare providers be credentialed. Healthcare organizations that don’t follow the CMS regulations are not eligible for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement. Most U.S. hospitals pursue the Joint Commission accreditation, which is also required for Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement eligibility. As such, the Joint Commission accredits only those who stick to its regulations Other groups set standards on credentialing as well, and many healthcare organizations follow them to receive additional accreditation. These include the aforementioned National Committee for Quality Assurance, the Utilization Review Accreditation and the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Healthcare. Organizations that actually handle credentialing information include the National Practitioner Data Bank (information on license suspension, revocation ort medical malpractice claims), the National Student Clearinghouse (Information on education history), the Federation of State Medical Boards (information on medical professionals, including certifications, education, etc.), and the American Board of Medical Specialties (a way to check the Board Certification of physicians under review). Add to this that all this reporting and monitoring must be continually checked by both the healthcare facilities that employ providers and by health insurance companies that want to issue an approved providers list. Can the lengthy process of credentialing affect a medical provider’s or healthcare facility’s bottom line? Keep in mind that credentialing can take anywhere from a few weeks up to 90 or, in some instances, 150 days, depending on the market. A drawn-out process can have a significant financial impact on both medical providers and healthcare facilities. That’s because when a provider is waiting for hospital credentials, he or she can’t see patients at the hospital. Moreover, when a provider is awaiting insurance authorization, he or she won’t be reimbursed by the insurance company for seeing patients who have that insurance. “A physician’s time is money,” says one credentialing expert. He approximates that for “every day a physician isn’t working, that’s a loss of $7,000 for a hospital. You multiply that over six months, that’s a big chunk of change.” That’s why it’s important that providers and hospitals ensure the process moves as efficiently as possible. What are some of the obstacles that can be anticipated in the credentialing process? This time-consuming procedure must be managed in the correct manner. If physicians are not fully enrolled or credentialed by their participating health plans, they will not get paid for rendering medical services. Not having admitting privileges will also impact their chances to attract more patients. Moreover, as noted above, the credentialing process can take up to 150 days from beginning to end. This amount of time allows for some leeway with case verification entities who don’t respond straightaway to requests of the credentialing authority or if the authority must look into inconsistencies for further clarification. Remember, the credentialing authority has little control over the response time from outside sources who need to verify information. If they don’t respond at first, the authority will make added requests, which can mean major holdups. So, is it time to consider getting medical credentialing help? You might decide, at this point, that going in-house for credentialing is not the best route forward. Fact is, health care providers often portray the procedure as “nightmarish” as the process rarely goes smoothly and many providers discover themselves resubmitting applications, battling enrollment denials and wasting a lot of time “on hold” with insurance companies. It’s also been found that in-house credentialing turns out to be problematic for many healthcare organizations either due to lack of dedicated staff, monetary restrictions or lack of required information resources. This is another reason why outsourcing is becoming a preferred option. Says one credentialing expert, “it’s no secret that the process of medical credentialing isn’t something many healthcare providers look forward to. In fact, it’s a process that many shrink from.” For many healthcare entities, it just makes sense to employ a service such as Medwave to help with medical credentialing. Not only does a credentialing service ease the burden of the process, but using such a 3rd party service usually saves money. Plus, a reliable service can be expected to have a higher success rate getting the credentialing completed expertly, indicating a physician can begin seeing patients with insurance, sooner rather than later. What, then, are some of the favorable aspects of using a third-party credentialing service? In brief, You reduce application errors which could slow down the process considerably. You save yourself and your staff time to see patients, cut paperwork and rid of frustration. You free up schedule space for staff to work on other things. You reduce overall operating expenses."
13,The minimally invasive hip replacement,health-fitness," THE MINIMALLY INVASIVE HIP REPLACEMENT Hip replacement is a major orthopedic surgery which consists in replacing the hip affected by hip osteoarthritis. The surgery involves the prosthesis of the entire joint, through the implantation of two titanium components which are anchored to the patient's bone without the aid of cement, as opposed to the knee prosthesis. There are 3 types of hip prostheses: the total prosthesis, or joint prosthesis, in which both the femur and the acetabulum are replaced; partial prosthesis, or endoprosthesis, in which only the head of the femur is replaced (usually when a fracture of the femoral neck occurs in an elderly patient); the resurfacing prosthesis, in which both the femur and the acetabulum are replaced but the neck of the femur is spared (this is a surgery reserved for selected cases, that is, young and sports patients with advanced osteoarthritis). In some cases, the hip prosthesis can also be cemented: these are selected patients suffering from severe osteoporosis. The choice of which prosthesis to use depends on the characteristics of the patient and the quality of his bone. Generally in elderly patients and patients with osteoporosis it is preferred to perform cemented prostheses, which have the advantage of immediately fixing the prosthesis to the bone and allowing for an early and complete load. Non-cemented prostheses, on the other hand, are considered biological as they are coated with a material that allows osseointegration by the patient, whose bone envelops and penetrates inside the holes of the prosthetic surface. The minimally invasive technique in hip replacement The minimally invasive hip prosthesis provides for a posterolateral access (in reality there are several minimally invasive access routes) with passage through the gluteal muscles, without however dissecting them; only one tendon is sacrificed, the piriformis, which at the end of the surgery is repositioned in its original site with resorbable points. The intervention also provides for the saving of a part of the femoral neck and the use of prostheses with short femoral stems. Thanks to the ""Femur-First"" technique, it is also possible to obtain satisfactory results by positioning the prosthetic components in such a way that they have an optimal working angle, guaranteeing a longer life of the polyethylene insert and a lower risk of implant dislocation. Which prosthesis to choose? The choice of the prosthesis depends on various factors, including the age of the patient and his functional requirements, but above all the geometry of the hip. In fact, there are different types of prostheses that allow you to faithfully reproduce the geometry of that particular patient. In fact, not all hips have the same shape, and each patient has his own geometry: the purpose of each hip prosthesis is to try to reproduce the original anatomy as much as possible. For this purpose, there are several methods, both for choosing the type of prosthesis and its dimensions. Surely the computer is one of the most evolutionary and precise methods. There is a software called Osirix, which allows you to calculate the geometry of the hip on the basis of the patient's X-ray, and thanks to a known metal landmark it is able to tell us if the chosen prosthesis reproduces the anatomy and geometry, the final length of the lower limbs and the sizes of the prosthesis."

16,Is CBD Legal in Alabama?,health-fitness," The use of cannabidiol (CBD) in Alabama is broadly legal. As with most states, Alabama has its provisions for the benefit of CBD. Governor Robert Bentley, in April 2014, signed SB 174, also called Carly's Law, which permits an affirmative defense of persons who use CBD for debilitating epileptic conditions. However, the law only allows for prescriptions through the University of Alabama - Birmingham. Because marijuana is still illegal federally, medical professionals cannot ""prescribe"" it. They can only ""recommend."" For this reason, access to CBD products was difficult. Governor Bentley signed another law, SB 94, on May 4, 2017, which widened CBD access. Also called Leni's Law, the provision allowed for the use of CBD for ""specified debilitating conditions that produce seizures. CBD is legal to buy in Alabama, but only from licensed vendors. The products must also contain less than 0.3% THC by weight. Presently, the state doesn't have any provisions for the testing and labeling of CBD products.

18,Best Foods to Boost Your Brain and Memory Your brain,health-fitness," As the control center of your body, it’s in charge of keeping your heart beating and lungs breathing and allowing you to move, feel and think. That’s why it’s a good idea to keep your brain in peak working condition. The foods you eat play a role in keeping your brain healthy and can improve specific mental tasks, such as memory and concentration. This article lists 11 foods that boost your brain. When people talk about brain foods, fatty fish is often at the top of the list. This type of fish includes salmon, trout and sardines, which are all rich sources of omega-3 fatty acids. About 60% of your brain is made of fat, and half of that fat is the omega-3 kind. Your brain uses omega-3s to build brain and nerve cells, and these fats are essential for learning and memory. Omega 3-s also have a couple additional benefits for your brain. For one thing, they may slow age-related mental decline and help ward off Alzheimer’s disease. On the flip side, not getting enough omega-3s is linked to learning impairments, as well as depression. In general, eating fish seems to have positive health benefits. One study found that people who ate baked or broiled fish regularly had more gray matter in their brains. Gray matter contains most of the nerve cells that control decision making, memory and emotion. Overall, fatty fish is an excellent choice for brain health. SUMMARY: Fatty fish is a rich source of omega-3s, a major building block of the brain. Omega-3s play a role in sharpening memory and improving mood, as well as protecting your brain against decline. If coffee is the highlight of your morning, you’ll be glad to hear that it’s good for you. Two main components in coffee — caffeine and antioxidants — help your brain. The caffeine in coffee has a number of positive effects on the brain, including: Increased alertness: Caffeine keeps your brain alert by blocking adenosine, a chemical messenger that makes you sleepy Improved mood: Caffeine may also boost some of your “feel-good” neurotransmitters, such as serotonin. Sharpened concentration: One study found that when participants drank one large coffee in the morning or smaller amounts throughout the day, they were more effective at tasks that required concentration . Drinking coffee over the long term is also linked to a reduced risk of neurological diseases, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s This could at least be partly due to coffee’s high concentration of antioxidants. SUMMARY: Coffee can help boost alertness and mood. It may also offer some protection against Alzheimer’s, thanks to its caffeine and antioxidants. Blueberries provide numerous health benefits, including some that are specifically for your brain. Blueberries and other deeply colored berries deliver anthocyanins, a group of plant compounds with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects Antioxidants act against both oxidative stress and inflammation, conditions that may contribute to brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Some of the antioxidants in blueberries have been found to accumulate in the brain and help improve communication between brain cells. Animal studies have shown that blueberries help improve memory and may even delay short-term memory loss. Try sprinkling them on your breakfast cereal or adding them to a smoothie. SUMMARY: Blueberries are packed with antioxidants that may delay brain aging and improve memory. Turmeric has generated a lot of buzz recently. This deep-yellow spice is a key ingredient in curry powder and has a number of benefits for the brain. Curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier, meaning it can directly enter the brain and benefit the cells there. It’s a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound that has been linked to the following brain benefits: May benefit memory: Curcumin may help improve memory in people with Alzheimer’s. It may also help clear the amyloid plaques that are a hallmark of this disease. Eases depression: It boosts serotonin and dopamine, which both improve mood. One study found curcumin improved depression symptoms just as much as an antidepressant over six weeks. Helps new brain cells grow: Curcumin boosts brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a type of growth hormone that helps brain cells grow. It may help delay age-related mental decline, but more research is needed. To reap the benefits of curcumin, try cooking with curry powder, adding turmeric to potato dishes to turn them golden or making turmeric tea. SUMMARY: Turmeric and its active compound curcumin have strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits, which help the brain. In research, it has reduced symptoms of depression and Alzheimer’s disease. Broccoli is packed with powerful plant compounds, including antioxidants. It’s also very high in vitamin K, delivering more than 100% of the Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) in a 1-cup. This fat-soluble vitamin is essential for forming sphingolipids, a type of fat that’s densely packed into brain cells. A few studies in older adults have linked a higher vitamin K intake to better memory. Beyond vitamin K, broccoli contains a number of compounds that give it anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may help protect the brain against damage. SUMMARY: Broccoli contains a number of compounds that have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, including vitamin K. Pumpkin seeds contain powerful antioxidants that protect the body and brain from free radical damage. They’re also an excellent source of magnesium, iron, zinc and copper. Each of these nutrients is important for brain health: Zinc: This element is crucial for nerve signaling. Zinc deficiency has been linked to many neurological conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, depression and Parkinson’s disease. Magnesium: Magnesium is essential for learning and memory. Low magnesium levels are linked to many neurological diseases, including migraines, depression and epilepsy. Copper: Your brain uses copper to help control nerve signals. And when copper levels are out of whack, there’s a higher risk of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s. Iron: Iron deficiency is often characterized by brain fog and impaired brain function. The research focuses mostly on these micronutrients, rather than pumpkin seeds themselves. However, since pumpkin seeds are high in these micronutrients, you can likely reap their benefits by adding pumpkin seeds to your diet. SUMMARY: Pumpkin seeds are rich in many micronutrients that are important for brain function, including copper, iron, magnesium and zinc. Dark chocolate and cocoa powder are packed with a few brain-boosting compounds, including flavonoids, caffeine and antioxidants. Flavonoids are a group of antioxidant plant compounds. The flavonoids in chocolate gather in the areas of the brain that deal with learning and memory. Researchers say these compounds may enhance memory and also help slow down age-related mental decline. In fact, a number of studies back this up. In one study including over 900 people, those who ate chocolate more frequently performed better in a series of mental tasks, including some involving memory, than those who rarely ate it. Chocolate is also a legitimate mood booster, according to research. One study found that participants who ate chocolate experienced increased positive feelings, compared to participants who ate crackers. However, it’s still not clear whether that’s because of compounds in the chocolate, or simply because the yummy flavor makes people happy. SUMMARY: The flavonoids in chocolate may help protect the brain. Studies have suggested that eating chocolate could boost both memory and mood. Research has shown that eating nuts can improve markers of heart health, and having a healthy heart is linked to having a healthy brain. A 2014 review showed that nuts can improve cognition and even help prevent neurodegenerative diseases. Also, another large study found that women who ate nuts regularly over the course of several years had a sharper memory, compared to those who didn’t eat nuts. Several nutrients in nuts, such as healthy fats, antioxidants and vitamin E, may explain their brain-health benefits. Vitamin E shields cell membranes from free radical damage, helping slow mental decline. While all nuts are good for your brain, walnuts may have an extra edge, since they also deliver omega-3 fatty acids. SUMMARY: Nuts contain a host of brain-boosting nutrients, including vitamin E, healthy fats and plant compounds. You can get all the vitamin C you need in a day by eating one medium orange Doing so is important for brain health, since vitamin C is a key factor in preventing mental decline. Eating sufficient amounts of vitamin C-rich foods can protect against age-related mental decline and Alzheimer’s disease, according to a 2014 review. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that helps fight off the free radicals that can damage brain cells. Plus, vitamin C supports brain health as you age. You can also get excellent amounts of vitamin C from bell peppers, guava, kiwi, tomatoes. SUMMARY: Oranges and other foods that are high in vitamin C can help defend your brain against damage from free radicals. Eggs are a good source of several nutrients tied to brain health, including vitamins B6 and B12, folate and choline. Choline is an important micronutrient that your body uses to create acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood and memory. Two studies found that higher intakes of choline were linked to better memory and mental function. Nevertheless, many people don’t get enough choline in their diet. Eating eggs is an easy way to get choline, given that egg yolks are among the most concentrated sources of this nutrient. Adequate intake of choline is 425 mg per day for most women and 550 mg per day for men, with just a single egg yolk containing 112 mg. Furthermore, the B vitamins have several roles in brain health. To start, they may help slow the progression of mental decline in the elderly. Also, being deficient in two types of B vitamins — folate and B12 — has been linked to depression. Folate deficiency is common in elderly people with dementia, and studies show that folic acid supplements can help minimize age-related mental decline. B12 is also involved in synthesizing brain chemicals and regulating sugar levels in the brain. It’s worth noting that there’s very little direct research on the link between eating eggs and brain health. However, there is research to support the brain-boosting benefits of the nutrients found in eggs. SUMMARY: Eggs are a rich source of several B vitamins and choline, which are important for proper brain functioning and development, as well as regulating mood. As is the case with coffee, the caffeine in green tea boosts brain function. In fact, it has been found to improve alertness, performance, memory and focus . But green tea also has other components that make it a brain-healthy beverage. One of them is L-theanine, an amino acid that can cross the blood-brain barrier and increase the activity of the neurotransmitter GABA, which helps reduce anxiety and makes you feel more relaxed. L-theanine also increases the frequency of alpha waves in the brain, which helps you relax without making you feel tired. One review found that the L-theanine in green tea can help you relax by counteracting the stimulating effects of caffeine. It’s also rich in polyphenols and antioxidants that may protect the brain from mental decline and reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s and. Plus, green tea has been found to improve memory. SUMMARY: Green tea is an excellent beverage to support your brain. Its caffeine content boosts alertness, while its antioxidants protect the brain and L-theanine helps you relax. Some foods, such as the fruits and vegetables in this list, as well as tea and coffee, have antioxidants that help protect your brain from damage. Others, such as nuts and eggs, contain nutrients that support memory and brain development. You can help support your brain health and boost your alertness, memory and mood by strategically including these foods in your diet. For more information please visit: https://nplink.net/8y73iswn"
19,Help For Pain Behind The Knee,health-fitness," Knee pain is extremely common and there are many people who suffer with it. Surprisingly, even more complain of knee pain in a specific location…. Behind the knee! Yes, there are many condition that cause knee pain in the medial or lateral sides, deep inside the joint or under the knee cap. However it seems one of the most common complaints is pain behind or in back of the knee. If you’re a posterior knee pain sufferer yourself or just want to help someone you know with pain behind the knee, keep reading this article to learn some of the causes and helpful guidance for treatment options. People who suffer with pain behind the knee are generally at the end of their rope when they finally show up at the doctor’s office. This condition is as common as it is debilitating and many posterior knee pain patients have similar complaints. While relentless pain in back of the knee is common amongst all, most sufferers differ in when/how they get the pain. Some can’t fully straighten their knee, yet others have more pain when bending it a certain degree. Most have trouble with stairs, with the majority having the worst pain behind the knee when going down. Few posterior knee pain patients can run, while many have interruptions or inability with prolonged walking. Many also have trouble with pain and swelling behind the knee at night. Pain behind the knee can come from several different causes. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but rather a place to get started and some important bases to cover. A proper diagnosis is extremely important as it will dictate the type of treatment; the wrong diagnosis often sends many patients into the wrong direction, ending up with unnecessary medication and surgeries that cause more harm than good. Here are some of the causes of pain behind the knee or in back of the knee joint…. Baker’s Cyst – this is a fluid filled sac that develops behind the knee, in the soft tissue in back of the knee joint. These can grow to as big as a golfball for some, however is usually the size of a jumbo marble for most; they are often asymptomatic. Baker’s Cysts are fairly common but few cause pain behind the knee or much disruption. Many patients have Baker’s Cysts and never even know it. In symptomatic cases, patients complain of stiffness and pain upon bending the knee, sometimes pain with straightening, but rarely cause trouble with walking/running. Baker’s cysts are considered benign and removal is often not recommended unless causing severe pain. When they do have to be removed, the surgery is not considered simple however arthroscopy can sometimes be used. Neuritis – this is an inflammation of a peripheral nerve. It occurs frequently when nerves are  pinched from spinal misalignments. Sometimes inflammation will build in sections of a pinched nerve and cause symptoms in these areas, for example behind the knee. Neuritis from a pinched nerve in the spine is as common as it is a frequent cause of many sufferers of posterior knee pain. Misalignment of the knee joint – This mostly occurs from hyperextension injuries but also repetitive motions and degenerative arthritis. Unlike a Baker’s Cyst, misalignments causing pain in back of the knee usually give symptoms when locking or straightening, not bending. Patients with this problem also commonly have pain going down stairs, rather than up. Degeneration of the knee joint – Osteoarthritis is the slow wear and tear of the knee joint. After a certain amount of deterioration, different areas of the knee may have pain; in back of the joint is one of the areas. Usually pain from osteoarthritis/bone on bone knee conditions are when upright, getting up from sitting or at night. Deterioration of the knee joint may also cause reduced range of motion and pain behind the knee can occur from bending as well. Treatment While surgery may be the only way out if pain behind the knee is coming from a Baker’s Cyst, take heed a word of caution before jumping into treatment. In many cases a Baker’s Cyst may show on x-ray/exam however is asymptomatic, while the pain is coming from a neuritis. Beware of traditional medical practitioners who fail to rule out pinched nerve causes first and rush into surgery; an accurate diagnosis is paramount to receiving the correct treatment. Severe pain in back of the knee caused by a misalignment or neuritis is best handled by a good chiropractor who has experience in treatment of extremities. If posterior knee pain is the result of degenerative arthritis, regenerative medicine shows the greatest promise for not only pain relief but also improving joint space. Human tissue cellular allograft injections directly into bone on bone joints is providing many patients with restoration of function and new options for alternatives to joint replacement surgery."
20,"Medical Marijuana Providers Need Billing, Payment Processing Options",health-fitness," Billing & Payment Processing for Medical Marijuana Cannabis A Proven Commodity Marijuana Cannabis is projected to be one of the fastest-growing industries over the next decade. Worldwide cannabis sales more than tripled, from $3.4 billion to $10.9 billion between 2014 and 2018, and Wall Street has forecast that sales will grow $30 billion by 2025. In the U.S., State and Commonwealth medical marijuana laws have changed expeditiously. Cannabis has become a viable medical product for treating conditions such as Parkinson’s Disease, cancer, arthritis, and neurological disorders. The Challenges in Medical Unfortunately, those that own/operate medical marijuana practices encounter an assortment of challenges because of a refusal of major financial institutions, private insurance companies – as well as the federal government – to assist them financially. Since cannabis is a controlled substance on the federal level, many banks look at legal businesses selling marijuana products as not worthy of their assistance, refusing them financial support and making it exceedingly complicated to maintain their profits. Truth is, as this all goes mainstream – 33 states now have legalized medicinal uses of cannabis – entrée to insurance and banking services continues to be a major point of frustration throughout the medical marijuana chain. Furthermore, for many healthcare providers (not just medical marijuana operations) it's compulsory to run cash only businesses, which can only lead to more aggravation. The cannabis industry has been a cash-only industry since its inception, mainly because cannabis businesses aren’t able to do business with federally licensed banks, major private, insurance companies. Medicare / Medicaid will not cover for specific medical marijuana services and prescriptions. There are several ways, however, to navigate these roadblocks by employing alternative solutions that can significantly benefit those in medical marijuana. One alternative solution is referred to as cannabis payment processing companies and billing groups (those that will bill for services outside of marijuana treatment, but still in-house), but there are a few things you need to know before choosing the right one. Make sure your Payment Processing Company Understands the Complicated Legal Jargon Nothing in the business world is easy and stress-free, and that goes for marijuana payment processing solutions as well. We’ve described that marijuana processing is not a simple undertaking and the most important thing you’ll want to do is put your business in the hands of a 3rd party company that knows how to deal with the legalities immersed within the industry. To process marijuana payments, it’s critical that your payment processing company understands the legal issues of the cannabis industry, and just as critical, has the know-how to deal with hostile circumstances where legal authorities have doubts about activities on your account and may try to freeze your money. Look for an Experience Medical Marijuana Payment Processing Company It’s critical to be mindful that marijuana continues to be identified as a Schedule 1 drug, and there are federal and local protocols and laws that a well-thought-of bill processing company must adhere to. When looking for a marijuana payment processing company, it’s imperative to inquire how they deal with any sizeable volume passing through their system. Unfortunately, many third-party processors will gleefully transact your money, but when your business begins to grow, they’ll leave you hanging out to dry. The more transactions they process, the more they have to be accountable for those transactions. Always search for a long-term partner that can deliver a total solution, and that will be completely transparent about all fees and logistics from day one. In short, look for a processor who is eager to form a long-term relationship and not just close a short-term deal. Also, be sure the company can provide a merchant account for any cannabis-related business, including eCommerce, CBD products, and cannabis paraphernalia. Here's a good list of those that provide cannabis-friendly payment processing. Start Small; Think + Plan Big We’re in this struggle together. Marijuana payment processing companies depend on and operate with specific vendors and businesses, so it’s in their best interest to defend and support the “small fries” (and currently compromised) as much as possible. Of course, they’ll have to make a profit, but a good payment processor will demonstrate a “thank you” for your business. Additionally, when dealing with a processor that takes a genuine interest, you won’t receive boilerplate e-mails or have to call them a dozen times simply to get a response. If you're a start-up and just getting underway, searching for a reputable medical marijuana processing solution or are looking for a better way to navigate the medical cannabis industry, don’t be anxious about working with a company that fits your budget and needs. Marijuana Billing Plenty of successful medical marijuana providers have discovered the benefits that outsourced medical billing can bring. From the get-go, you'll need a medical (marijuana) billing company that can provide an immediate solution – one that: Has a thorough understanding of the legal issues of the medical cannabis industry Will completely take care of the billing for you Has an in-depth knowledge of coding and payer guidelines Can follow-up on incomplete documentation Can perform stringent audits and verification process(es) Offers fast turnarounds of claim submissions Provides fast follow-up of rejections Can assess your current compliance and privacy programs and identify areas of non-compliance Can make sure money keeps flowing into your practice Enables you to spend more time with customers and internal business tasks Benjamin Franklin is quoted as saying, “If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail.” We cannot stress enough the importance of sound planning when it comes to the medical cannabis industry. That’s why we ask that you give us a call to discuss how we can help you plot a course through this sometimes difficult pathway. Medwave offers all of these marijuana billing benefits, plus others too numerous to list."

2,Imposters! All Around Us,health-fitness," Did you ever feel like you didn't belong? That all your achievements and accomplishments are fraud and you got them only by chance? If your answer is yes, then you are not alone. Imposter syndrome or phenomenon is defined as experienced anxiety induced by the individual’s feelings of fraudulence, fear of being revealed as a fraud, and incapacity to internalize private achievement (Clark et al., 2014). People with impostor syndrome fail to correctly assign their success to their real competence; they usually attribute accomplishments to external variables such as chance or support from others and attribute failures as proof of their professional inadequacy. Self-doubt affects people at all levels in various ways, it is estimated that 9 to 82% of the population are affected in a way or another (Bravata et al., 2019). Dr. Valerie Young in her book “The secret thoughts of successful women: Why capable people suffer from the impostor syndrome and how to thrive in spite of it” defines five  separate imposter syndrome subtypes based on self-imposed competence evaluations: 1- Perfectionist: Perceives competence as excellence of 100%. Anything short of that is known as a failure. This person often reflects on how things could have been better done. 2- Natural genius: Measures competence by how easily the accomplishment reached him/her. Hard work and perseverance are considered negative traits because this individual believes that they should have achieved success more naturally. 3- Superman/woman or super student: Perceives competence as an ability to simultaneously juggle different tasks and obligations. Even in the sense of major achievements, falling even marginally short in one position (parent, caregiver, researcher, etc) constitutes overall failure. 4- Expert: Measures competence by the amount of skills or expertise. Due to a lack of expertise, this person fears being revealed as inexperienced. 5- Soloist: Perceive competence only if the accomplishment has been completely accomplished on its own without the assistance of external resources. Asking for support is perceived to be a sign of failure. Why do we experience imposter syndrome? There is no single reason identified. Some researchers suggest that it has to do with personality traits—such as anxiety or neuroticism. However, imposter syndrome is not recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Classification of Diseases as a psychological disorder. Other researchers concentrate on family or behavioral factors such as Professionals of the first generation, people with high-achieving parents, members of minority communities, or people for whom success came quickly (Sherman, 2013). Strategies to overcome Impostor Syndrome Imposter syndrome can generate anxiety about success and lead to burnout and depression. It is therefore important to learn how to handle these feelings. Here you can find some useful strategies that may help you ( Chandra et al., 2019): 1- Recognizing the imposter syndrome and calling the impostor-like emotions for what they are is the most important initial step in coping with it. This will allow one to comprehend the feelings of inadequacy and fraudulence in a proper context. 2- Ask for objective and real input from mentors and trustworthy peers. You can distinguish what's true from your illusions of insecurity by expressing your insecurities with someone you trust and admire. 3- Create a list of the qualities you have. Take the time to list your strengths and what you are contributing to. Ask others for feedback, and in times of self-doubt, refer to the list. 4- Break the impostor-like thought loop.Thought stopping and shipping are two approaches that can be used to modify thought patterns. The cornerstone of the thought-stopping approach is to be mindful of negative thoughts and to substitute something more positive for them. It helps one to create a more optimistic and uncritical view of one's abilities by rooting these positive thoughts into self-compassion and kindness towards oneself. Though shipping represents the concept of not waiting until an idea is flawless before releasing or introducing it. Shipping pushes one beyond the comfort zone, which is a powerful stimulus for growth and innovation, especially for the imposter syndrome subtypes of perfectionists and experts. 5-  Professional therapy and counseling can also provide insight to interrupt the impostor-like thought loop if needed. Overall, there are moments of doubt most people encounter, and that's natural. The crucial part is not to let your actions be controlled by that doubt. References Bravata, D. M., Watts, S.

4,How To Have Twins: a Fertility Expert tells you the truth,health-fitness," We get a lot of questions from couples about the chance to have twins with fertility treatments. Much of what is out there is wrong so this article will explain how women get pregnant with twins. So today I will separate the fact from fiction. Types of twins: Most people are familiar with the fact that there are basically two types of twins. The first type are identical twins identical twins arise from a split in the embryo shortly after fertilization. Facts about identical twins: Identical twins are uncommon only about 3 to 4 of every 1000 births are identical twins identical twins make up about one third of all twins with a few rare exceptions. This doesn't seem to very much based on where you live or other factors. Identical twins don't generally run in families though there are some very rare families where it might happen. These rare families point to the possibility that there might be genes that increase the chance for identical twins. Clomid chance for identical twins: Though scientists have not yet been able to pin down any specific genes yet the fertility medication Clomid is well known to increase the chance for fraternal twins. But this 2006 study also found that the proportion of identical twins was higher when twins occurred with Clomid compared to a group of naturally occurring twins. IVF chance for identical twins: The only well-documented factor that increases the risk of identical twins is IVF. Growing embryos in the laboratory seems to increase the chance that an embryo will split. The longer they stay in the lab the greater the chance for embryo transfers that occur after growing embryos for two to three days. Identical twins occur about 1 to 2 percent of the time waiting until the blastocyst stage at five to six days increases the chances to about two to three percent and making a hole in the shell surrounding the embryo known as assisted hatching, roughly doubles the chance that the embryo will split. Facts about fraternal (non-identical twins): Fraternal twins are a lot more interesting. Fraternal twins arise from fertilization of two different eggs by two different sperm. There are several factors that seem to influence a woman having fraternal twins naturally. That is without the use of fertility drugs. Sub-Saharan Africa sees about 23 fraternal twins for every 1000 births. Asian countries have about 5 per 1000 births. The U.S. is in the middle with about 10 to 12 per 1000 births that occur naturally. Body type and the chance for fraternal twins Tall women appear to have one and a half to two times the chance for twins in some studies but not in others. Women with a BMI over 30 had a 62 percent higher chance of twins and women with a BMI less than 20 had a 38 percent lower chance for twins. Family history (genetics): Fraternal twins do run in families for a given couple. If twins run in the female's family or if the woman herself has a twin, the couple has a higher chance for twins themselves. If twins are in the male's family, the couple doesn't have a higher chance for twins. But if the couple have daughters they will have a higher chance for twins. The overall impact of family history may increase the chance for a twin by one and a half to two times. So about 15 to 20 twins per 1000 deliveries age. Female age: It is true that as women get older they have a higher chance of releasing more than one egg at the time of ovulation. And so they have a higher chance of a twin pregnancy. The impact here is pretty strong. Women in their late 30s and early 40s have about four times the chance for twins compared to women in their late teens. The twin rate in older women is about 40 per 1000 births. Food (diet) to have twins: Some people have theorized that the reason why some regions in Africa like Nigeria have a higher twin rate is because of the presence of yams in their diet. The evidence here however is extremely weak. Dairy products: One small study suggested that the milk from cows that received a growth hormone would have higher levels of a hormone called IGF 1 and that women who drink the milk from these cows would therefore have higher IGF 1 levels themselves which would in turn stimulate the ovaries to produce multiple eggs. However studies in women who drank a lot of milk found no increase in their IGF 1 levels. Dairy products are unlikely to influence the chance for twins. Medications (Metformin, Folic acid): Metformin is a medication that is used to induce ovulation in women with PCOS. Metformin does not increase the risk for twins. Folic acid or folate is a supplement that all women should take if they are planning to become pregnant since it reduces the risk of certain birth defects. The evidence is mixed here with some studies showing a slight increase in twins and other studies finding no increase. At this point the weight of evidence argues against any effect. Letrozole (Femara): this medication is used to induce ovulation in women with PCOS. Studies have found a twin rate of 10 percent or higher or at least one hundred twins per 1000 pregnancies. Clomid or Clomiphene citrate has about the same rate of twins as Letrozole. Injectable fertility medications like Follistim or Gonal F has a twin rate of 25 to 30 percent and a pretty substantial rate of triplets and quadruplets. Now with IVF the rate of fraternal twins depends primarily on the number of embryos transferred. If two embryos are transferred in a world class IVF program, the chance for twin pregnancy exceeds 60 percent."
5,How to Slow Down Aging and Stay Younger for Longer,health-fitness," We all have the desire to stay young for the rest of our life. Researchers ran some experiments on 1000 volunteers. Although their age was 38 years, their health was as good as that of those who were 20 years old. According to many research studies, it was concluded that genetics play only 20% role as far as aging is concerned. The rest of the 80% impact comes from factors related to lifestyle and environment. Given below are some tips that can help you stay younger much longer. Read on to know more. According to experts, the ends of chromosomes in your body have an impact on the aging process of your cells. You will age faster if your telomeres are shorter. And one of the primary factors that make the telomeres shorter is stress. Therefore, it is important that you manage your stress. There are many ways to manage stress, such as meditation, regular exercise, and a healthy diet. The idea is to get rid of negative thoughts and situations. Many research studies have proven that those who live in a friendly and safe environment enjoy a longer lifespan. Apart from this, married couples and people who maintain their friendships also enjoy longer life spans. Researchers suggest that you have at least 6 friends to keep your mental health in check. If you restrict your caloric intake, you can slow down your metabolism and stay young much longer. But you may not want to compromise on your nutrition levels. In other words, you may want to make some adjustments to your diet. First of all, you may want to exclude all kinds of junk food from your menu. Apart from this, you may want to include some anti-aging foods in your diet. Some good examples of these include turmeric, avocado, salmon, nuts and blueberries. It is important to exercise on a daily basis. But that does not mean that you don't need to train your brain. If you want to rack your brain, you can read good books, learn a foreign language, and enjoy playing your favorite games. By keeping your brain active throughout the day, you can slow down your aging process. If you use artificial cosmetics, we suggest that you switch to natural products instead. Apart from this, you may want to make it a habit to clean your face on a daily basis, especially if you cannot avoid artificial cosmetics. Today, researchers have found that spending at least 12 minutes in the sun is good for your health. Actually, you get vitamin D from the sunlight. However, make sure that you sit in the sun before midday. In short, if you make these lifestyle changes, you can stay healthy and enjoy a longer lifespan. Hopefully, these tips will help you achieve your goals."
6,What is Nitric Oxide (N.O.)?,health-fitness," N.O. is short for nitric oxide. The good news is that N.O. products offer a lot of benefits for athletes, youngsters and old age people. As a matter of fact, these products can have a significant impact on your sexual health. Let's find out more about it. Basically, your body is a natural generator of this gas called N.O. The function of this element is to have your body cells communicate with each other through the transmission of signals. In other words, this agreement is a primary requirement for many psychological functions in your body. N.O. plays an important role as far as the treatment of many health challenges is concerned, such as diabetes, opacity, insomnia, and libido, just to name a few. This is the reason N.O. boosters are quite popular among people of all ages. N.O. can act as an intracellular messenger, neurotransmitter, and hormone.

7,The coronavirus - what exactly is it?,health-fitness," The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which comprises zoonotic viruses found in birds and mammals. Symptoms of a SARS-CoV-2 infection include fever, weakness and fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, and difficulty breathing. The coronavirus - is China the source of the epidemic? For several months now, the world has been trembling with fear of the newly discovered coronavirus. In just a few weeks, the virus has spread from Asia to almost all continents. The vast majority of coronavirus cases are still located in China, in the Hubei province (and its capital of Wuhan). The incredible amount of untrue information spread by the media has caused a lot of disinformation and fear. Here are some facts about the coronavirus that also answer the most common questions about it. The coronavirus - name The official name of the Wuhan coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2. This is because of the virus' genetic similarity to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which caused an epidemic in Asia in 2003. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is called COVID-19. The coronavirus - vaccine Work on a potential COVID-19 vaccine is ongoing in many research centers around the world. The structure of the virus is being studied, especially its surface glycoproteins, which could potentially be used to create an effective vaccine. So far, no human trials have been started. The coronavirus – victims An estimate based on the number of infected patients and recorded deaths indicates a mortality rate of approximately 2.3% (that is, approximately 2.3% of all infected patients are likely to die). SARS-CoV-2 would therefore be 20 times more lethal than the influenza virus. However, scientists say the calculation method used to receive this number is flawed because the number of tested infected patients might not reflect the actual number of infections. The vast majority of infected experience only mild symptoms of the disease, and some are completely asymptomatic - these people tend to be ignored in statistics. So the virulence of the Wuhan virus might be much smaller - right now it is impossible to know for sure. Is it true that the virus spares young and healthy people? So far, no cases of Wuhan coronavirus have been reported in people under the age of 9. Mortality of patients aged 10-49 ranges from 0.2% to 0.4%. However, for patients over 80, the risk of death is almost 15%. Illnesses such as: cardiovascular diseases (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), chronic respiratory diseases (6.3%), hypertension (6%), cancer (5.6%) increase the risk of death of patients infected with SARS-COV-2 compared to the population not burdened with comorbidities (the average risk equals 0.9% for all age groups combined). The coronavirus - spread SARS-CoV-2 is spread by droplet route. A sick person spreads the virus over a distance of about 1 meter when sneezing or coughing. Saliva droplets containing the virus settle on objects. Infection is also possible through contact with infected secretions and rubbing them into your mucous membranes (eyes, mouth, or nose). Has the coronavirus reached Poland yet? On March 4, 2020, the first case of the coronavirus was confirmed in Poland. So far, a total of 67,372 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in Poland (as of 01/09/2020). 2,039 people have died as a result of infection. The coronavirus - how to prevent getting sick? The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a set of recommendations whose application should reduce the risk of transmission and infection with the virus. Regularly wash your hands with soap or an alcohol-based preparation. Avoid approaching sick people at a distance of less than 1 meter. Avoiding touching your mouth, nose, and eyes. Cover your mouth with your elbow when sneezing or coughing to reduce the spread of the virus. Stay home if you have any symptoms that might suggest being infected (fever, weakness and fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, difficulty breathing). It is worth implementing this point in the case of all infectious diseases, e.g. influenza. If you develop symptoms after contact with someone at the site of the epidemic, immediately contact the infectious diseases ward."
8,Management of Unerupted Lateral Incisor by LASER Assisted Surgical Exposure,health-fitness," Introduction- Maxillary incisors are aesthetically important, parents often notices it first and are troubled. The children are bullied or teased due to delayed eruption resulting in psychological complications. It is necessary to bring the unerupted incisor into its correct position with proper monitoring and timely surgical orthodontic intervention so as no prosthetic solution is required as nothing is better than tooth itself. LASER have its advantages over conventional scalpel for the surgical exposure of the unerupted incisors. Diagnosis of unerupted incisors- A) Clinical evaluation- Firstly patient’s chronological age and dental age should be examined to determine if there is delayed eruption or not. The amount of space available for the eruption of tooth, space loss, midline shift, position of the adjacent teeth, and contour of the bone should be examined Palpation of the labial bulge on the mucosa if visible and if not visible then evaluation by radiograph The distance from the mucogingival junction - An adequate amount of keratinized gingival tissue that is under proper plaque control, is a fundamental requirement for periodontal health. Labially or buccally erupting teeth show reduced dimensions of gingiva as abnormal eruption of permanent teeth restricts or eliminates the keratinized tissue between the erupting cusp and the deciduous tooth. A lack of attached gingiva (keratinized gingiva) poses a potential risk for gingival recession in labially or buccally erupted teeth due to the possibility of accumulation of plaque and/or traumatic tooth-brushing. B) Radiographic evaluation- The accurate location of the unerupted lateral incisor by the conventional two - dimensional radiographs is done. For the exact estimation of buccolingual position a second periodical film is obtained by using a) Clark’s rule b) Buccal-object rule. CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) can be used to avoid multiple exposure and to know the accurate position of the tooth. Firstly determine the presence of lateral incisors and if bone is present on the erupting tooth buds The amount of root formed In this case the patient’s chronological age was 9 years suggesting of delayed eruption of lateral incisor. Palpation of the painless incompressible labial fibromucosal protuberance or bulge is done to locate the crown. It is supported by the intraoral periapical radiograph. No bone is seen on the crown of the unerupted lateral incisor. The location and size of window to be made during surgical exposure is determined to be 1mm below the mucogingival junction. Treatment- Pioon S1 blue dental LASER of 450 nm wavelength was used for the surgical exposure of lateral incisor. This consist of following steps: Isolation of area followed by application of topical anaesthetic agent. Marking the shape, extent and site of window of exposure by making dots with LASER at lesser power settings using 400 micron tip. (Fig 1) Removal of the tissue at higher power setting with 400 micron tip in non-contact mode. The complete safety protocols were followed for the patient, operating and assistant staff like using laser protective eye glasses and use of high vacuum suction. Highly reflective instruments were avoided while using lasers. (Fig 2) Rationale for the use of LASER- LASER assisted surgical procedure has various advantages. Incision performance, hemostasis, reduced pre and post-operative oedema and pain hence the accelerated wound healing and reduced healing time resulting in less discomfort and reduced need of analgesics. In paediatric patient behavioural guidance of children in the operative and perioperative period is a special challenge. Use of topical anaesthetic agent, no scalpel and less blood results in better cooperation from the children. It also aids in patient homecare and allows for better bracket repositioning and final detailing. Conclusion - When unerupted tooth is not deeply placed, surgical exposure with Pioon LASER at 450 nm allows conservation of attached gingiva, no injection, less bleeding during surgery, less use of analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs, minimal postoperative complication and also immediate placement of orthodontic brackets so less appointments as well. Hence LASER represents indispensable modality to treat paediatric patients with ease. References- 1)HuBer K, Suri, Taneja P. Eruption disturbances of the maxillary incisors: a literature review.

9,Psychiatric Nursing: All Your Questions Answered,health-fitness," Unlike physical ailments which generally have an obvious cause and treatment plan, mental illness can be harder to diagnose and treat. Furthermore, while attitudes are changing, there is still a stigma associated with seeking therapy or treatment. In this blog post, we’ll dive into the critical role a psychiatric nurse plays in mental health settings. We’ll explore where psychiatric nurses work, what types of conditions they treat and much more. Keep reading to learn more about this in demand field. What is a psychiatric nurse? A psychiatric nurse, also known as a behavioral health nurse or a mental health nurse, works with patients that are receiving treatment for a variety of mental illnesses. Since mental illness can occur at any point in life, patients range in age from children to the elderly. In addition to treating psychiatric disorders, behavioral health nurses also help patients address the stigma associated with their mental health issue(s). It is a career path that blends psychology, psychiatry and nursing. Due to the complex nature of their patients’ condition(s), psych nurses work as part of a behavioral health team. Psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and occupational therapists are just a few of the specialties that behavioral health nurses frequently interact with. What types of conditions does a psychiatric nurse treat? A psychiatric nurse works with patients experiencing a wide variety of disorders and mental illnesses. Below are some of the most common disorders that psych nurses encounter: Addiction Disorders – Addiction disorders are defined as a complex disease of the brain and body that involves the compulsive use of one or more substances (i.e. drugs and/or alcohol). Patients with addiction disorders persist in compulsive behaviors despite serious health and/or social consequences. Dementia Disorders – Dementia is a general term that is used to describe a loss of memory, language and/or problem-solving abilities. Dementia disorders most frequently occur in geriatric populations. While Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, patients may also suffer from vascular, frontotemporal and/or Lewy body dementia. Eating Disorders – An eating disorder is a serious mental illness in which people experience severe disturbances in their eating behaviors and related thoughts/emotions. Anorexia, bulimia and binge eating disorder are the three most common types of eating disorders. Anxiety, panic and obsessive-compulsive disorders typically accompany an eating disorder. Mood Disorders – Patients with mood disorders experience an emotional state (or mood) that is distorted or inconsistent with their circumstances, impairing their ability to function. They may experience feelings of apathy, worthlessness and sadness or extreme mania. Depression and bipolar disorder are the two most common types of mood disorders. Psychotic Disorders – Psychotic disorders are a group of serious illnesses that affect the mind. They make it hard for patients to think clearly, make good judgments, respond emotionally, communicate effectively, understand reality and behave appropriately. Two of the main symptoms associated with psychotic disorders are delusions and hallucinations. What are the typical job duties for a mental health nurse? Mental health nurses play a critical role in assessing and diagnosing patients. Consequently, much of their work centers around monitoring symptoms and behaviors and providing short- or long-term care. While specific job responsibilities vary by practice setting, some of the most common job duties include: Gauging a patient’s psychiatric state; Collaborating on psychiatric intervention plans; Administering psychotropic and similar medications; Ordering and interpreting diagnostic tests; Monitoring adherence to non-medical treatment regimens; Removing potentially harmful or triggering environmental features; Recording a patient’s health journey and reporting on notable alterations; and Educating family members about a patient’s condition and care plan. Where do psychiatric registered nurses work? Psychiatric registered nurses work wherever mental health services are provided. This means they work in both in-patient and out-patient settings. An in-patient care setting refers to places where a patient is admitted for care and includes places like hospitals, in-patient mental health facilities and state/federal correctional facilities. Out-patient care settings typically include local clinics and home healthcare organizations. It can even include schools that serve individuals with emotional and mental issues. What education and/or experience does a psychiatric nurse need to have? To become a psychiatric nurse, an individual must first obtain an Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN) or a Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing (BSN). After fulfilling their program’s educational requirements, the individual must take and pass the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX-RN). Two years of work experience as a full-time registered nurse may also be required by an employer before starting work as a psychiatric nurse. Because the psychiatric field is highly complex, many employers require their clinicians to hold a current Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing Certification (RN-BC). This certification is available through the American Nurses Credential Center (ANCC) and is valid for five years. Additional psychiatric nursing certifications that allow clinicians to treat patients with specific disorders, substance abuse matters, etc. are also available through the ANCC. After working in the field for an extended period, many psych nurses choose to pursue an advanced degree (i.e. Master of Science in Nursing, Doctor of Nursing Practice). While pursuing this level of education requires a substantial investment of time, it allows clinicians to practice in the broadest range of settings. In some states, clinicians with these advanced degrees can operate private practices and prescribe medications. What skills are needed to succeed as a psychiatric nurse? To succeed as a psychiatric nurse, a clinician must possess the following skills: Interpersonal Communication – A substantial portion of a psych nurse’s job is assessing and diagnosing patients. For that reason, psych nurses need to be comfortable and confident initiating conversations with patients and their family members. Furthermore, psych nurses work as part of an interdisciplinary team and they need to effectively communicate with other medical professionals. Problem-Solving – When it comes to diagnosing and treating mental health issues, the root cause of a patient’s condition may not be immediately obvious. For that reason, behavioral health nurses must be diligent in asking the right questions and looking for cause-and-effect relationships. This helps ensure that the right course of treatment is delivered in a timely and effective manner. Observation – Patients receiving treatment for mental health issues may, through subtle behavioral changes, give off signs that they intend to hurt themselves or others. Therefore, mental health nurses must be vigilant in watching for and responding to any signs of patient distress. Reliability – Patients and their family members frequently rely upon registered psychiatric nurses for emotional support. Hence, it is extremely important that their demeanor remain consistent from day to day. The ability to maintain a positive attitude and to consistently provide an exceptional level of care is crucial to patient success. What is the career outlook for psychiatric nursing? According to the National Institute of Mental Health, nearly one in five U.S. adults lives with a mental illness (approximately 51.5M people in 2019). Additionally, the Affordable Care Act has ensured that more Americans have access to health insurance and mental health services. Given the current shortage of qualified nurses, there is (and will continue to be) a high demand for behavioral health nurses at all levels in the years to come. Given the current shortage of qualified nurses, there is (and will continue to be) a high demand for behavioral health nurses at all levels in the years to come. Why should a mental health nurse partner with a healthcare staffing agency? There are three main reasons why a mental health nurse should partner with a healthcare staffing agency: Access to Opportunities – Healthcare staffing agencies have access to psychiatric nursing positions in a variety of practice settings. This means psychiatric nurses will have a better chance of finding a position that meets their interests and requirements when they partner with a healthcare staffing agency. The Chance to Travel – Due to the growing demand for behavioral health nurses, facilities nationwide are engaging travel nurses to meet their needs. Behavior health nurses that are partnered with a healthcare staffing agency will have the opportunity to take their career on the road. Dedicated Support – While rewarding, work within the mental health field can be mentally and emotionally tough. Psych nurses that are partnered with a healthcare staffing agency (like Premier Medical Staffing Services, LLC) will have a dedicated recruiter supporting and cheering them on."
10,What diet should I eat to reduce belly fat?,health-fitness," First, the good news, when you lose fat, it’s not just your belly, you’ll lose fat wherever it sits in your body, including your chest, waist, thigh, arms, etc. What follows is the result of years of experience and a lot of failures! Losing fat is hard and there are a lot of myths. I’ve tried many and failed, taken the time to do the research and find out what really works. So, no theory, only real-life strategies that work. These are the things that I follow. Here are 8 strategies: (1) Take at least 20 minutes to eat your meal. If you do nothing else from this list, do this! Why is this so important? Once you start eating, it takes your body about 20 minutes to tell your brain that you are full. Once that message is sent, you don’t feel like eating anymore. Sadly, most of our meals don’t last that long, so we tend to overeat - because we eat fast. So - slow down. Ways to do this: Put down your fork/spoon after every bite. Chew your food at least 20 times. Don’t eat while watching TV as you will not pay attention to how fast you eat. Set a timer for 20 minutes. (2) Fill a half-your plate with veggies. This is a simple rule. Every time you sit down to eat, fill half the plate with vegetables. Which one? Any will do, so long as you like it. The only exception is the potato family as they tend to be high in carbs. Any other veggies are ok. This strategy will make sure you fill yourself with healthy food that gives you a lot of nutrients, will keep you full because of the water and fiber in the veggies and you’ll find that it slows down your meal because veggies need a fair bit of chewing. Here’s a visual that should help: (3) Eat veggies and protein first, carbs after. Put veggies on your plate first, then put protein. The last thing on your plate should be carbs (like rice, roti, tortilla, pita bread, etc). Why does this work? Because you are putting the most nutritious foods first and leaving the worst (nutrient-wise) for last. Now, remember that it’s not bad to eat carbs, it's just that we tend to eat too much and then not enough veggies and protein. By following this strategy, we fix that. If you want to skip the carbs sometimes, that’s perfectly ok. I am not suggesting zero-carb or very low carb, but lower’ carb compared to where most people are today - which is very high carb. (4) Have a glass of water before the meal. This is a great tactic to use before each meal. By doing this, you’ll be a little bit full before starting to eat. So when you eat, you will not be starving and choose silly foods. You’ll make better decisions and will also not be able to stuff yourself. And no - this will not dilute stomach acid. Given the acid levels in your stomach, you will need more than 20 liters of water to dilute your stomach acid to a point where it interferes with digestion. (5) Get 45mins of activity every day. Does not matter what it is, pick something you enjoy and will do regularly. Don’t pick something that you think is a ‘punishment’, that will backfire as you’ll then end up eating more to reward yourself for the punishment. Regular activity (preferably outdoors) is excellent for health. You should remember that fat-loss is mostly about food, so don’t expect too much from exercise alone. But it does help, so doing it regularly will definitely help. Even walking is perfectly fine. You don’t need a gym membership. Also, many people think that stomach crunches will reduce belly fat. That is not how the body works. When you lose fat, you lose it wherever the fat is on your body and the fat goes away in sheets (or layers). So you don’t need to (and cannot) target specific body parts. Just get an activity that is mild to moderate intensity, which makes you sweat and leaves you a bit out of breath. (6) Sleep at least 7hrs every night. This is the most underrated element of fat loss. If you don’t get enough sleep, your body will store fat. This is the opposite of what you want! You want to burn fat. But to do that, your body must not be under stress. Not getting enough sleep = stress. So, stop stressing your body and get more sleep. For most adults, the recommendation is 7hrs or more every day. And you cannot catch-up just over the weekend, consistency matters. Try naps if you cannot get enough at night. (7) Eat fruit, don't drink it (ie no juices). It’s very easy to get too much sugar through juices, so best to avoid them. Here’s an example - a glass of orange juice has 4–6 oranges. You can drink that juice in 2mins. Can you eat that 4–6 oranges in one go? I guess not! Fruits are rich in fiber so it's very hard to eat too much. That’s nature's way of keeping you in check. But when you juice it, you take out the fiber so it's mostly sugar and water. This is why you can overdo it and drink a lot of calories very quickly. So, avoid juices - have the fruit instead. (8) Eat nothing from a packet or box (ie no processed foods). Processed foods are really not very good for you. They have many added ingredients. These are there for 2 reasons: To give the food a long shelf life. To trick your brain into wanting more (remember ‘no one can eat just one’?). These foods have a specific mix of salt, sugar, and fat that tricks your brain into wanting more, it's like an addiction. And these flavors are developed in a laboratory by scientists. Is that the kind of food you want to eat? So be smart about such foods and give them a miss. Your body will thank you. How NOT to try and lose belly fat? Don’t rely on: magic fixes like lemon water/teas/detox diets. Random supplements. internet diets. Count calories and not pay attention to food quality. Starve yourself. Overwork yourself with too much exercise (that is bad stress)."
11,How can I effectively lose belly fat in 7 weeks?,health-fitness," The difference between fast walking and jogging is that brisk walking is more suitable for people with more flesh on the stomach. Because of the stomach is too much, jogging will put some pressure on the knee, causing sports injuries. But walking quickly can avoid the damage of the knee, and the same amount of heat is not reduced, the effect is also very obvious. Swimming For people with more belly fat, swimming can protect the joints while achieving a systemic fat loss effect. Swimming under the pressure of water, has a certain massage effect on the joints of the body, if swimming for one hour, it can be equivalent to running twice an hour. Especially for friends who are seriously obese, swimming is the best choice for all sports. Food The culprit of the fat on the stomach is, of course, inseparable from eating. When you open your legs, it is very important to control your mouth. Therefore, the control of diet is the most important thing to reduce the stomach. Reducing the intake of fat is the key to losing weight. After that, with exercise, it is difficult to think about it. Unoisetion Cavitation 2.0 is offering a new treatment which we believe can potentially replace traditional cavitation. Unoisetion customers can get results they are satisfied with, without having to undertake buzzing and noise in ears How Unoisetion Cavitation 2.0 Work? Unoisetion Cavitation W.0 therapy makes it possible to apply concentrated levels of unionization cavitation 2.0 energy to specific treatment areas. This type of therapy targets and destroys subcutaneous fat cells in the fat cell membranes through a series of microscopic implosions. Once the fat cell membrane (adipose tissue) is destroyed, the fat is discharged between the cells where they are turned into protein and then changed to free fatty acids and glycerol. Free fatty acids are moved to the liver where they decay and are removed from the body while water-soluble glycerol is transported to the circulatory system and used as energy. With collective strong sound wave head, unionization strong sound wave of 40000HZ may be emitted to vibrate fat cells at top speed and produce numerous vacuum air pockets inside and outside the fat cells, robustly impact fat cells to generate introverted blast and disintegrate triglyceride into glycerol and free fatty acids. Then RF waves at a frequency of 1MHZ are used for exhausting the integrated glycerol and free fatty acids through hepatoenteral circulation. Finally, vacuum RF and energy electrode are used for positioning and tightening fat. In physics, it is known as ""cavitation"".

14,The Secret to Weight Loss,health-fitness," The secret to weight loss is actually very simple-burn more calories in the body every day than intake. Although the reason is simple, in real life, it is not easy to do. The source of protein, the choice of food and even the way of cooking will affect the final weight loss effect. Therefore, it is very difficult for people who are just starting a weight loss plan to succeed. If you are tired of strict calorie control diets and unsavory meal replacement products, and you are standing on the scale day after day but find that your weight has not changed at all, this article may be what you need to study carefully. I provide you with 8 best nutritional weight loss methods to help you achieve your ideal weight. These changes may seem small, but they can make a huge difference in your weight loss path. Choose high-fiber carbohydrates When it comes to weight loss, people usually choose low carbohydrates or high carbohydrates and low fat. However, reducing carbohydrate intake will directly reduce the macronutrients necessary for the human body, which is not good for health and therefore undesirable. First of all, the most important key is to know that carbohydrates are divided into two types-simple and complex. Simple carbohydrates are fast-release monosaccharides, and monosaccharides are the main source of energy; complex carbohydrates are foods such as rice and pasta, which are low in sugar and can continuously release energy. When losing weight, choosing low-calorie, high-fiber foods can not only continuously supply energy to the body, but also avoid turning to unhealthy snacks because of hunger. Whole grains (such as brown rice, whole wheat bread, and oats) and legumes (such as beans and lentils) are ideal choices. Don't reduce meals If you want to omit a meal of the day, thinking that this will help your weight loss plan, you are wrong. Generally, one of the main reasons that low-calorie diets can only produce short-term results is because the human body needs at least 1,200 calories a day to maintain normal functioning. The human body has a very sophisticated scientific operating mechanism. In order to protect itself and maintain survival, when you eat less, it is equivalent to saying to your body: ""Don't burn any calories."" Your body will receive this information, and will automatically reduce your metabolism, thereby reducing calorie consumption and retaining as much calories as possible. In other words, you will burn less calories than usual (when not losing weight). Therefore, it is very important to keep eating three meals normally for weight loss. Eating one meal can only have the opposite effect. If your life is very busy, you can also use meal replacements, such as MYBAR slimming protein bars to ensure a balanced diet. No carbonated drinks Carbonated drinks are typical representatives of ""empty calorie"" foods. Empty calories foods refer to foods that contain high calories, but do not contain (or have very little) vitamins, minerals and protein, and are completely devoid of any nutrients. In other words, empty-calorie foods usually only contain simple sugars, and in addition to rapid energy production, simple sugars do not have any additional nutritional effects on the human body. A can of 330ml of soda is equivalent to 6-8 tablespoons of sugar-that is, 140 calories of empty calories, and without any vitamins and mineral nutrients. Limit juice intake You may wonder why drinking fruit juice will affect the weight loss effect? Although fruits are rich in vitamins and minerals that the human body needs, don't forget-they also contain calories. A small orange contains about 10 grams of carbohydrates (fructose), so think about it, how many oranges are needed to make a glass of juice? At least 3-4. In other words, a glass of orange juice contains 30 to 40 grams of carbohydrates = 120 to 160 calories. The solution is also very simple, use fruit instead of drinking juice. Drink a cup of tea or coffee Green tea and coffee have fat burning properties (the fat burning components are theophylline and caffeine respectively). Scientific research shows that these two beverages can reduce belly fat and improve body composition. More importantly, the polyphenol chemical substance catechin contained in green tea has the functions of anti-oxidation and scavenging free radicals! Caffeine is also suitable for all people who need to consume large amounts of caffeine before exercise. If you want to achieve the best exercise performance, try caffeine tablets 45 minutes before workout to refresh yourself. Eat more fat and less carbohydrates To lose weight by eating more may sound contrary to the way of weight loss, but in fact, this is the correct way to lose weight nutritionally. Scientific research shows that the weight loss effect of choosing a low-carbohydrate diet is far better than that of a low-fat diet. Because the human body needs to burn more fat than carbohydrates in order to supply energy. If you eat too much carbohydrates, and the excess part is not burned as energy, then these excess carbohydrates will be stored as glycogen. If your glycogen reserves are full, the body does not need to burn fat as a fuel source to supply energy. The excess carbohydrates cannot be used and burned by the body, so they may be stored as fat by the body. Match junk food once a week to boost metabolism The eating and drinking we are talking about here refers to high-fat and high-carb foods (basically fast food and junk food). Eating junk food every week seems to go against the usual diet plan, but in fact Conducive to weight loss. The body's metabolism level is usually reduced due to the usual low-calorie diet. With junk food once a week, you can maintain a vigorous metabolism during weight loss and ensure that the body burns calories at a higher rate. But of course, make sure that the once-a-week junk meal does not end up being a junk meal every weekend or every week. People are easy to overindulge in the food they crave, so the best way is to decide in advance your junk meal. Which foods to choose. Drink plenty of water Drinking water can not only reduce food cravings, but also help eliminate toxins and accumulation of body fluids in the body. In addition, water is also an essential element in the metabolic process and is the key to the body's normal functions. If there is not enough drinking water, none of the previous 7 weight loss methods will be effective. in conclusion The above are all simple but powerful weight loss techniques that can help you plan to take in the calories your body really needs and lose weight more effectively. If you are trying to lose weight, first check your diet plan carefully to ensure that your food choices are correct. Weight Loss Made Easy!

15,What are the best ways to lose weight?,health-fitness," Losing weight is the purpose of many people when the New Year rolls around. However, after the arrival of February, there are many who have given that objective for lost, since it is a battle in the medium and long term, and the results are not usually as fast as is usually thought. This usually happens because dieting is a mistake, and losing weight would imply a significant change in lifestyle, with diet being the basic pillar of this style. The best ways to lose weight are given below: Drinking water can speed up your metabolism by 24-30% over a 1 to 1.5 hour period, helping you burn off some extra calories. One study showed that drinking half a liter of water an hour and a half before meals helped dieters lose 44% more weight. Eggs have many benefits, including helping you lose weight. Replacing a cereal-based breakfast with eggs can lead to consuming fewer calories in the next 36 hours, losing weight and body fat. And if eggs can't be eaten for some reason, any other quality protein source works too. Coffee has sometimes been unfairly demonized. When it's of good quality, it's packed with antioxidants and plenty of ways to support good health. Caffeine can increase metabolism by 3-11% and fat elimination by 10-2% (6, 7). Of course: you have to make sure not to add large amounts of sugar or other high-calorie ingredients since that would cancel all its benefits. Green tea contains small amounts of caffeine, but it also includes powerful antioxidants called catechins, which are believed to work in synergy with caffeine to enhance the fat-burning effect. Although the evidence is not entirely firm, many studies show that green tea (both the drink and the extract in supplement form) can help with weight loss (10, 11) Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in medium-chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats. These triglycerides have been shown to raise your metabolism in a range of up to 120 calories a day and also reduce your appetite, which could end up consuming up to 256 fewer calories per day. The idea is not, however, to add it to something that has already been cooked in a traditional way, but to replace some of the fats that are usually used in cooking with coconut oil. Glucomannan is a fiber that, in several scientific studies, has made research subjects lose weight. It absorbs water and settles in the intestine for a time, making you feel more full and helping you consume fewer calories. And people who take glucomannan supplements have been shown to lose slightly more weight than those who don't. Most people eat too much added sugar. This consumption is strongly associated with the risk of obesity and diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart problems. If you want to lose weight, you need to cut back on added sugar and high fructose corn syrup. And be sure to read food labels carefully, as many supposedly healthy products are sometimes full of sugar. Refined carbohydrates are usually sugars or grains that have been stripped of their fibrous and nutritious parts. Scientific studies show that refined carbohydrates can raise blood sugar quickly, leading to hunger and cravings, and increased food intake within hours. Consuming them is strongly linked to obesity. Thus, if carbohydrates are to be consumed, it is better to ensure that they are being consumed with their natural fiber included. Extensive research shows that sticking to a low-carbohydrate diet can help you lose two to three times more weight than a standard low-fat diet. And, at the same time, it contributes to better health. Although it may sound impossible at first glance, it has been shown that using smaller plates often automatically leads to lower calorie consumption. Anything that contributes to being aware of what you eat is useful. Thus, controlling portion sizes or counting calories consumed may be a good idea, for obvious reasons. Studies also show that keeping a food diary, writing down what you eat each day, or taking pictures of what you eat, can contribute to weight loss. Buying and having healthy foods on hand prevents you from resorting to harmful snacks for the diet. Thus, it is ideal to resort to fruits, nuts, baby carrots, yogurt, or boiled eggs. Although there are no studies to support this, many recommend brushing your teeth immediately after dinner, which seems to prevent the temptation of a late-night snack. Some spices, such as cayenne pepper, contain capsaicin, a component that can speed up metabolism and slightly reduce appetite. Aerobic exercises not only burn calories but contribute to better physical and mental health. They appear to be especially effective for losing abdominal fat, which grows around the organs and causes metabolic problems. One of the bad side effects of dieting is that it tends to promote muscle loss and a slowdown in metabolism. And the best way to prevent this is to do some kind of resistance exercise, like lifting weights. This can keep your metabolism high and prevent muscle loss. Fiber is usually recommended for weight loss. Although the evidence is not conclusive, some research shows that fiber, especially viscose, increases satiety and helps with long-term weight management. Both vegetables and fruits have properties that make them very effective for weight loss. They contain very few calories, but a lot of fiber. They are also rich in water, which gives them a low energy density. Also, they take time to chew and provide satiety. Several studies show that people who consume them tend to weigh less. These foods are also very healthy and nutritious, which is why eating them is important for reasons other than losing pounds. It can take time for the brain to ""register"" that you've had enough to eat. And some research shows that chewing slower helps you consume fewer calories and increase the production of hormones linked to weight loss. Sleep is sometimes ignored, but it is just as important as eating healthy and exercising. Poor sleep is one of the main risk factors for obesity, linked to an 89% higher risk in children and a 55% higher risk in adults. A study conducted on 196,211 individuals in 2014 found that 19.9% ​​of people fell within the criteria for food addiction. If you have powerful cravings and you can't control your diet no matter how hard you try, you may be facing a case of this addiction. And the only thing that works is getting help. Trying to lose weight without dealing with that problem first is almost impossible. Following a high-protein diet has been shown to speed up your metabolism by 80 to 100 calories per day. One study showed that converting to protein 25% of the calories consumed per day reduced obsessive thoughts about food by 60% while cutting nighttime cravings in half. Thus, simply adding protein to the diet, without restricting anything, is one of the easiest and most effective (and delicious) ways to lose weight. If getting enough protein in your diet is difficult, taking a supplement can help. The research found that replacing part of your calories with whey protein can lead to a weight loss of around 4 kilos while increasing lean muscle mass. Sugar is bad, but in liquid form, it is even worse. In fact, it is probably the most fattening part of the modern diet. For example, one study showed that sugary drinks are associated with a 60% higher risk of obesity in children for each daily serving. This also applies to fruit juices, which contain the same amount of sugar as soda. You can consume the whole fruit, but it is best to avoid consuming the juice alone. If you want to be slimmer and healthier, one of the best things to do is to eat natural, single-ingredient foods. These foods are generally naturally satisfying, making it difficult to gain weight if the majority of your diet is based around them. Most diets generally don't work in the long run. In fact, studies show that dieting consistently predicts future weight gain. Instead of dieting, it is better to aim to become healthier, fitter, and happier. Focus on nourishing the body instead of depriving it of things. Thus, weight loss will come as a natural side effect."
16,Understanding the Definition of Health Related Fitness,health-fitness," Being a Health and Fitness Professional, I must know terms and definitions which are typical for the current business, likewise to remain up to date advancing patterns. Through my experience, I even have discovered that an assortment of terms merit a touch more explanation than that which they're conceded. Besides explaining the meaning of Health Related Fitness, this content plans to reveal some insight into two or three of the related terms, and to bring up their particular differentiations. Is it just beat a name? The fitness world appears to use the idea Health-Related Fitness kind of conventional fitness guideline - exchangeable with others like ""Actual Fitness"", ""Wellbeing and Fitness"" or just ""Fitness."" While they frequently include those terms under the wide term Health and fitness, they only ask various angles - both nonexclusive and explicit. Lamentably, references to those and different fitness-related terms are regularly unclear, while consistency in their proposed use is small, best-case scenario, there's such a ""mostly acknowledged"" use for them, yet people frequently accept own understanding, and this will create turmoil. So, does Health Related Fitness just derive fitness by methods for great wellbeing? nearly . that is the reason we'd prefer to know a touch more behind these words prior to processing the definition. How did the term Health Related fitness occur? After the 1996 report from the US Surgeon General (Physical Activity and Health; a report of the Surgeon General), there was a transition to embrace and address the disturbing ascent in stoutness levels among the general American public. Studies and activities required normalization among clinicians, wellbeing experts, and fitness mentors to wrestle with the job that needs to be done. Enter ""Wellbeing Related Physical Fitness"", a working term to manage the general condition of wellbeing among the overall population. The meaning of Health-Related Fitness As showed by the American College of medication (ACSM), the most authority during this field, insufficient definitions with hazy and emotional phrasings, likewise as definitions containing terms which themselves require characterizing, have added to befuddling the expression ""Actual Fitness."" There is no dependable guide for Health and Fitness Professionals to live ""Actual Fitness"", on the grounds that the term has been so freely and conflictingly characterized. it's along these lines that one ought to think about the idea of Health-Related Fitness. The definition consequently fixates on the 5 Components of fitness which identity with ""great wellbeing."" These Components are: Cardiorespiratory Fitness Body Composition Adaptability Solid Strength Solid Endurance On the contrary hand, Skill Related Fitness Components are: Equilibrium Response Time Coordination Readiness Speed Force As shown by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the meaning of fitness underlines the distinction between Health-Related fitness and Athletic Ability fitness. Its place of-flight is that the ""wellbeing"" of the US country, which is generally referenced because of the ""general wellbeing viewpoint."" in that regard, the 5 Health Related Fitness Components are a higher priority than those related to Athletic Ability (or Skill Related Components). Although the idea of Health Related Fitness has an indispensable relationship with ""great wellbeing"", they tend the 5 Components to independently by wellbeing experts to allow for their estimation. Presently that we have a more profound comprehension of the term, what reason does it serve? Proceeding from the last known point of interest, the aim of estimating the 5 Components is to exhort customers about their own specific Health-Related Fitness and to use information gained from the tests to style suitable exercise programs that may then be assessed. The 5 Components contribute equitably to frame up an all-encompassing Health Related Fitness, which directly interests the soundness of the standard resident, in that the idea is standardizing. It's a commonplace that takes into consideration a steady application. It is subsequently significant for those working inside the wellbeing and fitness industry to not mix-up ""generally speaking actual fitness"" with ""Wellbeing Related fitness ."" To close, permit us to think about this qualification among fitness and Health-Related Fitness One must remember that normal exercise can improve fitness, likewise as Health-Related Fitness. Fitness might be a nonexclusive term and is up to abstract understanding, while Health Related Fitness are frequently surveyed. The differentiation between these two terms exists in that Health Related fitness is regularly estimated reliably with a gathering of setting up similar standards. This is the place where ""everything hits real."" the guidelines stated by the ACSM empower wellbeing experts to figure with customers to survey and quantify their reaction to practice and recommend proper exercise programs. A customer's advancement could then be checked and changed were essential in order to get the redefined fitness objectives. Cleto Tirabassi might be a confirmed Fitness Trainer with the International Sports Sciences Association (ISSA). His work fixates on the ""reasonable method"" to Health-Related Fitness, which involves the usage of functional, adaptable, and manageable techniques to acknowledge ideal degrees of wellbeing and fitness. His demographic has a place with the gathering he calls ""normal ordinary individuals"", who quickly need to be fit as a fiddle, yet still, have a standard existence. In Rome, Italy - he's devoted to controlling the people he's used with to comprehend their wellbeing and fitness objectives. He likewise comprehends that the wellbeing and fitness industry is reliably advancing and along these lines keeps up a top to bottom watch on patterns in his field of involvement."
17,What face mask to use to protect against SARS-CoV-2?,health-fitness," Many countries around the world have introduced an order to cover the lower parts of the face, nose, and mouth in public places to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is widely advised to cover mouth and nose at least until an effective coronavirus vaccine is developed and widely available. Many different types of protective face masks can be currently found in pharmacies and stores. They have different purposes and are made of different materials. However, the question is - does a face mask protect against the coronavirus? According to the recommendations of the WHO (World Health Organization), protective masks should be worn by those: sick, coughing, sneezing, with clear symptoms of the disease, attending the sick. The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control agrees with the position of the WHO but also points out that wearing masks in public places, shops or public transport can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by people who do not exhibit symptoms of the disease. Keep in mind that the coronavirus is airborne - it is spread through coughing, sneezing, or even a conversation with an infected person. The virus can enter the body through the nose, mouth, and eyes (directly or by touch). Wearing protective masks reduces the risk of this happening. What types of protective masks are there? The degree to which a mask can protect you depends on the type of mask you use. On the market, you can find surgical masks that protect the lower part of your face and protective masks, the so-called half masks that protect the respiratory tract against the ingress of microorganisms. A surgical mask is made of two or three layers of plastic - polypropylene. There are two types of surgical masks: type I – with the filtration efficiency of >95 (two-layer mask), type II – with the filtration efficiency of >98; exhibits resistance to permeation (three-layer mask). Surgical masks are subject to European Standard EN 14683: 2019 + AC. This type of face mask is a barrier to body fluids (saliva, blood, lymph) that can transfer from a sick person to a healthy person. Surgical masks are a barrier to microorganisms with a diameter of up to 1 micrometer. It is therefore permeable to viruses whose size is measured in nanometers. A surgical mask protects very well against further transmitting the virus by spreading in the cloud of aerosol generated when sneezing or coughing. The bodily fluids carrying the virus are stopped on the inside of the mask, potentially containing a virus. Surgical masks can be tied in two ways: with straps - the user adjusts the mask to his face and ties the strings of the mask at the back of their head, with elastic bands - comfortable bands that are pulled behind the user's ear. Every surgical mask has a sewn-in wire at the top that allows the mask to tightly fit over the nose. A surgical mask is a single-use medical mask. It should be disposed of after a single use or after contact with an infected person. A surgical mask provides short-term protection - up to several dozen minutes, depending on its saturation with bodily fluids and steam. The second type of protective masks are the half masks. They are made of 4 or 5 layers of polypropylene. They are stiffer than surgical masks and are also meant to adhere to the nose. They stop dust and aerosols. Half masks are divided into three types based on their filtration: FFP1 - stops approximately 80% of particles smaller than 2 micrometers in diameter, FFP2 - stops approximately 94% of particles smaller than 0.5 micrometers in diameter, FFP3 - stops approximately 99.95% of particles smaller than 0.5 micrometers in diameter. The European standard for half masks has the mark 149:2010+A1:2019. The half masks adhere well to the face. They are tied at the back of the head or have an elastic band. FFP2 and FFP3 masks are recommended for protection against viruses that may be airborne or in a cloud of aerosol emitted when coughing or sneezing. Disposable half masks can be used for up to 8 hours or until they are in contact with an infected patient. There are also reusable masks with replaceable filters. Such a filter should be replaced in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations so that the mask retains its protective properties. Half masks are usually equipped with valves to facilitate breathing. The exhaled air inside the mask is discharged through these valves, which prevents the accumulation of moisture. The valve only works in one direction - it is not possible for air to enter the mask through the valve. Due to regulations being introduced, many people have begun sewing masks at home. Three-layer cotton is mainly used for this, usually lined with fleece. These masks can be used multiple times. Like surgical masks, they will not stop viruses from entering the respiratory system. They act as a barrier against airborne aerosols and against spreading the virus by people who may not show symptoms of the disease. Such protective masks should be disinfected after each use, washing them at 60 degrees Celsius or exposing them to hot steam, e.g. an iron (set at about 100 degrees Celsius). The mask should be changed when it gets wet from the water vapor released during breathing and after suspected contact with an infected person. How to properly put on a face mask? Face masks do not provide 100% effective protection against the virus and at the same time can be dangerous in case of improper use. So how do you use them properly? Before putting on the mask, wash your hands with soap and water or disinfect them with a special alcohol-based liquid. Check that the mask is not damaged. Make sure the outside of the mask is facing the correct way. Adjust the mask to your face using strings or elastic bands. Adjust the mask to your nose and check that it covers the lower part of your face. Do not touch the mask or face (eyes) with your hands during use. If you do, wash your hands immediately with soap and water or disinfect them using a sanitizer. Change the mask for a new one if it gets wet. Do not re-use disposable masks. After use, remove the mask touching only its elastics or strings. Be careful that the mask does not touch the skin of your face or clothes. Do not touch the outside of the mask. Throw the used mask into a closed garbage can. After removing the mask, wash your hands with soap and water or a disinfectant."
18,Why Outsource Your DME Billing?,health-fitness," Outsourcing DME (Durable Medical Equipment) Billing In a constantly growing healthcare industry, Durable Medical Equipment (DME) have become an increasingly popular choice of healthcare-related services to millions of patients nationwide. In fact, a recent survey performed on the DME products industry found that the market would grow significantly over the next 10 years. With the rising number of an aging population and an increase in the number of cases such as respiratory illnesses, home healthcare will continue to be in high demand. However, with this increased usage, DME billing is turning out to be more and more complicated for healthcare providers. Today, DME billing can be challenging and confusing, especially if your team is not up to date with the latest policies and procedures of the payor. It demands an in-depth knowledge of reimbursement standards of both Medicare and Medicaid, as well as commercial, private insurance plans. DME billing also requires a non-stop commitment to quality and keeping up to date with all the changes which occur within reimbursement guidelines and coding and documentation musts. For an effective DME billing process and appropriate reimbursement, healthcare providers have a lot to watch out for, which can become a costly matter, both in time and money. Before going any further, let’s look at a few definitions to make sure we’re all on the same page. HME denotes medical equipment that is appropriate for a home environment and can be overseen by a patient or non-professional caregiver. HME billing extends over the total revenue cycle and originates with referrals from hospitals, clinics and physicians. DME refers to any robust medical equipment that delivers therapeutic benefits to a patient with particular medical conditions. Examples consist of oxygen tanks, kidney machines, walkers and blood sugar monitors. A major chunk of DME is usually aimed at extending therapeutics relief for patients with a long-term critical condition. As such, DME is a category of HME. Here are some typical challenges encountered in DME billing: Inexperienced billers and coders – Obviously, hiring a team of qualified billers and coders is paramount. As both government and insurance companies initiate new guidelines, it demands constant training and keeping track of the latest billing directives. Inexperienced billers, uninformed of the billing process or its rules, can mean a denial of claims and a loss of revenue. Inadequate claims management – Oft times, in-house billers wind up neglecting claims submissions and follow-up as they juggle between their administrative responsibilities and billing duties. Missing facts and figures – Missing and inadequate information translates to difficulties for the provider organization, leading to delays in the billing process, and would-be denial of claims. Coding errors – Perhaps the principal challenge in the DME billing process is coding errors. With the over-abundance of codes, inexperienced coders often input inaccurate codes, causing holdups in the billing process. Medical coding is a specialized segment and coders who work exclusively with coding and billing will know all the directory of codes that are used under DME services. Truth is, a lot of DME providers are facing serious challenges in managing their front office work which leads to delayed payments, even a denial of claims.

19,The New College Course of the Future Gelotology 101 (The Study of Laughter): A Perquisite is Laughing for No Reason.,health-fitness," Page 1 of 5 The New College Course of the Future Gelotology 101 (The Study of Laughter): A Perquisite is Laughing for No Reason. Ed.D Haynes, Gene. 1 Training Manager 2 Adjunct Instructor 3 Certified Laughter Yoga Teacher 4 Ed.D Educational Leadership and Management, Capella University Abstract— There is a new elective course needed in all colleges. Gelotology 101 (The study of laughter) it is course designed as a certification in what is known as Laughter Yoga. The course is a fun interactive course that does not use jokes or comedy. It is a course that engages students to use fake laughing that becomes contagious and real laughter. The course teaches students how to reduce stress through laughter. It also educates students how to start their own laughter programs in their professions. The growing body of research proves there is a need for colleges to implement this course as part of any college curriculum. Index Terms— Gelotology, Laughter Yoga, Stress Reduction, Edutainment, Curriculum, Elective Course. I.	INTRODUCTION Gelotology has played a role in health improvement for many years. Most of its significance in the health field was unrecognized. Today the growing body of research has led to the development of a capstone project that proves studying gelotology can play an important role college curriculums. According to Steinberg (2016), every day we must change, innovate and re-think learning. Amazon, Google, and Apple are companies that have used this approach to become successful. Companies in any industry can become successful if they follow this method. The gelotology course is an example of change by offering something new and innovative. The course is built upon existing practices and the course re-thinks learning by its interactive exercise which is different than traditional courses. The course on gelotology is like no other college course. It involves laughing and child-like playfulness in every class. Today, businesses thrive on innovation; in a competitive market, it is innovation that is the key to an organization’s survival. Almost every year various companies strive to be on top. To be number one and gain as much market share as possible, a company must constantly seek new ways of conducting business. The design of a course on gelotology is an example of thinking outside of the box and thinking innovatively in a rapidly changing world. The course on gelotology is innovative because it is something new and different than the traditional courses offered at the college. The assignments, lesson plans, group work, and class activities; are designed to create a unique course that educates students on a practice that is not offered in many colleges. The uniqueness of the course is designed to make class fun and interesting to students. At the same time they will learn how something as simple as laughing can have an affect on stress. According to Ting and Lee (2012), several authors cited the importance of offering elective courses of interest to students. The more interest students have in the content, the greater the impact on student learning. According to Morreall (2014), education is supposed to be preparation for life. It should foster the intellectual and personal attributes needed to be a successful, well-rounded human being, but traditional education either ignores or actively suppresses one of the most important of these attributes – humor. The new course on gelotology includes humor and provides students with new tools to help cope with stress. II.	Background ""Yoga"" is derived from a Sanskrit root word ‘Yuj’ (join), hence ""yoga"" means and includes, joining of the body, mind and the ‘Self’(soul)” (Setty, Pailoor, and Mahadevan, 2016, p. 89). Yoga promotes self-knowledge and understanding.. Having this understanding will allow the individual to cope with the daily stress of everyday life. Through its practice people have been able to live a more refreshing life, filled with happiness and good health. As an exercise yoga has been able to help heal the body and reduce stress. Galantino, Bzdewka, Eissler-Russo, and Holbrook (2004) conducted a pilot study of participants with lower back pain. Results found that participants experienced a decrease in disability and stress; and an increase in flexibility. Over time yoga has transformed into an exercise that originated from ancient rituals. Yoga is a practice that many have used for centuries. The history of yoga dates back to ancient religious text that describes techniques of yoga. According to Kumar and Aanand (2015), it is believed to have originated in India. Some date yoga back 3000 years. Ancient stones show carvings of people in yoga poses. Many years ago, it was believed that people worked long hours and needed time to rest. The rest allowed their bodies to relax and regain its energy. As people rested in these ancient times, they discovered the harmonious effects of sitting still. The mind body and soul connection became a tradition that many used as a way to remove themselves from their busy lives. While there are many different forms of yoga. The most popular categories of yoga divided into four broad sections the vedic period, pre-classical, classical and post-classical. Each of these periods has evolved over time changing yoga into many different forms. Today, the United States became one of the biggest markets for Yoga. The recognition of yoga received attention, the United    Nations    General    Assembly    has    declared     June  21st International Yoga Day. People all over the world celebrate this day by honoring the traditions that have been practiced for centuries. The actions of yoga help to reduce stress and improve the mind body and soul through relaxation. As yoga developed over the years, new forms of yoga were created. Gelotology is a term coined in 1964 by Edith Trager and William Fry. The practice was formed from the Greek root gelos (to laugh) Butler (2014). Madan Kataria, a general practitioner in India, Page 2 of 5 ————————————————————————————————————– coined the term laughter yoga in 1995 while researching an article he was writing for a health magazine (Kataria, 2002). Kataria began the first laughter club at a park in Mumbai, India, and these laughter clubs have now spread worldwide. Laughter yoga combines laughing with the yogic breathing exercises used in yoga. What makes laughter yoga different is that it involves laughing followed by periods of meditation. There are no jokes, humor or comedy used. Research has found that the body does not know the difference between real laughter and fake laughter. Kataria developed this concept to trick the mind into happiness. The process of fake laughing releases endorphins into the blood stream causing a chemical reaction to reduce stress. Kataria’s movement is established through the development of free laughter clubs. Participants attend the free clubs to laugh, learn about gelotology and reap the health benefits of the saying laughter is the best medicine. According to Khatchadourian (2010), Kataria concentrated his energies on promoting the therapeutic and health benefits of his exercises. The works of Kataria started in India and have now spread worldwide. According to ‘Yoga,’ (2011), laughter yoga is practiced in 60 countries. In India, Kataria conducted exercises in maximum security prisons, at schools for homeless children, and at institutions for the blind. He encourages his acolytes to share laughter yoga in similar venues. According to Butler (2014), Fry published studies of the physiological processes that occur during laughter supporting the claim that laughter is equivalent to exercise. Wagner, Rehmes, Kohle, and Puta (2014) conducted a study comparing the activation of trunk muscles during laughter yoga in comparison to exercises such as crunching and back lifting exercises. Results found that during the highest intensity of laughter yoga, the action of the laughter was comparable to those produced by traditional exercises. Therefore, not only is laughter yoga a great method for stress reduction, but it is also a form of physical exercise. III.	The Need for a Gelotology Course Laughter therapy is a something that can be taught to students in a college setting.. According to Dolgoff-Kaspar, Baldwin, Johnson, Edling, & Sethi (2012), instructors can be certified through Laughter Yoga International. The founder of the organization, Dr. Madan Kataria trains individuals in the laughter therapy principles (Dolgoff-Kaspar, et al, 2012). After students complete the course on laughter yoga, they can pursue more education about the program to enhance their skills. Currently this training is available outside of academia, however there is a need to expand this within college curriculums. Students will learn a new skill in a collaborative space and gain new knowledge to apply to their profession and personal lives. The new course would teach students leadership abilities by helping students to learn how to design programs on gelotology which can be applied outside of the classroom. e.g medical students could use what was learned in the course to help patients recover. A business could also benefit by starting a laughter program at their work place to reduce employee stress. A new course on gelotology can help bring about change within academia and the allied health field. According to Grogan, Donaldson, and Simmons (2007), leaders who can challenge accepted methods have the most chance of promoting learning for their members. Taking the initiative to identify problems and develop solutions shows a leader’s ability to take action and solve complex problems. The course on gelotology is a practice that more nurses need training on as laughter therapy gains recognition in the allied health field. IV.	Problem Described The design of the new course helps the institution review new content and innovative ideas that may bring about change. As one of the faculty at a for profit college, the design of the new course is a suggestion to help meet the needs of students as observed during sample laughter sessions during class time. As a faculty member that teaches freshman students, often students complain about the elective courses offered by the college. Seeing this as a problem led to the development of a new course to address the students complaints about the current curriculum. The changes that would occur consist of the following: An additional elective course An innovative course of interests to students A unique course that is not offered at other colleges New knowledge to medical professionals as part of a growing body of research A one of a kind course offering that may attract new students Educate students on new career choices Additional content to be added to the students' portfolio What is most important is that the new course will create a change to your institution by offering a one of a kind course that is not offered at other colleges. A literature review indicates, there is a lack of nurse education in the field of alternative therapies such as gelotology. The course can help to attract new students seeking to learn more about laughter and how it can help improve the quality of life of patients. ‘Academic Programs’ (2014) states the importance of institutions to maintain and achieve financial success. By continuous improvement, colleges will build its brand of keeping up with the changes in healthcare and academia. According to Papandrea (2014), Mount Ida College used a different approach to branding by highlighting its academic programs vs. the institution as a whole. The development of a new program will allow the colleges to market its new program to new students and possibly use this new approach to branding. O’Brien and Deans in Ting and Lee (2012) stated the importance of students being more diverse within their education. Employers prefer graduates who have diverse skills vs. being too narrow and focused on their majors. Electives give students the opportunities to learn additional skills which can make them more marketable when they are seeking employment. The approval of a new course on gelotology would allow the colleges to teach students new skills that help to enhance their skills and their portfolios. Students are awarded certificates at the completion of the course, which could also be placed into the student's portfolio. According to d'Erizans and Bibbo (2015) After the term is over, students typically take the contents they have learned and either dispose of it or place the items in storage. Without much thought or reflection, the student does not realize how the content could be used to enhance their education. Providing students with a tangible item such as a certificate; the students could save the document electronically or store the item in their professional portfolio in one central location with easy access. V.	Benefits to the Allied Health Field The development of an elective course on gelotology helps to improve the allied health field by teaching nursing students additional skills to help improve the quality of life of patients. Sometimes medicine alone is not the solution to healing the sick. According to Pressman and Cohen (2005), despite Self-help books, popular magazines, and Sunday newspaper supplements that have suggested that positive affect (PA) can improve people's health, a search of PsycINFO revealed there are twenty times more studies on depression vs. happiness and health. There is a need for continued research and education on other alternative therapies such as gelotology and laughter yoga. The effects of laughter yoga have improved the quality of life of patients. According to Foley, Matheis, and Schaefer (2002) in Quoidbach, Mikolajczak, and Gross (2015) research tested the use of simulated 1-minute laughter exercises. It was found that fake laughter led to increases in positive emotions. The basis of these findings has provided strong evidence that the use of these alternative therapies can help improve one’s positive experiences. It is important for health professionals to be knowledgeable on these alternative therapies. Students learning about gelotology will be exposed to new careers which have an impact within the allied health field. According to Warren (2001), clown doctors are in hundreds of hospitals and healthcare settings in at least a dozen different countries around the world (including Canada, Britain, France, Brazil, Austria, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Spain and The States). As more people are educated on this approach to improving health,  it may shift the direction of health care. Many hospitals have seen the changes in patients as a result of the care and entertainment of clown doctors. Spitzer (2006) stated how clown doctors helped a twelve-year-old patient in the burn unit, to stop screaming and become settled. Also, clown doctors are not only for children. Adult patients also benefit from seeing clown doctors. “Our society tends to dismiss play for adults. Play is perceived as unproductive, petty or even a guilty pleasure. The notion is that once we reach adulthood, it is time to get serious. Between personal and professional responsibilities, there’s no time to play” (Tartakovsky, 2012, para 1). It is the objective of this research to educate more people, so they  are more aware of the research on gelotology. The knowledge learned can greatly impact the allied health field by the new course offering. III.	Benefits to the Workplace The design of a gelotology curriculum can have a great impact on society as well. The more people that are educated on the principles of gelotology; the more knowledge of its importance in society will become known. The benefits of a course on gelotology do not only help individuals in the allied health field, but it also helps the general population. Workplace stress has become a growing concern for employers. According to Hirsh (2005), the American workplace has seen an increase in stress due to decline in resources and added competition. The lack of resources has led people to work more hours and risk an increase in their stress. The development of laughter programs can also be used to help reduce employee stress. The results of stressed employees have revealed that employees will more than likely be unhealthy, poorly motivated, less productive and less safe at work. The results of this can affect an organization's ability to succeed in a competitive market Mani, Sritharan, and Gayatri (2014). Addressing the problems of stress can help improve society and the productivity of business, which has an impact on the economy. A study conducted by Mani, Sritharan and Gayatri (2014) found that job stress affects productivity, absenteeism, workplace errors and job dissatisfaction. They also suggested more employee training and knowledge of information about job stress. The education on this topic can address the problems and provide valuable solutions for improvement in the workplace. Beckman, Regier, and Young (2007) conducted a study (Fig 1.) that focused on the elements of laughter yoga on personal efficacy in the workplace and found a 100% positive change in a control group of laughter participants. Figure 1. Laughter Yoga on Personal Efficacy in the Workplace From Effect of Workplace Laughter Groups on Personal Efficacy Beliefs, by Beckman, Regier and Young. Copyright 2007 by The Journal of Primary Prevention with permission. For 14 days a laughter yoga session was conducted for 15 minutes. (Fig. 1) shows the results of the laughter groups based upon their changes in assertiveness, optimism, motivation, adaptability, self- regulation, self-actualization, self-acceptance, and self-awareness. The positive outcomes seen in this study lead to the preliminary conclusion that a workplace laughter groups can appeal to a diverse range of employees, can be effective with minimal investment of time, and may have sustained positive effects on self-beliefs that have been shown to correlate with positive workplace behaviors (Beckman, Regier & Young, 2007). Studies like what is depicted in (Fig. 1) need further research and should be implemented within the workplace. Kataria, the founder of laughter yoga, has introduced the concept of laughter yoga worldwide. He speaks at various conferences to spread the word of using laughter to reduce stress. Using his studies Kataria has found implementing a laughter intervention in the workplace has benefits such as: improving team building communication, innovation, creativity, increasing attention spans in meetings, and improving peak performance (Kataria, n.d.). Laughter therapy programs create fun in the workplace. Work has been known to be a serious place. However, fun in the workplace is now becoming more common. “As kids, we go out to ‘play.’ Later in life, we ‘play’ sports or ‘play’ music,” he writes in one posting. “But then in sharp contrast, we leave our homes each day and go to work. The term implies doing uninspired, often boring and yucky things” (Alsop, 2010, p. 50). However, this has changed in recent years. Companies like Google, which is ranked one of the best places to work, understand the concepts of work and play. Also, when employees are happy it can have a direct impact on sales. According to Baldonado (2015), workplace fun is an important topic in business; laughter yoga was named as one effective method of having fun in the workplace. Popular companies such as Pike Place Fish, Southwest Airlines, FaceBook, and Google have all incorporated these practices into their culture. These organizations have realized how much time is spent on the job. According to Everett (2011), we spend more than 90,000 hours at work and with the downturn of the economy staff must now accomplish twice the work with half the resources. The amount of time spent at work led to a greater deal of stress on employees. When corporations adopt a culture of fun in the workplace, performance improves. Yerkes (2003) cited several benefits of using fun in the workplace, including stimulating creativity, fostering commitment, improving employee relations, and reducing stress. The capstone project, shows the benefit of laughter programs in the workplace. The positive changes of developing a course on gelotology, benefits the specialization of education and management by improving learning and fostering change. Today businesses thrive on innovation; in a competitive market, it is innovation that is the key to an organization's survival. Almost every year various companies strive to be on top. To be number one and gain as much market share as possible, a company must constantly seek new ways of conducting business. Even during poor economic times, research and development efforts must not stop. According to Jaruzelski and Dehoff (2010), more than 90 percent of executive’s surveyed said innovation is critical as they prepare for an upturn, and a majority have maintained or expanded their portfolios and are pursuing new products to improve growth and margins. A course on gelotology is an innovative course that is designed to engage students. As an educator within the specialization of education and leadership, it is important to understand the importance of designing courses that engage students. Yearwood, Cox, and Cassidy (2016) stated student engagement should be designed into three parts: student engagement with the instructor; student engagement with their peers; and student engagement with the content. Combining the three will ensure the highest level of achievement for student learning. The course on gelotology uses the three forms of engagement by teaching students to interact with each other, engage with the instructor by following guided interactive instructions and engaging with innovative educational content. The negative effects of not actively engaging students can lead to withdrawing, academic failure, boredom, passivity, absenteeism, aimlessness, avoidance, and apathy. The gelotology course provides an engaging class that entertains students while at the same time teaching them new skills. Today’s courses should involve some form of fun in learning to further grasp students’ attention. Argan and Sever (2010) describes this form of learning as edutainment which combines entertainment and learning. Argan and Sever conducted a study on edutainment in marketing communication courses using a questionnaire as a data gathering tool. Findings of the study indicated that the use of edutainment can help to improve students’ attention and participation. The study also suggests other disciplines should extend edutainment into their specialties as well. It is my objective to one-day have courses on gelotology offered at all colleges. For further details on implementation of a course on gelotology in your college or a workshop on stress reduction through laughter at your workplace please contact Dr. Gene Haynes at info@learn2laugh.com.

20,"Bacterial lysates, or immunization vaccines for children",health-fitness," Bacterial lysates are immunizing vaccines that can protect the body against recurrent respiratory diseases. They are administered orally, in the form of tablets, granules, capsules, or aerosols. They are available only by prescription and can usually be used by children over 3 years of age. Why do we get sick? Respiratory tract infections are the most common cause of medical appointments, especially in children. An infection is considered to be recurrent in children aged 2 to 4 years when it occurs 6 to 8 times a year. Most children go through 20-30 infections in the first 4 years of life. However, this is not a cause for concern and does not constitute grounds for suspecting an immune disorder. Infections are a necessary part of the immune system's development. Through contact with antigens, the body learns to fight this type of threat. Childhood infections are extremely common due to the number of microorganisms and ongoing contact with peers in nurseries, kindergartens, and schools. In older children, infections are considered to be recurrent when they take place 6 or more times within a single year. There are a number of factors that may contribute to the frequent occurrence of infections. These include: •	environmental factors (exposure to pollution) •	allergies, •	in some cases, serious immunity disorders, which parents are so often unnecessarily worried about, •	insufficient physical activity, •	poor sleep hygiene, •	stress, •	bad eating habits. Recurrent infections can also be caused by excessive and unjustified use of antibiotics. One often-overlooked factor is the exposure to tobacco smoke breathed by the child's parents or guardians, which has a very large impact on the infections' frequency. How does vaccine immunization work? Vaccines are biological preparations administered to develop resistance to certain pathogenic microorganisms. The antigens contained in vaccines, when introduced into the body are supposed to simulate a natural infection and push the body to develop immunity similar to that which it would produce through a real infection. This allows for the production of antibodies and the creation of an immune memory, which translates into much better response to the disease upon repeated infection. Since humanity is currently facing an impending antibiotics crisis, new methods of fighting infections are constantly being sought. One of the devised solutions is the administration of oral, non-specific vaccines called bacterial lysates. Bacterial lysates are dead, chemically or enzymatically lysed bacterial cells or fragments thereof. Unlike most classic, specific vaccines, they are introduced into the body orally. They contain many different types of bacteria, especially those responsible for respiratory tract infections, including: •	Streptococcus pneumoniae, •	Streptococcus pyogenes, •	Staphylococcus aureus, •	Moraxella catarrhalis, •	Neisseria cararrhalis, •	Klebsiella pneumoniae, •	Haemophilus influenzae. Vaccines work on immunity by stimulating the body's natural defenses. As a result of contact with the antigen, the level of natural immunoglobulins, mainly IgA, increases, which protect the mucous membranes such as those found in the respiratory system. The fight against bacterial antigens contained in the lysate serves as a training battle for the specific immune system. Research has shown that lysates exhibit the ability to reduce infections caused by both bacteria and viruses other than those that were used to manufacture the preparation. The mere presence of various antigens stimulates the mechanisms of non-specific immunity, which is what gives lysates their ability to potentially help fight off viruses. Therefore, lysates stimulate both the specific (mainly through granulocytes, mast cells, and NK cells) and the nonspecific immune system (through T and B lymphocytes).  This stimulation causes intensive synthesis of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgE, IgG, IgM, and cytokines. Due to their non-specific function, lysates can provide a better immune response to various pathogens, including those with which the body faces for the first time. This makes for more effective protection in the event of various types of infections. Immunization vaccines – who are they for? Numerous scientific studies have proven that lysates help reduce the frequency of seasonal infections of the respiratory system, which in turn decreases the need for the consumption of antibiotics. Clinical studies have shown that bacterial lysates can reduce the incidence of infections in children and adults by up to 30-40%. For children, orally administered immunization vaccines can play a significant part in the prevention of frequently recurring respiratory diseases, such as pharyngitis, laryngitis, tonsillitis, or angina, as well as bronchitis, sinusitis, and inner ear inflammation. Some oral vaccines have shown effectiveness both in prophylaxis and in therapy. Non-specific vaccines come in the form of tablets, capsules, granules, and aerosols. Some of them can be given to children from the age of 2, but most of them only from the age of 3. Immunization vaccines are products that should not be used without medical supervision and are therefore only available by prescription. They should only be taken after excluding any abnormalities in the structure and functioning of the respiratory system. In summary, stimulating the body's immune system with bacterial lysates is a very effective method of preventing both bacterial and viral respiratory infections. The safety of their use has been confirmed by numerous scientific studies. Acquiring immunity as a result of oral vaccination is a long-term process, sometimes taking several months, as the body's immune mechanisms are gradually stimulated. It is worth considering beginning the therapy in the summer to prepare the child's immune system for the challenges waiting for it during the fall and winter."

1,Coronavirus: Disinfecting Your Scrubs,health-fitness," As the front line of defense against the coronavirus pandemic, nurses and doctors are continuously placed in a scenario where they may be exposed to the COVID-19 virus. While routine hand washing and the use of hand sanitizers and personal protective equipment (i.e. gowns, masks and gloves) are extremely effective methods of preventing further contamination, there is one medical accessory that is being routinely overlooked: scrubs, the universal uniform of the healthcare professional. Each day, medical professionals across the nation don a clean pair of scrubs as part of their preparations for the day’s work. While the cotton-blended scrub material is meant to be breathable and promote unencumbered movement, the truth is that the garment’s fibers can harbor pathogens that can easily be spread from patient to patient. Furthermore, if the medical professional opts to wear their scrubs to work and then returns home in them, the chances of spreading germs to friends and family members is dramatically increased. What can be done to prevent this scenario from occurring? What steps can medical professionals take to help circumvent the spread of the coronavirus to other patients and their family? On Wednesday, March 18, 2020, NurseBuff.com, a popular nursing humor and lifestyle blog, posted an informative article to their website about this exact topic. The article, entitled How to Disinfect Scrubs: A Nurses’ Guide to Sanitizing Scrubs Properly, outlines an easy-to-follow, step-by-step process that can be implemented to ensure that scrub uniforms are kept germ- and stain-free. How to Properly Disinfect Your Scrubs Keep your dirty scrubs separate from your regular laundry. If you change into regular clothes before leaving work, place the dirty garments in a plastic freezer bag. If you wear your scrubs home, change out of them as soon as you get home, placing the dirty scrubs in their own hamper or laundry basket. Wash your dirty scrubs with cold water and detergent on a normal setting first. You will want to make sure your scrubs are stain free before proceeding to the next step. Wash your scrubs again. This time use hot water and a color safe bleach. After your scrubs have been washed for the second time, place them in the dryer and tumble dry them on the highest setting for at least 30 minutes, killing pathogens. Once your scrubs are dried, iron them. The high heat ensures that any remaining pathogens are killed. Store your scrubs in a drawer or closet until they are ready to be worn again. Furthermore, the blog post offered best practices to ensure that family members are protected from possible germ exposure in communal spaces (i.e. laundry hampers and washing machines). Whether you’re a medical professional that is working in a COVID-19 affected facility or a clinician that wants to help keep their patient population healthy during these tenuous times, this article is a definite must read. A big thanks to NurseBuff.com for posting this much needed information! Premier Medical Staffing Solutions is extremely grateful to the brave men and women that are tirelessly working to provide first-rate medical care during this national crisis.

2,Does IPL Hair Removal Work?,health-fitness," What if we told you that you never had to deal with razor cuts, wax burns, ingrown hairs, or unsightly body hair ever again - would you believe us? For many, silky smooth, hair-free skin is a dream, but in order to achieve such a feat, the use of less than desirable hair removal methods like sticky hot wax strips, dull razors, and smelly depilatory creams are needed. That is until now. IPL hair removal has become increasingly popular as a safe and effective way to eliminate unwanted hair. But does it actually work? If you've been searching for a more permanent solution to getting rid of those pesky unwanted hairs on your upper lip or the unsightly forest growing on your back, IPL hair removal is a great option. In this article, we will cover what IPL hair removal is and how it works. So grab a cup of coffee and get comfy - let's dive in! IPL Hair Removal vs. Laser Hair Removal: What’s The Difference? IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) and laser hair removal treatment both work on the same principle when it comes to permanent hair removal. Light energy is absorbed by the pigment melanin, which is found in high concentration at the root of each hair follicle. The hair absorbs this light energy and heats up, causing damage to the follicle. Follicles are responsible for producing hairs, so when they are damaged, it prevents hair regrowth in the future. The main difference between IPL hair removal devices and laser hair removal devices is the light source used. IPL works by using broad-spectrum light pulses that scatter onto the skin, whereas laser hair removal utilizes a specific light consisting of one wavelength or color of light, going in one, focused direction onto the skin. To be clear, IPL technology is not a form of laser treatment. It is a form of light therapy. Due to the way IPL and laser technologies work, treatments vary in terms of: Treatment time.Since the beam of light used in laser treatment is very concentrated, laser devices have a very small effective treatment window. This means it can take quite a bit of time to zap unwanted hair in large areas like the legs. Thanks to the broader flash of light used in IPL, IPL devices usually have a bigger treatment window, meaning they can cover a much larger area at once, resulting in a much faster overall treatment time in comparison to laser. Pain rating. Everyone is unique, and experiences pain differently. However, the single, more pointed beam of light used during laser treatment is often reported to be more painful than IPL treatment. Cost. It's expensive to generate laser light so laser hair removal treatment tends to come with a hefty price tag. IPL hair removal is just as effective and often much more affordable. Longevity of results.Laser hair removal treatment may cost a little more, but the results are nothing short of amazing. But, as with any kind of light-based hair removal or reduction, you'll always need to continue with touch-up treatments to prevent hair follicles from regenerating and producing new hairs. After multiple treatments, many people will experience hair-free skin for several weeks at a time following an IPL or laser session. IPL becomes a little more convenient here because of its availability for at-home laser hair removal with home laser hair removal devices. Safety.Laser light is extremely powerful and can even be dangerous, especially when the treatment isn't followed out by an experienced technician that specializes in laser hair removal. IPL treatment is a much safer hair removal system because the light is less concentrated, meaning less negative side effects are likely to occur. That being said, both hair removal methods are generally safe for use anywhere on the body except the eyes, with the most commonly treated areas including the underarms, legs, and bikini area, as well as smaller areas like the facial hairs on the upper lip. It's also important to note that there are different lasers for different skin types; traditional lasers are most safe and most effective for dark hair on lighter skin, while newer lasers like the Nd:YAG are safe for light hair colors and darker skin. How Effective is IPL Hair Removal Treatment? As we mentioned, IPL hair removal is a safe way to kick unwanted hair to the curb, but how effective is it really? To understand this, you need to know how hair grows. Every single hair on your body has three phases of hair growth: anagen (active stage), catagen (short transitional phase between the anagen and telogen phase), and telogen (resting phase preparing to go into the anagen stage). All three of these hair growth phases occur simultaneously. Each hair follicle is independent and essentially has a mind of its own, going through the growth cycle at different times. At any given time, about 85% - 90% of your hair is in the active anagen phase, 1-2% is in the transitional catagen phase, and 10-14% is in the resting telogen phase. At the end of the active anagen phase, your hair enters the catagen phase, which usually lasts no more than ten days. This is when hair stops growing and transitions into the telogen phase. The final telogen phase is known as the resting phase when your hair begins to shed and rests for a period of time, ranging from one to two months for upper lip and chin hairs to three to six months for leg and bikini line hairs. Once the hair has shed completely, the anagen phase commences again. The anagen phase is the best phase for IPL treatment because it is the phase where hair is active and visible above the skin's surface, making it easy to target and eliminate with the IPL light. As we mentioned, every hair on your body is going through the growth cycle at different times. So, for IPL hair removal to work properly, multiple sessions are required to effectively target hair as they leave the final telogen phase and enter the active anagen phase. Everyone is different, and results tend to vary, but depending on your personal hair growth cycle and hormonal changes, you will begin to see results from IPL just after a few treatments. What About At-Home IPL Devices? Getting rid of undesirable hair is easier than ever with the advancements in laser light technology. Back in the day, if your goal was permanent hair reduction, you had to schedule an appointment for an in-office visit at a clinic. Today, at-home IPL hair removal has become increasingly popular as a safe and effective way to combat unwanted hair, once and for all! When looking for an at-home IPL device that suits your needs best, there are a few things to consider: The number of flashes. This is the number of times the IPL device can emit a flash. Once the lamp runs out of flashes, a replacement lamp will be needed. Purchase from a company like FITSKINthat offers an IPL device with over 10+ years of flashes to leave your skin silky smooth and hair-free for many years to come. The level of intensities. This impacts how often you'll need to use the IPL device and whether you can adapt the intensity to suit your more sensitive areas. The FitSkin Laser Hair Removal Handsetoffers five different power settings to suit your skin tone or skin's sensitivity while still producing results at any level. Corded or cordless. Some IPL devices can be used cordless, for ease of use and transportation, but be sure to check the battery strength to avoid having to stop mid-treatment, which can be frustrating. Large areas like the legs and chest will require more time per session to effectively treat unwanted hair, so look for a device like FITSKIN that comes with a 12V power supply to ensure the battery doesn't die on you during use. Conclusion If you are tired of dealing with the ingrown hairs, razor bumps, and wax burns that come from traditional methods of hair removal like waxing, shaving, and tweezing, then it's time to consider a more permanent solution: IPL hair removal. Give it a try - you'll thank us later!"
3,How Effective is Laser Hair Removal?,health-fitness," Did you know that if you shave roughly three times per week, the number of shaving sessions you do adds up to a whopping number of 3,900 sessions over the course of 25 years? And if your hair happens to grow back faster than the average Joe, that number is even higher. That is a lot of time spent shaving if you ask us! However, for many, traditional methods of hair removal like shaving and waxing are necessary to achieve silky-smooth velvety skin--until now. Gone are the days of painful ingrown hairs, razor bumps, wax burns, and infinite plucking. Today, there is a much more effective way to achieve flawlessly smooth, hair-free skin that most people only dream of. Can you guess what that might be? If you said laser hair removal, you are correct! Laser hair removal is a medical procedure typically done by a dermatologist that uses a concentrated beam of light (laser) to remove unwanted hair, even in the most sensitive places like the underarms, bikini line, and even the upper lip. But, how effective is this popular hair removal method, really? Let's find out! How Does Laser Hair Removal Work? Laser hair removal is an effective treatment that eliminates unwanted hairs. It utilizes state-of-the-art light technology to target the hair follicles deep within the skin, where other methods like waxing and shaving can't reach. Hair follicles are the sole culprit behind the production of unwanted hair. By altering them with laser hair removal, you can achieve baby-smooth, hairless skin. It works by emitting a highly focused beam of light in short pulses. The lasers are color sensitive, making the laser light attracted to the melanin pigment in your hair. Melanin is a natural skin pigment that is responsible for providing color to your eyes, hair, and skin. When the hair absorbs the light, it immediately converts to heat, which then alters the hair follicle, generally stopping or at least minimizing the growth cycle. Two to three days after your laser hair removal session, the hair will begin to fall out in the treated area, and the follicle won't be able to produce new hair. Who is an ideal candidate for this laser hair removal? Laser hair removal is generally safe for people of all skin types and skin colors. Both women and men can appreciate the benefits that it has to offer. However, since the laser's light is attracted to pigment, laser hair removal is most effective when there is a contrast between the color of your hair and the shade of your skin. So, this means treatment works best for those with dark hair and fair skin. Do you have dark skin or blonde hair and want permanent hair removal? Although this kind of treatment works best on the darkest, most visible hairs and light to fair skin, laser hair removal has come a long way since its creation in the 1960s. Today, there are many different lasers that can help people of all shades and skin tones, and can even be safe for those who have seen a little too much sun exposure of the years. What kind of lasers are used, and does the type really matter? There are four lasers that are primarily used for laser hair removal treatment: Ruby Laser Hair Removal In a world that is constantly evolving, Rubies can be considered relatively old, having been in use for laser hair removal treatment for quite some time now. This type of laser produces a very small beam of light that is ideal for people with dark coarse hair and light skin. Since the beam of light on this laser is smaller, sessions are oftentimes longer, with more pulses of light targeting the treatment site. Lasers like the Ruby are becoming less popular in the beauty industry with the rise of newer, more effective laser innovations. Some of the best advantages of the Ruby laser include: Long term hair removal can be achieved If hair does grow back, it tends to be finer and less noticeable Compared to other lasers, this laser is generally pain-free Built-in cooling equipment to minimize the chance of burns and swelling Some of the disadvantages of the Ruby laser include: Can't be used on dark or even tanned skin or on white or blonde hair The Ruby laser has a slow repetition rate which may increase the duration of the treatment There are a few risks for side effects like scars, redness, burns, and swelling. Alexandrite Laser Hair Removal The Alexandrite laser produces a much longer beam of light than that of the Ruby laser, so it requires fewer pulses during a session, which comes with the benefit of lessening patient discomfort. In addition, this powerful laser has the ability to effectively remove hair on people with a wide range of hair color and skin tone combinations! Some of the best advantages of the Alexandrite laser include: Very good skin penetration Known to be effective on fine and thinner hairs that are much tricker for other lasers to handle Extremely effective on light to fair skin tones Some of the disadvantages of the Alexandrite laser include: The laser may cause pigment changes in the skin ND:YAG Laser Hair Removal This laser is one of the most innovative lasers available on the market today. It has the ability to distinguish between pigmentation and subtleties, effectively removing hair on any skin tone. Some of the best advantages of the ND:YAG laser include: Works on almost all skin types, including darker skin complexions and tanned skin Laser of choice for darkly pigmented skin Larger body areas can be treated quickly Some of the disadvantages of the ND:YAG laser include: Not that effective on white or light hair colors The laser may be more painful than others Has the potential to cause blistering Diode Laser Hair Removal Commonly referred to as the ""Mercedes Benz"" in the world of laser hair removal, the Diode laser offers a gentler touch, removing hair while also protecting the skin. This ensures you experience very minimal to no damage surrounding the tissue making this laser superior to the rest! Some of the best advantages of the Diode laser include: This super laser features a longer wavelength, so it is able to provide better results among people with darker skin Provides a very deep and safe penetration into the layer of the skin to destroy hair follicles Some of the disadvantages of the Diode laser include: There may be some temporary burns, scars, swelling, and redness following treatment If you are unsure which laser is right for you, don't panic - the doctor or technician performing your laser hair removal treatment is a dermatology expert and will be able to assess your specific and unique skin type to pair you with the right laser to achieve beautiful, smooth, skin -- free of hair. Okay, but how effective is laser hair removal, really? If you are going to spend the time to get laser hair removal, obviously you are going to want to know how effective it will be, right? As much as people like to believe it is 100% permanent, the truth is that this is not always the case. Now, it is important to keep in mind that everyone is different, so results tend to vary, but the truth is that treatment is only capable of providing 90-95% long-lasting hair reduction. The good news is that when you do experience a little bit of hair growth down the road following treatment, hair grows back very fine and is quite sparse. For the best results, occasional maintenance sessions are a good idea to help ensure the hair follicles don't regenerate. Depending on your specific and unique individual needs, you may need a touch-up session once or twice a year after completing the initial round of laser treatment. Can I buy a home laser device and just do it myself? Great question. Home laser hair removal devices and Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) has gained widespread popularity over the years for the many benefits it affords the user. However, not all products are created equal. Your skin is the largest organ in your body, so it's of the utmost importance that you do everything in your power to take care of it--this means using top-quality products to achieve top-notch results.

4,Say Hello to Keto Food in Canada,health-fitness," Over the past few years, there have been much controversies on the keto diet as a general weight-loss plan. It is because there are various low-carb, high-protein, and weight-loss diets in the world. Atkins, Paleo, and South Beach diets are some of the most attention-grabbing diets. These diets are also sometimes referred to as Ketogenic diets but are entirely different from a true keto diet. Unlike the high-protein and low-carb diet, which focuses more on protein, a true keto diet centers on fat.  This fat, supplies over 90% of daily calories. Canada has one of the most abundant numbers of people that engage in a ketogenic diet.  Let’s get to know more about the keto diet. What Is A Keto Food? Keto foods are meals used and included in a keto diet. A word keto is a short form of ketogenic. It originates from the Greek word ketogenesis, which means 'producing ketone bodies.' Keto diet is known to be a medical and therapeutic form of diet. Some of the foods Canadians eat on a keto diet are seafood, low-carb vegetables, like cucumber, olives, lettuce, and many more. Cheese, avocado, meat and poultry, eggs, coconut oil, Greek yogurt, and nuts are other popular keto foods in Canada. Types of Ketogenic Diets Ketogenic diets are numerous as they have different levels of carbohydrate intake every day. Here, we shall be looking at three different types of keto diets. It is the most popular form of keto diet because it restricts the carb intake to fifty grams a day and sometimes lesser. This restriction helps to alter metabolism and makes the body seek for another fuel source, 'fats.' For individuals that are just starting a ketogenic diet, this plan is the best option. The TKD also restricts carb intake between twenty to fifty grams per day. It is suitable for individuals who needs a bit of carbohydrate to fuel their workouts. This type of ketogenic diet is popular among professional athletes. This diet follows the standard ketogenic diet of five to six days per week, followed by one to two days of a higher carb intake. Between these two days, you can consume up to four-hundred grams of carbohydrates to help refuel your glucose reserves. How Does the Keto Diet Work? The action a keto diet performs is called ketosis. When you restrict your daily carb intake to 50 grams or even lesser, your body then runs out of blood sugar or fuel; and you will eventually start to break down the protein and fat in the body. It will make you lose weight. Who Should Not Do A Keto Diet in Canada? There are mostly three groups of people that should never engage in a keto diet in Canada. The 2017 statistic in Canada shows that about 8.4% of people in Canada suffer from diabetics, so they should void ketogenic diets. Other persons that should avoid a ketogenic diet include those with high blood pressure and breastfeeding mothers. Benefits of Keto Foods Studies have shown that there are several benefits of eating keto food. These foods can help improve heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and brain injuries. Although there are other benefits of keto foods, these are the most popular among them."
5,What Are Cardiovascular Endurance Sports? 5 Examples Provided,health-fitness," Cardiovascular endurance sports or rather aerobic exercise is basically a physical form of exercise which puts your heart, blood vessels, and lungs to work. This is typically done with aerobic activities such as swimming cycling or running. But what are the most popular types of endurance sports? And I guess, some of the craziest? Read on to find out more. By definition, you're considered entering an aerobic energy-generating process after being active in a given sport for a period of time, or more than 90 seconds. So here are some sports which have become the most popular forms of this type of exercise: Hiking is a form of walking, which is considered an aerobic exercise when done for prolonged periods of time. Not only that, but hiking will test your elevational skills as well as it will be you going uphill quite a lot. Remember that time when you went on a family trip to the mountains and a short climb up a steep heel will send your heart racing? Yeah, it's pretty intense. Of course, running is on this list. Running is one of those sports that anyone can do, all you need is a pair of good running shoes, a running hat to protect you from the sun. But with running in particular, you can increase your intensity levels as you wish and you can enter an aerobic training zone quite efficiently. Running on an incline will test your endurance skills even more. Just give it a go and see if you can get past 50 meters without puffing out. Definitely, one that's on the list, cycling at fast speeds will definitely send your heart and lungs into action to deliver oxygen. Cycling is sometimes a better choice than running or hiking because it has less impact on your knees and joints, whilst still giving you a great workout. Of course, that swimming, cycling, and running are all on the list. With swimming, you don't need much other than goggles to see underwater and it has even less impact on your body than cycling, as cycling tends to hurt your lower back with time. With swimming, you basically have gravity on your side, whilst getting a highly efficient cardiovascular endurance workout. Initially, you would think, really? Golf? But golfing requires a lot of moving around and activity. of course if you use a buggy (golf cars) you'd be selling yourself short on improving your fitness. Playing golf by walking around throughout the field the entire day works your cardiovascular endurance highly. Typically because most golf courses have hills that will further test your endurance levels. Conclusion: As you can see, cardiovascular endurance sports are quite common and there are many ways to do it. Heck, you can even switch it up and run up and down the stairs of your family home to test your endurance. But be careful not to injure yourself. After a few months, you will notice your heart, lungs work more efficiently and intake more oxygen which will further enhance your sporting performance."
6,Benefits and Risks of Biotechnology,health-fitness," Although biotechnology seems like a modern, sophisticated technology, it dates back to human beings' existence in the world. You can't just talk about food, plants, and animals without it. Although it has witnessed revolutionary growth in the past century and since then, there is no looking back. The days are gone when Biotech was only about minimal edits in the genes for improvement and better performance, nowadays we can write anything and everything across the genome. Start listing the benefits of Biotechnology; the list will end, merits won't. Hence, for a quick reality check, let's shed light on the positives and the risks in detail; BENEFITS: Better Medical Treatment: Some diseases emerge from the genes directly. The tools, studies, and information of Biotechnology facilitate Medical Professionals to look into detail, leading them to find the actual cause of the disease in detail. They now have more knowledge about, for example, the origin of cancer in the human body. Consequently, it will help in producing better, effective, and productive therapies to cure the disease better than ever. Many institutions have started working on treatments under the supervision of profound life sciences consulting firms to treat patients better. Waste Management: Waste these days are a big challenge, particularly for big metropolitan cities to manage. Failure in adequate Waste Management puts the environment in danger. The concern slowly and gradually will challenge the authorities to ponder. Here comes the Biotechnology, enlightening the experts about the biodegradability of some materials that can be used to packaging items, thus smartly managing the dumpsites. The study of Biotechnology also guides in clearly categorizing the steps needed for perfect Waste Management. Conservation of Resources: Earlier, the perishability of the food items used to be a significant concern. The worries are no more as Biotechnology has blessed us with useful methods of pasteurization and freezing—the processes used for Food Conservation base on Biotech. Since the food is better preserved and conserved, the exploitation of resources will be decreased. Furthermore, Life Sciences Consulting can help even more to increase the age of food items. RISKS Soil Fertility Insecticides, pesticides, and other artificial seeds produced through bio-chemicals have enhanced the crops' nutritional values and production capacity. On the other hand, if you observe the rapid increase and betterment in the production, it exhausts the fertility of the land used for agriculture and cultivation. Consistent production with impressive quality and great quantity has the risk of losing/affecting fertility, a long-term loss. Weaponizing Biology When there are positive uses of technology, people can also abuse the features of biotechnology. Bioweapons are deadlier than the weapons used previously because they can't be easily detected or stopped. Consequently, harming more than we can imagine. Intentionally injecting and spreading poison or infectious diseases can lead to serious consequences. The production of dangerous bioweapons is reportedly happening in developed nations of the world, which is quite alarming."
7,A Day in the Life of a Correctional Nurse,health-fitness," Currently, there are more than 2.4 million men and women serving time in America’s jails and prisons. Of these 2.4 million inmates, it is estimated that 40% are managing chronic medical conditions; 40% are coping with mental health disorders; and 65% meet the medical criteria for substance abuse and addiction. Never has the need for qualified and capable healthcare providers that are willing to treat this vulnerable population been so evident. However, misguided assumptions about correctional healthcare prevents many clinicians from pursuing these job opportunities. While not the right work environment for every clinician, the correctional healthcare setting can provide a rich and rewarding career for those nurses that are willing to put their preconceived notions to the test. To help combat some of the natural biases that surround the correctional healthcare vocation, we interviewed Chris McMahon, RN, BSN. As an experienced correctional nurse, Chris provides insight into what a typical day looks like in correctional healthcare, the type of care that correctional nurses are generally responsible for and what it takes to succeed in this non-traditional healthcare field. While I was pursuing my bachelor’s degree at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside, I knew that I wanted to end up in a career where I would have the opportunity to help and care for other people. At the time, I didn’t know that nursing would be the place where I would land. As I was trying to decide on a major that was right for me, I took a very general class about nursing. From there, I was hooked. I had so many amazing teachers along the way that encouraged me. Their enthusiasm for the profession was contagious. I’ve never regretted my choice to become a nurse. I was initially exposed to the correctional healthcare environment as part of a clinical rotation while earning my associate degree. I had the opportunity to spend six weeks at the Ethan Allen School for Boys, a correctional facility for juvenile offenders in Delafield, Wisconsin. I guess I was lucky. I had a really good experience there. One of the nurses at the facility took me under their wing and really showed me how I could make a positive difference in the lives of the patients. Just as the rotation was ending and I was getting ready to graduate, a position at the facility became available. I applied, was hired and the rest is history. I don’t think I would have pursued a job as a correctional nurse if I hadn’t had a positive experience on my clinical rotation first. A typical day for a correctional nurse is both predictable and unpredictable. Within the facility, there is a steady rhythm and flow to life. For instance, head count (when inmates must return to their cell and be counted) and mealtimes occur at the same time every day. During these times, inmates are not allowed to schedule medical appointments. This means you have dedicated time slots throughout your day when you can focus on job responsibilities outside of patient care. It’s a nice balance. While the structure and routine of each day is highly predictable, the type of care that you provide as a correctional nurse changes from day-to-day. Without a doubt, you will have inmates that need regular treatments for chronic medical conditions. However, just like in regular life, medical emergencies happen that require your immediate attention. As the primary care provider within the facility, these patients will come to you first for assessment and next steps. These emergencies require you to be flexible and to think on your feet. As a correctional nurse, you have the opportunity to see and treat the spectrum of medical conditions. From dermatological issues to emergent conditions, you will be the first person the inmate sees for treatment. Furthermore, you will be the one who decides if the inmate needs to be taken to a specialist for additional care. While the care you provide will always be performed in consultation with a physician, you will have a lot of autonomy in deciding how that treatment plan is carried out and when/if next steps need to be taken. One aspect of being a correctional nurse that I especially enjoy is the opportunity to teach my patients everyday medical skills. For instance, I have had patients with diabetes that have not been able to control their blood sugars. Through my interactions with those patients, I have had the opportunity to educate them about proper food choices and the need for regular exercise. In my experience, these patients have been grateful for the knowledge that I have imparted. For some inmates, you will be the first medical professional that is consistently advocating for their wellbeing. You will have the opportunity to influence their relationship to health and medical care. When it comes to patient interactions, there is no difference in how I treat an inmate from a regular patient. Everyone that comes to me for medical help is treated with dignity and respect. I think that’s the key to successful provider/patient interactions. Whether you’re working in a traditional healthcare setting or a correctional facility, you only get one chance to make a good first impression. If you come across as rude or condescending, your patient isn’t likely to follow your recommendations or be compliant with the treatment plan. If your goal is to help heal people, respect is the first step. On the whole, I would describe my typical patient interactions as pretty positive. Inmates are coming to see the nurse because they want medical attention and advice. They are not being forced to come see you. As a result, they usually have a lot of questions. They want to learn about their condition and why their treatment plan is the right course of action. I find that a good portion of each of my interactions is spent on patient education. It’s especially rewarding to share what I know and watch a patient apply that knowledge for their health and betterment. Generally speaking, as part of the on-boarding process, you will be required to go through basic safety training classes. For instance, you may be required to take a series of online classes about recognizing manipulation, how to effectively communicate, what fundamental safety procedures need to be followed, etc. Furthermore, the facility will likely send you offsite for additional hands-on training where you will learn how to deescalate confrontations and avoid hostile situations. While you are providing care, there will always be a guard within earshot to ensure that everyone is on their best behavior. In my experience, it is extremely rare for an inmate to attack the medical staff. Prisoners view the nurses and doctors at their facility as people that are there to help them, not punish them. One of the toughest aspects of working as a correctional nurse is making sure that you are taking care of your mental and emotional health. For various reasons, the correctional healthcare environment can be very stressful. In order to do your job to the best of your ability, you will need to “check in with yourself.” If you find that you are not doing okay, that the stress is getting to you, you will need to reach out to your friends, family members or (possibly) a mental health professional to get yourself back on track. It’s important to remember that you can’t take care of others if you aren’t taking care of yourself. I think that one of the biggest benefits that you get working as a correctional nurse is the autonomy that the job provides. While your work will always be performed in consultation with a physician, it is unlikely that a doctor will be on the facility’s grounds every day, advising you what to do in every scenario. Your patients are going to be relying on you to help them then and there. It is a terrific opportunity to use your nursing license and medical degree to its fullest. Another great benefit of working as a correctional nurse is the opportunity to learn and expand your skill set. For instance, nurses that work in a hospital rarely have the opportunity to perform a thorough head-to-toe exam. Over time, their knowledge becomes highly specialized in one area. As a result, they don’t have the opportunity to see and treat as many conditions. In order to be effective, a correctional nurse must be willing to constantly learn and grow. Your patient’s health and wellbeing depends on you have a diverse knowledge base. First and foremost, I would tell them that life within a prison or jail is nothing like what they see on television or in the movies. Those scenarios are dramatized to create entertainment value. Just like a traditional healthcare setting, you will have days that are long, boring and predictable and days when you wonder if there is something in the water. Regardless of what setting you work in, you still need to be flexible and compassionate. Additionally, I would tell them that it is natural to have reservations about working in this field. However, they can easily overcome their concerns by having a conversation with a nurse that has or is working in a correctional environment. They will be able to speak to your specific questions and mentor you on how to be most effective."
8,Considering Home Health Nursing? What You Should Know Before Applying,health-fitness," After gaining one to two years of work experience on a medical-surgical floor, the career opportunities that are available to a nurse become virtually limitless. While some clinicians will continue their employment journey in a traditional healthcare setting, others will choose to pursue a career in a non-traditional work environment. Home health nursing is a non-traditional employment option that provides clinicians with independence and autonomy. Keep reading to find out what you can expect from a career as a home health nurse. What is a home health nurse? A home health nurse, also known as a home care nurse, provides one-on-one care in a patient’s home. Most of the time, the patients that a home care nurse treats have been discharged from a hospital or other medical care setting. Home health nurses are primarily responsible for ensuring a patient’s continued recovery and for monitoring for any potential complications that would result in readmittance to a healthcare facility. Depending upon their experience and training, a home health nurse may provide other specialized services (i.e. pain management, wound care, hospice care). Home care nurses always work under the direction of the patient’s physician and may be responsible for managing/directing other members of the patient’s care team (i.e. nursing assistants or non-medical home care providers). What types of conditions does a home health nurse treat? Home healthcare services are designed to help patients rest and convalesce in the comfort of their own home. Nurses that work in home healthcare may work with one patient on a long-term, full-time basis or they may visit multiple patients each day. Furthermore, a home care nurse may treat a patient’s chronic and/or acute condition(s). The following list is illustrative of the types of conditions that a home health nurse provides care for: •	Alzheimer’s Disease; •	Chronic kidney disease; •	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); •	Diabetes; •	Heart disease; •	Recovery from illness or surgery; and •	Chronic conditions or injuries. What are typical job duties for a home care nurse? Home healthcare nursing is a rewarding career path that is available to both registered nurses (RN) and licensed practical nurses (LPN). However, the specific jobs duties that home healthcare clinicians will perform varies based on credentials. For instance, a home health RN would be responsible for: •	Performing head-to-toe physical assessments; •	Developing care plans with the patient’s physician; •	Administering medications (including intravenous infusions); •	Drawing labs; •	Providing wound care and dressing changes; •	Taking vital signs; •	Assisting with activities of daily living (i.e. bathing, toileting, grooming) and •	Assisting with mobility. A home healthcare LPN would be responsible for: •	Administering medications (excluding intravenous infusions); •	Providing wound care and dressing changes; •	Assisting with activities of daily living; •	Assisting with mobility; and •	Reporting any concern(s) the patient may have to the supervising RN. What education and/or experience does a home health nurse need to have? The first step in pursuing a career as a home care nurse is to fulfill the educational requirements requisite for a RN or LPN program. For instance, RNs must graduate from a two- or four-year, state-approved nursing program and pass the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX-RN). LPNs wishing to work as a home health nurse will need to obtain a diploma from an accredited, state-approved program and pass the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX-PN). After a nurse has completed the educational requirements, they will need to acquire experience in a medical-surgical and/or critical care setting. One to two years of work experience in these settings is strongly advised before making the transition to home healthcare. What skills are needed to succeed as a home care nurse? To succeed as a home health nurse, a clinician will need to have strong interpersonal skills. The ability to actively listen to the patient’s concerns and clearly communicate the plan of care (as well as empathy) will be vital to forging trust and rapport with the patient. Furthermore, some home care patients may have limited communication abilities, so demonstrating patience is a must. While a home care nurse always works under the direction of the patient’s physician, they still need to have a great deal of independence and initiative. Nurses in a home care setting do not have a physician or head nurse physically present, directing their every move. They need to be able to independently make choices that advance the patient’s wellbeing. Most home health nurses see more than one patient in a day. That is why it is essential for clinicians in this field to have strong organizational and time-management skills. For example, home care nurses must allow enough time at each visit to attend to the patient’s needs while still factoring in time for proper documentation and travel to the next patient’s home. What are the benefits of working as a home health nurse? There are several reasons why clinicians enjoy working in a home healthcare setting. For some, it is the opportunity to develop long-term personal relationships with patients and their family members. For others, it is the independence and autonomy that the job offers. Listed below are three of the most popular benefits associated with a career as a home care nurse: •	Flexible Scheduling – Home healthcare is full of full-time and part-time job opportunities. Furthermore, many patients require care during evening hours and on the weekends. This means that there are employment opportunities that fit nearly every schedule. •	Lower Stress Environment – Nursing careers in traditional hospital settings can be stressful (i.e. ERs, ICUs, medical-surgical floors). A home health nurse gets to apply their skills and knowledge in a lower-stress atmosphere that is still professional. •	Professional Development – Home healthcare professionals have multiple opportunities to grow their skill sets and advance their career. For instance, within the field there is high demand for clinicians that are certified in wound care, pain management, gerontology, psychiatric/mental health, etc. What is the relationship between home healthcare and hospice care? Like home healthcare, hospice care can be provided in a patient’s home. However, while the aim of home healthcare is to provide treatment that restores the patient’s health and independence, the goal of hospice care is to provide care the keeps the patient as comfortable as possible as they near the end of their life. In both instances, home health nurses and hospice nurses are responsible for skilled care (i.e. administering medications, providing necessary supplies/equipment, attending to personal care needs). For this reason, many clinicians find it easy to transition between both fields. It is not uncommon to see clinicians that vacillate between positions in home healthcare and hospice care. What is the outlook for the home healthcare industry? According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, overall healthcare employment is projected to grow by 18% through 2026. However, home healthcare is specifically projected to grow by an impressive 41% in that same time frame. This means that the home healthcare industry will add 1.2M jobs to the healthcare industry in the next six years. A career as a home care nurse is a solid choice for any clinician looking to be a part of an in-demand field."
9,Staying Healthy During Cold and Flu Season: Tips and Tricks for Nurses,health-fitness," As a nurse, your risk of catching a viral illness from an infected patient during cold and flu season is high. Additionally, your line of work requires that you be out in the community where you could possibly be exposed to COVID-19 (which shares many similar symptoms with the cold and flu viruses). Thankfully, there are several simple lifestyle changes that you can implement to enhance your immune system’s response. Keep reading to find out how you can protect and improve your health this cold and flu season. 10 Ways Nurses Can Stay Healthy During Cold and Flu Season Eat a Balanced Diet Did you know that nearly 70% of your body’s immune system resides in your gastrointestinal system? This means your gut plays a critical role in keeping you healthy during cold and flu season. You can improve your gastrointestinal system’s overall health by consuming a balanced diet, one that is low in fat and sugar and high in protein and fiber. Furthermore, there are several foods that you can eat to give your immune system an added boost. Red peppers, for instance, contain three times as much vitamin C as a Florida orange and shellfish (i.e. oysters, crabs, lobsters and mussels) are packed with zinc. Reduce Stress When your body is under stress, your adrenal glands produce and release cortisol into your bloodstream. While cortisol plays an important role in activating your body’s fight or flight response (critical for high stress situations), it also suppresses the effectiveness of B-cells and T-cells (critical for destroying viruses and pathogens). Furthermore, high levels of stress can wreak havoc on your digestive system, causing ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome and other unwanted changes. That is why it is extremely important that you find ways to lower your stress levels during cold and flu season. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach for stress reduction, breathing exercises, practicing mindfulness and positive self-talk are all great ways to help reduce tension in the moment. Exercise Regularly In addition to lowering your stress levels, regular acute exercise (exercise that is moderate to vigorous and lasts less than an hour) has been proven to improve your immune system’s response. Typically, your body’s immune cells collect in the organs that are responsible for killing viruses and pathogens (i.e. your lymphatic system). However, when you exercise, your blood and lymph flow is increased, resulting in a higher number of immune cells circulating in your body at a higher rate. The best part is that you will not need an expensive gym membership or fancy exercise equipment to achieve this immune boosting benefit. Walking, running and cycling are all types of acute exercise that will produce the desired result. Get Enough Sleep When you’re working 12-hour shifts and attending to the needs of your family and home, it can be difficult to pencil in an eight-hour appointment with the Sandman. While getting an adequate amount of rest is important all year long, it is especially important during cold and flu season. When you’re sleeping, your body releases cytokines that stimulate the immune system to fight foreign pathogens. Production of these protective cytokines is decreased when you cut your sleep short. Additionally, restful sleep bolsters the production of T-cells, responsible for destroying cells infected by viruses and pathogens. Help your body help you. Go to sleep. Take Your Vitamins While we generally think of vitamin C as the “go-to vitamin” of cold and flu season, there are several other vitamins that, when taken properly, improve your body’s immune function. For instance, vitamin D does so much more than support bone health. It has also been shown to enhance the function of immune cells, such as T-cells and macrophages. Additionally, vitamin B6 is responsible for producing white blood cells and T-cells and supporting the immune system’s biochemical reactions. And vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that helps the body fight off infection. These three vitamins are just the tip of the iceberg. Before taking any vitamin supplements, we recommend consulting with your doctor on the appropriate dosages and frequency. Get Outside As the weather grows cooler, people tend to congregate indoors where it is nice and warm. However, staying out of the elements can be detrimental to your health during cold and flu season for two reasons. First, as people spend more of their time inside, the likelihood of getting a virus from someone else is increased, especially in buildings with poor ventilation systems. Second, scientists believe that when we are outside, we breath in phytoncides (airborne chemicals produced by plants) that increase our white blood cell count. Therefore, spending time in the great outdoors prevents possible exposures and improves our immune health. Also, it’s much easier to exercise outside and our bodies naturally produce vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. Wash Your Hands No article on staying healthy during cold and flu season would be complete without a reminder to wash your hands. While hand washing is a best practice that many nurses readily follow, simply lathering up with soap and water is not enough. Outlined below is the proper handwashing technique for healthcare professionals: •	Use lukewarm running water to wet your hands. •	Apply soap and rub your hands together to work up a lather. •	In addition to rubbing your palms together, be sure to wash the back of your hands, your wrists, between your fingers and under your nails. •	Proper handwashing should take no less than 20 seconds (or the amount of time it takes to sing the ABC’s or Happy Birthday twice). •	Rinse your hands starting at your wrist. Let the water run off your fingertips. Be sure to rinse away all the lather. •	Dry your hands well with a clean paper towel. Use the paper towel to turn off the faucet and open the door. Wash Your Scrubs Throughout your day as a nurse, you encounter a variety of patients that are managing a variety of health conditions. While you undoubtedly understand and embrace the importance of good hand hygiene as part of these interactions, have you ever considered the importance of good scrub hygiene? Common bacterium and viruses can live on surfaces for hours, days, weeks or even months. That is why it is important to properly disinfect your scrubs during cold and flu season. To properly disinfect your scrubs, first wash them inside out with cold water and detergent on a normal setting. Once you are sure that your scrubs are free from any stains, they need to be washed again with hot water and a color safe bleach. After they have been washed, scrubs should be put in the dryer on the highest heat setting for 30 minutes to ensure that any remaining contaminants are killed. Get a Flu Vaccine The flu shot is your first line of defense when it comes to warding off the constantly evolving flu virus. While not an absolute guarantee that you will not contract a strain of the flu, individuals that are vaccinated experience significantly shorter periods of illness when compared with those who do not receive the vaccine. After the vaccine has been administered, it can take up to two weeks for your body to build immunity. Most health experts recommend getting the flu shot by the last week of October to ensure that your body has acquired immunity before the peak of flu season (typically December through February). Stay Home If you find yourself sick this cold and flu season, staying home is your best option for regaining optimal health quickly. While you are home convalescing, make sure that you are getting plenty of rest and drinking lots of fluids. While making the decision to stay home is never an easy one, it is important to remember that you will do more harm than good by going into work sick. Additionally, you’ll be able to return to work more quickly and you’ll be more productive at work if you take the time to heal first.

Although self-care can feel like one more thing on a To-Do list, it will rise to the top of that list once you begin to feel the positive effects of making it a priority. To minimize stress and give you some fresh ideas for self-care, here are some fun ways to help you boost your mood and feel more in control of how you manage your RA. Eat steak Steak is delicious and if you get top quality, it may actually help your arthritis. Grass-fed or pastured meat has been shown in research studies to be significantly higher in omega-3 fatty acids and creatine, both of which can help reduce inflammation. Get a massage Massaging your muscles increases blood flow, reduces pain, and can help loosen up stiff joints. Not to mention it relieves stress and feels amazing. When you can move with less pain, you will continue to move more, thus more relief from pain follows. Gentle stretching programs like some types of yoga and tai chi can help keep your joints moving and stimulate blood flow around cartilage. Stretching, especially in the hands, also prevents aggravation. Both massage and stretching activities may help reduce perception of pain and manage stress. Let go of being a super-human Super-powers come and go for anyone who has been diagnosed with RA. One day you are up and going with ease and the next day just getting out bed can be a challenge. Don’t be hesitant to tell your family and friends when you're having a flare so they can help with some of the chores that you might ordinarily handle. Lower your expectations of yourself and focus on what really matters most; relationships. Rather than cook dinner for friends, invite them over for the best-in-town pizza. Getting together and enjoying life is the point, not the food. If stuff doesn’t get done, it’s not a big deal. Dishes. Laundry. Vacuuming. Whatever. Use the good days to prepare for the not-so-good days Preparing easy-to-eat and healthy snacks is a good way to spend time during the days you feel good. Wash and cut up fruits and veggies, move food from jars or cans into easy-to-open plastic containers with large tabs, and portion out snack food into baggies. Freezing meals you cook yourself is also a smart way to prepare. Home cooked meals are so much healthier than most frozen food options that you buy in the grocery store. Store bought meals tend to be full of salt, preservatives, and even sugar, that can only agitate a flare up and cause more inflammation. Try a hot wax treatment Why not? Heat treatments, like warm compresses or hot paraffin wax like the kind typically used in deluxe manicures, are a simple way to reduce stiffness and pain, and make you feel pampered. And of course the bonus is, you will have incredibly soft hands!"
11,How Porta-Potties Help the Environment,health-fitness," Besides the convenience of having clean portable bathrooms at outdoor functions, distant events, or large functions where the indoor bathrooms can't keep up with the demand-- there are likewise numerous ecological advantages of portable sanitation. You can lease a portable bathroom both for short-term and long-term use. The cleaning and maintenance are typically inclusive. The ecological benefits underneath apply when porta-potties are involved. Ways Porta-Potties Help the Environment Portable Toilets Decrease The Spread of Disease Among Animals Human waste can be poisonous both to natural life, and it is known to make its way through the climate in more inconspicuous ways than just direct consumption. It travels through human feet, paws, and hooves and on the wings of creepy crawlies. It is the reason an ever-increasing number of campsites decide to have clean, convenient porta-potties. Supports Water Conservation While many select modern flushing toilet rentals, some go to porta-potties as a way of conserving water. Indeed ""low stream"" bathroom utilizes at least 1.6 gallons of water per flush. This type of support is an immense improvement from older toilets that need up to 6 gallons of water for each flush. Porta potties that don't need to be flushed spare numerous gallons of water since the disposal of waste is possible without utilizing the water that is ordinarily required to flush the toilet. While the porta-potty and reservoir will need water for cleaning, it is a radically more modest sum than flushing after each usage.

12,What big skin care manufacturers don’t want you to know,health-fitness," The skin care industry is huge- in fact it is over$ 50 Billion in sales in 2018 and growing rapidly. Most industry observers project it to grown another 20 Billion by the year 2025. However, not all skin care products are created equally. Did you know that in the U.S. the industry is largely unregulated? How does that affect us as consumers? You might be interested to know that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only bans 30 chemicals that cannot be used in skin care products. These include your makeup, lotions, serums, creams, etc. Whereas the European Union bans 1328 chemicals from being used in skin care products! Included in the vast majority of skin care products in America are known toxic ingredients. Have you ever looked on the label of your skin care products only to find a long list of ingredients that you cannot even pronounce- folks, those are chemicals. We all know that processed foods are not good for our bodies- but are you aware that most people in America unknowingly ingest daily harmful toxins into the largest organ we have- our skin. Here are just a few of the toxins and chemicals used in many skin care products that are linked to a variety of health problems: Formaldehyde- yes, you read that right. The same chemicals used to embalm dead bodies are in many skin care products. It is a preservative fluid and is a recognized carcinogen (cancer causing agent) by the National Cancer Institute- with particularly higher risk for leukemia, but many unknowingly put this harmful chemical into their bodies daily while searching for the “fountain of youth”. Parabens- Parabens have many other names and are used as preservatives in skin care products. They have been linked by scientists to an increased risk of contracting breast cancer and are routinely used in skin care products. A startling statistic is that 99% of patients with breast cancer have been found to have higher levels of parabens in their bodies. The National Chemical Society estimates that about 85% of personal care products in America contain parabens. Synthetic fragrances- These ingredients are not fully disclosed. The requirements for “fragrance” or perfume is simply to list Fragrance or Perfume on the ingredient list. However, these chemical fragrances can be filled with thousands of separate ingredients- many which may be toxic. Even the word unscented may use “fragrances” to mask the smell of toxic chemicals. Fragrances have been linked to migraine headaches, asthma, and other respiratory problems. By contrast organic essential oils used as fragrances offer no side effects, and even can assist with out health. Phthalates- A truly toxic skin care ingredient used to help your skin care product absorb into the skin- while also absorbing this known toxin that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Health and Human Services have classified phthalates as a probably human carcinogen! All natural products may take a short bit longer to absorb into the skin- but at least you are not also absorbing toxic chemicals into your largest organ in your body@ Petrochemicals- This category of chemical based ingredients encompass formaldehyde, parabens, phthalates sodium laureth sulfates, coal tar and more. They are known toxins used primarily to extend the shelf life of skin care products laden with toxic chemicals that are known to be dangerous to humans. Borates- Boron containing chemical compounds, most commonly called sodium borate, boric acid, sodium perborate and perboric acid. These are used as preservatives and emulsifying agents in skin care products and sometimes teeth whitening tootpaste. Borates are banned by the European Union and have been linked to male and female sexual and birth defects. The above list is but a small sampling of toxic products contained in our skin care products. We urge you to read your labels and choose all natural ingredients only to protect your health.

16,Top Benefits of the Keto Diet,health-fitness," The keto diet is a healthy fat, very few carbohydrates, and moderate protein eating plan. The primary intent of the dieters is to get their body into a metabolic state known as ketosis. What is ketosis? Ketosis occurs when the body runs out of its glycogen stores, so it needs to find another source of fuel. When this state is achieved, your liver begins to process fat into ketones, which become your body’s main source of fuel. Benefits of a Keto Diet Keto, unlike many other diets, has numerous benefits due to how it changes your body’s chemistry. When the human body has ketones as a fuel source, it becomes much more efficient. 1: Weight Loss This is the main reason lots of people look up to the keto diet. Because fat is a source of energy, the body actively burns fat when it needs more energy instead of looking for glucose. The keto diet helps promote weight loss in several ways, including reducing appetite and boosting metabolism. Keto diets consist of foods that can reduce hunger-stimulating hormones. For these reasons, following a keto diet can reduce appetite and promote weight loss. 2: Appetite Control An amazing thing happens when your diet is not carb-heavy. You find that you are not as hungry as often, and you do not end up with random cravings that cause you to eat bad things. Many people who go on keto can do intermittent fasting where they only eat during a set period. This is possible because your stomach is not rumbling telling you that you need to eat a donut. 3: Better Mental Focus The problem with carbs as a source of energy is that they cause your blood sugar levels to rise and fall. Because the energy source is not consistent, it is harder for your brain to stay focused for long periods. When your body is in a state of ketosis, and your brain uses ketones as its source of fuel, it has a consistent source of fuel that it can rely on, which means you can focus longer. 4: Helps Fight Type II Diabetes People that have Type II Diabetes suffer from increased production of insulin. Because the keto diet program removes sugars from the diet, this causes the HbA1c count to be lowered, and type II diabetes is reversed effectively. Lots of studies have shown that following a keto diet program can reduce key markers related to type II diabetes. 5: Lowers Blood Pressure High blood pressure is an early sign of future heart problems. The keto diet does a great job of helping to lower blood pressure. When people suffering from high blood pressure integrate the ketogenic diet into their lives, they could stop taking their blood pressure medicine. Conclusion One of the amazing things about the keto diet that is not mentioned above is the variety of delicious recipes you get to make. The keto diet is more than just a diet.

17,Natural Remedies for Spider Veins,health-fitness," Varicose veins and spider veins are super common and affect almost everyone I know.  Some are more bothered than others. Medically speaking, there is only one reason to do vein procedures and that is symptoms.  Varicose vein symptoms can include leg pain, leg cramps, restless legs, and leg swelling to name a few. Advanced symptoms or signs include skin color changes or eczema, leg ulcerations and bleeding varicosities.  We know that vein procedures are quite effective and vein doctor offer some of the most advanced techniques available.  However, a large number of patients do not require procedures in the absence of symptoms but are curious about what they can do at home to remedy some mild itching or discomfort. Here is a list of common home remedies to help soothe irritative varicose veins: We do not recommend ACV for spider veins. Despite various claims, there is no science to back up this belief.  Because of the acidic nature of ACV, there can also be skin irritation. Circulation is not improved and varicose veins are not likely to shrink away with ACV. While it can be a rich source of vitamin C, the ingestion of cayenne peppers is likely to do little more than cause stomach irritation.  Support is weak for this home remedy. Along with essential oils, horse chestnut has anti-inflammatory effects and thus can feel soothing for uncomfortable or itchy spider and varicose veins.  Just don’t expect them to disappear. This one is a sure bet to helping the legs feel better.  Promoting circulation is the key to relieve any varicose vein leg pain.  Exercise improves the tone of the calf muscles as well which again promotes healthy movement of blood.  Key point is to avoid sitting or standing in one position for too long. Crossing your legs alone will not cause spider or varicose veins.  However if you suffer from poor vein circulation, then tightening your legs or sitting in one position for an extended period of time can inhibit blood circulation and trigger more pain. Can have a soothing or cooling effect on your legs and that can feel nice on spider veins.  However, like essential oils or cayenne peppers, don’t expect veins to disappear. At this time, there are very few things that are sure fire DIY measures for curing vein disease.   Still hoping here that CBD may be an option for varicose vein relief, but the jury is still out.  In the meantime, for mild disease or those interested in getting some extra relief, a trial with essential oils or horse chestnut extract can be considered.  If the symptoms persist or worsen, it’s best to make an appointment with the vein doctor for further evaluation and treatment."
18,Crown Lengthening Procedure using Dental Diode Laser,health-fitness," Introduction- Crown lengthening is a surgical procedure designed to increase the extent of supra-gingival tooth structure for esthetic and restorative purposes. Based on the clinical scenario, crown lengthening procedure is categorized as either esthetic or functional. Esthetic crown lengthening is usually done in the anterior esthetic zone of oral cavity, where the major concern is to reduce excessive gingival display and increase the clinical crown height. While functional crown lengthening is done to expose the crown structure so that a functional prosthesis can be placed over the exposed crown. Preservation of biologic width is the therapeutic endpoint of both these procedures. Crown lengthening can be limited to soft tissue only, or both soft and hard tissue can be contoured. Indications- There are several indications including: restorative needs, to increase clinical crown height lost due to caries, fracture or wear, to access sub-gingival caries, to access a perforation in the coronal third of the root, to relocate margins of restorations that are impinging on biological width, esthetics, short teeth, uneven gingival contour and gummy smile. Treatment Modality- Crown lengthening procedure can accomplished either by the use of a periodontal knife/scalpel, rotary coarse diamond bur, electrosurgery etc. These techniques have certain disadvantages like surgical trauma, postoperative pain and swelling, bleeding during surgery, poor patient acceptance and also coronal migration of the soft tissue margins is seen during healing which makes it difficult for recording the finish lines after the tooth preparation. With recent advancements, conventional techniques are replaced by LASERS which offers a relatively bloodless surgical procedure, sterilization of the wound site, minimal swelling, reduction of surgical time, high patient acceptance, reduced postoperative pain and much lesser need of post-operative medications. PIOON Laser offers different wavelengths like 450nm/810nm or 980nm. Out of which 450nm can used in non-contact or contact mode whereas 810nm and 980nm are used in contact mode in order to perform a crown lengthening procedure. The most desirable among them is 450nm wavelength due to faster cutting and lesser thermal damage due to non-contact mode of operation. In the present case, clinical and radiographic evaluation revealed adequate keratinized gingiva, presence of sub-gingival caries and inadequate tooth structure on the lingual side of lower left first molar. Firstly assessment of biologic width was done by probing to the bone level (referred to as ""bone sounding"") and subtracting the sulcus depth from the resulting measurement."
19,Fitness Supplements and Expert Choice | BodyTechSupplements,health-fitness," Timing is everything when it comes to supplements. You can scan for supplements until you're blue in your face, but you only flush down your drain if you don't know how and when to take these supplements right now. Proper nutrition is a key factor in enhancing muscle gains and performance. Fitness Supplements Pre-Workout Supplements Do not slam a pre-workout supplement directly before beginning your preparation for optimum results. Most pre-training drinks must be digested for at least 15-30 minutes. Have the time down so you can rock in the gym. Post-Workout Supplements Compared to pre-workout drinks, you should have a drink after your workout. You will need to take two different shaker bottles – one for pre-training and in-training drinks, and one for your post-training supplements. The fitness supplements are meant to give the organization what it needs after a hard workout. Creatine The best way to make use of creatine is before and after exercise. Pre-training of 3 to 5 grams of creatine helps increase the body's phosphate inversion and increases the capacity, strength and intensity of the workout. After exercise, creatine serves to replenish the phosphate levels lost during intensive training. You can also take it at various times during the day while you are loading creatine. Glutamine Glutamine accounts for around 60 per cent of free amino acids in the skeletal muscles. There are signs that higher muscle saturation of glutamine contributes to improved protein synthesis and can help to maximize potential muscle benefits. Before and after exercise, you can take 3 to 10 grams of glutamine. Whey Protein The whey protein is a fast-digestion protein source, suitable during the day when high-level protein synthesis is present in the body, e.g. during exercise, after exercise or after a fasting period. Carbs - Waxy Maize Rapid digestion of carbohydrates is anti-catabolic. They help battle muscle loss and are especially good before and after exercise. Waxy corn is a common addition to building a body. It is a high-quality digestive carb source and can be consumed during and after exercise. Multivitamin Multivitamin is very common in the morning to be taken first. The best time to eat is with vitamins and minerals – every meal. Get used to taking the biggest meal of the day with multivitamins. This ensures that it is digested properly and quickly. Most vitamins are better absorbed when taken with whole foods. Fish Oil You normally take a lot of fish oil gels every day, as do most bodybuilders. Instead of all your daily dose of fish oil, split the gels throughout the day and, if possible, take one for each meal. Sleep Enhancers Consider taking this supplement about an hour before you go to bed instead of taking the enhancer right before you go to bed. Give your sleep a fighting chance to digest your system fully. Amino Acids A wide range of supplements is covered by the word amino acids. We are talking here about bulk amino acid supplements containing a large number of essential amino acids. You'd like your amino acid substitute to be isolated all day long, like fish oil. Post-workout, and first thing in the morning, amino acids are also important. At this stage of the body, protein synthesis is enhanced and a higher dose of amino acid can be used. BCAAs Branch Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs) will make up between 15% and 30% of your energy during intense workouts. Protein synthesis is also aided by BCAAs. It is also safest to take BCAAs before, during and after your training. The use of 3 to 5 grams before and after work helps avoid exercise-induced catabolism and maximizes muscle recovery and new muscle growth. Vitamin C Divide vitamin C in smaller quantities over the course of the day. Joint Health Joint health supplements are better to take before bed and early in the morning. Fat Burners Many fat loss supplements are taken twice a day. You should always take the first dose early in the morning and the second dose in the evening. It is advised to do so. Since fat loss supplements also contain stimulants and/or caffeine, you should not take any fat loss supplements at night or before bedtime. Online Store or Shop for Supplements Body Tech is one of the best and top-selling stores also online stores for fitness supplements in Australia. They are popular for pre-workout supplements, post-workout supplements, protein supplements, fat loss supplements, Joint health supplements, vitamin C, fish oil, all over in Australia."
20,Dialysis definition and realities,health-fitness," Dialysis definition and realities Kidney Dialysis is a technique that subs for a considerable lot of the ordinary elements of the kidneys. Dialysis permits individuals with kidney failure (Renal Failure) an opportunity to carry on with profitable lives. When kidney work diminishes to a basic level or complexities emerge, an individual may need to begin dialysis. There are two primary kinds of dialysis, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis Center utilizes a machine and a channel to eliminate by-products and water from the blood. Peritoneal Dialysis utilizes a liquid (dialysate) that is put into the patient's stomach depression to eliminate side-effects and liquid from the body. Each sort of dialysis has focal points and weaknesses. People frequently can pick which kind of long haul dialysis that best matches their necessities. Dialysis gives a few people an all-inclusive life, and in others, it gives extra an ideal opportunity to find a proper giver kidney for a kidney relocate (renal transfer). What is dialysis? The kidneys are liable for sifting by-products from the blood. Dialysis is a methodology that subs for huge numbers of the ordinary elements of the kidneys. The kidneys are two organs situated on either side in the rear of the stomach pit. Dialysis can permit people to carry on with gainful and valuable carries on with, despite the fact that their kidneys at this point don't work sufficiently. Measurements from 2015, U.S. Renal Data System Annual Data Report (USRDS), indicated around 468,000 patients were accepting dialysis in the United States. In excess of an extra 193,000 patients had a working kidney relocate for end stage renal ailment. Dialysis helps the body by playing out the elements of bombed kidneys. The kidney has numerous jobs. A basic occupation of the kidney is to control the body's liquid parity. It does this by changing the measure of pee that is discharged consistently. On hot days, the body sweats more. Along these lines, less water should be discharged through the kidneys. On cool days, the body sweats less. Along these lines, pee yield should be more prominent so as to keep up the best possible parity inside the body. It is the kidney's responsibility to control liquid parity by changing pee yield. Another significant obligation of the kidney is to eliminate the by-products that the body produces for the duration of the day. As the body capacities, cells use energy. The activity of the cells produces by-products that must be taken out from the body. At the point when these byproducts are not taken out satisfactorily, they develop in the body. A height of byproducts, as estimated in the blood, is designated ""azotemia."" When side-effects aggregate they cause a wiped out inclination all through the body called ""uremia,"" which is because of urea and different nitrogenous waste mixes. When do patients require dialysis? At the point when the kidneys neglect to channel the blood successfully, and liquid and side-effects develop in the body to a basic level an individual may need to begin dialysis. The two primary driver of kidney disappointment and requirement for dialysis treatment are diabetes and hypertension. At the point when an individual's degrees of side-effects in their body become so high they begin to get wiped out from them, the person in question may require dialysis. The degree of the byproducts for the most part develops gradually. Specialists that represent considerable authority in ailments and states of the kidneys are called nephrologists. To enable nephrologists to choose when dialysis is important for a patient, he she will arrange tests that measure a few blood synthetic levels in the patient's body. The two significant blood synthetic levels that are estimated are the ""creatinine level"" and the ""blood urea nitrogen"" (BUN) level. As these two levels rise, they are markers of the diminishing capacity of the kidneys to scrub the collection of side-effects. Specialists utilize a pee test, the ""creatinine freedom,"" to quantify the degree of kidney work. The patient spares pee in an extraordinary holder for one entire day. The side-effects in the pee and in the blood are assessed by estimating the creatinine. By looking at the blood and pee level of this substance, the specialist has a precise thought of how well the kidneys are functioning. This outcome is known as the creatinine leeway. Ordinarily, when the creatinine freedom tumbles to 1 under 10 cc/minute, the patient needs dialysis. The specialist likewise utilizes different markers of the patient's status to choose about the requirement for dialysis. In the event that the patient is encountering a significant powerlessness to free the assortment of abundance water, or is grumbling of issues with the heart, lungs, or stomach, or troubles with taste or sensation in their legs, dialysis might be demonstrated despite the fact that the creatinine leeway has not tumbled to the 10 cc/minute level."

1,Real Weight Loss Solutions,health-fitness," Much of the weight loss industry likes to focus on overweight Americans. That’s where the money is for them. But the truth is, much of the world is overweight, too. Studies showed that in 2000, 45% of adults all over the world were overweight. Overweight people are more likely to have chronic health problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and knee arthritis. Overweight people also die at younger ages than persons of normal weight. Many overweight people want to lose weight to improve their health and their appearance. Because so many people want to loose weight and doing it is difficult there are many commercial weight loss programs on the market. Many are expensive, capitalizing on the huge demand. Of those programs many are ineffective. Each year millions of Americans and Europeans enroll in commercial and self-help weight loss programs. Health care providers and their obese patients know little about these programs because of the absence of systematic reviews. Unfortunately, many patients and their doctors know little about the effectiveness and safety of these programs, either. Few high-quality studies have assessed weight loss programs. Many of the existing studies present the best-case scenario because they do not account for people who drop out of the program. he evidence to support the effectiveness of major commercial weight loss programs is limited. Patients considering the use of commercial weight loss programs should realize that these programs have not been carefully studied. So, do weight loss programs really work? Some do in the short term but long term results are doubtful. The real effective way to lose weight is jsut what we all want to ignore: behavioral change done diligently over time. Changing behavior over time and engaging in a regular exercise routine is what will take excess weight off and keep it off. There is no magic potion, pill or program. Change behavior from what you eat to how you eat it, how much you eat and when is the key to long term, sucessful wight loss. It comes down to more calories used each day, called “burning calories,” than taking in, called “eating.” If you are fighting obesity haphazardly, start to change your behavior TODAY. Use a smart yet systematic approach to behavior modification. It will take time but the long term benefits and permanent weight loss will be there!"
2,How to Treat Nail Fungal Infection,health-fitness," How to Treat Nail Fungal Infection Your doctor may prescribe an oral anti-fungal drug. Studies show the most effective durgs are terbinafine (Lamisil) and itraconazole (Sporanox). Treatment with oral antibiotic medications effectively combats fungal infections about 75% of the time. Treatment success rates with these drugs appear to be lower in adults over age 65. And treatment success seems to improve when you combine oral and topical anti-fungal therapies. However the drugs must be taken for a long period in order to be effective. These drugs help a new nail grow free of infection, slowly replacing the infected part. You typically take this type of drug for 6 to 12 weeks. But you won't see the end result of treatment until the nail grows back completely. It may take 4 months or longer to eliminate an infection. And during the treatment, the oral anti-fungal drugs may cause side effects ranging from skin rash to liver damage. Severe liver reactions have been observed with these drugs. As a result, patients who are taking these drugs are asked to have routine blood tests to make sure their liver is not damaged. Doctors may not recommend these drugs for people with liver disease or congestive heart failure or those taking certain medications. Other potential side effects include headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, dyspepsia, stomach pain, diarrhea, constipation, reversible loss of taste, hepatitis, neutropenia and pancytopenia. Most people start their treatment with the use of topical medications or home remedies. Patients have tried topical Lamisil, Lotrimin, Micatin, Vicks Vapor-Rub, tea tree oil, white vinegar, rubbing alcohol and bleach. All of these need to be used twice a day for up to one year to see results. The probable effectiveness rate of this treatment method is less than 20%. Nail fungal infection, is a common nail pathology which is a treatment challenge to healthcare professionals. Anti-fungal drugs have been the mainstay of therapy for many years. Recently, laser technologies have been introduced as a new treatment method for nail fungal infection to avoid the disadvantages of oral and topical drug therapies and offer a rapid treatment for an often persistent unhealthy conditions of nails. Laser treatment is completely drug free, meaning it does not impose all the health risks associated with the oral anti-fungal medications. There are no adverse reactions, injuries, or known side effects from use of lasers to treat a fingernail or toenail fungal infection. In one word, laser treatment is a green & pure physiotherapy way. We will notice result as short as the 4th week of use. To achieve significant improvement and removal and prevent future fungal infections, it takes about 3 months for treatment. Laser treatment is more cost-effective & time-effective than medicine treatment. One of the most popular laser treatment devices for nail fungal infection looks like a clip with both low level laser and blue light, and takes only 7 minutes each time.

3,How to stimulate a newborn's eyesight and hearing?,health-fitness," The five senses we are born with we allow us to perceive the world around us, but the level of their development at the time of birth varies from child to child. The first and most important sense by which the fetus perceives its surroundings is hearing, which enables it to know the sound of its mother's voice or the beating of her heart. Immediately after birth, the vision of the newborn is the least developed sense. How can you ensure the proper development of these and other senses? There is no better way than active stimulation! The development of eyesight from birth to the age of one 1 month old •	has blurry vision (visual acuity is 30 times lower than in an adult's), •	does not distinguish shapes and colors, because they blend together, •	has not learned to focus on objects or people, let alone moving objects, •	the most visible objects for an infant are strongly outlined and black and white (and they are the most stimulating), •	better perceives objects on the edge of their field of view; has so-called peripheral vision. Stimulating the eyesight of a newborn - install large,  black and white objects, with contrasting, expressive elements in the close vicinity of the child (e.g. in the crib), which the child will be able to notice and on which their eyes will be able to focus for extended periods of time. 2-3 months old •	begins to follow objects and people with their eyes more consciously, •	directs their head towards an observed light source, •	laid on the stomach, begins to raise their head. Stimulating the eyesight of an infant - an example of a proven exercise is to place contrasting pictures or objects in front of the baby lying on their stomach. This not only gives the toddler the ability to stimulate the eyesight but also forces them to raise their head to see something, which exercises and strengthens the muscles. Consider introducing a colorful educational mat that will stimulate the child to focus on colored objects. 4-5 months old •	can focus on more complex shapes, •	sees their own hands and points towards the desired object, •	perceives more colors, especially bright, intense colors, •	can follow a moving object that is about 30 cm away from their face. Stimulating the eyesight of an infant – use black and white pictures for babies and toys in black and white colors that can be moved closer and further from the child's face when playing with them. 6-8 months old •	eyesight becomes more and more efficient, the toddler notices distant objects as well as those that are in motion, •	consciously follows objects, •	masters eye-hand coordination, •	grasps toys and even shifts them from hand to hand. Stimulating the eyesight of an infant – toys with a large diameter are a good solution since they are easier for a child to grasp and shift from hand to hand, which incentivizes intensive opening of the hand. For a toddler that is already able to crawl, you can leave toys at a distance that will make the baby move towards them. 9-12 months old •	can perceive the world “to its fullest” using their senses, which are already at a high level, •	points their finger at the desired thing or person, •	can show details in pictures or booklets, •	recognizes sounds made by familiar animals. Stimulating the eyesight of an infant – contrasting pictures with animals, frequent contact with other people and children. Even though the baby's eyesight is the least developed sense at birth, it develops very intensively (up to about 2 years of age), so it is worth providing the baby with appropriate visual experience, adapted to their current abilities. The development of hearing from birth to the age of one Hearing is the most developed sense at the time of birth. But although a newborn can hear well, they are nevertheless sensitive to high-pitched sounds, especially very sudden ones. In the 20th week of gestation, the baby develops the ability to hear low-frequency sounds, and in the third trimester recognizes the sound of the mother's voice, as well as music. From birth until around 4 months of age After birth, the sounds of music are soothing for the baby, so he can calm down and calm down with them. However, she reacts to sharp sounds with Moro's reflex, consisting in a sudden throw of her hands to the side and tensing the body. She may also start crying or squeezing her eyes tight when she makes sudden loud noises. Stimulating the hearing of an infant - as the toddler reacts poorly to loud sounds, it is worth providing him with a quiet and peaceful environment, sounds of the radio, conversations, lullabies, etc. 0-3 months old •	the child reacts to known sounds, •	turns their head towards the source of the sound, •	the child starts to coo, i.e. unconsciously make sounds, •	wakes up when they hear loud noises •	smiles when they hear a familiar voice, •	listens to the conversations of other people around them, •	the child stops moving when they hear a sudden sound, such as a doorbell, •	exhibits change in activity, e.g. the child sucks when they hear their mom's voice. 4-6 months old •	the child starts to crow, i.e. consciously make their own sounds, •	reacts to the rustle of paper, •	can locate the source of a sound, •	listens to what others say. 7-9 months old •	begins to react to their name, •	tries to imitate the sounds heard around them, •	understands the emotional meaning of the parents' statements, e.g. you must not, •	listens to their own sounds, •	is able to manipulate sound toys to produce sound. 10-12 months old •	the child says their first words, •	moves when they hear music, •	recognizes onomatopoeic expressions, •	focuses for much longer on the sound they hear, •	understand simple commands. It is worth getting your baby accustomed to the sounds of devices such as a vacuum cleaner or hairdryer (the so-called white noise) as soon as possible, even during sleep. These sounds remind your baby of the sounds they heard while in the womb. Stimulating your baby's hearing is much easier than stimulating eyesight and does not require the purchase of contrasting books or items. It is enough to just talk to the baby, sing, play lullabies, or quiet songs. You can also use rattles, squeaks, or sound toys. Polysensory stimulation, i.e. the stimulation of many senses at once, is very important for a child from the moment it is born. It helps with the development of sensory integration, that is, perceiving the environment through the senses, processing the information they deliver and remembering it. This has a huge impact on the development of a newborn, so it is worth taking care of properly facilitating the development of the child's senses."
4,What Makes Mental Health Billing So Difficult?,health-fitness," Vexatious Aspects of Mental Health Billing Let’s face it, the healthcare industry is vast and complex, even more so for mental health providers. This is especially true when it comes to the billing process. The variety in the types of services, the time, scope and restraints put on mental health treatments make the billing process quite demanding. If a patient visits his or her medical doctor, the doctor will likely perform standard tests and services, such as measuring a patient’s height and weight, checking blood pressure and perhaps drawing blood. Such tests tend to be standardized across patients, differing only slightly among patients and all taking nearly the equivalent amount of time. As a result, billing is also repetitive and standardized. With mental health providers, however, services vary way more extensively. The length of the session, the approach to therapy and the willingness of the patient to partake make it far more difficult to standardize treatment and billing. Moreover, the manner in which insurance companies look at mental health is noticeably unlike the way they look at more traditional medical practices. For example, insurance companies can determine how long treatments are allowed to take and how many sessions can take place each day, making it challenging for mental health clinicians to balance effective billing with adequate patient treatment. Additionally, the requirement of pre-authorization has resulted in more difficulty and complexity for mental health billing. The differences between medical billing and mental health billing are also magnified by office budgets. A large group practice might hire dedicated employees to focus wholly on medical health billing, but with mental health, it’s more commonplace to have small group or solo practices with limited administrative support for billing and other office duties. Some providers will even try to do the billing themselves but sooner or later, this will become overwhelming and produce time management problems, not to mention lost income. All this makes the billing process quite demanding for mental health professionals. They need to make sure that they can keep income levels high while also assuring that each and every patient gets the utmost quality care. Truth is, no one gets into the mental health field because they enjoy wading through insurance industry bureaucracy. People become mental health professionals because they want to help others. However, providers cannot help others unless they collect sufficient funds to run their practices and pay themselves. It’s rather predictable, without a dedicated staff member to keep up-to-date on healthcare billing codes, changing regulations and the billing practices of each insurance company, rejection rates will climb. Put simply, there are fewer pitfalls involved in medical billing versus mental health billing because medical health billing is more straightforward. Avoiding billing issues is vital to the well-being of your business As a mental health clinician, being paid for the services you provide to patients is paramount. Unfortunately, due to the frequency of insurance claim denials today, payment is not always assured for your services. Payer sources use denials and rejections as tools to force clinicians to hand over hard-earned dollars. Let’s briefly look at some of the more common billing pitfalls. Seeing Patients Too Often. Serving and billing a larger number of patients than you could credibly see during a typical workday is one billing pitfall. For instance, seeing and billing 50 patients and using the same code for these patients could be a red flag to an insurance company. Similarly, if you work in a psych hospital for half of your workday and then are at a clinic for the second half of your workday where you claim to see 50 patients, this also is not considered feasible. Clients Seeing Multiple Therapists Another billing pitfall happens when a client is visiting multiple therapists. This can occur if a client must see a therapist in the same facility as his or her doctor, but he or she is also meeting a private therapist or counselor for personal reasons, such as the client prefers sessions with the private therapist. A payer source will not want to pay for two different therapists for a single client. Frequently Using the Same ICD-10 Code Using the same ICD-10 code too often is another common billing pitfall for mental health professionals. Variety is key in billing to avoid audit risk. When you bill the same diagnosis code for all of your patients, such as anxiety disorder, this is considered a red flag. Specific Codes That Raise a Red Flag Another billing pitfall surfaces from the use of specific codes in mental health billing that can raise red flags. Billing too many specific codes for your services can create problems for your practice. Three of the codes to be aware of are billing code 90837 (individual psychotherapy); billing code 99215 (established patient visit); and billing code 90853 (group psychotherapy). Treatment Plans The final billing pitfall for mental health professionals lies in treatment plans for patients. Not completing a treatment plan is a definite way to not receive payment or to be required to pay back money to a payer source after an audit. Documentation and billing errors can also occur when a claim is missing progress notes and does not include a plan for the patient’s long-term care. The bottom line is that billing issues for mental health professionals can lead to reduced revenue, unproductive time and further stress. Maybe it’s time to get help with your mental health billing Okay, it’s been demonstrated that billing for mental health differs greatly from billing for medical services. We’ve also determined that mental health professionals often operate on a smaller budget than medical facilities and many offices employ a small staff. As a result, taking on the billing needs of patients can stretch counselors and staff members thin, which can ultimately impact client service. Reducing the time for billing and coding procedures can, however, be harmful to offices focusing on mental health services as insurance companies will quickly deny a claim that is not filed or coded accurately. Such is the dilemma faced by mental health professionals today! Okay, what are the benefits of outsourcing your billing process? Most healthcare providers don’t possess the time or know-how to manage the billing process. Plus, very few have the means to take on an in-house billing team. This especially holds true for the mental health provider. By outsourcing such things as your statement preparation, data entry, filing and follow-ups to a third party, your practice benefits in the following ways. Reduction in unpaid claims We get it. Nothing is more wearisome than disputing with the insurance company over unpaid claims. When you work with a billing service, not only will the number of unpaid claims go down, but they’ll also contest the ones that get rejected. Billing services take the irritation of dealing with insurers off your plate. That involves looking into claim rejections, tracking full payment of partly reimbursed submissions, and keeping up on approved claims that have not yet been paid.  In short, third party billing services help you take command of your receivables once and for all. A billing service will submit your claim accurately the first time You’re clearly aware that proper coding is vital if you hope to be reimbursed promptly. The traditional therapist billing software utilized by a third-party billing service starts by authenticating the client’s insurance coverage. Next, they accurately code the claim and submit it straightaway. Not only will claims be clean the first time they are submitted but as mentioned above, you’ll witness a dramatic drop in rejections and partial payments. This will increase cash flow and help keep your focus on your patients. Offer cost-effective solutions With outsourced billing, your organization can free up in-house resources substantially. Rather than tasking your employees with time-consuming billing duties, they can work on things such as quality assurance and improving patient care. Help to reduce your expenses Mental health providers can reduce their office expenses by using the services of a third-party biller as well as the existing software. All you need is a PC and access to the internet. The majority of practice management software is all-inclusive, even over the internet and is part of the service provided. No costly software updates or support fees. No hidden costs or added charges. Improved communication When you work directly with insurance companies, you’ll most likely be able to work with them only during their specified business hours, which may not even be in the same time zone as your practice. It’s also to be expected that you’ll end up talking with a different agent each time you call, obliging you to describe your circumstances again and again. When you use a billing service to help push through your claims, you’ll do away with these aggravations. More time to provide direct care Every minute spent tracking down claim information in the course of your business day is a minute you’re unable to devote to providing direct care. This disruption forces you to miss out on would-be income opportunities. Let’s say you charge $100 per hour and devote one business hour every day on billing. In this instance, you may be losing up to $500 every week. When you recoup this lost time by employing a billing service, you’ll be growing your income potential and, in many cases, producing added revenue that exceeds the cost of the billing service. When should you consider outsourcing? When your practice’s billing process is inadequate When your practitioners and staff are not technologically sound When your practice has excessive staff turnover When your practice is new Or, putting it another way, the real cost of billing is not the payroll expense. It’s really all the charges that were not billed in the first place or were not followed up after billing. An expert billing service would pay for itself. Conclusion: Outsourcing mental health billing can allow offices to focus on patient services while realizing higher returns for services provide. What should you look for when searching for a mental health billing service? It pays to take your time and be discerning when assessing possible providers for your outsourced mental health billing. Before you make your decision, make sure to find out if the provider has the following capabilities and the wherewithal to do the job. Ensure they offer specialty-specific mental health solutions.

7,How Dental Procedures Work With Anesthesia,health-fitness," All medical procedures have greatly benefitted from the introduction of anesthesia in practice. It doesn't only eliminate pain for the patients being treated but also allows the professional to focus on more important technicalities of the process. Let's first try to understand how anesthesia works. Anesthesia is a safe way to control pain during dental surgery and keep in check any discomfort as the dentist carries out procedures. It works to eliminate painful sensations in the specific area being operated upon without entirely losing consciousness unnecessarily. The medication typically administered through an injection creates a numb feeling during orthodontic or dental procedures with effects lasting up to a few hours after treatment. Anesthesia lets the patients be calm and relaxed and experience less anxiety and pain through the process. Types of Anesthesia The type of anesthesia suitable for you will majorly depend on your medical records and type of treatment you are getting, best decided by your dentist/orthodontist. Long more intensive oral procedures require a heavy anesthetic administration to keep you calm during the procedure. However smaller, less invasive kinds of oral surgery such as a filling or trimming may do with a local anesthetic that will only numb the specific localized area. Your eligibility for a certain kind of anesthetic will depend on various factors such as pregnancy, blood sugar level, and blood pressure levels as there are various risky aspects for different conditions. Here are brief explanations of the different kinds of anesthetics available, their utility, and procedures that use them. Local Anesthesia The Local anesthesia numbs a localized region of your mouth without making you completely unconscious. Dentists usually use them to perform a tooth extraction, root canal or have stitches in place. They are administered via sprays, ointments, or gels that are applied to the specific area or in some cases injected in combination with epinephrine to prevent it from spreading elsewhere in the body. Most people don't experience any side effects from local anesthesia, you should still check in with your dentist and doctor. Sedation Sedation is offered to have a calming effect on the body before, during, and after the procedure as it relives the nervousness and anxiety associated with injections, visiting a dentist, or simply getting operated upon. Unlike Anesthesia, it doesn't relieve pain but it has a calming effect on the patient, preparing them for the procedure. A popularly used sedative used is nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas, which can be inhaled or taken via an injectable or oral pill. Typically, you won't remember many conversations from the procedure and might experience side effects like dizziness, nausea, and headache. People with special health conditions need to take extra care and consult before getting administered. General Anesthesia General anesthesia makes your body completely unconscious. General anesthesia is required for long extensive procedures in case of serious, invasive oral surgery. It can be taken through an IV injection or inhaled as an anesthetic gas. Various procedures require general anesthesia as a must but it has various side effects as compared to sedation or local anesthesia. Speak to your dentist if you have underlying risk factors or conditions for general anesthesia. This may include high blood pressure/sugar, heart problems, pregnancy, and other conditions that might affect your blood pressure, respiratory system, or nervous system. Pros of Anesthesia Patients particularly with a phobia of dental treatments or anxiety associated with injections may more likely avoid anesthetics for required during dental procedures. However, once your dentist elaborates and briefs you on the benefits of anesthesia, you relax and remain calmer during the surgery and feel less pain. The main advantages of anesthesia include: Using anesthesia can help the professional do the procedure in a single sitting instead of multiple, saving a lot of time and money. The patients experience negligible to no pain or discomfort during the procedure and hence surgeries can be undertaken more smoothly. Anesthesia used in combination with sedation can help relieve anxiety, pain, phobias, and discomfort during procedures in dentistry. All kinds of anesthetics used in dentistry or orthodontics are completely safe and highly useful. Most anesthetics do not completely put you to sleep except general anesthesia so the patient can remain conscious and be consciously present for the procedure. Drawbacks of Anesthesia Although anesthetics do not have major side effects still doctors should have full information on your medical history and past record of substance/alcohol abuse or any other underlying conditions (something even as minor as an allergy). Nausea Vomiting Swelling in the region Dizziness Prolonged numbness (usually subsides within few hours) Anesthetic is a major branch of study that assists in carrying out medical procedures smoothly without pain and hassles. However, you should never self-diagnose and always have a doctor look into what kind of anesthesia works best for you as well as the treatment. Further last but not the least, don't let any of your fears and phobias keep you from visiting the dentist. Regular check-ups are done for your own good so minor problems don't turn big and now as you know your fears and other anxieties can also be easily worked out once you pay a visit. So, don't ignore any arising pain or discomfort in your teeth, gums, or mouth, and keep brightening the world with your smile, always!"

10,How Watching Your Diet Can Help Your Arthritis Symptoms,health-fitness," Did you know that by 2040, it’s estimated 78 million Americans 18 years or older will have some form of arthritis? That’s an astonishing amount of people that a trusted Riverside arthritis doctor can help prevent you from being a part of. The truth is, there is no magic diet that is going to make your arthritis disappear forever — whether it’s osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or another form. But, here’s the good news: If you’re realistic about your goals, paying attention to your diet can greatly ease your symptoms. Osteoarthritis (OA) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Differences There are many variables between these two common forms of arthritis, but an easy way to think of the main difference between RA and OA is this: rheumatoid arthritis is about inflammation of the tissue around the joints—osteoarthritis is about deterioration of the cartilage between the joints. Of course, there are other differences between rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis that can go into great detail. One of the main similarities is they can both impact your spine. Following are a few more differences. First and foremost, rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease, and is not associated with the wear and tear of joints. This type of disorder occurs when your body's immune system turns against itself—attacking your body's healthy tissues when it should be protecting them. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) complications are known for affecting all parts of the body, not just the joints. The same inflammatory processes that cause joints to hurt and become damaged also cause problems to the eyes, lungs, skin, heart, blood vessels and more. Ongoing RA inflammation can destroy the joint cartilage and bone around affected joints. Severe cartilage loss eventually leads to bones becoming deformed. Deformities make it hard to use an affected joint and may eventually lead to disability. RA joint damage is usually irreversible and while many patients experience flares followed by periods of remission, sometimes the disease gets steadily more serious. Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis and is sometimes referred to as “wear-and-tear arthritis”. Other names include degenerative joint disease, degenerative arthritis, DJD, and osteoarthrosis. It develops when cartilage, the flexible tissue that allows bones in a joint to glide over each other, breaks down and usually begins in an isolated joint. When your cartilage begins to wear away, you lose that barrier between the bones of your joints. So your bones then can rub onto one another, which can be very painful. Osteoarthritis causes pain, stiffness, and swelling of the affected joints. While it is most common among adults over age 65, people of any age can develop it. Women are two to three times more likely to be affected after the age of 45, and men are more likely to be affected before the age of 45. The Ultimate Arthritis Diet A carefully thought out diet high in nutrients is a great place to start, and many foods can help fight inflammation and improve joint symptoms. It’s also important to remember that consistency and thinking long-term is key. If you know you won’t stick to a new way of eating for the long-haul, find ways of healthy eating that you will confidently commit to. There’s a well-established relationship between obesity and pain, so diet plays a key part in preventing and managing arthritis symptoms. A low-calorie Mediterranean diet high in Omega 3 fatty acids and low in Omega-6 fatty acids has proven one of the best habits of health for those suffering with arthritis. Studies confirm that eating foods commonly part of the Mediterranean diet can do the following: •    Lower blood pressure •    Protect against chronic conditions, ranging from cancer to stroke •    Help arthritis by curbing inflammation •    Benefit your joints as well as your heart •    Lead to weight loss, which can lessen joint pain The Mediterranean diet consists primarily of the following: •    Fish •    Nuts & Seeds •    Olive Oil •    Fruits & Veggies •    Whole Grains •    Beans •    Nightshade Vegetables A recent study compared diet and exercise with diet alone and exercise alone in lowering the stress on the knees in people with obesity and osteoarthritis. Diet and exercise combined yielded the best results — so your best bet is to work with your doctor to develop a diet plan and an exercise routine that takes your condition and potential limitations into account."

This process is practically used in the famous therapeutic salt rooms. Salt Room Therapy: Salt room therapy is an internationally acclaimed spiritual treatment which is used to treat respiratory, skin, and anxiety issues by using the abilities of Himalayan pink salt. It is being done in the exclusively made salt-induced rooms by using its ability to generate negative ions and make the environment healthy. The walls of the salt rooms are made of salt tiles and floors are usually covered with granulated salt to get a complete salt exposure. People sit, relax, and breathe in the salt rooms and feel a clear difference afterward. This therapeutic technique is also somehow proved by experts and associations.

Precautions Released by Salt Therapy Association: The Salt Therapy Association (STA) divulged some important precautions regarding the pink salt treatment. According to the STA precautionary measures, salt rooms are normal for the kids to have many salt therapy sessions. However, pregnant or nursing women should ask their doctors before attempting salt room therapy. The STA site additionally does not suggest salt therapy for the people who have viral diseases such as infectious maladies, fever, open wounds, extreme hypertension, and dynamic tuberculosis.

12,Is There a Link Between COVID-19 and Rheumatoid Arthritis?,health-fitness," People with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) may be more at risk for contracting COVID-19 compared to others. If those with RA develop COVID-19, they may be at higher risk for developing severe symptoms and additional complications. Treatment options for RA may also affect the immune system, increasing the risk further. It’s important to check with a Fallbrook arthritis doctor before abruptly stopping any treatments for RA, as this may lead to a flare up. The COVID-19 virus is highly infectious and spreads through respiratory droplets in the air and people with autoimmune diseases like RA are more likely to get infections, including COVID-19. Severe Complications of COVID-19 RA can cause complications involving the heart and lungs. Since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, people with heart and lung issues are more likely to have serious symptoms, too. The following factors may increase your chances of developing more severe symptoms of COVID-19. That’s why it is so important to stay on top of your RA treatments, eat right, and go for regular physicals and check-ups: • Adult age 60+ • Have other medical conditions, like type 2 diabetes or obesity • Have severe, unmanaged RA • Have been previously hospitalized with a respiratory infection • Taking drugs for RA called immunosuppressants Examples of immunosuppressants include some of the drugs in these categories: • Corticosteroids • Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) • Biologics, biosimilars Protecting Yourself From COVID Since some RA medications like immunosuppressants suppress the immune system, you might wonder whether you should stop taking them to protect against COVID-19. Never stop taking medication without consulting with an experienced RA doctor. Keep taking your medications as directed as stopping could cause serious complications, which require even more medication. Scientists are still studying the link between COVID-19 and RA. However, infections are a known trigger of RA flares when symptoms increase in severity. If you develop COVID-19, the infection may cause a flare. It can also be emotionally taxing to cope with and the stress can also worsen RA symptoms. If you have RA, be sure to take extra steps to protect against COVID-19. You may have a higher risk for getting the virus or developing severe symptoms if you do develop COVID-19. This is especially true if you’re older or have other medical issues. Follow the general rules for COVID-19 prevention and consider the following these steps as extra precaution: •  Ask your doctor for a refill if you’re due or almost due •  Ask your doctor for a 90-day supply instead of the usual 30 days •  Contact other pharmacies if your usual location is out of stock What to Do if You Get Sick Most cases of COVID-19 are mild.

The second category is people inclined to be overweight. The reasons are very different - from hereditary predisposition to poor nutrition in childhood. Most often, such people have a manageable weight and lend themselves well to correction. The third category is people with a predisposition to obesity. All three categories of these people can use the following weight loss techniques . Weight Loss Techniques: Eat cold food whenever possible. When you eat hot food, you absorb not only its nutrients and calories, but also heat, and these are additional calories that will keep the body temperature - about 37 ° C, and inhibit the burning of the body's own calories. In addition, in order to absorb cold food, the body will have to warm it to core body temperature. This will contribute to slow digestion and late onset of hunger. Drink soft drinks. Drinking 2 liters of cold water will leave the body in the form of urine heated to 37 ° C. An increase in water temperature will require energy from the body. Thus, without any special effort, the body will lose calories. Take a lukewarm shower. This will force the body to expend 100 calories just to prevent the body from cooling. A refreshing shower works best when directed to areas where blood circulates through arteries close to the skin (armpits, groin, neck, chest). Do not wet your back and hair. Avoid well heated areas. A room temperature of 25 ° C contributes to an increase in body weight. It needs to be lowered by 3 ° C, which will force the body to burn 100 extra calories per day. Wear lightweight clothing, do not wear tight-fitting clothing. The clothed body always sweats a little and this fumes should be encouraged by wearing loose clothing. These simple steps can help you lose up to 420 calories a day. However, cold alone is not enough for weight loss. Physical activity. Exercise has always contributed to weight loss, however, there are a few rules to be aware of in order for exercise to be beneficial, not harmful.

17,"Why and when did humankind switch to metal cookware, and what have been the effects?",health-fitness," The human civilizations had been making cookware from clay since early history, even with the existence of skilled Metallurgy (the art and science of extracting and forming things from metals). And they never felt the need to try any other material because, along with the art and skill of making clay cookware was passed along the value to the health of the food, by cooking in them. But recent history changed many things. With the advent of Industrialization came the excessive mining of metals during the 17, 18 and 19th century. With all that metal everywhere, people had to find a way to re-purpose it! Why not re-make it into cookware! A brilliant idea then, is only now showing its ugly head. After a few generations of eating food tainted with metal ions, and nutritionally lacking, we have become a race that is acquiring new illness and diagnoses by the hour, so to speak. A far cry from the groups of people just a few generations ago that were eating food cooked in clay and did not have the health problems we are suffering from: Here are some of the popular metals used in making cookware and what they do to food: Iron: The metal or ferric form of iron from cast iron cookware has no health value and cannot be assimilated like the ferrous form found in plants and meat. It remains toxic in the blood and combined with oxygen, forms free radicals. Studies show these free radicals may the cause of many kinds of cancer. Aluminum: Chronic aluminum exposure has contributed directly to hepatic failure, renal failure, and dementia (Arieff et al., 1979). This soft metal reacts with foods and releases metal into blood which could be the root cause of Alzheimer’s disease. Other health problems caused by this toxic metal are colic, convulsions, esophagitis, gastroenteritis, kidney damage, liver dysfunction, loss of appetite, loss of balance, muscle pain, psychosis, shortness of breath, weakness, and fatigue (ATSDR 1990). Aluminum toxicity can even cause birth defects in newborns. Stainless Steel: It is made up of a combination of various metals like iron, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, carbon etc. that are all toxic. For example, even a small concentration of nickel can cause kidney dysfunction, low blood pressure, muscle tremors, oral cancer, skin problems etc. Titanium: Contrary to popular belief, titanium is a reactive soft metal. It contaminates food by reacting to nutrients present in the form of oxygen, hydrogen, halogens, acids, and bases. The resultant pseudo-nutrients accumulate in the blood, cells, tissues, and organs and make them dysfunctional over time. Ceramics & other inferior quality clays: Ceramics and other clays like flame ware, stoneware, terracotta etc. have secondary or tertiary clay that has impurities. Furthermore, additives containing metal oxides and chemicals are used for ease of manufacturing and making the product attractive. This defeats the whole purpose of making clay cookware because the final product is sure to leach toxins and contaminate food. Pure Clay Cookware – the only healthy alternative to metals & ceramics This leaves us with the only material our ancestors were initially using – all-natural primary clay. Miriams Earthen Cookware (MEC) – a pioneering company in the USA is working day and night to correct probably one of the biggest mistakes in human history, by making pots and pans from pure clay. Their cookware pieces are individually handcrafted without using additives or glazes from scientifically tested raw material. MEC leaves no stone unturned in making certain their cooking pots are 100% non-toxic, pure, and healthy – exactly how they should be for cooking food."

7,Why Sunken Trampolines Are So Popular Today,health-fitness," Instead of investing in a standard trampoline that is above the ground, you may want to invest in one that is at the ground level. These are sometimes referred to as a sunken trampoline. You will have to excavate a specific amount of room for the trampoline to descend below the ground as people are jumping up and down on it. There are many reasons why parents in particular will appreciate this type of trampoline over any of the others that are currently sold. Even though those standard trampolines can be completely safe, there are safety reasons related to this emphasis on why sunken trampolines are so popular today. They Can Help Protect Kids From Falling If your kids have fallen out of the trampoline before, it was likely because you did not have a protective barrier around it. This is a common practice with most trampolines today. However, there are still those that are sold without them, and if your kids fly off, they could end up breaking an arm or leg. Therefore, to alleviate the potential for this problem, a sunken trampoline is the best choice. If they fly off of the trampoline, the furthest they could fall is on to the grass at literally the ground level. They Do Not Obscure The Surrounding Landscape If you have ever had a trampoline before, especially those that have the protective barrier, they are extremely easy to see. They will literally block anything behind them, and if you have spent a lot of money on landscaping your backyard, you really don't want everyone looking at only the trampoline. Therefore, you could pick a specific area, preferably to the left or right, so that the sunken trampoline has its own designated place. Of course, you should make sure that it is surrounded by soft material, such as grass, so that your kids will not fall and hurt themselves on rocks, trees, or even the concrete. They Are Easier To Maintain One final reason for investing in sunken trampolines is that they are easier to maintain. For example, there is a supporting structure for trampolines that has many nuts and bolts. Over time, through thousands of jumps that will occur, they can become loose. Some of them may even begin to break down. However, those that are in the ground are going to be supported by the ground, and therefore the usual wear and tear that accompanies trampoline use will not be as effective with the ground level trampolines. Although investing in these trampolines may be slightly more expensive than standard ones, it is going to be a worthwhile investment. Part of that investment will be the excavation of the soil where you are going to place it. However, once it is in the ground, your kids are going to have a good time, and they won't have to worry about falling. These are a great way to also preserve the surrounding landscape of your backyard as you will not be looking at the obtrusive metallic structure that typically accompanies every modern trampoline made today."

9,Orthodontic Exposure of Impacted Permanent Tooth using Soft Tissue Diode Laser,health-fitness," Introduction - An impacted tooth simply means that it is “stuck” and cannot erupt into function. The most commonly impacted or un-erupted tooth is the permanent maxillary canine. Primarily the impaction is due to arch length deficiency. Since the canine is usually the last tooth to erupt anterior to the first molar in the maxillary arch, shortage of space may result in ectopic eruption or impaction of this tooth. There has been numerous hypotheses developed regarding the etiology of canine impaction, the issue remains controversial. Impacted canine can cause complications without such as internal or external resorption, loss in arch length, infection associated with partial eruption, and resorption of the roots of lateral incisors. Treatment modality- Various treatment modalities have been proposed to avoid the complications associated with impacted canines such as use of scalpel, caustic agents, electrocautery and diode laser. However, Diode laser therapy is an effective and noninvasive treatment option for exposure of impacted canine without bone covering the tooth. But in most of the cases, it first requires orthodontic preparation of the maxillary arch in order to create adequate space between the lateral incisor and first premolar prior to surgical exposure. PIOON Laser offers different wavelengths like 450nm/810nm or 980nm. Out of which 450nm can be used in non-contact/contact mode whereas 810nm and 980nm are used in contact mode to perform the procedure. In this case after obtaining the informed consent surgical exposure of the tooth with diode laser at wavelength of 450nm was used in non-contact mode under topical anesthesia and the soft tissue over the impacted tooth was exposed. The impacted tooth was cleaned and scaled to permit bonding and an orthodontic bracket was bonded to position immediately in the same siting after the exposure of the tooth. The patient was given postoperative oral hygiene instructions that included chlorhexidine rinses, gentle tooth-brushing. Sana F et al. in 2018 and Deepa D et al used 940nm and 980nm wavelength respectively. They concluded that use of diode laser in the surgical intervention of submerged tooth exposure gives many intraoperative and postoperative advantages along with excellent results. Fornaini C et al. in 2016 also proved that wavelength 450 nm proved to be very effective and safe for soft tissue procedures with no side effects for the patients. Rationale behind Use of Lasers Diode laser offers advantages like patient compliance, reduced pain and discomfort, faster healing process, absence of bleeding and less chair side time. The greatest advantage is the complete absence of bleeding, which gives the possibility to immediately bond the bracket in dry enamel, so preventing the possibility of detach and reducing the risk of a further re-intervention Conclusion- The use of lasers in orthodontics, and in particular diode lasers, has made it possible for orthodontic clinicians to more easily address the challenges faced on a daily basis in an orthodontic practice.

11,Health Cover for Vector-Borne Diseases this Monsoon,health-fitness," Each year, people from both urban and rural populations in India exhibit symptoms such as weakness, body ache, and fever. Generally, they display these symptoms at the start of the monsoon. But from the standpoint of medical science, these are the indicators of vector-borne diseases such as Chikungunya, Dengue, and Malaria. Vector-borne diseases result from the action of vectors such as mosquitoes and fleas. They transmit disease-causing microbes, such as viruses and bacteria that cause these diseases. Often, the expenses for the treatment of these diseases add up to a hefty amount of money. As a result, one’s finances can come under severe strain for the treatment of these diseases. Fortunately, though, you can get coverage against it by virtue of vector insurance. Benefits of vector insurance Apart from Chikungunya, Dengue, and Malaria, vector insurance also covers a wide range of diseases. These include Zika Virus, Filariasis, Encephalitis, and more. The treatment cost for these diseases may range between Rs. 30,000, and Rs. 500,000. Both the upper and the lower limits of it are significant enough to wreak one’s finances, especially if one needs to bear it all of a sudden. Vector-borne insurance bails a beneficiary out of the financial trouble for meeting the cost with the following benefits: ●   Hospitalization benefits: Sometimes, hospitalization becomes necessary for the proper treatment of an individual when they suffer from one of the vector-borne diseases. The hospitalization benefits under vector insurance policy come to the rescue in such situations. These benefits provide coverage for charges for the ambulance, room rent, and daycare treatment. In addition, it also accounts for the ICU charges. ●   Cover for medical expenses: This component offers coverage for hospitalization charges for a period of 30 days and the medical expenses arising thereafter for up to 60 days. ●   Annual health check-up: This feature provides a comprehensive body checkup of an individual on a yearly basis to evaluate their health. This is important as it plays a vital role in the detection of vector-borne diseases due to which an individual also gets timely treatment. ●   Cashless treatment cover: The beneficiary gets a health card using which they can avail cashless treatment in one of the hospitals in an insurer’s network. It enables them to receive quality treatment for a vector-borne disease without the worry of making the payment for it in cash. ●   Automatic recharge of sum insured: This component can be termed as one of the hallmark features of a vector insurance policy. It reinstates the sum insured if the entire fund is used up in a year due to multiple claims. As a spin-off, this feature puts at bay the worry of running out of coverage due to multiple claims for the insured. While the benefits mentioned above cover the significant part of the coverage of a vector insurance cover, it also provides some additional benefits such as no claim bonus and alternative treatment cover. Final thoughts Given the commonness of vector-borne diseases in the monsoons in India, the diagnosis and on-time treatment are important for an individual. With the aforementioned benefits, a vector insurance policy can help you address both the needs."

14,How to shave your legs in the right way?,health-fitness," If you were to go to a beach, you wouldn't like to hang around with hairy legs. Shaving is one of the most primitive, yet efficient, cheapest and most effective methods to remove unwanted hair. Contrary to men, women tend to have softer and more fine hair, which is easier to cut, but at the same time, they also have much softer skin as compared to men. This makes them vulnerable to cuts and ugly rashes. Women especially need to take care while shaving. To avoid skin problems, they should always follow important shaving tips for legs. · Exfoliate your skin Use a good scrub and apply it carefully and evenly over your legs and gently massage it all over. This will exfoliate your skin and remove all dead cells. Removing dead cells is essential because dead cells are the leading cause of ingrown hair. · Wet your legs This is probably the most essential part of shaving tips for legs. It is imperative to wet your legs before you start shaving. It is always advisable to wet them with warm water. What warm water does is, it opens up the pores that hold the hair follicles and also makes the hair softer. Gently rubbing your legs helps soften the hair further. You can wrap a towel soaked in warm water around your legs for this purpose. Remember to leave it for a few minutes before you start. · Apply shaving cream A shaving cream aids in the smooth movement of the razor blades over the skin. The shaving cream's function is to hold the hair straight up so that the blades can cut them properly. It is recommended to invest in good shaving cream. It would help if you were not confused and carried away by the special shaving creams for women. Remember that all shaving cream contains the same thing. However, if you want, you can go for an aloe vera-based shaving cream to moisturize the skin. · Invest in a good razor Now, the razor is the most crucial part of the shaving procedure, and here you need to take care. Anything less than the best would prove painful and would finally lead to shaving bumps, cuts and nicks. You need to give special attention as to which kind of razor suits you best. It is recommended for you to go for a double or a triple-blade razor. Razors with rotating heads are even better because they can adjust to the legs' contours and give a perfectly close shave. Never use a dull razor because that would lead to nicks and bumps. The dull blades don't cut the hair easily, but instead pull the hair, which irritates the hair follicle and forms a bump. · Shave against the grain When you move your hand on the legs' surface, you can feel the direction for the growth of hair.

15,Transforming Healthcare through Artificial Intelligence and Robotics,health-fitness," Over the past few decades, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has played a vigorous role in transforming our world. Especially today, AI presents itself in many different forms and influences our daily life. It is incontestable, that the potential of AI and robotics is nearly endless, opening up new doors for a vast array of industries. Inevitably, Healthcare is one of the latter. Technology allows for more accurate, systematic, and impactful interventions in patient care. Artificial Intelligence is expected to drive the changes and improvements towards healthcare excellence, by truly augmenting human activity. Applications and Benefits of AI and Robotics in Healthcare AI has become extremely sophisticated at doing what humans have been traditionally doing. What’s more, it’s incomparably time-efficient and cost-effective. It lays the ground for proactive health management and encourages an appropriate lifestyle for well-being. Although the applications of AI and Robotics in healthcare are vast, we list just a few of them below: Self-Care, Prevention, and Healthy Lifestyle – Contemporary patients are becoming increasingly empowered to take care of their health and well-being. Starting from numerous healthcare applications all the way to sleep trackers and blood pressure measurers, AI-based solutions are able to provide personalized plans and guidance. They can track and process greater amounts of data and gain insights into care processes. Improving Healthcare Operations – With the Help of AI, operations such as scheduling, hospital admissions, discharge, and capacity management become simplified. Diagnosis – Many AI-based technologies can help triage patients and detect whether the symptoms present require additional attention. In turn, it creates a positive trend for the patients to appear at hospitals and emergency rooms only when essential. Early Detection and Diagnostics – AI solutions suggest effective ways for improving early detection mechanisms and timely diagnosis along with its accuracy. This is due to strengthened pattern recognition abilities that can have significant clinical implications. Decision-Making Support – AI can present a patient’s medical information in a well-structured way, that allows healthcare professionals to select the appropriate treatment option. Such facilitation results in a time-effective and evidence-based decision-making process. Care Assistance – Contemporary robots and machines can refill stocks, take appropriate notes, and retrieve medical records if needed. These technologies can as well be of great help while monitoring the patient’s condition. Innovation Support – along with the clinical practice, AI can successfully support research and development activities. Expanding access to healthcare – AI and Robotics could help fill the shortages of healthcare workers, especially in underserved or developing regions. E.g. AI imaging tools can screen chest x-rays for signs of tuberculosis, often achieving a level of accuracy comparable to humans. Lowering the Burden of Record Use – AI can facilitate the process of receiving routine requests from the inbox, including medication refills and result notifications. It can help prioritize tasks that truly require the clinician’s attention, allowing the users to work through their to-do lists. In addition, Voice recognition and dictation can accelerate the clinical documentation process. Prediction and Management of Patient Risks – AI can extract and analyze the abundance of patient data in an accurate, timely, and reliable manner. This makes patient risk assessment and management way easier. What are the challenges with AI applications in Healthcare? The main challenge with AI application in healthcare is reliable and relevant data. AI solutions are just as good as the data they base decisions on. Typically, in healthcare, the data is fragmented across various systems and in multiple formats. Such a fragmentation can increase the risk of errors and decreases the comprehensiveness of the datasets. In addition, AI systems might become biased on the data they are being trained on. Furthermore, there are ongoing privacy concerns related to AI incorporation in the healthcare industry. Some patients have worries regarding their privacy being violated. This assumption becomes even more sizeable due to AI’s ability to predict the private information of the patient without the algorithm ever having received it."
16,"Atrial Fibrillation Can Cause Stroke, but It Is Treatable",health-fitness," Atrial fibrillation, also known as AFib, is a type of arrhythmia, a heart condition that causes your heart to beat irregularly and quickly. It can increase your risk of stroke and heart failure but fortunately is treatable with lifestyle changes and medications. Dr. Timothy Talbert, a leading cardiologist in Chattanooga, can help you learn more about your condition and how to manage it. He can also help you find the best treatment for your health. What Is Atrial Fibrillation? A diagnosis of Atrial Fibrillation¹ means that during an attack, the heart beats faster and irregularly, and the different chambers of the heart are not working in sync. Because your heart isn’t filling up entirely, it cannot pump enough blood to other systems in your body, causing fatigue. There are four types of AFib, which are identified by the frequency and rate of arrhythmia episodes. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation occurs for less than a week, and in some cases, resolves itself without medical intervention. With persistent atrial fibrillation, symptoms persist for longer than a week, and medical treatment is usually needed. The other two, long-term and permanent atrial fibrillation, are diagnosed after a year of symptoms. Permanent atrial fibrillation is the most severe and only diagnosed after several treatments have failed. What Causes Atrial Fibrillation? While damage to the heart chamber is the leading cause of atrial fibrillation, some patients also experience lone atrial fibrillation, which currently has no discernable trigger. However, several medical events² can cause heart damage, including high blood pressure, a heart attack, thyroid problems, smoking, and congenital heart defects. In addition to heart damage, a patient’s age, sedentary lifestyle, diabetes, obesity, and family history can increase their risk³ of developing atrial fibrillation. Atrial Fibrillation Symptoms Because the heart beats faster and irregularly during an AFib attack, symptoms can include heart palpitations, a feeling of weakness, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, and fainting. If these symptoms continue, they can also cause fatigue and make it harder to exercise. In a study of 100 patients seeking hospital assistance, 72 of them reported symptoms at night⁴. If a patient has a history of heart problems and is experiencing these symptoms, they should make an appointment with one of the top-rated cardiologists in Chattanooga. Without treatment, atrial fibrillation can lead to severe complications, including blood clots, strokes, dementia, and heart failure. Because the different types of atrial fibrillation are determined by how long the symptoms persist, it is helpful to keep a diary of symptoms that includes when the attack occurred, which symptoms were prominent, and how severe the attack was. Atrial Fibrillation Treatment After diagnosis through an EKG, physical examination, and other tests, including a sleep study, stress test, or chest X-ray, your doctor will recommend treatment options. If there are any underlying causes or risk factors like obesity, smoking, or high-stress levels, your doctor may address these first with suggested lifestyle changes⁵. By losing weight, exercising, eating healthy, quitting smoking, or leaving stressful environments, you can decrease your risk for an atrial fibrillation attack and reduce the severity if an attack does occur. There are also several atrial fibrillation medications⁶ your doctor may recommend. Like the lifestyle changes, many of these medicines address underlying health issues that can worsen the frequency and severity of AFib attacks. Your doctor may also prescribe medicine that stabilizes and controls the heart rhythm. Beta-blockers and Flecainide are two commonly prescribed medications that help return the heart rhythm to normal after an attack. Other types of beta blockers and digoxin serve to control the heartbeat. The type of atrial fibrillation, along with other pre-existing medications and side effects, determines medication choice. Because the risk of stroke is higher, your doctor may also prescribe a blood thinner like Warfarin. There have been many new studies in c, and recently, several new drugs have come onto the market. At your next appointment with the best cardiologist in Chattanooga, ask about the benefits of the new medicines ⁷ like dabigatran and apixaban and if they’re right for you. Visit Dr. Timothy Talbert for More Information About Atrial Fibrillation Treatments AFib is a serious condition that needs to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible, especially if your symptoms have lasted for more than a week. Although paroxysmal atrial fibrillation doesn’t always require medication, the other three types of AFib almost always require medical intervention in the form of medication or lifestyle changes prescribed by your doctor. Because atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke, it’s essential to consult with your doctor about preventative medication. References ¹(2019, March 15). Atrial Fibrillation | NHLBI, NIH.

17,Treatment of Gingival Melanin Hyperpigmentation using Dental Diode Laser,health-fitness," A beautiful smile surely enhances the individual’s self-confidence. The esthetics of smile though majorly influenced by the color, shape, and position of the teeth, is also influenced by the color of the gingival tissues. The color of gingiva is influenced by the vascular supply, thickness and degree of keratinization of the epithelium, and presence of various pigments. Among these, the major factor contributing to the color of gingiva is melanin. Gingival hyperpigmentation does not pose any medical problem, but many patients may consider this an esthetic problem, particularly patients who have excessive gingival display or gummy smile. The most common cause is physiologic pigmentation i.e. melanin production, although some adverse habits such as smoking can further stimulate melanin pigmentation, and so intensity of pigmentation is also related to the duration of smoking and number of cigarettes consumed. Treatment Modalities Gingival depigmentation is a treatment to remove melanin hyperpigmentation of the gingiva and various methods have been used for this procedure with different degrees of success including gingivectomy, gingivectomy with free gingival autografting, acellular dermal matrix allograft, electrosurgery, cryosurgery and abrasion with diamond bur. The drawbacks of these techniques are intraoperative and post-operative bleeding, need for anaesthesia, need of periodontal pack/dressing, risk of post-operative infection, edema etc. Laser with different wavelengths have been used easily with well-tolerated and good esthetic outcomes. In depigmentation process the epithelial tissue exhibiting excessive melanin pigments is ablated using diode lasers. PIOON Laser offers various wavelengths that can either be used in contact or non-contact manner to perform this procedure. In the present case only topical anesthesia was applied, wavelength of 980nm was used in contact mode in scrapping motion at ablative settings for removal of the pigmented epithelium and a part of connective tissue, leaving behind the rest of connective tissue intact. After the procedure, laser bandage was done, postoperative instructions were given and patient was kept on follow up. Hanaa M. El Shenawy et al in 2015 used 980nm wavelength and concluded that the use of diode laser is a safe and effective treatment modality that provides optimal aesthetics with minimal discomfort in patients with gingival hyperpigmentation. Eser Elemek in 2018 also suggested that the use of 810nm diode laser for gingival depigmentation resulted in complete healing with maximum esthetic outcome and minimum patient discomfort. Rationale behind Use of Lasers Laser is absorbed by pigments (melanin and haemoglobin) in the soft tissue, thus making it an excellent modality for depigmentation procedure with minimal amount of bleeding. It also offers easy handling of tissues, less chairside time, potential decontamination and sterilization.  It also forms protein coagulum on the wound surface which act as a biological wound dressing, sealing the ends of sensory nerve endings hence obsoleting the need of periodontal packs/dressings, thereby making the aesthetic laser treatment more acceptable for the patients. Conclusion The use of a diode laser is a safe, effective, quick, and minimally invasive. They provide optimal aesthetics with reduced discomfort to the patients during and after procedure.

Unlike its counterpart THC that gets you high, CBD is becoming popular for its therapeutic benefits. CBD works hand in hand with the body's natural endocannabinoids. These endocannabinoids can be thought of as neurotransmitters that ensure that the body maintains perfect homeostasis. Through CBD oil, persons are able to reap the benefits of it.

3,A Full 5000 Year-Old Medical Secret Unearthed!,health-fitness," When you get sick, you go to the doctor. And the doctor will, of course, prescribe medicines. You will go and buy medicines. You take them, and hopefully, you get well. This is how the health profession goes on nowadays a cycle of diagnosis and prescription. If anyone were to give you herbs for medicine, you would probably say that that person was a quack. But nowadays, studies are being conducted to see if there are really is any merit to what is called natural medicine. Natural medicine is the use of natural methods, herbal medicines, and traditional practices to heal ailments. Every culture has a form of natural medicine. In ancient cultures, village medicine men served as the doctors of the community, passing on medical knowledge to the apprentices that followed them. Many categories of the healing methods fall under natural medicine. Among these are traditional medicine, complementary medicine, and alternative medicine. Usually, natural medicine refers to medical practices that were in place before the advent of modern medicine. This includes herbal medicine, or phytotherapy, which is prevalent in Chinese, Ayurvedic(or Indian), and Greek medicine. Upon the advent of modern medicine, many professionals discarded the use of herbs in favor of man-made medicine. The fact that these treatments are based on the healing properties of some herbs was forgotten. For example, opium, digitalis, quinine, and aspirin all have their roots in traditional medicine. Natural medicine can be considered as a lost art. This does not mean that it has lost efficacy over time. In some cases, natural therapy is actually better than modern medicine. This leads some doctors to seriously consider and study the possible uses of natural medicine Before we continue, it is important to stress that not all the natural remedies are legitimate. It would help to only try those remedies which have been thoroughly studied and are relatively risk free. Take herbal medicine for example. There are many well-documented and studied herbal remedies available. However, only those that deal with minor ailments such as cough, colds, fever, skin rashes, and its ilk are likely to be recommended by health professionals. These remedies are sometimes superior to synthetic medicine. This is because herbal medicines are less likely to cause negative side effects. Currently there are numerous organizations that study the effects and advocacy of natural medicine among which is herbal medicine. Some governments and health agencies openly advocate the use of natural methods since they are inexpensive and relatively risk-free. As their studies compile, more herbs and treatments are added to the list of accepted medicines. However, many herbs and treatments have been proven to be bogus medicine. This represents a challenge for both the user and the agencies because they have to ascertain that the treatments they either use or advocate are legitimate. There exist today many alternative medical treatments that fall under natural medicine. However, not all of them have been proven to be effective. You could mention homeopathy, aromatherapy, acupuncture, and other alternative medical treatments. It would pay to consult the experts as to the legitimacy of these treatments. Natural medicine should also be thought of as an accompanying medicine. Right now, the current collective medical thought suggests that natural medicine be used only to supplement accepted modern medical practices. In that case of minor ailments your expert we actually advise you to take natural therapies instead. The practice of modern medicine revolves around diagnosing an illness and prescribing treatments for such. Natural medicine is helpful because it suggests that treatment be not necessarily given only when sick. Natural medicine strives to make each patient practice good health habits. These habits include good diet, healthy living, and the regular natural treatment. It is this same line of thought that leads our parents to tell us to eat our vegetables. Yes, a healthy lifestyle and will do no harm to our well-being. And this is the foundation of natural medicine may it be massage, herbal medicine, aromatherapy or others. It is funny but true that science, in its quest for excellence, is studying the knowledge of sages past. This, surprisingly, leads us back to the remedies nature offers. The possibilities of finding remedies to everyday illnesses in natural medicine are encouraging. So staying tuned to studying these remedies is worthwhile until we can verify that these therapies are truly helpful to our health and our society."

You may consult your cardiologist, primary care physicians and other medical professional while looking for the right cardiac surgeon. Look for national recognition by objective, trusted sources. It's best if you go for hospitals and surgeons that have created quite a reputation nation-wide. Check with your health plan/insurance.

6,White Knuckling: A Dangerous Lifestyle,health-fitness," Stomach aches, muscle tension, chest pain and sleep problems. No this is not the next virus eyeing up the last four months of our twenty twenty calendars with hungry eyes. These symptoms are actually a sign of stress, and the effect it can have on our body. Stress is a universal problem everyone in the world faces, whether it is celebrities stressing about their old racist tweets or regular, normal people stress like having an approaching deadline, it affects us all in a similar way. We all know the feeling. Considering that stress is so pertinent in every single human life, it seems odd that it has been shoved to the side, as the proverbial red headed stepchild of societal issues, eating the leftovers of its more popular brothers and sisters. After analysing the way we view stress and consequently relaxation, it’s obvious that there is a huge amount of misunderstanding around the concept of stress and how it can work with us. The myths around stress begin at the eleven plus stage of exams. This is a stage in the UK where children moving from primary school to secondary school take a test to get into more exclusive or academically prestigious schools. 78% of primary school leaders surveyed believed that the increasing rate of anxiety, panic attacks and stress in young people is due to specifically the fear of failing exams. Despite this, little has been done by exam boards or the government to change the system. What has been created, however, are a plethora of homebrew techniques available on the internet on how to suppress a child’s stress in order for them to do better in the exams. This is avoiding the issue at hand. Much like pain, stress is a useful indication from one’s body that the situation that body is in is unpleasant. It is useful to be able to control stress for short periods of time, however this idea of suppressing stress for months in order to deliver is ridiculous. Instead, the problem which is causing the children the stress should be addressed; the exams. (The irony of writing this article, hours before the deadline is not lost on me.) The fact that we are introduced to the idea of suppressing stress from such an early age has clearly impacted our mental and physical health severely. 67% of adults in the UK suffer from disrupted sleep, a known symptom of stress. So the stress we take in as children clearly affects us not only in the short term but in the long term. As we grow, our relationship with stress changes, it ages less like a fine wine and more like a pint of milk. Throughout our late teenage years and early twenties, we are bombarded with the idea of ‘the grind’. The grind can be categorised as a way of life in which one works constantly in order to make money or find security in life that they can enjoy later. Although this is the most modern version of this idea, the system of working incredibly hard in one’s twenties to rest easy in one’s forties has been prevalent in our society for a very long time. An example of this is the “work hard, play hard” slogan which has seen use in advertising as early as the nineteenth century. The problem with this idea of overworking and then relaxing or ‘playing hard’ is that it fundamentally misunderstands the way in which stress, and consequently relaxation work. Humans are creatures of habit and we get good at what we practice, whether that is watching television all day, playing the piano or enduring eighty hour work weeks, our body and mind become acclimated to the conditions. Because of this if we neglect relaxation and focus purely on work, we will become acclimatized to the high pressure environment and when we do get a chance to relax, not only will we not want to but we won’t know how to. This is the reason why people who leave high intensity jobs often find themselves suffering from heart attacks as well as symptoms of anxiety such as insomnia. It is because the change that our bodies and minds go through is absolute and immediate. Randall Paulsen, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital explains that ""During that phase of going from a lot of structure to almost no structure, men can exhibit the same signs as someone who is overworked."" This shows that humans are not built to do purely one thing and then purely another thing. To live a happy life there must be a balance between work and relaxation, both at a level which feel comfortable. The concept of finding time to relax and working it into day to day life as an essential rather than an addition has been a part of many cultures. The ancient Greeks for example were an essential and revolutionary society. They invented modern philosophy, geometry and, most importantly, cheesecake. However, despite their rational minds, they always found time to relax, specifically in the form of dance. At the festival of Dionysus, every march, every member of Greek society was expected to dance without limit or judgement. What the ancient Greeks had grasped that we seem to have forgotten is the importance of regular relaxation and letting go. For adults today, relaxation  is seen as an optional extra, restricted to overpriced and pretentious meditation classes or two weeks of holiday in some remote island every couple of years. This idea that relaxation is for secure, usually financially independent people only, or for it to be seen as ‘stress points’ that can be cashed in now and again is very harmful. Everybody feels stress, in the same way that everyone feels pain or joy, so to attempt to suppress, control and privatise stress and relaxation is flawed as a concept and dangerous to the individuals who subscribe to that way of life. The overall takeaway of this article is that ‘white knuckling’ one’s way through life is much like trying to remove asbestos from a building by eating it all. Unpleasant, ineffective and probably not very good for you."

10,How to deal with Anxiety and Panic Attacks?,health-fitness," What is Anxiety? Most of us would be mildly aware of the word 'anxiety,' but it is not everyone's cup of tea to understand the concept of anxiety in the purest form. Anxiety is an emotion that pours out when one faces an uncontrollable anticipated event which one doesn't want to come across. Each one of use has gone through those phases where we got worrisome of the situation we are about to face like a test or interview or conversing with a stranger, but that fear doesn't last much as we go through them very often. But when this unpleasant feeling starts interfering with your daily life, there is a problem requiring serious attention. Anxiety, in itself, is undoubtedly not something one should worry about in your daily life. It can play out to be a great motivator to prepare for that not-so-good situation or fear in advance, increasing your confidence and productivity. But not everyone's case is similar; a large population of the world goes through anxiety, which is uncontrollable and often intervenes with their daily life activities. It becomes an anxiety disorder or anxiety attack, and you cannot afford to take that lightly. What are Anxiety Disorders and Panic attacks? Anxiety disorders are a range of mental conditions that are characterized by fear or anxiety. Anxiety here is the worry of future events or hallucinations, and fear generates from ongoing things or current events taking place. An anxiety attack tends to get intense and can last for several months. Unlike normal anxiety, an anxiety disorder needs special attention and proper treatment to get rid of it. Anxiety disorders and anxiety attacks can make their way to the mind because of genetic or environmental factors surrounding the person. Sufferers of anxiety disorders try to avoid the situation or things capable of inducing an anxiety attack. Panic attacks, on the other hand, are mostly sudden episodes of intense fear and worry that triggers various physical symptoms without any significant danger or cause. The symptoms can vary and can get out of hand in no time. That is why one who goes through panic disorders needs to get in touch with treatment in combination with anxiety and panic support. Although these panic attacks are not life-threatening in itself, the symptoms need some professional help to get rectified before they start affecting the ordinary course of life. Symptoms of Anxiety and Panic attacks Although anxiety attacks and panic attacks are technically not the same things, they do look similar in respect to how a person behaves under their influence and the symptoms these mental illnesses can develop over a period. The physical and emotional symptoms that show up with anxiety attacks and panic attacks are quite identical; they both include worry and fear of a situation or a specific thing. Panic attacks are more intense and terrifying than anxiety attacks; panic attacks come from nowhere, whereas circumstances mostly trigger anxiety attacks. Panic attacks can lead to show symptoms like shaking, shortness of breath, excessive sweating, nausea, choking, numbness, chest pain, dizziness, chills, stomach pain, and a racing heartbeat. In case of a panic attack, the person already is dealing with panic disorders, and the reason for the sudden panic attacks might not even exist. In most cases of an anxiety disorder or anxiety attack, the persistent cause is the fear of a specific situation that might show up or conditions that are not favorable or signify danger to the sufferer. It can include symptoms like increased heart rate, trembling, sweating, feeling weak, difficulty in controlling worry, sudden mood swings, having a sense of danger or doom, rapid breathing, trouble in concentrating, experiencing gastrointestinal problems, etc. Factors that Lead to Anxiety and Panic attacks Although, we cannot conclude precisely when panic or anxiety attacks can spike up and who will experience these mental illness symptoms. Still, there are some general guidelines regarding those who are prone to anxiety or panic disorders. Those are: ●	Medical Condition: Dealing with a medical condition or illness can sometimes induce anxiety or panic attacks in an individual. Sometimes illnesses come with stress, which can overpower what the sufferer can handle. Such stressful conditions build a base for anxiety disorders and anxiety attacks, resulting from fearing and excessive worry. ●	Family History: Those who come up with a family history of mental issues and problematic cases can inherit similar traits and become easy prey of anxiety and panic attacks; this factor is uncontrollable, but indeed it can be treated with proper treatment. ●	Trauma: There is also a risk of anxiety and panic attacks in those who have gone through some gut-wrenching trauma or accident in their early phase of life. The fear of a particularly traumatic incident can take the form of severe panic disorder, which can spike significantly whenever the patient comes around a similar situation. ●	Personality: Some are prone to anxiety or panic attacks right from the start; a sufferer doesn't need to experience any mental worry or situation for a panic or anxiety attack to originate. Sometimes an anxiety attack can turn into a panic attack over a period and occur out of the blue for an individual. ●	Excessive Alcohol and Smoking: Excessive alcohol consumption and smoking not just takes a toll on your physical health, but does some severe unnoticed damage to your mental health. Those much indulged in such activities fall under the risk of anxiety and panic disorders, which might even get out of hand if not taken under supervision. Treatment of Anxiety and Panic Attacks As we are now well aware that anxiety and panic upto a certain degree, of course, are not required to be clinically treated, just some home remedies can help you in lowering the symptoms of anxiety and panic attacks. Consulting anxiety and panic support system seems a reasonably good option to go for when faced with such mental difficulties. It will not only allow you to get a clear understanding of the terms but also calm you down with the fact that all of us go through that phase. But suppose you are dealing with anxiety or panic attacks of a severe degree then, you must consult a psychiatrist to get yourself a proper screening and treatment of anxiety and panic disorders you are fighting. There are a few ways that are incredibly effective in themselves, too but can work wonders for your mental health if combined. Almost all primary health facilities prefer the amalgamation of all of them to get the best results. They support each other's working mechanisms without giving out too many side effects. Those are: ●	Psychotherapy: Psychotherapy (also known as talk therapy ) bolds out as the first-line treatment of anxiety and panic disorders. It mainly focuses on making one understand their acute condition and presenting proved ways to cope with them effortlessly. One of the significant parts of the psychotherapy is cognitive-behavioral therapy, where the therapist tries to re-create the situation that induces an anxious or panicky behavior in you, with the motive of eliminating the fear or worry regarding that situation or thing. The therapy results are overwhelming in most cases where the sufferer no longer finds a particular condition threatening. ●	Medications: Treatment of anxiety and panic disorders see some bright rays of hope in medicines capable of reducing or eliminating the symptoms of such mental issues. These prescribed drugs work well for those who did not show any significant positive growth form the counseling and therapies typically considered sufficient to treat severe anxiety and panic. Medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and Benzodiazepines are the most prominent drug taken into use to treat panic and anxiety attacks. ●	Self Help: Undoubtedly, the treatments mentioned above are competent and powerful in their ways of rectifying symptoms and problems related to anxiety disorders and panic attacks, but still, there remains a vacant space in the treatment plan, which depends entirely on the patient. Self-help is the tool that perfectly fills up that space and ensures top-notch recovery from the mental illness. Self-help includes activities that allow you to get out of that sickness-driven thought process. Self-help activities for anxiety and panic attacks try to bind you with positive thoughts, relaxation, fighting spirit, and willingness to get out of that misery phase. It includes breathing exercises, introspecting, remembering joyful moments, practicing healthy habits, reading, indulging in your favorite activities, exploring your hobbies, and acting normal."

It could be more; it could be less. It is said that eating carbs create craving for more carbs, hence eventually increasing your weight. If you want to cut your weight, cutting carbs is the first step followed by cutting bad fats. Although food is the most important factor of your body weight, exercise plays an almost equal role in getting you close to your weight loss goal. Exercise speeds up your metabolism. One of the biggest benefits of exercise is that it burns fats in your body, and it does so quickly. If you don't do any exercise at all, your body might still burn fats in doing daily physical activities, but it will be extremely slow. Just like setting up your dietary plan, you don't need to spend a lot of money to come up with an exercise plan. When it comes to exercise for losing weight, you should do what you enjoy doing. Walking, cycling, hiking are activities that only need time and a little bit of commitment. Whatever exercise you choose to go with, make sure you do it in sets with appropriate intervals between sets. Don't exhaust yourself to an extent that you feel tired the following day to do any exercise at all, hence slowing down your overall weight loss progress. These are the two fundamentals of weight loss. Start with these and track your progress over a period of time. Don't hesitate to change your plan if you need to. If you are serious about losing weight and have an hour to spare every day, you need lean muscle weight loss. With a bit of commitment and promise to yourself, you are not too far from your weight loss goals! The Most Recommended way to lose weight without exercise is by increasing metabolism using supplementary pills. Watch a video here https://cutt.ly/JflbY15  about how this supplementary pills work"
14,Tramadol For Pain - Need To Know About Pain,health-fitness," Pain is a feeling of discomfort that your body experience, makes it hard for you to do anything. The uncomfortable sensation can distract you from what’s happening around you. The feeling of pain can range from annoying to excruciating. It can feel like a dull ache or sometimes as a sharp stabbing. People often describe it as stinging, pinching, sore, and throbbing. Pain arises from the nervous system, and it serves as a warning signal for our body to get away from danger. Usually, a person would have a painful experience after touching a very hot or cold thing; this will deter them from making contact with such things.

15,Stop-Clock: How your health benefits when you stop smoking,health-fitness," It’s the question that all smokers have to ask at some point: what would happen to my health if I decided to stop smoking? When you’re still deep into a chronic cigarette addiction, it can be hard to see the benefits clearly. With that in mind, here’s some proven ways your health would improve over time if you gave up smoking: 30 minutes: At the 30 minute mark, the rate of your pulse will gradually reach a normal speed. 9 hours: After just 9 hours, the nicotine and carbon monoxide levels in your blood begin to go down by 50%, while the oxygen in your blood reaches a normal amount. If you can feel yourself desperate for a cigarette at the end of a hard day, make sure you keep this in mind.  We’d recommend vaping as a brilliant alternative for satisfying that urge. 1 and a half days: This one calls for a celebration. After just one and a half days, your sense of smell and taste will start to improve. Why not order your favourite pizza as a treat? 3 days: Things are getting even better! After 3 days, the tubes in your lungs will start to sooth, allowing for easier and more efficient breathing. Alongside this, you’ll also start to feel yourself becoming more and more energised. Some smokers might interpret this as anxiety, so make sure you focus on the positivity of your actions. 9 days: Relax: this is the stage where many ex-smokers start to feel a reduction in their cigarette cravings. 2-10 weeks: After a few more weeks, your circulation will quickly improve with a possibility for zero cravings whatsoever. Even so, don’t lose your focus. While you should be proud of getting this far, it’s very easy to slip into old habits. 3-10 months At this stage, that horrible smoker’s cough you may have carried round for years should finally have disappeared, with a 10% increase in lung function. 1 year: This is a milestone ex-smokers dream of hitting. Make sure to celebrate the achievement as you’ve definitely earned it. A big bonus is that your chance of getting heart disease is now half compared to someone still smoking. A decade: Lung cancer looms over all smokers and will always be a massive reason for many quitting in the first place. A decade later and you’ll still be seeing the benefits of your positive choices, with your chances of getting lung cancer now half of that of a smoker. 15 years: A massive 15 years later and your risk of health issues, including heart attacks, has become the same as a non-smoker, possibly for the first time in your adult life. Smoking addictions are incredibly tough to break away from, but the health benefits are too overwhelming to ignore. We’d recommend using vaping as an alternative. While it may contain nicotine, it doesn’t come with all the lethal parts of cigarettes. This factual guideline should give you hope on your journey to quit, with your health improving almost immediately. We’re backing you every step of the way."
16,How do dangerous viruses like COVID-19 come about?,health-fitness," This year we have witnessed the devastation that viruses can cause. In addition to the numerous mortalities and morbidities that the virus, COVID-19, has caused, it has also brought entire economies to a stand still. In fact, lifestyles have changed because of this virus. Many know viruses cause diseases, but they now want to know more about viruses. They have been seeking answers to the questions that they have. I would be answering a number in this blog post. A virus is an infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism. What this means is that a virus isn't a living thing like a plant or an animal. The smallest unit of an animal or a plant is the cell. Outside a living cell, a virus is more of a particle, an object without life, that does not grow or shrink. However, it does contain genetic material in the form of a DNA or an RNA. As soon as a virus comes into contact with a living cell, it hijacks the living cell and then produces more copies of itself. It is able to transcribe its genetic information when inside a living cell. We say that a virus is sub-microscopic because it cannot be seen with neither the naked eye nor an ordinary microscope. To see a virus, you need what is called an electron microscope, a powerful microscope capable of magnifying an object 10 million times. How do dangerous viral diseases like COVID-19 arise? From Animals As we have already said, viruses are only active when inside living cells. Outside a living cell, a virus like HIV cannot live for more than 20 minutes. COVID-19 cannot live outside a living cell for three days. That is how all viruses are. Some viruses have infected animals in the wild. They haven't caused epidemics and pandemics because no human being has come into contact with any of these animals. The very minute any human being comes into contact with them, an epidemic would most likely break out. I must say that not all viruses are equally dangerous, and not all of them are transmitted the same way. The human immune system develops immunity to viruses that it has already encountered, so that when it encounters the virus again, it would be able to mount an effective immune response against it.  New viruses are dangerous because the body cannot mount an effective immune response against them. Coronaviruses are present in some birds and bats. It is believed that COVID-19 was acquired from bats. Genetic Mutation Viruses make more copies of themselves when inside a living cell. This we have already said. However, as it makes copies of itself it doesn't always do it the same way, because it frequently makes mistakes. Now, when mistakes are made this way, the new viruses created will differ slightly from the parent virus. This phenomenon is called genetic mutation. That is how new viruses emerge. A virus that has been around for a while, without causing many problems, can suddenly become dangerous when mutation occurs.  This may occur in animals or in human beings. It is possible that COVID-19 developed this way. I cannot say for sure that it did, but it is possible. Engineering of Viruses in the Laboratory The science of genetics is now so advanced that human beings are able to clone animals and even other human beings in the laboratory. Human beings are able to insert the DNA of one organism into the DNA of another, so that the desirable qualities of one are transferred to another. This has been employed extensively in the development of genetically modified crops. Scientists conduct several experiments in the laboratory, so that hospitals and health officials will be able to better treat diseases. In the course of these experiments, more dangerous viruses can emerge. This can be deliberate or unintentional. However, the necessary precautions are taken so that these viruses don't escape. COVID-19 could have emerged in this manner. Conclusion With the above information, you now know what a virus is and how viruses like COVID-19 emerge. No one knows for certain how it arose, but it was definitely due to at least one of the ways that I have outlined above. Research is on-going. In the next few months, we should have an effective vaccine as well as drugs against the disease. If you want to know how to prevent coronaviruses, visit 10 coronavirus prevention strategies."
17,3 Complications of Untreated Sore Throat,health-fitness," You won't believe it, but it is true that sore throat can kill. It might not kill you within a few days, but in the long run you would get many problems which might kill you if you don't treat it well. If it doesn't kill you, it might lead to some other serious health problems. So, sore throat must be treated well. Sore throat is very common. It is estimated that 8 out of every 100 people get sore throat at least once in three months. Chances are you have had sore throat already a number of times. We all know the feeling you get, when you have sore throat. You experience pain in the throat, especially when swallowing. It also often itches. It is often associated with headaches, fever, body aches, and common cold. It can spoil your day. What are some of  the complications that sore throat can give you? It Can Lead To Heart Problems Sore throat is caused by viruses and bacteria. Acid reflux disease (GERD), trauma, and tumors can also cause sore throat. One type of sore throat is caused by streptococcal bacteria. When one gets streptococcal sore throat, the bacteria can travel through the blood to the heart. There the bacteria start destroying the heart valves. After a number of years, this can lead to a condition called mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve prolapse, leads to incomplete closure of the heart valves. The valves may close well when a person is at rest, but when the person lifts weight, or does any work which causes the ventricles of the heart to contract forcefully, the valves won't close well. Such people often feel discomfort when lifting weight or exerting themselves, because instead of all the blood going to the rest of the body, some are forced back into the left atrium and then into pulmonary circulation. Mitral regurgitation follows if the condition is left untreated. When this occurs, the mitral valve does not close at all. It occurs even at rest. A loud noise called a murmur can often be heard even without  a stethoscope. The left ventricle now forces more blood into the left atrium then into the pulmonary vein.  This can lead to several problems such as difficulty in breathing (dispnea), stroke, arrhythmias (abnormal heart beat), and even sudden death. Surgery can correct this problem. During the procedure the valves are replaced with artificial heart valves. It Can Lead to Kidney Problems If you ever wondered, what the functions of the kidney are then here are a few. The kidney cleans blood of toxins, and excess substances such as water and nutrients, helps regulate blood pressure, and then helps the body make use of Vitamin D which gives the human body strong teeth and bones. Left untreated, streptococcal sore throat can also give you kidney problems such as post streptococcal glomerulonephritis.  This can occur as early as 10 days after a streptococcal sore throat. Symptoms of this condition include dark reddish, brown urine, swollen face, and fatigue. High blood pressure and  protein in urine also result from this condition. It can lead to Arthritis Untreated sore throat can lead to inflammation of the joints. This is commonly called arthritis (post streptococcal reactive arthritis). When this happens, patients experience pain in the major joints. The affected joint often becomes swollen. This may lead to several problems. Left untreated this can actually destroy your joints.  In short, you would not be able to do what you usually do because of the severe joint pains. Just think of all the lost hours of productivity that will accompany this condition. Conclusion Clearly, you can see from the above that something as trivial as sore throat can lead to many serious problems, and even death. With this knowledge, we must make every effort to treat sore throat well."
18,8 Helpful Tips to Avoid Diabetes,health-fitness," Diabetes kills, but it can be prevented. Worldwide, about 460 million people, representing 8.8% of the global adult population were said to be living with Diabetes in 2019. This means about 9 out of every 100 adults is living with diabetes. In the United States, the Center for Disease control estimates that about 83,564 die from diabetes related causes each year.  Globally annual mortalities due to diabetes is about 4.2 million. Diabetes is the seventh (7th) leading cause of death globally. It would interest you to note that Diabetes refers to two different diseases. The first is Diabetes Mellitus, and the second Diabetes Insipidus. However, when you hear people talk about Diabetes, they are most likely referring to Diabetes Mellitus. There are two types of Diabetes Mellitus, namely Type 1 and Type 2. Diabetes Mellitus is a disease which leads to blood sugar levels in excess of the normal range. Clearly, diabetes is a dangerous disease. How can it be prevented? Eat a Healthy Diet In order to prevent diabetes, eat a healthy diet every day.  A normal human being needs about 2000 calories each day. Sticking to this limit is one sure way to prevent diabetes. Eat food rich in whole grains and fiber, that also has good fats, such as polyunsaturated fats found in nuts, vegetable oils, and fish. In addition, limit sugary beverages and eat less red meat. Exercise Often If you really want to prevent diabetes, you must exercise often. Studies have shown that exercising for about 90 minutes each day reduces the risk of diabetes by about 28%. You don't have to be Usain Bolt, or Florence Griffith-Joyner (Flojo), whose athletic skills are well known. Walking briskly each day should be enough. If you can't go on a walk daily, purchase a treadmill. This should help in no small way. Control Weight Obesity increases the risk fo getting diabetes, therefore keeping weight in check is a must. No weight is ideal for all. For a particular height, there is an ideal body weight. A metric called Body Mass Index (BMI) combines weight and height into an ideal figure. In order to control your weight, first purchase a BMI chart so that you would know the ideal weight range to target. A combination of diet, exercise, and sleep measures should help you to keep your weight in check. Check for Pre-Diabetes Before one gets diabetes, a condition called pre-diabetes first sets in. Pre-diabetes is also called impaired glucose tolerance. This is not as serious as diabetes itself. However, if you are able to detect pre-diabetes early, your chances for preventing diabetes entirely would be higher. Going to your doctor for a check up once a year, or once every two years should be enough to detect pre-diabetes. Avoid Tobacco Studies have shown that smoking tobacco increases the risk of getting Type II diabetes by about 30 to 40%. Nicotine releases glucose from the cells of the liver into the blood stream increasing the blood sugar level. If you are really serious about preventing diabetes, then quit smoking. For those who already have diabetes, smoking makes managing the disease difficult. Avoid Excess Alcohol Each time you take alcohol, it increases you blood sugar. Beer, for example, adds 154 calories to your calorie intake, so drinking a few bottles can easily add over 500 calories to your daily calorie intake, raising your risk of getting diabetes. In addition, alcohol also stimulates appetite, which may cause you to over-eat. Further, alcohol may raise your triglyceride levels which increases your risk of getting diabetes. Infections Although this is well known, scientists say that infections increase the risk of getting diabetes. Therefore, we must try as much as possible to avoid infections; but this is hard. The best we can do is to ensure that anytime we detect any infection, we treat it promptly and thoroughly. Use the Right Drugs Some drugs predispose the body to diabetes. Examples include thiazide anti-hypertensives and steroids. With this in mind, we must be careful whenever taking drugs. If you have have been diagnosed with pre-diabetes, let every doctor you speak to know so that they can avoid these drugs. Conclusion Diabetes kills, and when it doesn't kill you, you may end up with aputated limbs, poor vision, heart disease, kidney diseases, and health expenses more than twice what the average person pays.  The tips outlined above can significantly reduce your chances of ever getting diabetes."
19,Why would you want to install a UV light?,health-fitness," Why would you want to install a UV light? UV lights significantly reduce the amount of microbes on surfaces, in ductwork, and other airspace. UV lights have the ability to kill viruses and bacteria throughout the home, schools, and the workplace. The 1903 Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded to Niels Finsen for his use of UV radiation against lupus vulgaris (by the way, a terrible skin infection). Using UV light to treat water dates back to 1916 in the USA. UV light is now used to treat drinking water, wastewater, hospitals, surfaces, and indoor air. Today, there are many UVC light options. So, how do you know which one is best for you? Hopefully, this guide will help. Just the Facts – Quick Reference: Match the effective area of the light to the area being sanitized. Choose the correct light for the intended use, i.e. Light Duty or Commercial Grade. Ozone enhancement provides the most thorough sterilization, and the light does not have to span every surface to be sterilized. However, it requires that the area remain ventilated and unoccupied for at least 30 minutes after the light goes out. If you need to re-enter the area in less than 30 minutes, then choose a light without ozone enhancement. However, when ozone enhancement is not used, the light must span every surface to be sterilized. Regardless of which light you choose, when the light is on, the area being sanitized must be unoccupied by people, pets, and plants; and remain unoccupied for at least 30 minutes after when using ozone enhancement. For a more in-depth understanding, please read the following guide. To know, which light is your best option, you need to answer a few questions first. How big is the area that you are trying to sanitize? This is straightforward. Each light (at least, our lights) has a maximum effective area listed, e.g. 1500 square feet. Just match this with the room or area that you need to sanitize."

1,The Ancient Healing Practice of Acupuncture: Your Questions Answered,health-fitness," According to the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), health is determined by the balance of the life force, Qi or chi, in the body. It flows through the body via various points called “meridians”. When the opposing forces of Ying and Yang along with the five basic elements that make up the entire Universe, disrupt the flow of life force, it can lead to illnesses. To ensure the general well-being of one’s health, the energy balance should be maintained. And, acupuncture is an ancient healing technique that sets out to do the same. It treats multiple illnesses of the mind and body by inserting tiny needles into the skin at certain points (acupoints). The aim is to remove congestion and ensure an adequate flow of energy throughout the body. It is often said that acupuncture needles cause the body to release endorphins – body’s natural pain killers, and thus help in boosting the blood flow, enhancing brain activity, reducing pain and improving the overall health of the patient. From treating patients for chronic pain, acute pain, insomnia, indigestion, infertility to improving the conditions of those suffering from illnesses such as diabetes and dementia, acupuncture is recognized by Western medicine as an alternative healing practice. Are Acupuncture Needles Safe to Use? YES, acupuncture needles are safe to be administered on the patient's body. The US FDA considers acupuncture needles as medical equipment used by “trained professionals”. FDA holds them to the same standards as other medical devices. It means the acupuncture needles that come to the market need to be passed through rigorous quality checks and protocols. Additionally, it is required by law to use single-use, disposable acupuncture needles. It avoids cross-contamination and reduces the chances of infections. Thorough disposable of acupuncture needles is also required by acupuncturists and TCM practitioners. Does Acupuncture Hurt? With the right technique and correct size of acupuncture needles, it rarely hurts. Often, the patients may feel little to no pain when the needles are inserted or removed from the body. In some cases, bleeding, bruising and soreness may persist for some time. It is important to understand that certain acupuncture treatments include the use of lancet needles for removing blood by reopening the orifices. The blood-letting treatment is administered to let out “bad blood” generated in the body due to injury and certain kinds of fevers. The TCM practitioner will use the technique to eliminate congestion, maintain the balance of Qi, and remove pathogens from the blood. Why go to a Licensed Acupuncture Practitioner? First of all, not everyone can buy acupuncture needles. Online acupuncture wholesale supplies store and offline brick and mortar stores require you to have a practitioner's license to buy acupuncture needles. If a place is selling you acupuncture needles without requiring you to produce a license, it is a bit shady. Avoid buying needles from such a place because you cannot be assured of quality. Acupuncture is a very precise healing technique that requires insertion of needles in specific points. If you insert the needles in a wrong way or keep them in the body for a long time, it can have adverse effects and lead to more imbalance of chi. Always have professional administering needles on your body. A licensed, certified practitioner will be able to diagnose the underlying issue correctly. They have sufficient knowledge and required experience to understand the problem and solve it. So, you must choose a licensed TCM practitioner for effective healing. Remember acupuncture is a safe treatment only when you choose a licensed professional."
2,What's Wrong With Crash Diets?,health-fitness," Many desperate people turn to crash diets hoping they will lose the most weight in the shortest time that way. Perhaps they have had past experiences of losing weight successfully with this type of plan, or they have read about a new diet that some celebrity has followed to lose weight fast. So what is wrong with crash diets? Is there any reason why they have such a bad reputation? The most obvious problem with crash diets is that the weight loss is almost always temporary. If you suddenly change to a restricted diet, your body will respond by storing less water. You will lose weight and be less bloated, i.e. thinner, but you will not necessarily lose any fat. When you end the diet that weight will go right back on. Of course, you may lose some fat too, depending on the diet and how long you follow it. However, the body often goes into starvation mode during these diets. It thinks a famine has hit, and it should slow down the metabolism and store as much fat as possible to guard against the hard times ahead. When you increase your food consumption, even if you do it in a healthy way, that famine metabolism can persist and lead your body to gain some or all of the weight back. Added to that is the psychological effect of breaking a crash diet. Whether this happens at the end of the planned diet or in the middle out of desperation, it tends involve overeating. For this reason alone, many people who follow crash diets find that a month later, they are heavier than they were before the diet. In addition, there are some significant health issues with crash diets. First, diets that focus on losing weight fast are usually very restrictive in the types of foods that you can eat. Many foods (and sometimes whole food groups) will be cut out. This is not something you could do in the long term without suffering from deficiencies. It is not good for the body in the short term either. On many crash diets you will not be getting the nutrients that the body needs. It is true that you can take supplements, but many supplements rely on substances in whole foods to make them work most effectively. Nutrient deficiencies lead to cravings, making it harder to stick to the diet and more likely that you will break out in a binge. At the same time, you may be getting more of some nutrients than is healthy. To summarize, crash diets can only ever be a temporary solution, for example for a situation where you need to lose a little weight for a particular event, and you do not mind if you gain it back - and more - afterward. The healthiest option for losing weight is to make changes that will allow you to lose weight slowly on a healthy eating plan that does not ban any foods completely, but allows you to incorporate occasional treats. In the long term, people who follow crash diets are likely to gain weight, not lose it."
3,How To Increase Your Immunity With Top Immune Boosters,health-fitness," Your immune system is an amazing machine. It’s responsible for keeping your body safe from outside invaders like viruses, bacteria, fungi, and toxins. There are two main parts of your immune system: the part you were born with (innate or non-specific system) and the part you develop from exposure to the environment (adaptive acquired, or specific system). Your immune system is made of various organs, cells, and proteins – skin cells, blood, bone marrow, tissues, and organs like the thymus and lymph glands. A strong immune system is your best defense against illness and infection. Without it, you would have no way of fighting off harmful substances or changes within the body. Your immune system has three main tasks: To fight pathogens (disease-causing “germs”) like viruses, bacteria, fungi or parasites and get them out of your body To recognize and neutralize harmful substances from the environment To fight disease-causing changes in the body, like cancer cells Your immune system is activated by antigens – things the body doesn’t recognize as belonging there. These are proteins on the surfaces of bacteria, viruses, and fungi. When the immune system cells come into contact with these antigens, a whole series of processes are stimulated in your immune system. The good news is that once your immune system comes in contact with a germ, it will recognize that germ if it sees it again. This is why vaccines work to protect you against certain diseases. In this article, we’ll take a look at the top all-natural and safe immune boosters that everyone can take advantage of to strengthen the immune response, increase resistance to disease and infection, and help recover more quickly. Let’s begin! Get Plenty of Sleep Not getting enough sleep can lower your immune response and leave you more likely to succumb to infection. In a study of 164 adults, the ones who slept less than six hours a night proved more likely to catch a cold than those who slept longer. When you’re sleep-deprived, your body makes stress hormones like cortisol to keep you awake and alert – and that can suppress your immune system. And you may also take longer to recover if you’re sleep-deprived. That’s because your body can’t make enough antibodies to fight off diseases if you’re not rested. Your body also releases special proteins (cytokines) that help your immune system – but they only do that while you’re asleep. Your body does a lot of healing and regenerating while you’re asleep. Typical adults should try to get seven or more hours of sleep daily to function properly. Teens need eight to ten hours a night and younger children and infants need to get up to 14 hours of sleep to be at their best. People who got a full eight hours of sleep had higher levels of T-cells than those who slept less, according to a 2019 study. And a 2015 study found that those who get seven hours of sleep are four times less likely to come down with a cold than those who were sleep-deprived. Most modern people don’t get enough sleep, which is a shame because it’s an easy fix to a common problem. Some tips for getting a good night’s sleep include limiting your screen time starting two to three hours before your bedtime. The blue light from the TV, computer screen, or cellphone has been shown to disrupt your body’s natural sleep cycle (circadian rhythm) so shut them all down. Another thing to limit is caffeine use. If you’re having a tough time getting to sleep, try skipping caffeine after noon. Even if you think your body is used to it, a little caffeine can go a long way. You can also try sleeping in a totally dark room that is cooler than the rest of your home, as your body cools down when it’s ready to sleep. Avoid highly stimulating books or conversations right before bed, too. They get your adrenaline levels up and you’ll have more trouble calming back down. Go to bed at the same time every night, even on your days off, and have a set sleep schedule you follow before getting into bed. If you’re still having trouble with your sleep, talk to your doctor. Getting a good night’s sleep is essential to a healthy immune system, as well as many other of your body’s systems. You can’t perform at your best if you’re sleep-deprived. Stay Active Prolonged intense exercise has been shown to lower your immune response – however, moderate exercise actually boosts that response. Studies show that even one session of moderate exercise can increase vaccine effectiveness in those with compromised immune systems. “Working out is a powerful way to boost your immune system,” says Mark Moyad, MD, MPH, Jenkins/Pokempner director of preventative and alternative medicine at the University of Michigan Medical Center. Exercise circulates your antibodies and white blood cells more rapidly, which helps them detect germs more quickly. “Being active this way also lowers stress hormones, which reduces your chances of getting sick,” Moyad adds. According to a recent study of over 1,000 people, those who exercised at least five days a week had almost half the risk of coming down with the common cold than the more sedentary folks. Regular moderate exercise can reduce inflammation, too, and that is known to improve your immune system. Exercise can also help your immune cells to regenerate regularly. Examples of moderate exercise include 30 to 60 minutes of brisk walking, jogging, swimming, steady bicycling, and light hiking three to five times a week. Notice that most of these are associated with the outdoors. There’s a good reason for taking your exercise outside. Sunlight can stimulate your T-cells, special parts of your immune system that help fight off infection. And being outside brings you into contact with phytoncides and other plant products that can boost your immune function. It also boosts Vitamin D levels in your body, which helps your immune system further. You should also be doing strength training exercises twice a week to stay at your healthiest. The CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) recommends two and one-half hours of moderate-intensity exercise every week as well as one hour and fifteen minutes of high-intensity aerobic exercise. So, you should exercise regularly and get enough sunlight to boost your immune system and increase your overall health. Eat Whole Plant Foods Today’s processed diet is a major cause of inflammation in the body. Our ancestors ate more raw fruits and vegetables and doctors have proven this is a healthier diet for your immune system (as well as other systems in your body). Whole plant foods are rich in antioxidants and nutrients that strengthen your immune system. Registered dietician Julia Zumpano, RD, LD, had this to say about eating your fruits and vegetables: “Try to eat a wide variety of foods and aim to eat fruit and vegetables from every color of the rainbow.” Eating a colorful diet is not only artistically pleasing, but fresh fruits and veggies are far better for you than processed foods and supplements. Protein is also needed for immune health. Amino acids help build and maintain immune cells and a low-protein diet may reduce your body’s ability to fight off infection. In a 2013 study, mice with a diet of only 2% protein were more severely affected by flu than mice who ate a normal (18% protein) diet. There are three main vitamins needed by your immune system: Vitamin C, Vitamin B6, and Vitamin E. Vitamin C is one of the essential vitamins needed by your immune system. It’s important for you to get plenty of natural Vitamin C from your diet because your body doesn’t store that vitamin. Anything you don’t use is flushed from the body by your kidneys. The good news is that you can easily get enough Vitamin C from food without spending money on supplements. Fruits and vegetables rich in Vitamin C include citrus fruits (and their juice), strawberries, bell peppers, broccoli, kale, and spinach. Another immune system-boosting vitamin is B6 or pyridoxine. It’s a water-soluble vitamin that isn’t made in your body, so you need to eat the right foods to get enough for your immune system. Natural sources of B6 include chicken or turkey and cold-water fish like salmon or tuna. You can also get Vitamin B6 from green vegetables and chickpeas (the main ingredient in hummus). So even if you’re vegan you can get plenty of B6 to strengthen your immune system. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that is a powerful antioxidant. It’s found in nuts, seeds, and spinach. You do need to be more careful with Vitamin E because, since it’s stored in your fat, can actually build up in your body to dangerous levels. Never take Vitamin E supplements unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so. If you’re older or feeling particularly tired, you might also have your doctor check your Vitamin D levels. Most people get enough Vitamin D from simply going outside, where sunlight stimulates your body to make the vitamin. However, if your doctor says you need more, taking 400 IU daily has been shown to increase disease-fighting cells like T-cells. Foods that contain Vitamin D include fatty fish like tuna, mackerel, and salmon, beef liver, cheese, and egg yolks. Additional nutrients your immune system needs are zinc, folate, iron, and selenium according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Getting these from your food is better than using supplements, but you do need each of them to support your immune system. Eating more whole plant foods can really improve your immune system. Eat Healthy Fats “80% of your immune system is found in your gut,” says Yufang Lin, MD, of the Center for Integrative Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, “so when it’s healthy, we tend to be able to fight off infections faster and better. When it’s not, our immune system is weaker and more susceptible to fighting off infection.” Healthy fats are those with anti-inflammatory properties, like the ones found in olive oil, nuts, and fatty fish like salmon. These may boost your body’s immune response by lowering inflammation. Inflammation is a natural response to stress or injury, but chronic inflammation, such as can be caused by a high-fat, highly-processed diet, can suppress your immune system’s responses. Olive oil has been scientifically linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. It’s highly anti-inflammatory and may help your body fight off dangerous viruses and bacteria. Omega-3 fatty acids, like the ones found in cold-water fish (like salmon) and chia seeds, have also been shown to fight inflammation and support your immune system. In general, Dr. Lin recommends people focus on a Mediterranean style of eating. That means a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats. “This eating pattern is high in nutrients such as Vitamin C, zinc, and other antioxidants shown to help reduce inflammation and fight infection,” she explains. Adults between 65 and 70 years old who followed a Mediterranean diet showed small increases in disease-fighting cells (such as T-cells) according to a 2018 study published in Frontiers in Physiology. Healthy fats can help stimulate your immune system and boost your body’s response to disease or infection. Eat Probiotic-Rich Foods Fermented foods like yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut, kefir, and natto are rich in helpful bacteria called probiotics. These are the same bacteria that live in your gut and help your digestive system work properly. Gut health and immunity are closely interrelated. Research has suggested that a healthy gut bacteria population can help your immune system tell the difference between healthy body cells and harmful invaders. In one study, children who drank just 2.4 ounces (70 ml) of fermented milk daily had around 20% fewer childhood infectious diseases compared with the control group who didn’t drink probiotics. If you don’t regularly eat fermented foods, a probiotic supplement may be a good idea. In another study of people infected with rhinovirus, those who took a supplement of the bacterium Bifidobacterium animalis had a stronger immune system response and lower levels of the virus in their nasal mucus than the control group did. A typical daily dose of probiotics is between 1 and 10 billion CFUs (colony-forming units) daily. The key is to take these probiotic supplements or foods consistently to maintain a healthy gut and support your immune system. It’s best to eat probiotic-rich foods like yogurt or sauerkraut, but if you can’t include those in your regular diet, you should consider supplements to improve your immune response. Limit Sugar Intake The latest research states that added sugars and processed foods can contribute significantly to obesity, which can in turn reduce your immune system response. One study of around 1,000 people found that obese people who got their yearly flu shot were twice as likely to still get the flu afterward than non-obese people who got their vaccine. Cutting your sugar and processed food intake can lower inflammation. It also aids in weight loss, of course, and reduce your risk of developing conditions like heart disease or type 2 diabetes. And since all three conditions – obesity, diabetes, and heart disease – are known to weaken your immune system, “curbing your sugar intake is an important part of an immune-boosting diet,” according to Healthline. Try to limit your sugar intake to 5% or less of your total daily caloric intake. If you’re on a 2,000 calorie a day diet, for example, you should get less than two tablespoonful’s (25 grams) of sugar in one day. Reducing your sugar and processed foods can not only help you lose weight but can improve your immune system. Stay Hydrated Dehydration is when your body doesn’t get enough water. It can reduce your physical performance, mood, focus, digestion, and heart and kidney function. These can also lower your resistance to disease. Your first hint that you may not be getting enough water is a common feeling – thirst. You may also get a headache. You should be drinking enough fluid to create a pale-yellow urine. Water is best because it doesn’t have any added calories. Try to avoid too many sweetened drinks like fruit juice, sweet tea, or sodas. While those can help hydrate you, the added sugar can reduce your immune response and negate the positive effects of drinking enough fluid. Staying hydrated can boost your immune health. Water helps your body make lymph, which carries immune system cells like white blood cells. Try eating hydrating foods like cucumbers, melon, or celery. Also, try to avoid overdoing diuretic or water-reducing substances like caffeine. As a general guideline, you should drink whenever you’re thirsty and continue drinking until your body no longer signals it needs liquid. You may need more fluid if you exercise, work outside, or live in a hot climate. Remember that as you age, your body is less able to signal its needs for liquid, so older people are less likely to drink enough. If you’re over 55, you should make sure you drink enough even if you don’t feel particularly thirsty. Although hydrating doesn’t have a direct effect on your immune system, it’s important to your overall health and thus, important to your immune system. Reduce Stress There’s a strong link between your immune system and your mental health. Stress and anxiety make poor germ fighters. Studies have shown that just having anxious thoughts can lower your immune response in as little as half an hour. Constant stress makes it even harder to fight off viruses and bacteria. Stress makes your body produce cytokines, molecules that trigger inflammation that can reduce your immune response. “When you’re under chronic stress or anxiety,” says Dr. Mark Moyad, “your body produces stress hormones that suppress your immune system.” Research at Carnegie Mellon University found that if you’re stressed, you’re more likely to come down with the common cold. In one study, healthy adults were exposed to the cold virus, then quarantined for five days and monitored. Those who reported stress were twice as likely to get sick. “In addition,” Dr. Yufang Lin says, “People who are stressed are less likely to pay attention to other healthy habits, like eating right and getting enough sleep, which can affect immunity.” There is also evidence that sorrow if it lasts a long time, can lower your body’s immunity. This effect can last for up to six months – and can go on even longer if your grief is deep or doesn’t ease. Talk to a doctor or therapist if you suffer from anxiety or grief that doesn’t seem to be letting up in a reasonable time period. Although you can’t avoid stress or sorrow, you can use strategies to manage it better. A 2012 study in Annals of Internal Medicine found that adults who either had a daily exercise routine or performed mindfulness meditation were less likely to get sick with a respiratory infection – or that, if they did get sick, missed fewer days at work. Exercise increases the release of endorphins, hormones that reduce stress, and create feelings of pleasure. This makes it a great way to fight off stress. Dr. Lin says, “Since stress negatively impacts our immune system, this is another way exercise can improve immune response. Mindfulness is a way of focusing your thoughts on the here-and-now instead of worrying about the future or stressing over the past. Stress can negatively affect your immune system but managing that stress can moderate or negate that effect. Regular exercise helps, as does mindfulness meditation that focuses your thoughts on what’s going on immediately around you instead of letting you keep worrying. Quit Smoking Smoking damages your lungs, which are two of the main gateways into your body. Nicotine and marijuana both decrease your lungs’ ability to fight off infection and both increase inflammation. And yes, vaping still counts as smoking if you’re talking about your immune system. “Chemicals released by cigarette smoke – carbon monoxide, nicotine, nitrogen oxides, and cadmium – can interfere with the growth and function of immune cells like T-cells, cytokines, and B-cells,” per a 2016 review in Oncotarget. Smoking also makes infections worse, especially if they’re in the lungs (like pneumonia, flu, and tuberculosis). And overdoing the booze even once can slow your body’s ability to fight off germs for a full 24 hours. Over time, drinking too much can damage your body’s ability to repair the damage. This is why people who drink are more prone to illnesses like liver disease, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and certain cancers. If you’re going to indulge, stick to one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men. Moderation in all things. Smoking and drinking too much are harmful in many ways. One of the things you may not have considered is your immune system. There is a multitude of ways to stop smoking and drinking. If you’re having difficulty, see your doctor for some expert help to get yourself healthy again. Conclusion Your immune system is an amazing part of your body. It recognizes germs like viruses, bacteria, and fungi and fights them off. It also neutralizes harmful substances and fights disease-causing changes in the body. “Think of the immune system as an orchestra,” says Lauren Bedosky for Everyday Health. “For the best performance, you want every instrument and every musician in the orchestra to perform at its best.” You don’t need one musician suddenly playing double speed or one instrument blaring out at top volume. The same goes for your immune system. There are many things you can do to boost your immune system and help your body fight off disease. Some of these you’ve heard all your life: exercise regularly, stop smoking and drinking, get enough sleep, and manage your stress. One additional method you’re probably already doing is to keep your chronic conditions under control. “Chronic conditions like asthma, heart disease, and diabetes can affect the immune system and increase your risk of infection,” says Bedosky. A 2019 study in Current Diabetes Review found that people with type 2 diabetes who don’t keep their blood glucose levels under control may create a chronic, low-grade inflammatory response that weakens their immune systems. “If you manage your chronic conditions better,” says Dr. Lin, “you’ll free up more reserves to help your body fight off infection.” So, stay on top of your chronic conditions – take your medications, keep your doctor visits, and keep up any healthy habits that keep that condition at bay. “Your immune system will thank you,” says Bedosky.

4,Pulse Oximeters And COVID-19,health-fitness," As we keep on managing the advancing COVID-19 situation, clinical recommendations are constantly changing. This leads to common clinical items and devices becoming scarce overnight. Only a month back it was about difficult to track down thermometers at any store. The previous week has put heartbeat oximeters on the open radar, prompting shortage and, tragically, many heartbeat oximeter ‘scams.' What Is A Pulse Oximeter? What is a pulse oximeter? Pulse oximeters are devices that measure the oxygen immersion of the blood. It is normally observed clasped on a finger, as they help decide how well oxygen is being conveyed to parts of your body (particularly parts that are further from your heart). A pulse oximeter works by using light to detect how much oxygen is in your blood. There are numerous reasons pulse oximeters are used in hospital settings including observing your oxygen levels after surgery, checking if a patient is capable of breathing all alone, and observing patients who may have different infections where it is imperative to watch oxygen levels. Typical oxygen immersion levels are commonly thought to be around 95 to 100. A hear pulse tbeat oximeter perusing lower than 95 begins to raise concern. Why Doctors Are Mentioning Pulse Oximeters Doctors were initially saying that it was not important to purchase a pulse oximeter for home use except if there was a previous respiratory condition. As time went on, be that as it may, we have found out increasingly more about COVID-19 and what it is able to do. Most patients who get contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 (the infection that causes COVID-19) have mild – if any – symptoms, usually recovering without any complications. Doctors in hospital emergency rooms, be that as it may, have begun detailing that they have patients coming in with COVID pneumonia who have amazingly low oxygen immersion levels. According to the doctors, pneumonia in these patients had been present for a while. They should have had trouble breathing long before they went to the hospital. The vast majority of the patients just went to the emergency clinic since they at last felt winded for quite a long time in the wake of building up a fever or hack (or other symptoms). Generally, when oxygen saturation levels drop 90%, individuals feel like they are struggling to breathe. COVID pneumonia, be that as it may, doesn't appear to seriously influence our capacity to breathe out carbon dioxide (CO2), so these patients would not have felt winded without a buildup of carbon dioxide. How To Test With A Pulse Oximeter This new information is scary, of course. It means that people are getting sick and can be critically ill without even knowing it. Doctors still are not sure why some people get so much sicker than others. Some doctors have said that it might be a good idea to keep a pulse oximeter on hand in case you start developing any symptoms. Other doctors are still not recommending buying one. A pulse oximeter can help detect if your blood oxygen levels are low, regardless of whether you don't feel winded. Checking your oxygen immersion levels could help give early discovery to respiratory issues identified with COVID-19, particularly COVID pneumonia. . If you have tested positive for the virus, it is recommended that you monitor your oxygen saturation levels for at least two weeks. Two weeks after testing positive for the virus is when pneumonia would be most likely to develop. The tests used to detect COVID-19 have also shown to give false negatives, meaning that a few people are testing negative when they really have the infection. It can be helpful to monitor your oxygen levels if you test negative but have other symptoms like coughing and/or fever. In the event that you have a heartbeat oximeter and get a low perusing, call your primary care physician first to abstain from overpowering trauma centers. There might be different reasons why your perusing is low that are not identified with COVID-19. Finding The Right Pulse Oximeter We sell portable pulse oximeters at our drug store, and you might have the option to discover them on the web. I have been watching out for choices (and searching for scams!) to perceive what else is available to the public. One ‘alternative’ I found is an app that claims to be able to read your oxygen level saturation and heart rate by using the camera and flash on your phone. To see if this app was accurate, I compared its results with a real pulse oximeter. Using the real pulse oximeter, I got consistent readings of 97-98% oxygen saturation and a heart rate of 85-86. I used the app to measure my levels and heart rate 4 times and got one oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93%, then three consecutive ratings of 99%. My heart rate ranged from 82-83 beats per minute (bpm). After testing myself, I asked a coworker who had been walking around (read: should have a higher pulse) to try out the application too. His outcomes from the application were equivalent to my latest readings: SpO2 of 99% and pulse of 83 bpm. Hmm. His real heart rate had been 102 bpm at the time and his oxygen level was 97% on the real pulse oximeter."

9,The Increasing Use of Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizers In COVID-19,health-fitness," We as a whole realize that frequent hand washing is important to prevent the spread of infectious agents to and from those with whom we have both direct and indirect contact. Be that as it may, it isn't always convenient to wash. Having traveled this past winter to anesthesia board meetings in Australia, Charleston, and Scottsdale, I found that eating on a plane during turbulent weather when safety belts should not be removed prevented me from always washing up first. These occurrences were ideal for utilizing liquor based hand sanitizers. One just places a modest quantity on all fours rubs them together until dry. No water, cleanser, or paper towels are essential. One can even remove a small amount of the sanitizer from a larger commercial container and place it into practically any clean, more convenient sized labeled bottle to improve its portability and utility. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Guidelines for Infection Control in the Dental Health-Care Setting—2003 suggests putting away liquid hand-care items in either dispensable containers or holders that can be washed with cleanser and water before topping off. Such holders must not be topped off or ""topped off"" when in part vacant, as that could lead to bacterial contamination of resistant organisms. Hand sanitizers can be found throughout the hospital, and there are already regulations on how wide the corridors must be before a particular sized apportioning unit can be joined to the divider. Indeed, even my own state dental load up has endorsed this kind of item for use in the dental office before setting gloves and subsequent to evacuating them and whenever an article or surface that may be contaminated with blood or saliva is touched with bare hands. Obviously, as a ""shade-tree mechanic"" working on antique cars and tractors in his spare time, your supervisor realizes that hand sanitizers can't supplant incredible scouring with cleanser and water to remove obvious dirt, grease, and grime. Nevertheless, rubbing your hands with one of these items is safe and effective in reducing the bacterial skin count many dental office situations. Moreover, visit hand washing with cleanser and germicides can cause chronic contact dermatitis. Damage to the skin can change the skin flora, resulting about more regular colonization by staphylococci and gram-negative microbes. Since liquor based sanitizers might be less bothering to the skin, their utilization may actually improve hand hygiene. For oral surgeries, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests careful hand antisepsis before wearing clean gloves. One ought to follow the producer's proposals by utilizing either antimicrobial cleanser and water or plain cleanser and water followed by drying the hands and applying a liquor based careful hand-scour item with relentless movement to forestall the gigantic bacterial development that in any case could create under the warm, moist gloves. Your editor typed this treatise on his laptop computer in the hospital late at night while munching on a few cookies to remain awake after finishing to long day with a fiber-optic endotracheal intubation of a seriously contaminated dental patient who had not bathed for a long time. Recalling a study conducted at Northwestern Memorial Hospital that demonstrated that vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus could survive on the keyboard for 24 hours and that Pseudomonas aeruginosa could survive for 1 hour, your editor considered sanitizing the keys on his laptop computer before eating, but that disinfection plan was rejected because of possible damage to the computer. Thus, this editorial was created by the repetitive process of typing a few words, rubbing the hands with a sanitizer, and taking a few bites. We should not be concerned about being labeled as having an obsessive-compulsive the top habitual issue or being a ""germ-a-phobe"" like Howard Hughes. Hand sanitizers are acceptable and ought to be used frequently."

12,What big skin care manufacturers don’t want you to know,health-fitness," The skin care industry is huge- in fact it is over$ 50 Billion in sales in 2018 and growing rapidly. Most industry observers project it to grown another 20 Billion by the year 2025. However, not all skin care products are created equally. Did you know that in the U.S. the industry is largely unregulated? How does that affect us as consumers? You might be interested to know that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only bans 30 chemicals that cannot be used in skin care products. These include your makeup, lotions, serums, creams, etc. Whereas the European Union bans 1328 chemicals from being used in skin care products! Included in the vast majority of skin care products in America are known toxic ingredients. Have you ever looked on the label of your skin care products only to find a long list of ingredients that you cannot even pronounce- folks, those are chemicals. We all know that processed foods are not good for our bodies- but are you aware that most people in America unknowingly ingest daily harmful toxins into the largest organ we have- our skin. Here are just a few of the toxins and chemicals used in many skin care products that are linked to a variety of health problems: Formaldehyde- yes, you read that right. The same chemicals used to embalm dead bodies are in many skin care products. It is a preservative fluid and is a recognized carcinogen (cancer causing agent) by the National Cancer Institute- with particularly higher risk for leukemia, but many unknowingly put this harmful chemical into their bodies daily while searching for the “fountain of youth”. Parabens- Parabens have many other names and are used as preservatives in skin care products. They have been linked by scientists to an increased risk of contracting breast cancer and are routinely used in skin care products. A startling statistic is that 99% of patients with breast cancer have been found to have higher levels of parabens in their bodies. The National Chemical Society estimates that about 85% of personal care products in America contain parabens. Synthetic fragrances- These ingredients are not fully disclosed. The requirements for “fragrance” or perfume is simply to list Fragrance or Perfume on the ingredient list. However, these chemical fragrances can be filled with thousands of separate ingredients- many which may be toxic. Even the word unscented may use “fragrances” to mask the smell of toxic chemicals. Fragrances have been linked to migraine headaches, asthma, and other respiratory problems. By contrast organic essential oils used as fragrances offer no side effects, and even can assist with out health. Phthalates- A truly toxic skin care ingredient used to help your skin care product absorb into the skin- while also absorbing this known toxin that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Health and Human Services have classified phthalates as a probably human carcinogen! All natural products may take a short bit longer to absorb into the skin- but at least you are not also absorbing toxic chemicals into your largest organ in your body@ Petrochemicals- This category of chemical based ingredients encompass formaldehyde, parabens, phthalates sodium laureth sulfates, coal tar and more. They are known toxins used primarily to extend the shelf life of skin care products laden with toxic chemicals that are known to be dangerous to humans. Borates- Boron containing chemical compounds, most commonly called sodium borate, boric acid, sodium perborate and perboric acid. These are used as preservatives and emulsifying agents in skin care products and sometimes teeth whitening tootpaste. Borates are banned by the European Union and have been linked to male and female sexual and birth defects. The above list is but a small sampling of toxic products contained in our skin care products. We urge you to read your labels and choose all natural ingredients only to protect your health.

13,What is the Most Important Thing to do After a Cancer Diagnosis?,health-fitness," You get a phone call. You suddenly hear the word cancer in the same sentence as your name. Suddenly, your emotions kick in, such as fear, confusion, dismay, and oh so many questions. What to do now? The most important thing to do initially is nothing. Nothing?! There is this cancer thing, and I must do research, and phone calls to make. Why start with nothing? Your body heals best when it is in a state of relaxation. By taking a few minutes to do nothing, you will quiet your mind which will help your body to relax. Why is this so important? The opposite state of relaxation is stress. When your body is in a stressed state, hormones levels increase and these changes can dramatically decrease your body's ability to heal. When changes such as increased blood glucose, shutting down digestion and reducing immune system function will reduce your body's ability to heal. The changes that are associated with the stress response are meant to be short-lived. Once the crisis is handled, your body returns to a state of relaxation. This process is normal. It is the effects of prolonged stress that dramatically decrease your body's ability to heal. It is normal to think of cancer as a threat, but the truth of the matter is, you have a choice in how to approach your diagnosis. Our body has an amazing ability to heal. Do not try to hold in his is the message you want to focus on, not the alternative message that your life is in danger. Do not try to hold in your emotions. You should acknowledge every emotion that you feel. Keeping your emotions inside will have negative health consequences. Cancer is not something to be taken lightly. You will have many difficult decisions, conversations, and treatments in the coming weeks and months. Can you approach these situations while in a state of relaxation? If so, your body will have a much better chance of healing. So how do you achieve this state of relaxation? It is a skill that takes practice. Here are some ideas Rapid breathing signals the body that there is danger present. Breathe in for a count of 5, pause for a count of 5, and then exhale for a count of 5. Nature has an inherent ability to heal and impart wisdom. Have some fun - listen to your favorite music, dance, laugh (think of something that has made you laugh or smile in the past). Exercise, if it is part of your normal routine, will help your body to relax. Do not do something extreme that your body is not used to doing; this will cause another stress response. Further, tell someone how much you appreciate them; it will brighten both of your days. The more time your body stays in a state of relaxation, the greater your healing potential will be. Try to find ways to work these techniques into your daily routine whenever you are feeling stressed. Relaxation is your body's normal state, and it will want to return there. Doing things that help your body relax will serve as a reminder that it is OK to relax. Any time you choose relaxation over stress, your body will benefit. You can do all the same tasks, just in a more relaxed state. You will also find that in a state of relaxation, you will be more efficient, think more clearly, and have more productive interactions with others. It is a win-win situation. From this state of relaxation, you can begin to ask your body what it needs most to heal. You will not gain this awareness from a state of stress."

16,Can CBD Help With Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain?,health-fitness," There has been an explosion of new cannabidiol (CBD) products hitting the market, and today more than ever it’s important to be as informed as possible before trying it out for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pain relief. Because of marijuana’s somewhat tumultuous history, research on the positive properties of hemp plants’ derivatives such as cannabidiol oil has been extremely limited. There are also plenty of marketing schemes making unsubstantiated claims that promise relief from a wide range of ailments like ear aches and Alzheimers disease. Understandably, this has caused many people to question its use for modern day health issues, including RA primarily because there has yet to be enough long-term, or in-depth studies to feel confident. On the positive side, the FDA has finally approved one CBD product called Epidiolex, a prescription drug product used to treat two rare, severe forms of epilepsy. It is encouraging that research is being taken seriously now, and the results so far are positive. Just what is CBD? To clear things up, CBD is NOT “psychoactive” — that is, it does not cause the intoxication or high associated with marijuana use. CBD is a medicinal product derived from hemp. Hemp and marijuana are both types of cannabis plants, but they are very different from each other. They each have different quantities of various phytocannabinoids, which are substances naturally found in the cannabis plant. You can think of it like how different kinds of berries contain different combinations of antioxidants. Hemp contains less than 0.3 percent THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) which is the cannabinoid that makes you high. CBD cannot get you high. Marijuana, on the other hand, contains an abundance of THC. How does CBD work? CBD works with your endocannabinoid system, which is a group of receptors in the body that are affected by the dozens of other documented cannabinoids. CBD is thought to work on pain in two parts of the body: the site of soreness (such as your finger joints) and the central nervous system, which sends pain signals to the brain when it detects certain stimulation or damage to nerves and cells. The ability for CBD to calm that response is one reason the compound might be a viable pain remedy for people with RA. Another is CBD’s anti-inflammatory properties. Inflammation occurs when your body is fighting a perceived infection. In autoimmune diseases such as RA, the immune system is attacking healthy parts of your body like your joints. Will CBD work for me? CBD could be worth exploring as a potential solution for RA pain as part of an overall arthritis treatment plan, but keep in mind that there are more than 100 types of arthritis. With rheumatoid arthritis, conventional prescription medications are highly recommended to continue taking, because these drugs help prevent permanent joint damage and worsening disability. CBD is used to primarily help cope with the pain, not prevent or cure RA. Reports from people who have started incorporating CBD into their arthritis treatment have been positive. One person posted on a Facebook group called Creaky Joints that topical CBD “helps better than any other ointment I’ve ever used.” You can find plenty of positive results out there. Because we are still waiting for well-designed, scientifically valid, and rigorous clinical trials, it’s important that you check with a trusted rheumatoid arthritis doctor before trying CBD. Pain management should always be a conversation between you and your doctor, even if it includes CBD. Keep in mind also that CBD is not inexpensive. Prices range widely and depending on dose, frequency, and formulation, the cost can be considerable — some are as much as $120/month, and health insurance does not usually cover it. In the years to come, CBD may become one of the most valuable treatments for chronic RA pain, and even many treatment-resistant mood disorders experienced by millions of Americans. One day, it may also be covered under insurance plans."

18,Weight loss supplements really help you lose weight?,health-fitness," If you want to lose weight safely, no weight loss supplements will help you. The ones that are effective, only influence your weight loss by a tiny margin. The ones that are effective, they’re almost always dangerous. For example, there are some supplements that help you lose weight by blocking your sense of hunger. There are even some Russian websites, suggesting you can lose weight by infecting yourself with tapeworms. You know, the worms that live in your intestine, and can grow up to 3 meters in length. The motivation behind putting a parasite inside you on purpose (a depressingly common scheme) is that it will live inside your digestive tract and gobble up calories from the cheeseburgers and cake you keep eating, but saying a tapeworm will help you lose weight is like saying a knife wound in your throat will ease your sleep apnea—it might have the intended effect, but it's also a terrible, terrible idea. Then there is the category of supplements that work, kind of. For example, green tea extract. Green tea extract can work in helping you lose weight, but the effect is so tiny, you’ll be better off doing a push-up, instead of buying it. So what should you do if you want to lose weight? You don’t need to do exhaustive dieting, you don’t have to eliminate all sugar or carbs. At its very core, weight loss is about creating a caloric deficit. Now, there are ways to do achieve and live in a caloric deficit without putting too much strain on the body. No matter what you do, it’s impossible to become immune to hunger - you WILL lose weight. The fat is there for a reason - to be used when you’re not getting it from outside sources. And intermittent fasting is the all-natural way to lose weight. But effective weight loss can also seem confusing if you’re not familiar with it yet. In fact, after reading all the different answers with different ways to lose weight, you could be more confused than you were to begin with. Through evolution, our bodies adapted to constant fasting. People sometimes didn’t eat for weeks or even months if the food wasn’t around. And they were fine. So no, you won’t damage your metabolism. No, you won’t gain it all right back. A caloric deficit is the only way of losing weight, and IF allows you to stay in a caloric deficit without feeling like it. That means you can get on with your life. You’re not dieting, you get used to eating according to a pattern, and then it becomes entirely natural for you to eat breakfast when others are eating lunch. Losing weight is easy. When you eat less frequently, you eat less overall. As a result, people doing IF lose weight - significant amounts of it. Extra productivity Before doing Intermittent Fasting, I didn’t know that actually, the first 3 hours of my morning are the most productive ones. That’s around 12 - 15 hours into my fast. That was completely unexpected, and now that I have extra time in the mornings, I can use it to be extraordinarily productive and start my leisure activities a lot earlier than I used to. Long-Term approach IF works best if you find just the right amount of calories and the perfect eating window. That is entirely up to you. To find that, listen to your body’s needs and act accordingly. Once you find how many calories you need to feel great and when are your favorite feeding times, you’ll find that you can do it indefinitely, and that’s why Fasting is way more effective than dieting or taking supplements. Even more benefits of IF: ✔️Increases insulin sensitivity. High insulin sensitivity allows the cells of the body to use blood glucose more effectively, reducing blood sugar. ✔️Reduces insulin resistance.

1,NJ Medical Marijuana Got Cheaper in July 2020,health-fitness," NJ-New Jersey sales tax on medical marijuana was cut to four percent on 1, down from six percent july. This represents the first stage in a three-year plan built to phase out state taxes on purchases of medicinal cannabis. Fast forward to 1, 2021 and you will see that the state sales tax will be cut even more — to two percent july. Then, in 2022, it will be completely gone. Don’t assume that this means medical marijuana will be totally tax-free, though. Each community is allowed to impose a two percent “transfer tax” on purchases; that being said, no municipality has instituted such a tax at the time of yet. Jake Honig Compassionate Use Medical Cannabis Act The sales tax phase-out was a vital section of 2019’s Jake Honig Compassionate Use Medical Cannabis Act.

However, supply issues because of the high prices (up to $500 for a ounce that is single of marijuana) have dogged the program right from the start.  An ounce of “Green Fire OG,” for example, applies to $440 per ounce at Curaleaf NJ, a Bellmawr dispensary. Because of the sales tax in place ahead of July 1, a person would shell out $29.15 in taxes, for a amount that is total of469.15. Now, that tax paid is reduced to $17.60, for a complete of $457.60. Just nine medical marijuana dispensaries are open around the state at this time. Other locations that are pre-approved associated with legal battles and cannot open yet.

2,"EXERCISE ANXIETY, IS THAT EVEN A THING |12 WAYS TO IDENTIFY IT AND FIX IT",health-fitness," Just thinking about starting a fitness routine or reconnecting with an old one, can unleash feelings of negativity and apprehension before even getting started… Anxiety presents itself in many facets of life, including exercise. There are many psychological reasons for getting healthy and one may be the social pressures to look a certain way, which gets people uneasy about even heading into a gym or health club, in the first place. At times we’re striving for the standards set out in society which may feel impossible to achieve. But that negativity and fear of failure keeps some from even attempting to get started. Some also feel judged by walking into a gym or even the feeling of judgment while working out… some don’t know where to start, some make huge goals that seem impossible to achieve and others just are so insecure about their current physical condition that they feel embarrassed to even try to become healthy. Anxiety as a whole can present with physical symptoms or psychological symptoms. Some physical symptoms are rapid heartbeat, sweaty palms, restlessness, irritability, fatigue & difficulty sleeping. Psychological symptoms would be worry, paranoia, analytical thinking towards negative results or events. Despite exercise being a highly effective way to reduce stress and anxiety. Anxiety is a common reason that keeps people from starting an exercise routine or seeking professional fitness services because of the stress and negativity the thought even causes them. Here’s some ways to win the struggle against anxiety and worry that may be associated with starting a new fitness routine or joining a gym… Do research to figure out the proper fitness routine for you. Initially, you must be thoughtful of how you’re feeling and do what feels right for your body. The anxiety that’s caused prior or during exercise is usually the result of negativity or a fear of failure. There’s always a level of fear or embarrassment because of the unknown, starting something for the first time… with a feeling of judgement from others. Find the type of fitness routine that is enjoyable to you, whether it’s group classes or individual personal training.. find the right fitness setting that feels best to your psyche. The less you think about what others are thinking the more you’ll be able to achieve in your own personal goals. Schedule in advance. Have a plan for each workout you do. Having structure even in fitness, gives you a feeling of security as well as comfort, because you’re following a plan… Know which equipment you want to use, know what class you want to attend. Giving you a path for your workout. Give yourself a timeline for your workout as well. Including how long you’re going to do certain fitness equipment, cardio or even the length of your entire workout. Begin Conservatively. When starting cardio begin with 5 minutes, each session and thereafter try to increase in 30 or 1 minute increments. The thought of running a mile the first time, on a treadmill sounds daunting and unachievable. But thinking of paced progress increases what your body is able to achieve with effort and determination, of course. Be the only person you compete with. Once you start comparing yourself with others, whether it’s in real life or on social media, you will start to try to achieve their results instead of goals that are feasible for your starting physical condition and body type. So again instead of focusing on what others are doing or what they think… It’s best to focus on your own goals. Invest in Activewear. Yes, buying specific fitness apparel is not necessary and by all means, if you don’t have the budget to do so, avoid attempting to. But if you are able to invest a small amount in attractive active wear that makes you feel confident and ready to attack any fitness routine, by all means, do it! Make that purchase, because it makes a difference. Having select apparel that was bought and is used for fitness workouts gives you that boost of positivity, because not only do you feel amazing in your active wear, but you also feel that you are in your gym uniform. Ready to kick butt!😎 Being in denial only increases the problem. Avoiding the problem, whether it’s weight gain or unhealthy living, only creates increased health problems and or body weight. Just because your mind and your body are not wanting to or feeling like exercise, is no reason to avoid it or allow anxiety to take over. Remind yourself that anxiety and frustration is only temporary, but a healthy physique and a healthy functioning system is something that you will always treasure.. Acknowledge your small milestones along your journey. Attaching positivity whether it be in small gifts or allowing yourself to buy something you’ve wanted, because you stuck to your fitness routine with the proper frequency and duration, is a wonderful thing. Attaching positivity to exercise in a healthy way, is something that your psyche will respond well to. Therefore, changing any negative feelings or correlations to exercise or fitness that you once had. Acknowledge your exercise anxiety. Admit the feelings and emotions you are feeling towards exercise. If you’re feeling workout stress whether it’s before or during, Acknowledge those feelings and repeat those affirmations stated above, as well as positive thoughts and feelings towards working out. Accept the 1% mentality. Look at exercise as a slither of your time, of your day. Fifteen minutes is only about 1% of your day. Whatever workout you choose, decide to set aside a few minutes to workout each day. So many people get wrapped up in an all-or-nothing mindset… But it should be changed to a mindset of something-is-better-than-nothing, no matter how short the length of time you’re able to be active. Incorporating any amount of fitness into your day, will have a beneficial and positive impact on your health and wellness. Get a friend involved. Getting a workout buddy is a great thing. They hold you accountable to gym days, as well as initiating and finishing workouts… because of their presence and encouragement.

3,Reinforcing Positive Change,health-fitness," It’s one thing to say you want to make changes with a vague idea of what you want. But by setting and aligning ourselves to clearly defined goals and mapping the steps necessary to meet those goals, we can achieve successful change. The most successful people in the world set goals, take the steps necessary, succeed, then make a new goal.  They thrive on the process itself, they revel in the challenge and the conquest. We too can adopt this mentality with the changes we desire. Defining our motivation is the first step to positive results. Motivation can be external or internal/ intrinsic. •	External Motivation External motivation is driven by external rewards such as money, fame, SAT scores, praise, acknowledgement.  The motivation comes from outside the individual. •	Intrinsic Motivation Internal or intrinsic motivation is when something is done simply because it is pleasurable or enjoyable. Successful people can be motivated externally, but the most successful and happy people tend to be intrinsically motivated because they find fulfillment and purpose in the actions they take. When we begin to find the joy in the changes we are actively engaging in, the process itself can become enjoyable. By shifting our mindset on the process, we can further align with our goal, and the process becomes less of a challenge. We can internalize the process rather than seeing it as separate, as an obstacle or a chore, a means to an end. When talking to people who live a fitness lifestyle, they’ll lament when they’ve missed a workout, when they cannot make it to the gym. They’ll tell you their workout is their “me time” because they have aligned with their goal and it is now a source of pleasure for them. The same is true for those who eat clean, who’ve changed their dietary habits and it has changed how they feel in their bodies. They find joy in the foods they eat, in how their bodies now function. This isn’t to say that external motivation is bad. Far from it. A majority of change is instigated by external motivation. Wanting to lose weight so you can snag a partner is external motivation. Wanting to fit in that dress for a friend’s wedding is external motivation. Wanting to get into a good school to make our parents proud or get a promotion to afford a new house are external motivations. The shift that creates long-term change comes when we’ve stuck with a new, healthier habit for a while and our reasons for keeping it up move to intrinsic motivation. Instead of wanting to lose weight to get a partner, the motivation can become focused on the changes we are feeling in our bodies, in how our clothes fit and how we feel about ourselves, our confidence and self-esteem raise. Studying hard and acing a test can become about the sense of accomplishment and pride in our efforts and gaining knowledge rather than about someone else’s opinion. By exploring our motivations and shifting perspective on our goals, we can take these changes to a deeper level and reinforce them for long-term success."
4,Slump Busting,health-fitness," So far we’ve talked about hitting The Wall and how to beat cravings. But what about that slump? The slump is the place you find yourself when you’re mentally fatigued or burned out on the changes you’re making and feel the pull to go back to old habits. How do we avoid those mental traps and pitfalls? We’ve laid the foundations for good habits, compiled tools and tips to get us through hard moments… But what about those hard days, or stressful weeks? How do we find the mental fortitude to keep going? The Reframe. By reframing the situation and our feelings around it, we can begin to pull ourselves out of the slump while building our mental strength and willpower. Reframing is all about taking a step back and shifting the perspective on a situation. Step 1. Write the thought down. “Keeping up with these new changes is impossible!” Emma Matthews Step 2. Write out your thoughts and feelings on the situation. I can’t do this. I want to give up. It’s not worth it. I’m frustrated, tired and overwhelmed. Step 3. Create alternative thoughts. I can do this. I don’t really want to give up. I want this too much to give up. My health and wellness IS worth it. I need to meet my needs for rest, decompression and relaxation. Victor Garcia Step 4. List the supporting evidence for the alternative thoughts. I’ve done things harder than this before. I’ve planned for these changes, I’m ready for these changes and I’ve already taken steps to succeed. My health is important to me, otherwise I wouldn’t have prepared and planned for my success. The changes I make will last a lifetime. Step 5. Write down your feelings and emotions post-reframe. Center or ground yourself, breathe and examine how you feel after challenging the initial thoughts with the alternatives. I feel confident in my choices. I feel less anxious about the changes. I feel empowered to keep going. By re-framing our thoughts, we can bust that slump and keep moving forward in our journey. With practice, reframing can become a new habit that further supports us along the way. The reframing exercise can be used in all areas of our lives to help us to re-energize ourselves, find our momentum, and overcome our biggest obstacle, ourselves."
5,Clinical Equipment Makers Fight To Fulfill Local Request Amid Of Coronavirus Flare-Up,health-fitness," As the novel coronavirus spreads, deficiencies and rising costs for protective medical equipment have become a typical issue for some, nations battling COVID-19 infection. In Ukraine, where the quantity of coronavirus cases has arrived at 117 and four patients have passed on, individuals are now alarm shopping, dreading deficiencies. Hence, drug stores are running low on medical masks and hand disinfectants. ""There are lines in medicate stores, everybody wants to buy them,"" said Volodymyr Rudenko, top of the Pharmacy Professional Association of Ukraine. The worldwide coronavirus pandemic has caused high as can be interest for defensive clinical gear, including for Ukraine. As the country’s clinical equipment maker’s battle to satisfy domestic interest, the administration and privately owned businesses are making a move. Ukraine has prohibited fares of defensive rigging, while clothing and alcohol companies have switched to producing medical products in an attempt to help. Export ban amid shortages Before the government banned medical supplies exports on a national level on March 11, moderately modest Ukrainian defensive items were sold abroad as once huge mob, including to Spain, Italy and China. While drug store workers had nothing to sell their clients, the nation's fares of defensive items arrived at 565 tons worth $10.6 million in February alone, twice as high as in September. The situation became so critical that some ambulance workers were even compelled to utilize clinical veils that had terminated 10 years prior. In some hospitals, nurses still can’t get necessary protection against the disease they are treating. Accordingly, domestic costs have skyrocketed for protective gear, now and then by 10-20 times. At the point when covers were available, drug stores began approaching $1 for the most fundamental clinical mask, which used to cost less than 4 cents. Amid such a sharp shortage of not only face masks, but also hand sanitizers, full hazardous materials suits and even defensive eyewear, Ukrainian clinical hardware makers guarantee they are giving a valiant effort, yet request is still amazingly high. On masks alone, request is now a few times higher than the 1.5 million units for every year that the nation had before the coronavirus started to spread, according to the Pro-Consulting market research company. Such a visible shortage finally prompted Ukraine to announce the export ban, which will go on until June 6 for the entirety of the 430 Ukrainian clinical hardware makers, with the goal that all their work is coordinated to the domestic market. ""There are things on which cash ought not to be earned – the war and individuals' wellbeing,"" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky back on March 13. In addition, state alcohol producer UkrSpirt additionally quit trading medical alcohol. Beginning on March 20, the state restraining infrastructure rearranged the component for offering liquor to privately owned businesses for a quarter of a year, if they purchase close to 1,000 liters. Just recently, employees of one such organization in the southern city of Kherson attempted to unlawfully send out 21,000 clinical covers worth $40,000 to Israel, the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine reported March 24. Meanwhile, dress and liquor organizations are changing to delivering clinical items too trying to enable the country to battle the spread of the virus. Ukraine's driving texture organization, Textile Contact, has just changed creation to clinical defensive gear, according to its owner, Oleksandr Sokolovskiy. Situated in Chernihiv, a city 140 kilometers north of Kyiv, the company began tailoring protective suits, covers and shoe covers. Its ability will be sufficient to make in any event 50 defensive suits and 1,000 face masks per day. “Don’t panic, we need to organize ourselves!"" Sokolovskiy said. ""The time has come to get that, in spite of political perspectives and inclinations, organizations need correspondence with the specialists, who are at present confounded by difficulties. Don’t let the chaos and panic destroy the country.” Style clothing brand Aviatsiya Halychyny has decided to produce 4,000 masks a day and, therefore, to enable the nation to fill what appears endless interest in face covers — and to help its employees to continue earning salaries. ""As a company, we don't bring in cash from this, yet it is basically significant for our laborers to have probably some income,"" said Yurko Nazaruk, founder of the brand. Yevgeny Chernyak, the owner of Europe's biggest alcohol holding, Global Spirits, is prepared to create sanitizers for free using the holding’s facilities ""This is a non-benefit venture,"" said Chernyak. ""We deal with all production costs."" Hospitals in need Unlike hospitals in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the Asian epicenter of COVID-19, which were completely equipped with modern equipment and where doctors had enough defensive dress, Ukraine is a long way from prepared to do fight with the coronavirus. ""The world has had an epidemic for three months. What does Ukraine have? There is almost nothing. Hospitals are not equipped,"" Victoria Syumar, an official with the European Solidarity group, said during the parliamentary session on March 17. To change the circumstance, in any event five sewing organizations in the western city of Lviv will be profiled to produce hazmat suits for local hospitals. As per Galyna Slichna, deputy Lviv mayor for humanitarian affairs, such suits are at present accessible in emergency clinics, yet they should be changed normally, so more of them are needed. In any case, other than clothing for clinical workers, Ukraine needs present day hardware to treat patients with serious instances of viral pneumonia brought about by COVID-19. According to Viktor Lyashko, Ukraine's top sanitary doctors, Ukrainian medical clinics right now have somewhere in the range of 3,500 lung ventilator machines to keep patients breathing, 400 of which are in intensive care wards of infectious disease hospitals. To think about, Germany, which has one of the most reduced death rates from COVID-19, has 25,000 lung ventilators and ordered 10,000 more from German company Draegerwerk. Also, Ukraine has just 15 extraordinary life bolster machines, which fully replace lung work if necessary. ""This is the main opportunity to spare an individual's life when their lungs have completely fizzled,"" said Oleg Musiy, the previous Minister of Health of Ukraine. Amid the coronavirus threat, state resistance creation mammoth UkrOboronProm, has given its patents on lung ventilation machines, which used to be made by its Kyiv-based Burevesnik Plant some of 12 years ago.

Tumors that have attacked the inward layer (lamina propia) when delegated Stage T1. Ta and T1 tumors can be evacuated by transurethral resection (TUR), and along these lines they are assembled under the heading of Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) for restorative purposes. Likewise included under this heading are level, high-grade tumors that are restricted to the inside layer (mucosa), and named CIS (Tis). Be that as it may, atomic science methods and clinical experience have exhibited the profoundly threatening capability of CIS and T1 sores. Along these lines, the terms NMIBC and shallow BC are imperfect portrayals. The tumor stage and grade ought to be utilized for remedial purposes. The histological reviewing of all bladder urothelial carcinomas was proposed and distributed by the WHO in 2004 (15, 16), this order incorporates the level sores as urothelial hyperplasia, responsive urothelial atypia, dysplasia and CIS. Among Non-Invasive papillary urothelial injuries, 2004 WHO reviewing separates between papillary urothelial neoplasm of low harmful potential (PUNLMP) and poor quality and high-grade urothelial carcinomas. Papillary urothelial neoplasm of low dangerous potential (PUNLMP) is characterized as sores that don't have cytological highlights of threat yet show typical urothelial cells in the papillary setup. In spite of the fact that they have an irrelevant hazard for movement, they are not totally favorable and still tend to repeat. 3) Diagnosis: A. Tolerant history ought to be taken and recorded for exceptionally significant data with a potential association with Bladder Tumor; including hazard elements and history of suspect side effects. B. Indications: Hematuria is the most well-known finding in NMIBC. Ta, T1 tumors don't cause bladder torment, and once in a while present with lower tract indications (LUTS). In patients who do gripe of these indications especially in these with irritative LUTS obstinate to suggestive treatment, CIS may be suspected. C. Physical Examination: the physical assessment doesn't uncover NMIBC however just enormous urothelial tumor attacks the bladder wall and other organs. D. Imaging: an) Intravenous Urography (IVU): Large exophytic tumors perhaps observed as filling surrenders in the bladder b) Computed Tomography (CT): This examination gives more data than IVU does (counting status of lymph hubs and neighboring organs) c) Ultrasonography (US): The US is frequently utilized as the underlying apparatus to evaluate the urinary tract. The transabdominal US grants portrayal of renal mass, location of hydronephrosis, and representation of intraluminal masses in the bladder. It tends to be as precise as IVU for the determination of the upper urinary tract obstacle (17). US is subsequently a helpful apparatus for the location of obstacles in patients with haematuria, be that as it may, it can't reject the nearness of upper tract tumors. CIS can't be determined to have imaging techniques (IVU, CT urography or US). d) Urinary Cytology: Examination of voided pee or bladder-washing examples for peeled cells has high affectability in second rate tumors. Because of loss of cell attachment in the epithelial coating of the bladder in CIS, there is a bigger number of drifting cells in the pee, just as a serious extent of anaplasia. The affectability of cytology for CIS location in 28-100% (18). Cytology is therefore helpful when high-grade harm or CIS is available. Positive voided urinary cytology can show a urothelial tumor anyplace in the urinary tract, from the calyx to the ureters, bladder, and proximal urethra. Negative cytology, be that as it may, doesn't bar the nearness of a tumor in the urinary tract. e) Urinary atomic marker test: Driven by the low affectability of pee cytology, broad lab research has built up various urinary tests for BC location (19-25). Considering the recurrence of cystoscopy for development, markers for the intermittent urothelial disease would be particularly valuable. Microsatellite investigation is the most encouraging of the techniques recorded in the Table underneath (26-28). g) Transurethral resection of Ta, T1 bladder tumors: The objective of the TURB in Ta, T1 BC is to make the right determination and evacuate every single noticeable injury. It is a significant system in the finding and treatment of BC. The procedure of resection relies upon the size of the injury. Little tumors ("
8,Easy Weight Loss,health-fitness," Weight loss is not a one-time activity; it is a lifestyle. If you want to lose weight and keep it off, change your habits of daily routine. There are many choices that you make each day that directly affect your health and cause obesity. Do not push yourself too hard to get in your desired shape. There are diet plans available everywhere which will help you to get slim quickly. But remember, the quicker you lose weight, the sooner you will get it back. So, what is the use of facing hunger, if you are more prone to get to point zero? You do not need to stop eating to lose weight. Our body is like a machine that needs nutrients in order to work properly. If you stop eating those, the body will get deficient in them, and it will cause problems in the future. For instance, if you get deficient in vitamin D, your bones will get weak, and you will feel tired all day long. So, make your diet plan in such a way that it will include all mandatory nutrients to fulfill your body needs if you can consult a dietitian too because they will guide you according to your body type. Examining your body type is essential in losing weight. Different factors are related to losing weight, e.g., your genetics, the response of the body to various foods, health factors, etc. One plan that might work for your friend might not work for you due to different body types. To get your plan ready, you need to experiment with different foods to check which works for you and which does not. After the plan is ready, set short term (to lose 10 pounds of weight in one month or daily calorie intake) and long-term goals (Loss of weight in a year) and stick to them. Keep an eye on yourself to live a healthy lifestyle. Calories, carbs, and fat are responsible for gaining weight if they are taken in excess amounts. It would be best if you keep these in check for a healthy body. Here are a few tips to lose weight gradually. Carbs: Carbohydrates are essential for the body, but the excesses of everything is bad. Have carbs, but in a less amount, the research also proves that a low carb diet is more effective against a low-fat diet. When you eat a meal, it provides you glucose and fat. The glucose enters in blood, and the body releases insulin to keep the sugar levels in check. Insulin has a duty to burn glucose to make fuel (energy) for your body and the carbs, which are not needed; insulin will turn them into fat cells. When you eat carbohydrate-rich food, insulin will burn the glucose and turn the unused carbs into fat, and it will amass in your body and will eventually lead to weight gain. Because now you need more energy to burn those carbs, now the vicious cycle starts where you carve more carbs to burn the existing one. So, reducing the amount of carb intake will reduce food craving, sugar levels, and lower insulin production in the body, which leads to weight loss because now the body will not be having a lot of glucose to fulfill its energy need. Therefore it will turn to other sources of energy. Low carb food includes eggs, fish, green leafy vegetables, etc. Calories Calories are a primary source of energy for your body. Eating fewer calories is considered as a rapid way to reduce weight gain. Why?  Because the secondary source of energy is fat. When you consume fewer calories, your body will not function smoothly. So, to fulfill the need for energy, the human body will turn to the secondary source and burn the hoarded fat in the body. Hence the less calorie intake will lead to gradual weight loss. And if you sustain the routine at least for a year or two, you will be able to keep the weight off. To reduce the number of calories you are eating, first, you need to stop eating mindlessly, i.e., when you are bored, stressed, or watching a movie. Then when you have a meal of the day, try to eat vegetables and fruits with fewer calories, e.g., broccoli, carrots, etc. Fats Markets are filled with low-fat products to attract customers, but if you look closely, they are packed with sugar and carbs, which will make you gain weight again in the form of fat due to the role of insulin. So be mindful while buying low-fat products. But you cannot completely wipe out the fat intake in your body. You need to take good fats because they will help you keep your weight in check, fight mood swings, and fatigue. Try to get a meal having low carb and low fat both to keep your weight in check. Healthy fats can be taken from olive oil, avocado, coconut, etc. Be Careful with Daily Routine Many people think skipping breakfast would help them reduce weight gain. But the reality is opposite people who skip breakfast are likely to gain more weight because they will feel hungrier after some time and end up eating more than necessary. Have your breakfast, but quit eating white food, for instance, white bread. Try to have some protein in the morning, e.g., eggs. If you cannot eat eggs, replace them with a good protein or fiber, i.e., a bowl of whole-grain cereal with fruits could also work wonders. Fiber and protein will not make you feel hungry, and you will eat fewer calories in a day. If you need to have a hot drink in the morning, then preferably use coffee without milk and sugar or green tea. Try to add some kind of exercise in your daily routine. Do not go for hard workouts initially; you will only hurt your body. Start with something light, e.g., 10-20 mins of walking. If you get bored while walking or doing exercise, try to play some sport like tennis so you could have fun while losing weight. At night give up mindless snacking and go to bed early. To lose weight, you need to get good sleep at night. Research shows that getting a good sleep at night could help you lose weight. How sleeping helps you to lose weight? Well, poor quality of sleep makes metabolism less effective. Metabolism will slow down the process of converting calories into energy, which eventually will store as fat. Also, lousy sleep cause increased production of insulin, which again increases the amount of fat storage in your body. So, have a good breakfast, eat mindfully, exercise, and sleep enough to wake up refreshed to start your day."
9,Know Your Curls - What Should I Be Using?,health-fitness," Hey, There Curly Girls! So you’ve decided it's time to forgo the flat iron and embrace your curls? Welcome to the Curly Girl community! This community is beautiful, broad, and expansive! It embraces a wide range of curls, textures, and waves, which is half the fun and all the challenge. As a hairdresser, I know that finding the place to start when figuring out which products and methods work for your curls can be overwhelming... Stop stressing, I’ve done the work for you! The Curly Girl range by Pump Haircare follows the Curly Girl Method introduced by Lorraine Massey in the early 2000’s. This method embraces and enhances natural curls, by boycotting sulphates and silicones, limiting shampoo and heat, and lathering on the moisture. While some rules apply to all curly girls, there is still so much variety when it comes to damage control, and styling preferences! So let’s talk hair type. For many of us, the first step we take is determining what our “hair type” is. We turn to charts that display curl patterns and coil sizes. Am I a 2b? 3c? 4a? Maybe you’re all of the above! While curl patterns can help determine things like cut and shape, when it comes to product selection and application method, there is a far more important thing to consider. One word: POROSITY. Determining hair care methods by hair porosity is the KEY to soft, strong, silky curls, and is far better indicator than curl pattern! Your porosity refers to how open or closed the cuticles on your hair strands are, which measures how well your hair absorbs and retains moisture, and can range from low to high. If you have no clue what I'm talking about and aren't sure what your hair porosity might be, I've got you! Determine your hair porosity by this 5-minute test! Grab a strand of shedding hair from your comb Put it in a glass of water and leave for 2 minutes RESULTS: If your hair floats on the top of the water, you have low porosity hair that struggles to absorb moisture. If your hair sinks slowly or sits mid-glass, you have medium porosity hair, which means your hair easily absorbs and retains moisture, (in other words you're a lucky b*tch!) And if it sinks to the bottom, you have high porosity hair that quickly absorbs moisture, but loses it just as fast. Once you have determined your hair porosity, the rest is simple! I have created products containing organic ingredients that are great for all hair types, but here is the application and method that will maximise those ingredients for YOU. Low Porosity Girls: To our low porosity girls, we got you. Your hair has a hard time absorbing moisture, but retains it like a pro! If you under moisturise your hair will be brittle, and if you over-moisturise, hello build up! Here is what I recommend for you! Like all curly girls, using too much shampoo is never the call!

Pump's Curl and Grow Mask is a hydrating, curl enhancing, growth mask, that also acts as a co-wash! You can rinse this mask out without any shampoo, so its cleanses and works it's magic all in one. When it comes to styling, low-po girls should move towards moisture milks and lightweight, hydrating styling products. Heavy creams and butters will build up in your hair so fast, requiring more washes in your week! Pump Soft Curl Gel is your dream product. It’s aloe vera based, all natural, curl hydrating and defining, with no alcohols, no stick, no crunch, no problems! Finding a light oil blend is like a pot of gold for a low porosity girl! Your hair needs the hydration oils provide, but can be weighed down by so easily! Pump Miracle Curl Oil, made from a light oil blend, absorbs and nourishes your curls, without sitting on top and weighing them down. Lastly, everyone needs a little something, on their day 2 curls!

Medium Porosity Girls: You’re in luck. Medium Porosity hair has no problems in the moisture department, so any of our products work for you! Your only concern should be maintenance! Keep up your precious medium porosity strands by conditioning, moisturising, and following the Curly Girl Method. Avoid excessive heat styling, uncertified curly girl friendly products and live your best life! High Porosity Girls: So your hair absorbs moisture like crazy, but loses it halfway through the day? Or maybe you experience dryness, frizziness, or (God forbid) brittle hair, in high temperatures and humid climates! High porosity hair has very open cuticles, allowing moisture to enter and exit all too well. Your hair doesn't struggle with getting the moisture in, but keeping the moisture locked! Here are my recommendations for you! CO-FREAKING-WASH! Co-washing is everything, especially for high porosity girls! Co-washing is forgoing shampoo every second wash minimum, and cleansing with a conditioner instead! Pump Curl and Grow Mask is a co-wash DREAM!

This product is packed with ingredients like argan oil and shea butter, to hydrate, style, and protect your curls at the same time! Hello protein!

10,WHAT IS HYALURONIC ACID ?,health-fitness," Hyaluronic acid is the way to in a split second plumping almost negligible differences and making skin look glowy. It tends to be found in everything from serums to sheet veils and even injectables—yet what precisely right? We requested that dermatologists give us the 4-1-1 on hyaluronic corrosive, including the correct way fuse it into your healthy skin scheme. Hyaluronic corrosive abbreviated as (HA) is a sugar found normally in our skin that holds water and helps keep it hydrated and full. Hyaluronic acid inside our bodies holds a thousand times its weight in water to not just hold such dampness in our skin and joints, yet in addition, keep such dampness from vanishing into the air. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HYALURONIC ACID  IN OUR BODY? Humectants are utilized A LOT in skincare. Think about a humectant like a wipe; it will keep on attracting and clutch dampness after it is gathered. They permit hydrogen holding and pull in water. Instances of humectants in skincare items incorporate fixings like glycerin, sorbitol (sugar liquor), hexylene and butylene glycol, and obviously, hyaluronic corrosive. Our skin's fundamental capacity is to secure our bodies. Clearly, our skin ensures our inside organs, muscles, bones, and so forth from the outside world. In any case, our skin additionally shields the body from destructive poisons that barrage us every day. The top layer of the skin (the epidermis) takes the brunt of outside harm (poisons). As we age, the lipid boundary (unsaturated fats that trap in water and forestall aggravations entering the skin) in the epidermis eases back down. Everything from UV beams to ecological contamination, to the way of life decisions (like smoking) cause harm. This harm brings about progressively scarce differences and wrinkles, dim spots, and drier skin. Nobody needs droopy skin. Ever. As we age, the elastin in the skin separates, and skin loses its snap or bounceback. A fast stunt to check your elastin (the bounceback) is to squeeze the skin on the head of your hand. On the off chance that it snaps back rapidly, you despite everything have a great deal of elastin. As you age, the skin won't ricochet back as fast. Next time you visit your mom or grandma, give the test a shot them (yet don't disclose to them why… there's truly no need, it can't be fixed. In the event that skin is noticeably scarred from skin break out, the hyaluronic corrosive won't fill in those scars. The skin around the eye zone is one of the first to show scarcely discernible differences and wrinkles. Utilizing an eye cream twice day by day will assist keep with cleaning graceful and hydrated, and keep new lines from framing. However, hyaluronic acid enhancements can be securely taken by the vast majority and give numerous medical advantages. It is notable for its skin benefits, particularly lightening dry skin, lessening the presence of barely recognizable differences and wrinkles, and accelerating wound mending. It can likewise help diminish joint agony in individuals with osteoarthritis. Other striking applications incorporate hyaluronic acid eye drops to alleviate dry eye and embeddings hyaluronic corrosive legitimately into the bladder by means of a catheter to decrease torment. By and large, hyaluronic corrosive is an advantageous enhancement for an assortment of conditions, particularly those identified with skin and joint wellbeing."
11,Excision of Mucocele Using Dental DIODE LASER,health-fitness," Introduction- Mucoceles are known as “mucus filled cavities” usually present in the oral cavity, lacrimal sac, and paranasal sinuses. Preoperative View (Courtesy – Dr. Sana Farista) Preoperative View (Courtesy – Dr. Sana Farista) Etiology - Mucus extravasation and mucus retention are the two most frequently occurring primary mechanical obstructive diseases of salivary glands. Formation of mucus extravasation cyst is mainly due to mechanical trauma causing rupture of ductal system of salivary gland and mucin spills into adjacent soft tissues. Mucus retention cyst is formed markedly by obstruction of salivary ductal walls causing dilatation of ducts without spillage of mucin. Treatment - Although mucoceles may occur literally anywhere in the oral cavity, the most common sites of occurrence are the lower lip. These lesions are soft, fluctuant and closer to the surface. They have a slightly bluish tinge as the mucin shine through. Mucoceles are benign lesions and do not necessarily warrant removal unless their size causes hindrance or they look unaesthetic. There are various treatment aspects available for the management of mucocele like scalpel incision, complete surgical excision, marsupialization, micromarsupialization, intralesional injections of corticosteroids, cryosurgery, laser ablation, sclerosing agent, and electrocautery methods. The conventional treatment includes removal by a surgical excision wherein the entire mucoceles is removed in toto along with any accompanying minor salivary glands to minimize recurrence. One of the more popular methods for mucocele excision is via a diode laser. The main advantages of soft tissue laser applications are minimal intraoperative bleeding and swelling, minimum postoperative pain, very less surgical time, without any need of suturing after excision because of natural wound dressing due to denatured proteins. After informed consent, the lesion is infiltrated with local anesthesia, the protective eye wears are worn and then the lesion is excised using soft tissue diode laser with either wavelength of 810nm/980 nm in contact mode or with 450nm wavelength in noncontact or slight contact mode. After the procedure, postoperative instructions are given and analgesic is prescribed on SOS basis. Also, care should be taken to get rid off the cause (sharp cusps or fractured tooth if any) along with the excision to make the treatment outcome more predictive. Here low level laser therapy can also be done over the exposed wound area using 660nm (red light) in noncontact mode to assist in faster healing and to manage postoperative pain. According to a study by Carlo Fornaini et al 2016, blue light dental lasers provide minimal discomfort to patients and complete healing occurs within 4-5 days with little traces of carbonization in the histopathological investigation. The use of diode lasers in general have been considered to be an effective and safe alternate to the use of scalpel, another study by M Paglia et al 2015 concluded that dental diode lasers is also seen to minimize relapse of mucocoeles in pediatric patients. Lesion marked with Diode laser (Courtesy – Dr. Sana Farista) Lesion marked with Diode laser (Courtesy – Dr. Sana Farista) Immediate Postoperative View (Courtesy – Dr. Sana Farista) Immediate Postoperative View (Courtesy – Dr. Sana Farista) Conclusion - Diode dental lasers can be a useful alternative to larger surgical lasers such Erbium and CO2 lasers. Their small size and low cost are distinct advantages. They sterilize the working area, as well as provide coagulation and hemostasis during excisions. Laser application makes it possible to reduce apprehension and fear especially in pediatric and geriatric patients. References – Fornaini C et al. 450nm diode laser: A new help in oral surgery.

Consuming an adequate amount of good fats is very significant with respect to sustaining proper belly fat loss and building lean muscle.  The right well-balanced fatty foods in your diet plan will assist in maintaining control over your cravings Some of the best sources of fats are the yolk from eggs (preferably organic), nuts, extra virgin olive oil, avocados, coconut oil (great source of wholesome saturated fats), and meats that are naturally grass fed. Munch on a small number of uncooked nuts (pecans, walnuts, and almonds are fantastic healthy selections) do this several times a day approximately thirty minutes before you eat a big meal. This approach can easily help to slow down your hunger and provide your body some healthy proteins, soluble fibre, and healthy fats.

Natural sugars found in fresh fruits as well as most types of berries (blueberries, blackberries etc.) tend to be okay due to the fact that the fibre in fruits slow down blood sugar response in the body. Remember that fruit juices should be avoided because they are primarily sugar and fruits lose the fibre when they are turned into juice. Individuals will begin to reduce belly fat when they reduce their consumption of grains such as cereals, bagels, pasta, etc You should concentrate on taking in more natural carbohydrates such as fruit and vegetables and reduce your intake of grains.

14,Great Guide To Having A Healthy Body,health-fitness," Some people are positive that nutrition is a niche topic and thus, they seek out professional nutritionists for their information. This can be a waste. You don't have to go this route. Nutrition information is everywhere, including in this article via some great tips. Check it out and learn about nutrition. Consume 600-900 mg of garlic, about 1 fresh clove, daily to help lower your cholesterol. There have been many studies where people have used garlic for health reasons. These studies have proven garlic is extremely beneficial in helping to lower total cholesterol, and in particular, LDL, the bad cholesterol and triglycerides. When it comes to nutrition, we all seem to have trouble doing it properly. Our problem areas vary though and sometimes, we need help identifying these problems. Look at your eating habits and decide which one you pick. Is it the salad or the cheeseburger? The soda or bottled water? The healthy choices are obvious and if you don't pick them as often as you should, that may be your problem. Oatmeal for business is what you need to begin your day. When you eat oatmeal in the morning it will keep you full. Avoid using too many condiments if you're trying to eat a healthier diet. Dips, sauces, spreads and dressings may jazz up a meal and taste delicious, but they are often full of fat, salt and calories. Try cutting back on how much dressing you put on your salad and how much mayonnaise you use on your sandwich. Celebrities like Luke Evans also follow the same tips. To maintain good nutrition it is important to avoid trans-fats. Trans-fats damage the cardiovascular system. Labels can lie about the presence of trans-fats. Look for hydrogenated oils in the ingredients. Hydrogenated soybean oil is a common trans-fat. Foods can claim they do not contain trans-fat even when they do. Companies set the serving size so they can round the number of trans-fats down to zero, but if you eat the whole bag of chips you have still consumed plenty of harmful trans-fats. Be careful, vigilant, and check the ingredients closely. Smoothies make a tasty and healthy treat. If you'd like to amplify the healthy effects of your next smoothie, give this tip a try. A little bit of omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in flax-seed oil, is a perfect addition to a smoothie or protein shake. This should also improve the flavour of your beverage and boost your immune system. You might buy ground turkey thinking that it's lower fat, and therefore better for you nutritionally. But you should always read the labels, and ground turkey is no exception. Ground turkey contains both white and dark meat, the latter being high in fat. And ground turkey, though certainly leaner than ground hamburger, is actually higher in fat than ground sirloin. As you can probably deduce from having read the article and the tips within, it doesn't take a schooled professional to figure out nutrition. If you can focus on the tips you've read here and practise healthy eating, you should have no problem receiving all the nutrition you need to remain strong, vibrant and healthy. "
15,Natural Diet Pills that Induce Weight Loss,health-fitness," Recent studies have shown that more people are getting overweight every year. This happens not only to adults but even to kids who have just started in school.  A lot of factors cause this to happen such as genetics, overeating, the type of food taken into the body and as people age, the metabolism slows down making it harder than before to burn the food that was just consumed. There are many ways to solve this problem. Some have decided to undergo surgery, while others have decided to change the dietary intake and exercise. Since this takes time and most people can’t wait to get rid of the extra weight, these people have decided to take the fastest way out which is through the use of weight loss diet pills. In the 1950’s until the late 90’s, doctors prescribed drugs for weight loss. The drug works by increasing the serotonin levels in the brain that makes the brain believe that the stomach is already full and thus, increases the person’s metabolic rate.

17,Do you sabotage your fitness resolutions every year? Here’s what to do instead,health-fitness," How to keep your focus and stay on track Are you one of the millions of people who resolve to start working out on January 1? While you’re probably excited to get back into the gym after indulging in more than a few delicious holiday treats, it can also be difficult to get back into a workout routine after weeks or months away from the gym. Turn your New Year’s resolution into a goal you work towards all year long by following these tips to avoid injury and ease back into a gym routine: Make new year fitness goals long-term. One of the biggest ways to actually keep your New Year’s resolution in 2018 is to set specific long-term goals. For example, you might say “Right now, I can do 15 push-ups. In six months, I’m going to be able to do 30,” instead of simply saying “I’m going to work out more in 2018.” Once you reach your initial goal, set another. And then another. Setting specific future goals helps you ease back into working out and keeps your New Year’s resolution because you’ll continue moving forward. See the big picture. A lot of people make a New Year’s resolution to work out thinking they’ll see results overnight. But working out is a process, and it’s important to stay positive when you don’t see immediate results after just a few days back in the gym. When you get discouraged, take a deep breath and think about all you’ve achieved since you started working out again. Have you shaved a few seconds off your run time? Benched five extra pounds? It may not sound like much to you now, but those small victories add up to big gains in the long-term. Take it slow (but not too slow). One of the biggest mistakes most people make when easing back into working out is going too hard, too fast. If you’ve been out of the gym for a while, start with shorter workouts several times a week, and incorporate stretch sessions before and after each workout. On the other hand, don’t cheat yourself out of a challenge. It can be tempting to stay in your workout comfort zone. Instead, increase the duration and intensity of your workouts over time to ensure you stay healthy and strong. Let go of stress and enjoy workouts. It can be overwhelming to take in all the fitness advice you’re bombarded with everyday. Just let go of all the magazine workout tips, gym advice from friends, and exercise infomercials you’ve accumulated. As you ease back into working out, try to empty your mind, and instead take time to strengthen the bond between mind and body. One great way to do this is to meditate briefly before a workout session. When your mind and body are aligned, you’ll be more focused on your workout, and more likely to keep that New Year’s resolution all year long. Work out with a personal trainer.

20,Hope in the Horizon in the Fight against coronavirus,health-fitness," Despite all the negativity in the press and the fear and pandemonium caused by the coronavirus, there is still hope on the horizon. Medical experts have been working round the clock to come up with a vaccine that would help stop the virus in its track. Some cheering news was announced on the 18th of May when a US biotech company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts announced a positive result in a group, eight volunteers, in their coronavirus vaccine trial. The United States firm had confirmed in a press release that its COVID-19 vaccine triggered an immune response in its 8 volunteers. It is however still too early to go into mass production as more tests need to be carried out. The World Health Organization (WHO) has outsourced the production of a vaccine for the coronavirus pandemic to several pharmaceutical companies. It is a race against time. A race that scientists are determined to win. The UK government on their part is bidding to combat the virus by supporting Oxford Group who are partnering with drug manufacturing company AstraZeneca to make 30 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines for the UK. Hopefully, there would be a breakthrough in the next few months with regards to the COVID-19 vaccine. Words of Hope On Sunday the 5th of April in a rare address to the nation, Queen Elizabeth II, who turned 94 last month sent a message of hope to the nation. “We will succeed in the fight”, was the general theme of her message. Three key points to pick out from her message highlights the fact there is hope even in the midst of the storm caused by coronavirus pandemic Challenging times: Indeed, these are challenging times. A lot of people have lost loved ones. A lot of people have lost jobs. People's lives have been disrupted. Children have been told to stay at home and their academics have been disrupted. But in these challenging times, we will come out stronger. Dreams have been truncated. It sounds so gloomy like the media wants us to believe, but we must be relentless. We must never allow these dark clouds to overshadow our beautiful dreams. Our paths may not be the easiest. The journey may not be the smoothest. The journey may even seem long and unending. Even the bravest may get scared of striving forward because they’ve never traveled through the treacherous paths before. But we must keep praying for the courage to move on and never to look back in fear and regret. We’ll surely bounce back from these difficult moments and share happy moments again. If we remain united and resolute, we will overcome the virus The is power in unity, and in these difficult moments, it is important we stand together as one. As a people, no matter our race, background, religion, or even status, we must all rally round and stand together as one in this fight. Those at the frontline have sacrificed their lives for others. We must also stand and help one another where possible. A little message sent. A phone call made. They make a world of difference to so many going through some form of difficulty in these trying times. Be strong The true measure of strength is not usually seen when we are in comfort but moments of great discomfort. In moments when we are passing through huge difficulty, our true character and strength are tested. Even in these pandemics, we must choose to remain strong. One of the fallouts from the catastrophic novel virus is the fear it leaves behind in its trails. People are scared they may get infected. Those who show little symptoms are scared of dying. The fear for the family getting infected. The fear for our spouse out there in the frontline. The fear of the virus is tormenting lives and leaving people helpless. But we must be strong and refuse to cave in to fear. Self-discipline Let's keep doing what we told to do. Keep washing your hands before and after touching food items. Keep using soap and water at intervals. Always using hand sanitizers where soap and water aren’t available. Stay at home except for essential travels. Avoid going to places where there are people around. Self-discipline is one of the key factors that would help us to go through these dark moments unscathed. We will succeed and success will belong to every one of us. It is a collective fight. A battle that we would surely win. It may take a while, but surely, we would triumph at the end of the day. Better days are coming The days ahead may appear bleak to some, but to those who have a positive mindset, the coming days will bring better moments. The road may be rough, but the destination will be beautiful. I want to tow the sentiments of Zig Ziglar who said and I quote: “Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations. The best is yet to come."" The peak of the pandemic has been reached. The death rate is slowing down in almost all countries affected. Things will get better in days to come if we hold on and never get discouraged."

3,Rheumatoid Arthritis and Surgery. Should You Do It?,health-fitness," Approximately 1.5 million people in the U.S. suffer from joint pain, swelling, and stiffness that accompanies rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It can make everyday life challenging at best, and life crippling at worst. Left untreated, this chronic autoimmune condition can cause bone erosion and joint deformities in the hands and wrists that impairs normal function of the knees, ankles, elbows, hips, and shoulders, as well. If you are considering surgery to alleviate discomfort, be sure to make an appointment with a trusted rheumatoid arthritis doctor near Temecula first, and read this article before making the next move. What is joint replacement? Joint replacement, or replacement arthroplasty, is a procedure of orthopedic surgery in which an arthritic or dysfunctional joint  surface is replaced with an orthopedic prosthesis. During surgery, parts of an arthritic or damaged joint are removed and replaced with a metal, plastic or ceramic device called a prosthesis. The prosthesis is designed to replicate the movement of a normal, healthy joint. Hip and knee replacements are the most commonly performed joint replacements, but the ankle, wrist, shoulder, and elbow can also be treated. Is joint replacement the new normal? More than 2 out of every 100 Americans now have an artificial joint, doctors are reporting, and about a million joint replacement surgeries are performed in the U.S. each year. Knee replacement surgeries, for example, have more than tripled in the 45-to-64 age group over the last decade and nearly half of hip replacements now are in people under 65, federal numbers show. RA doctors believe the boom is due to the fact that people are aware that the surgeries work and so are less willing to put up with painful joints. Any patient with severe RA is always on the lookout for ways to regain their quality of life and enjoy the freedoms a healthy body provides. In the past, it was commonly thought that people with RA fared worse after joint replacement compared with other patients with osteoarthritis. The tide is changing on this belief, as joint replacement surgery has now been shown to be comparable to those seen in people with osteoarthritis. This is great news for those who suffer with RA and have exhausted other treatments. Surgery is likely to help. Many physical therapists have agreed that after RA patients receive their replacement surgery, the recovery time is very fast. Many factors may contribute to this. Who are the best candidates for surgery? Not everyone suffering from RA-related joint damage is a good candidate for surgery. Doctors take into account many factors and look at the combination of the patient's pain and loss of function, as well as X-ray evidence of advanced joint damage. Patients are also required to undergo treatment from an RA doctor prior, as surgery is not for people who haven't first tried exercise, medicines and weight loss. The best candidates are patients with severe pain that limits their movement and where advanced X-ray damage is detected. If the pain seems out of proportion to the X-ray findings, it might indicate that the patient would benefit more from an adjustment of their medications. The healthier, the better It's important to look at a patient as a whole person and not just as a hip or knee. Health issues that are examined closely prior to a doctor’s approval include obesity, blood pressure, diabetes, and that there are no unaddressed cardiovascular symptoms, such as chest pain or shortness of breath at rest. Patients who've lost a lot of muscle due to immobility don't get as much function back, so people who depend on wheelchairs may experience long and painful recovery time. Resilience and a patient’s mental state of mind can also be a determining factor. Depressed patients don't fare as well after surgery so it needs to be treated first. Smoking, alcohol consumption, and drug use can also weigh in."
4,Do You Know What Causes Rheumatoid Arthritis?,health-fitness," Understanding rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and what causes it, is important for you to learn about if you want to avoid developing it. If you have been diagnosed with it, or suspect you have it, learning all you can is an important first step to reducing or eliminating the discomfort associated with RA. For some, RA is a long-term, progressive, and disabling autoimmune disease that causes inflammation, swelling, and pain in and around the joints and other body organs. It occurs when a person’s immune system mistakes the body’s healthy tissues for foreign invaders. As the immune system responds, inflammation  occurs in the target tissue or organ. The good news is, there are many treatments available from trusted rheumatoid doctors located in and around Lake Elsinore that can prescribe medications and other treatments that can improve symptoms dramatically. First symptoms of RA Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect smaller joints first — particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet. As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body. In the early stages, people with RA may not see redness or swelling in the joints, but they may experience tenderness and pain. These symptoms are clues to RA: •	Joint pain, tenderness, swelling or stiffness that lasts for six weeks or longer. •	Morning stiffness that lasts for 30 minutes or longer. •	More than one joint is affected. •	Small joints (wrists, certain joints in the hands and feet) are typically affected first. •	The same joints on both sides of the body are affected. About 40 percent of the people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect many non-joint structures, including skin, eyes, lungs, heart, kidneys, salivary glands and more. Who are most likely to be diagnosed Doctors don't know the exact reason why some people end up with RA, although a genetic component appears to be likely. While your genes don't actually cause rheumatoid arthritis, they can make you more susceptible to environmental factors — such as infection with certain viruses and bacteria — that may trigger the disease. Some researchers believe it could also be linked to physical or emotional stress or some other external factor. In a healthy person, the immune system fights viruses and bacteria. In a less healthy person, the immune system mistakes the body’s cells for foreign invaders and releases inflammatory chemicals that attack. In the case of RA, the chemicals attack the synovium - the tissue lining around a joint that produces a fluid to help the joint move smoothly. The inflamed synovium gets thicker and makes the joint area feel painful and tender, look red and swollen and moving the joint may be difficult. Researchers aren’t sure why some people develop RA. They think that these individuals have certain genes that are activated by a trigger in the environment, like a virus or bacteria, or physical or emotional stress or some other external factor. Risk factors Even though doctors don’t know exactly what causes this disease, they do know some things that increase your risk of being diagnosed: •	Age: RA can affect you at any age, but it’s most common between 40 and 60. •	Dental health: New research shows a link between RA and periodontal (gum) disease. •	Family history: If someone in your family has it, you may be more likely to get it. •	Environment: A toxic chemical or infection in your environment can up your odds. •	Gender: RA is more common in women than men. It’s more likely in women who've never been pregnant and those who've recently given birth. •	Obesity: Extra weight, especially if you’re under 55. •	Smoking. If your genes already make you more likely to get RA, lighting up can raise your odds even higher. And if you do get the disease, smoking can make it worse. If you think you might have symptoms of RA, be sure to contact a rheumatoid arthritis doctor as soon as possible. The longer you wait the more severe the symptoms become."
5,Two Days A Week Strength Training,health-fitness," 2 Days a Week Strength Training Training twice a week is something I've tried several times and always had success with it. Lots of people have an all or nothing attitude to training. Many people either stop training because they are busy and believe they have to spend loads of time in the gym to achieve any results. They would be better off doing two days consistently as everyone can get to the gym for two sessions a week if it's a priority for them. In my first year, I started strength training I only trained twice a week for and had good results. After that year, I could deadlift 180kg easily and gained 12kg in body weight. I have since had several short, but successful spells with twice a week training. I also have a few clients who only train twice a week, and they have all been making good progress Who could this be a good option for? Someone with a busy schedule and struggles to make it to the gym more often. # Someone who simply don't want to go to the gym more often, but wants to be in shape. For people who play sports and have other training commitments that are their priority, and only strength train to help improve their performance in their sport, and so can't spend an excessive amount of time lifting weights. Someone who recovery issues. People who have not been able to stick to a routine. For a short time when life is crazy. The key to making progress is doing this consistently over a long period of time. No matter how busy life is I can always train two days a week and make progress. I can then train I'm not writing this article expecting people to change their routine if they're able to do four times a week and are making progress. This is a good option for How did I set up my training? There were two ways my assistance work. Option 1 A - Squat - Bench press - Lower assistance exercises B - Deadlift - Bench press - Upper body assistance exercises Option 2 A - Squat - Bench press - 3/4 Assistance exercises B - Deadlift - Overhead press - 3/4 Assistance exercises You can use different main exercises. I sometimes used the trap bar deadlift, overhead press, and dips. Main work progression I would pick a rep range for each exercise such as 10-5 reps. Work up to a top set of 10. Every session you'll add weight until you can only do 5 good reps. You'll then start the cycle again with a weight you can do 8 reps with. This should be more weight than you used at the start of the last cycle. I do use other rep ranges as well such as 14-8 reps, 12-8 reps, 10-6,12-3 reps etc An example of what it might look like Week 1 100kg x 10 Week 2 102.5kg x 10 Week 3 105kg x 10 Week 4 107.5g x 9 Week 5 110kg x 8 Week 6 112.5kg x 8 Week 7 115kg x 8 Week 8 117.5 x 7 Week 9 120kg x 6 Week 10 122.5kg x 6 Week 11 125kg x 5 Week 12 110kg x 10 ( The start of a new cycle) With the squat and deadlift you'll do 2-4 back off sets after the top set with 80% of the weight you used for the top set and for the same amount of reps. These sets shouldn't be to the limit, and the bar speed should be fast for every rep. So it could look like this 200kg x 9 160kg 3 x 9 Personally, I progress well without doing any back off sets, but some people need more volume. With the bench press, overhead press, and dips (if used as one of the main movements) you'll take 90% of the top sets and do 2-4 back off sets for the same amount of reps as the top set. So it would look like this 100kg x 12 90kg 3 x 12 Assistance exercises would be done for 2-5 sets of 8-15 reps. I would do 3 or 4 assistance exercises a workout. Rest periods would be kept fairly short and often done as supersets so the workout didn't take too long. Another way I like to do assistance exercises is the 350 method I got from Paul Carter. With this method, you do 3 sets of as many reps as you can with 2 minutes rest in between. The aim is to get 50 reps over the 3 sets. Once you manage to get 50 reps you can add weight the next time. 100kg x 17 Rest 2 minutes 100kg x 13 Rest 2 minutes 100kg x 8 That gives me 38 reps, so I would keep the same weight until I got it to 50 reps in total. Upper body assistance exercises Upper back work (chin-ups, pull up, machine row seal row, t-bar row, dumbbell row, lat pull down etc) Dips Close grip bench press -Dumbbell bench press Curls Lower body assistance exercises Squat variation Glute ham raise Romanian deadlift Leg press Core work (rollouts, side bends, hyperextensions etc) Option 2 assistance exercises Normally the assistance exercises would be 2 upper body pulling exercises 1 upper body pushing exercise 1 lower body exercise What could a training week strength training week look like? For option 1, it would like this, Workout A (squat, bench press and lower body work) Squats 20kg x 10, 60kg x 8, 80kgx 5, 100kg x 5, 120kg x 5, 140kg x 5 170kg x 8 135kg x 3 x 9 Bench press 20kg x 10, 40kg x 5, 60kg x 5, 80kg x 5, 100kg x 8 90kg 3 x 8 85kg x 10 RDL - 350 method Glute ham raise - 3 x 12 Wheel rollouts - 3 sets Face pulls x 200 Done between sets of other exercises Workout B (trap bar deadlift and press and upper body workout) Trap bar deadlift (our trap bar weighs 32kg) 72kg x 10, 92kg x 5, 112kg x 5, 142kg x 5, 162kg x 3, 182kg x 3, 202kg x 1 212kg x 8 172kg x 2 x 8 Press 20kg x 10, 30kg x 5, 40kg x 5, 50kg x 5, 65 x 8 60kg x 9 55kg x 4 x 9 Close grip bench press- 3 x 12 Seal row 6 x 15 Lat pull down 3 x 12 Curls - Rest pause set 3 sets with 15 seconds rest between sets Face pulls x 200 done between sets of other exercises For option 2 it would look like this. Workout A (squat, bench press and assistance) Squats 20kg x 10, 60kg x 8, 80kgx 5, 100kg x 5, 120kg x 5, 140kg x 5 170kg x 8 135kg x 3 x 9 Bench press 20kg x 10, 40kg x 5, 60kg x 5, 80kg x 5, 100 x 8 90kg 4 x 8 Dips 4 x 12 Chin ups 4 x 10 Seal rows 4 x 10 Glute ham raise 4 sets Workout B (trap bar deadlift and press) Trap bar deadlift (our trap bar weighs 32kg) 72kg x 10, 92kg x 5, 112kg x 5, 142kg x 5, 162kg x 3, 182kg x 3, 202kg x 1 212kg x 8 172kg x 2 x 8 Press 20kg x 10, 30kg x 5, 40kg x 5, 50kg x 5, 65kg x 8 60kg x 9 55kg x 4 x 9 Romanian deadlift 4 x 10 Close grip bench press 4 x 10 Dumbbell row 4 x 12 Lat pull down 4 x 15 What were the benefits of twice a week training? The main one was that fitting in the workouts into my life while I had a lot going on was very easy. I tried to keep the same training days that were spread out evenly (Sunday and Wednesday), but with only having two workouts to fit in I could be flexible without it causing any problems. It does take away the excuse of not having time to train as everyone can find the time for two sessions a week. I found my motivation went up. I was looking forward to each workout and excited about training and that I would try and get a PR. I was itching to get into the gym and made training fun again. I haven't had a bad workout since I started training twice a week as I always feel recovered, fresh and excited about training when I start the workout. If you're going through a stressful time, or not getting much sleep you are likely to find this easier to recover from than if you were training 4+times a week. My joints felt great doing this after doing this. if strength and building muscle isn't your main priority it can give you more time to do cardio and mobility work. I did more much-needed mobility work at home while watching TV as I had a little more spare time. Jim Wendler has a template in his books called 2x2x2. With this, you do two strength workouts, two mobility workouts and two conditioning/cardio workouts. This can be a well-balanced way for you to train. What are the main negatives of just training twice a week? There is only so much you can do in just two workouts. You can't spend as much time working on weak points and it can be hard to get a lot of volume in The workouts have to be really hard, and I had to push close to failure a lot, and I had to cram so much into the sessions. Mentally this was tough. One of the most frustrating things about being a personal trainer is seeing people throw all their hard work away by stopping training completely, or by taking large breaks so they end up just working to regain what they had done before. I would rather they trained twice a week consistently for a long time, than four times a week and stop once life gets busy. Or just keep two days a week as a short term option for when life gets crazy. You might surprise yourself with what you can achieve while doing so little. It' certainly much better than giving up and then having to start from scratch."
6,5 Tips That Can Help You Undergo a Pelvic Exam Without Stress,health-fitness," Most women all over the world are not fond of gynecological check-ups especially when it comes to a pelvic examination. However, such a procedure is essential if you want to be aware of the condition of your reproductive organs. In most cases, it is impossible to diagnose a medical condition without additional tests and visual examinations. You should also understand that you ney need to undergo an ultrasound or Pap-smear if the gynecologist will suspect certain diseases. Even if you understand the importance of the gynecological check-up, you may still experience fear and embarrassment before the first pelvic exam. It is quite understandable since you should show your intimate body parts to an unknown doctor. In order to help you cope with your fear, we gathered these five tips that can help you undergo a pelvic exam without stress. Many young women are afraid to visit a gynecologist because they think about un unpleasant vaginal odor or discharge. However, you should understand that gynecologists meet a lot of women with different issues every day. Moreover, if the smell or discharge is the problem that makes you visit the doctor, it is recommended to avoid the hygienic procedures right before the check-up. If your pelvic exam is not devoted to the health issues, it is better to take a shower before the procedure. If there is no possibility to maintain personal hygiene in a proper way, you can use special wet wipes that are designed for intimate hygiene. If you feel nervous before the gynecological visit, you can make a list of complaints you want to discuss with the doctor. This will help you avoid a stressful situation in which you can simply forget why you made an appointment with the doctor. Take a list of paper and write down all the symptoms you experience. Don’t forget to take this list to the gynecologist in order not to miss some important issues. It may be quite difficult to undress in front of an unknown person (even in front of a doctor). In this case, you can make the first appointment with the gynecologist in order to get acquainted and discuss some issues that bother you. Such a conversation will help you to feel more comfortable during the next gynecological check-up. Moreover, this consultation can help a doctor to preliminarily evaluate your condition and ask you to perform certain additional tests. Anyway, this visit will make you feel more confident and less stressed in the future. In most cases, the family history of the disease can make your gynecologist make a more precise diagnosis. The reality is that most health issues are hereditary and may have similar manifestations in relatives. Moreover, many medical conditions that affect the reproductive system may have vague symptoms that can also complicate the diagnosis. If your doctor is aware of your family’s medical history, it would be easier for him or her to find out the underlying cause of your condition. The topic of sexual relations can be quite embarrassing especially if it is your first visit to the gynecologist. However, you should skip seemingly insignificant details as they can actually be a cause of your condition. If you experience pain during sex or suffer from a lack of lubrication, you should inform your doctor about these problems. The reality is that many serious diseases can manifest themselves through such symptoms. That’s why it is essential to be honest with your gynecologist."
7,Buy Xenical Online- Best Weight Loss Prescription Drugs,health-fitness," Eating less and moving more are the nuts and bolts of weight reduction that exists. For certain individuals, prescription weight loss medications may help. You'll still need to concentrate on diet and exercise while ingesting these medications, and they're not recommended for everybody. Specialists usually endorse the pills just if your BMI is 30 or higher, or if it's at any rate 27 and you hold a condition that might be identified with your weight, similar to hypertension or type 2 diabetes. This is what you should know about the most widely recognized remedy weight reduction drugs: orlistat (Alli, Xenical), naltrexone-bupropion (Contrave), liraglutide (Saxenda), and phentermine (Adipex-P, Ionamin, Pro-Fast). Before you receive a weight loss medicine, inform your primary care physician regarding your clinical history. That includes any allergies or different conditions you have; drugs or enhancements you take (regardless of whether they're natural or herbal); whether you're wanting to get pregnant soon, breastfeeding, or pregnant. Orlistat (Xenical) How it functions: Blocks your body from engrossing about one-third of the fat you eat. Keep READING BELOW When a specialist recommends orlistat, it's also named Xenical.

Side effects incorporate flowing oily stool, abdominal cramping, having frequent bowel movements, passing gas, and not being capable to control bowel movements. These reactions are commonly gentle and temporary. Yet, they may get worsen in case you eat high-fat nourishment. Uncommon instances of serious liver injury have been observed for individuals taking orlistat, yet it's not proven that the medication caused those issues. What else you should know: You should be on a low-fat eating regimen (under 30% of your everyday calories from fat) before using orlistat. Additionally, take a multivitamin at least 2 hours prior or after taking orlistat, because of the fact that the medication quickly makes it more difficult for your body to assimilate nutrients A, D, E, and K. Orlistat is the main medication of its sort that is affirmed in major of the countries. All other remedy weight reduction drugs just control your appetite."
8,Everything you need to know about CBD oil,health-fitness," Cannabidiol (CBD) is an oil of cannabis plant origin. Possible health benefits include reducing the pain and inflammation. It isn't legal in all jurisdictions, however, so there could be some threats as well. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the therapeutic use of Epidiolex, a distilled form of CBD oil, for two forms of epilepsy treatment in June 2018. In other states other types of cannabis are lawful. What is CBD oil? CBD is one of the cannabinoids (compounds) present in cannabis plants. Researchers have looked at the potential therapeutic uses of CBD. Two of the marijuana compounds are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) delta-9, and CBD. Those compounds have various effects. THC had been the best known compound in cannabis until recently. It's the most active constituent and psychologically it has an effect. When a person smokes it or uses it in cooking, it produces a mind-altering ""hot."" This is because when a person applies heat, THC breaks down and implants it into the body. Conversely, CBD isn't psychoactive. If they use it, it does not affect the state of mind of an individual. It can, however, cause significant changes in the body, and shows some significant medical benefits. Where does CBD come from? CBD originates in the cannabis plant. Depending on how much THC they produce, people refer to cannabis plants as either hemp or marijuana. The FDA states that under the Farm Bill, hemp plants are legal as long as they contain less than 0.3 per cent THC. CBD oil originates from these lawful hemp plants. How CBD works All cannabinoids generate effects in the body through interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are part of the endocannabinoid system. The body yields two receptors: •	CB1 receptors are present in the entire body particularly in the brain. They coordinate movement, pain, emotion, mood, thought, appetite, memories, etc. •	CB2 receptors are more prevalent within the immune system. They affect pain and inflammation. THC binds to CB1 receptors but CBD activates the receptors and the body creates its own endocannabinoids. Benefits Reasons for taking CBD oil according to a 2018 study include: •	Chronic soreness •	Illness or joint pain •	Depression and anxiety •	Sleep deprivation •	Migraine Headache •	Cluster and Headaches •	Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) •	Nausea •	Cancer •	Asthma or allergies •	Epilepsy and other convulsions •	Multifunctional sclerosis (MS) •	Pulmonary disorders •	Parkinson's disease •	Alzheimer's illness Natural pain relief and anti-inflammatory properties There is growing evidence that the non-psychoactive marijuana compounds, such as CBD, could provide a new chronic pain treatment. In 2018, mouse studies showed that CBD reduces inflammation by preventing the release of compounds which cause inflammation in the body. Quitting smoking and drug withdrawal A pilot study in 2013 showed smokers who used CBD-containing inhalers smoked less cigarettes than normal and stopped craving nicotine. This suggests CBD could help people quit smoking. The researchers noted that some of the symptoms associated with substance use disorders had been reduced by CBD. These included anxiety, symptoms related to mood, pain and sleeplessness. Epilepsy Following years of research into the safety and effectiveness of CBD oil for the treatment of epilepsy, in 2018 the FDA approved the use of Epidiolex, a distilled form of CBD. They approved it for treatment in people 3 years and older: •	Syndrome of Lennox-Gastaut •	Syndrome Dravet Scientists are starting to understand how CBD prevents seizures without the previously used side effects of sedating medicines. Synthetic drugs which target the endocannabinoid system are not yet available as CBD does. Alzheimer’s disease A rodent research in 2014 showed that CBD could help people maintain the ability to recognize familiar faces. People with Alzheimer's may be losing that ability. One 2019 review found that CBD could help slow Alzheimer's disease onset and progress. More research is under way to better understand the dosage. Some scientists believe that treatment that involves both THC and CHD could be more effective. Other neurological symptoms and disorders A research carried out in 2012 showed that CBD can produce similar effects to those of other antipsychotic medications and that the compound can provide safe and efficient treatment for people with schizophrenia. There is however a need for further research. Fighting cancer A review article in 2020 discusses the addition of CBD to chemotherapy drugs to improve the response of the immune system to treating cancer. Certain research has looked at how CBD could help: •	Prevents cancer cells from growing •	Reduces fears •	Improve the Chemotherapy action •	Reduce side effects of conventional chemotherapy. Anxiety disorders A research performed in 2019 showed CBD significantly decreased symptoms in nervous mice. Earlier authors of a 2015 review had suggested that CBD could help to reduce anxiety-related behaviours in people with the following conditions: •	PTSD •	General Anxiety Disorder(GAD) •	Panic ailment •	Social anxiety disorder •	Obsessive-compulsive disorder. The authors noted that existing therapies may have negative effects, and that is why some people avoid using them. There is no evidence, however, to confirm that CBD has important adverse effects. Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes occurs when cells in the pancreas are attacked by the immune system which leads to inflammation. Researchers found evidence in 2016 that CBD may ease this inflammation and protect against the onset of type 1 diabetes, or delay it. Acne One promising use for CBD is treating acne. The disease is caused, in part, to inflammation in the body and overworked sebaceous glands. A 2014 study found that CBD is helping to reduce sebum development that contributes to acne, partly due to its anti-inflammatory effect. According to study, application of CBD topically may minimize inflammation in psoriasis and other inflammatory skin diseases. Legality People should test the laws and any travel destination in their state. CBD's legal status in the US is complicated. Under the Farm Bill, hemp and hemp products are legal as long as their THC content is less than 0.3%. Risks and side effects As with most treatments, the use of CBD can entail some risks. It can interact with additives and with other drugs. Most CBD products have no FDA approval, which also means they have not undergone extensive testing. It is not possible to know: •	Is safe and easy to use for all. •	Has the properties or contents stated on the packaging. Possible adverse reactions include: •	Liver damage •	Additional drug and alcohol interactions •	Alertness shifts which can make driving risky •	Appetite loss and gastrointestinal problems •	Changes in attitude like irritability and frustration •	A drop in male fertility. During pregnancy Experts believe use of marijuana during pregnancy can influence neuronal fetal growth. Regular use among adolescents relates to memory, behaviour and intelligence issues. The FDA is recommending that people do not use CBD during pregnancy or breastfeeding. How to use CBD If a doctor is prescribing CBD for epilepsy, follow their instructions. Ways to use products with CBD include: •	mix them into food or beverage •	taking them with a pipette or dropper •	swallowing capsules •	massaging the skin with a paste •	spraying it under the tongue. Summary For now, people should seek advice from a healthcare professional about which product to use and how much to take. They will also conduct work to ensure they follow local and state rules. The FDA offers information on a broad variety of CBD-related concerns."

10,Not Smiling Can Also Lead To Sleeping Problems,health-fitness," People who do not smile very often or in public places come across as being low in self-confidence due to which their professional life gets hampered. This is the reason why; it is important that you take your kid to a professional such as Gary Baughman by the age of seven so that they can be treated for such problems. At this age, the jaw as well as gums are strong and very flexible to the upcoming teeth which can be directed to be developed in a straight manner which prevents the possibility of the teeth being aligned. In many cases, this is genetic as well which is why the expert also diagnoses the parents for the same problem before they try and check the kid. There are so many diseases and disorders that are related with crooked teeth such as Sleep Apnea in Montana that it is very important to sort such issues so that we do not face complications in the future and the same goes for your child too. It is not in the best interest of people to spend heavy amounts such as $3000-$3500 in such treatments because they find it useless to sort something that only disrupts their looks; however, stats show that many people refrain from smiling at public places due to which they undergo mental issues and in extreme cases, even depression. Invisalign is one of the best ways in which we can cure Sleep Apnea in Montana because this appliance is made of plastic and ceramic which makes it a lot more comfortable than the other aligners. Metal aligners are the most widely used appliances today that are used by professionals; however, If metal aligners are kept under room temperature then they get deformed, if kept for too long which is why we have to be careful when we make a selection and ought to know about all such properties of the aligner that can come in handy while we undergo such a dental procedure. With invisible aligners, it is much easier because of the fact that it is lighter in weight, does not get deformed easily and the fascinating thing here is that people who were not even related with this field created something that is now used by people all over the world and almost 4 million people in USA alone use it to fix their misaligned teeth. the type of aligner that is suitable for us can only be advised to us by an expert who knows about the ins and outs of such appliances and uses it for treating people for their oral defects. it has always been a constant effort of the professionals in the field of orthodontics to build an appliance that is perfect to sort crooked teeth."

12,Health and beauty benefits of sleeping on a pure silk pillowcase,health-fitness," My name is Michelle. A year ago on my birthday my good friend gave me a beautiful silk Pillowcase as a gift. I am 43 years of age and now knowing what I do about silk, I wish I had started sleeping on one years ago. At first I was just so happy with the way the silk pillowcase felt on my skin. I then noticed that when I woke up in the morning I looked refreshed and had none of the sleep creases that my cotton pillowcase used to cause which took hours to go away. I also noticed my hair was silky and had no tangles whatsoever. I also noticed that my nose was not stuffy. Maybe I was allergic to dust mites. I know dust mites can not live in silk. I was so impressed with my silk pillowcase that I purchased 2 more. I am listing below some health and beauty benefits of sleeping with silk. You probably already knew these though! I started to buy these as gifts for my loved ones too. I fell in love with these so much that I decided to build my own website called Silk House. The health benefits Silk is a hypoallergenic product and great for fighting acne as bacteria cannot grow on silk. Sufferers of asthma and other allergies may also experience reduced symptoms due to silk’s hypoallergenic qualities. The beauty benefits. The key benefits are preventing split ends in hair as silk doesn’t pull at the roots of the hair whilst sleeping, they are also amazing for prolonging the life of your blow-dry. Silk is hydrating as it doesn’t draw moisture away from the skin like cotton does and sleeping on silk prevents sleep creases - those nasty lines you wake up with after a night on your cotton pillow. I love Silk Pillowcases. I hope this will be informative and encourage more people to make the best ever health and beauty investment with a silk pillowcase. Pure Mulberry silk is the best and make sure its 25 Momme. Momme is about the thickness and quality of the silk. Silk needs to be cared for but its worth it. Something I do not understand is why us women spend time on a beauty system by cleansing, toning, moisturising and the rest. Why do we ruin it all by sleeping on a cotton pillowcase. Silk keeps your skin hydrated. Silk is temperature regulating so it cools you if your hot and heats you if your cold."
13,Natural Rapid Weight Loss Diet Pills,health-fitness," The rise in the number of fast foods joints that have a lot of saturated fat in the meals, the use of a lot of refined sugar in sodas and other processed foods and eating food with less fiber have all contributed to the fact that there are more people than before who are classified as either overweight or are obese. A lot of other factors cause this to happen such as genetics, overeating and as people age; the metabolism slows down making it harder than before to burn the food that was just consumed. The rate that a person loses weight is commensurate to how it is gained. Rapid weight is not good advisable since it leaves the person with lose skin and the only way to get rid of that would require surgery. Weight loss depends on the condition of the person which includes weight, health, calorie-intake, age, gender, lifestyle, stress level and routine. Being overweight does not necessarily make a person unhealthy. It just makes the person a bit unfashionable. Nutritionists and other health experts will say that a person’s weight with proper exercise can actually help lose a certain number of pounds per week The best way to do this is with a low calorie diet and an exercise plan. The first thing a person needs to do is to choose a diet program designed by a dietitian or another health professional. The patient has to be evaluated before any program can be made. The program usually consists of an eating plan and an exercise program that does not require the use of supplements or one to purchase any expensive fitness equipment. The best exercise plan should have cardiovascular and weight training exercises. This helps burn calories and increase the muscle to fat ratio that will increase ones metabolism and lose weight. A good diet should have food from all the food groups. This is made up by 2 things. The first is carbohydrates. The food that a person consumes should have vitamins, minerals and fiber. A lot of this can come from oats, rice, potatoes and cereals. The best still come from vegetables and fruits since these have phytochemicals, enzymes and micronutrients that are essential for a healthy diet. The second is fat which can come from mono and poly saturated food sources rather than animal fats. Since fat contains more than double the number of calories in food, this should be taken in small quantities to lose weight. All diet plans are designed to make the person induce reduced amount of calories into the body. This does not mean that the person has to eat less. It just means that one has to eat smart by choosing the foods that have less calories. This makes it possible for someone to lose weight without the need to eat less."
14,Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) Trends for 2020,health-fitness," Revenue cycle management has experienced ups and downs in recent years. What lies ahead for revenue cycle management? Last year, we saw the continued rise of automation and AI. We also saw battles over price transparency. Continuing the trend from previous years, we also saw healthcare organizations contend with patient expectations, government regulations, and a growing number of technology options. Let’s take a look at some of the revenue cycle management (RCM) trends we’re preparing for in 2020. Continued Battles Over Healthcare Pricing Transparency Healthcare pricing transparency battles occurred across the country in 2019. Expect battles to continue into 2020. A Waystar survey released in August 2019 found that lack of price transparency was the biggest factor to a negative patient experience. Governments are pushing for increased healthcare transparency, and healthcare organizations are adapting. Last year, we saw healthcare organizations implement strategies to better manage the patient financial journey. In 2020, we expect healthcare organizations to take the next step. Some organizations have published the chargemaster online, giving patients full transparency over how much services cost. However, because chargemaster prices are not necessarily the prices charged to the patient, these resources can be difficult for patients to interpret. In June 2019, the Trump administration signed an executive order mandating that health systems provide out of pocket cost estimations to patients upfront. Look for increased transparency and better patient access to prices as we move through 2020. Higher Demand for Revenue Cycle Management RCM Outsourcing Revenue cycle management outsourcing is becoming increasingly popular among healthcare organizations – and it’s been a trend for several years. The trend towards revenue cycle management outsourcing is expected to continue into 2020. Revenue cycle management companies advertise benefits like sharing the risk and reward, which creates a win-win solution for partner organizations. Healthcare organizations can create a sustainable, high-performing engine while still enjoying growing cash flow. As revenue cycle management outsourcing companies become more competitive, outsourcing is an increasingly attractive option for healthcare organizations. More Cybersecurity Battles and Ransomware Attacks Cybersecurity has been a priority for healthcare organizations for over a decade, and this trend is expected to continue into 2020. Cybersecurity attacks aren’t stopping anytime soon. Healthcare organizations need a coherent cybersecurity strategy to stay competitive. In April 2019, the United States government reported 44 healthcare data breaches, which was the highest number of healthcare breaches reported in a single month since the government started tracking healthcare breaches in 2010. The previous record was set in April 2018, when there were 42 breaches. Ransomware attacks are particularly common. Last year, Carbon Black released a study showing that 66% of healthcare organizations experienced a ransomware attack within the last 12 months. Higher Volumes and Patient Revenue Hospitals nationwide ended 2019 with an increase in hospital profitability. The increase was linked to surges in net patient revenue and service volumes. Hospitals were treating more patients – and making more money from those patients – than ever, according to a report by RevCycle Intelligence. This profitability increased despite a slight increase in supply expenses, increases in bad debt, increases in charity care, and mixed performance on expenses. Over 800 hospitals across the country saw particularly high volumes in adjusted discharges, emergency department (ER) visits, and operating room (OR) minutes. It was a positive trend after a tough year. The December 2019 increase was the first year-over-year operating EBITDA margin increase in six months. Hospital operating margins also increased by 171.8 basis points compared to November 2019. Overall, EBITDA margins rose 136.9 basis points year-over-year in December 2019. It’s possible this trend will continue into 2020. CFOs Are Becoming More Involved The role of the healthcare CFO has been changing in recent years. 2020 might be the year it becomes even more evident. CFOs are expected to continue taking a leading role at every level of the healthcare organization. Modern healthcare CFOs don’t just listen: they act. Healthcare IT Leaders Revenue Cycle Lead, Larry Todd, recently recommended that CFOs go beyond listening and start implementing: “…any implementation will affect the revenue of the organization so it’s very important for CFOs to be involved in the implementation project and to be informed of key parts of the project that could put the organization and its revenue at risk.” In the same article, Linda Hoff of Legacy Health described how CFOs need to take a specific interest in not just financials, but also patient satisfaction and quality. All metrics are closely intertwined: “You have a passion for what you’re doing within your facilities, how you’re interacting with patients. You have to be as interested in patient satisfaction and quality as you are in the financials. If you don’t have that passion for all those aspects, you’re really not going to land yourself in a CFO role especially today.” Surprise Billing Will Continue to Be Attacked Surprise billing took a beating at the end of 2019. In December, members of Congress announced the expansion of a bipartisan investigation into supress billing practice. Because of that expansion, the investigation will now look at physician staffing companies and health insurers. That same month, a Health Affairs study found that annual healthcare spending for patients with employer-sponsored health insurance would drop by $40 billion if specialists were not able to bill out-of-network. A Kaiser Family Foundation report released in June, meanwhile, found that one in six Americans received a surprise medical bill in 2017 despite being covered by health insurance. As surprise billing continues to make media headlines nationwide, surprise billing practices will continue to be attacked. Look for these trends and more to make headlines across the revenue cycle management field in 2020."
15,Perfumes and Colognes,health-fitness," There are many people who enjoy looking for a good perfume or Cologne that they can use in their daily lives. They may feel that these products make them feel better and give them more confidence, but what about the consumer products themselves? A lot of people buying perfumes and colognes from a beauty store in their local town may wonder if the perfume is worth the money. These people should consider several things when choosing which perfume to buy. There are actually some people who spend a lot of money on perfumes and colognes just to get the smell of someone they have recently met. There are many different manufacturers who produce different types of perfumes and colognes. However, you should be able to find the perfect scent with a little bit of research. The more you know about the product, the better you will be able to choose a great perfume. When looking for a perfume, there are a few things that you should look for. First, you should determine if the perfume is designed for men and women. If it is not, you may find that it is very difficult to find something that matches your individual needs. Before you purchase any product, you should always do some research on the product. You should also look at reviews and product descriptions to find out how the product works. The manufacturer should put some great information on the products so that you can make an informed decision. It is also important to realize that fragrances are all different. Some people may have a particular scent that is meant for summer. Some people may even have a scent that is meant for another season of the year. Perfume comes in many different scents, and you may have a preference on what you like. This is why it is important to have a little bit of research when you are shopping for perfume. Once you have found the right fragrance, you will have found the perfect product to make you feel confident when you are wearing it. Some of the fragrances that are available to purchase include colognes and perfumes that are not only for men and women, but also for children. You can find scents for babies, children, and even pets. This is another great reason why it is important to have a little bit of research when you are purchasing a perfume. Remember that not all fragrances are created equal. Some perfumes may smell wonderful, but others may give you a bad smell. You may want to take a whiff of the perfume that you are interested in and then decide if you like it or not. Most people do not choose a Cologne or perfume because they are trying to buy the best product. They do not necessarily buy the best product because they are trying to impress a woman or impress someone they know. Instead, they choose a Cologne or perfume because they want to find a scent that will smell good on them, and they want to feel comfortable while wearing it. You can find a company that makes all types of perfumes and colognes. You can even purchase colognes and perfumes that have animal materials as well as those that are completely natural. You can even find perfumes that have various herbs and spices that will make you feel relaxed and comfortable. No matter what type of perfume you choose, you should never rush your decision. Instead, you should do some research and take your time when it comes to making your purchase. Many of the more popular perfumes are made by some of the most well known companies in the industry."
16,None of Us Are Above the Placebo Effect,health-fitness," Webber Vitamin E Cream is fantastic in my mind. I put this stuff on everything. I use it on my lips, on dry skin, on minor cuts and abrasions. I use it instead of regular moisturizer on my hands and legs. Whenever supplies start to run low, I stock up because I consider it a necessity. I swear when my kids are grown and they’re reminiscing about all the weird stuff that mom used to do, Webber Vitamin E Cream will be at the top of the list. Does it work better than other products on the market? Probably not. Is there some sort of magical ingredient? Nope.  If you look at the ingredients, it’s essentially petroleum jelly and vitamin-E. So why do I use it? Because I think it works, even though there’s no evidence that it works any better or worse than anything else. It is my placebo and I’m OK with that. The placebo effect has a bad reputation. Most of us think that people who experience the placebo effect are ‘faking’ their illness or are just stupid. We need to toss that notion aside because, chances are, we’ve all experienced the placebo effect. A prime example of the placebo effect in parenting is when our children miraculously recover from a minor injury when we ""kiss and make it better"" or apply that omnipresent placebo, the Band-Aid. From experience I can attest that my toddler has been beside himself with pain from a small or imagined injury but miraculously feels better mere seconds after a kiss or the bandage is applied. A recent study has found that even when children are actually sick, the use of a sweet tasting placebo cough medicine actually improves their symptoms. Are kids ""faking"" the severity of their symptoms? No. But what kids are experiencing is a legitimate benefit from a treatment that’s more psychosomatic than medically based. And before we get all high and mighty judging kids, let’s not forget that adults experience the placebo effect even when we know we’re receiving a placebo. So what’s actually happening in both kids and adults when we take a placebo, whether we’re aware of it or not? To be frank, we don’t really know. The placebo effect works isn’t well understood, as it seems to work in nearly all aspects of medical (and even cosmetic) treatment. The working hypothesis places emphasis on the power of the mind and belief. In essence, if the person believes they are receiving treatment, the body reacts as if they have received that treatment, even if they haven’t. When I was in labor with my first baby, I was incredibly nervous. On our way to the hospital I anxiety ate oatmeal cookies that my mother-in-law had made for us like I would never eat again. I didn’t know what to expect, I was nervous, I imagined all the worst-case scenarios playing out. But, once we arrived and got settled in, I felt much better. The nurses were friendly, the hospital room was warm and welcoming, but I hadn’t received any treatment to make labor easier, if anything just the opposite. What made things easier was the idea that I was now in a safe place, with people trained to deal with any medical emergency. That made me relax and made labor easier to bear. The difference was purely psychological, not at all physical. My body was reacting as if I was receiving treatment, even though I wasn’t. This would seem like a great option to address the issue of viciously priced life-saving pharmaceuticals: just give people sugar pills and the body will heal itself. Unfortunately, the placebo effect doesn’t work as well as actual pharmaceuticals. The placebo effect is typically short lived, with the ailment returning and requiring actual treatment. As parents, we can all relate to this. Once the Band-Aid comes off, or hours later after you’ve kissed and made it better, typically a toddler’s actual ailment returns. If you take the example of my labor, the relaxation I experienced lasted a few hours. Then my contractions picked up and I experienced back labor (which is no joke if you’ve ever experienced it) and I was back to feeling anxious and desperate to deliver this baby. The placebo effect of being in the safe space with the friendly staff wore off. Enter the epidural! The other issue with placebos is that they don’t work universally with all people experiencing an ailment. If you give a large group of people suffering from the same aliment a placebo, typically only about a third will experience the placebo effect, at varying levels of success. This doesn’t mean that the other two-thirds of the group are immune from the placebo effect, it just means that in this particular circumstance they didn’t experience it. This isn’t a great example of the dose-response relationship. Imagine an antibiotic that only worked on 1/3 of the people who used it. Not a lot of doctors would prescribe it. Finally, there’s the medical ethical issue that placebos raise: they usually require a doctor to lie to a patient. The same studies showing that we experience the placebo effect even when we know we’re not actually receiving treatment, also show that the placebo effect is stronger when we legitimately believe we’re receiving treatment. Deceiving a patient is highly controversial and is almost universally frowned upon, and rightfully so. When doctors lie to their patients it degrades not only the doctor/patient relationship in that setting, but it also instills a sense of distrust of doctors and the medical profession in general. When it comes to treating a child with a recurrent illness that is difficult to treat or diagnose, lying to the parent or the child is in itself something that’s not generally done or recommended. Kissing a scrape and making it better is one thing, but prescribing fake antibiotics to a child with recurrent ear infections is viewed as unethical. I think my vitamin-E cream falls into the former category, rather than the latter. But that’s not going to stop me from using it. I know it’s a placebo. We all believe in some sort of woo – that is some form of pseudoscience or placebo. If you think you don’t, then it likely means you aren’t aware of what your specific form of woo is. Believing in woo doesn’t make you stupid, a bad parent or a sucker for slick marketing. It makes you human."
17,What Is Leptin Resistance?,health-fitness," Before we had modern health-conscious cosmetics women would adorn themselves with lead-filled face paint and wash their skin with ammonia. They would slowly poison themselves but were convinced it was essential for true beauty. The knowledge we have gained over the years has not come without a fair share of innocent misunderstandings, but thankfully, as we know more we are able to make more informed choices based on actual science, on truth, on what works. It is crucial we build our actions on a foundation of truth. Our beliefs about weight loss have centered around constantly shifting paradigms. Throughout the decades we have blamed various things for our inability to lose weight and keep it off - high-fat foods, carbohydrates, calories, lack of motivation, genetics.... We have, in a way, been the people who thought the sun orbited us. Deep down we may sense there’s another reason for our inability to control our appetite and our expanding waistline, but just don’t know what it is. If you look at the diet and health industry we have created you’ll see the answers we’re fed about the obesity epidemic. We are supplied new ""answers"" and ""solutions"" all the time, and so—full of hope—we try them, only to be disappointed when we end up back where we started. •	What if I told you the health industry has got it all wrong? •	What if I were to tell you that we actually have the solution for why you have gained weight and been unable to lose it? Would you believe me? If you’re anything like the people I’ve just described, the people who have trusted the ""answers"" and ""solutions"" in the past, probably not. You may be burnt out on hope.... Yet, you are reading these words so there must be some trace of hope left, and I want to work with that tiny bit of remaining hope to change your life. And I mean it. We’re here to show you a new way, to point you in the direction of the actual cause of your weight gain. No more blaming the wrong thing, looking in the wrong direction, no more wasting your time. The Real Cause This new direction starts with something called leptin. Never heard of leptin before? You’re not the only one. This hormone is a lesser known player in our hormonal system (which is sad since it is responsible for so much within our body.) Did you know leptin helps regulate bone mass, the menstrual cycle, the synthesis of thyroid hormones, our appetite and metabolism? And this is just scratching the surface. Leptin is known as the ""obesity hormone"" and the ""fat hormone."" A pretty big clue for what it’s responsible for. When our body operates faultlessly, as a well-oiled machine, leptin would be produced by your body’s fat cells and communicate with the hypothalamus (in our brain) via the bloodstream. The amount of leptin would determine whether the body stores fat or loses it, ""a minor increase in leptin concentration reduces the appetite and leads to a decrease in body weight.""(1) This is how things are supposed to work: a high level of leptin in the body informs your brain that there is enough fat stored, you are not starving—you will survive - and so your appetite is switched off and you burn more fat. Similarly, if your body fat were to decrease, leptin should follow suit and diminish, signalling to your brain to stop burning fat—to store the fat you have—to increase your appetite and prompt you to eat. This is how things are supposed to function. But what happens when something interrupts the balance which our body is meant to keep? That’s when leptin resistance occurs, and this leptin resistance is the reason for our fruitless (yet well-intentioned) attempts to take control of our health and body. Once you are leptin resistant you won’t lose the weight no matter how little you eat or how much exercise you do. Thankfully, there is a way out. Your life doesn’t need to be ruled by leptin resistance, there is something you can do. Real results. Real science. No wishing for the best. And this is where we come in. If you’ve had enough of the endless trying and disappointment, if you’ve had enough of feeling like a prisoner in your body and a prisoner to food then a product called Leptitox may help. It is a ground-breaking supplement program that addresses the root cause and breaks the devastating cycle of weight gain once and for all."
18,"Benefits of using high potency Collagen for Skin, Hair, and Joints",health-fitness," Collagen is one of the most abundant proteins in our bodies. In fact, collagen protein makes up 30% of our total protein in our bodies, and 70% of our total protein in our skin. A vast majority of our skin, hair and nails and a significant portion of our joints are comprised of collagen. Unfortunately, as we age, collagen levels go down in our bodies. Collagen contains a mixture of amino acids like proline and glycine, which are in every connective tissue within our body, including vital organs. While most beauty treatments (including shampoo and skin care products) tout the benefits of collagen being applied topically, the real benefits come from collagen being absorbed within our bodies. Collagen has been found to assist with: Bone and joint health Increases in muscle mass Promote skin elasticity Strengthen our hair and nails Promote gut health Emerging studies suggest specific amino acids in collagen can also assist with our body’s natural Hormone production and balance Clearly, collagen can provide many benefits to our bodies as we age. As we age, our collagen production from within our bodies declines. A number of lifestyle factors like stress, gut health imbalances, poor diet made up of processed foods instead of natural and organic foods can also impact our collagen production adversely. A quality supplement can assist with replacing this important protein back into our bodies. Unfortunately, most collagen supplements on the market are at very low concentration levels with a lot of fillers that will not assist you with replacement of collagen. Collagen powder (the hydrolyzed form of gelatin) contains these proteins that are broken down into individual peptide chains. This form is typically easier to digest and has frequently been suggested to help with people with digestive problems. An advantage of this kind of collagen is it is easily mixed into warm liquids and when properly treated, can be tasteless. Skin may benefit the most from collagen supplements While collagen can be beneficial to the entire body, it is most noticeably beneficial to the skin. The reason for this is as we age, our skin epidermic (outer layer of our skin) thins and loses elasticity in a process known as elastosis. As this happens, a person will tend to show more wrinkles and show more signs of aging. Two studies published by Skin Pharmacology and Physiology in 2014 found a daily regimen of collagen peptide supplements can improve elasticity and reduce wrinkles by up to 20 % when used for just 8 weeks. The studies was done on a sample group of over 200 women. The study also concluded a high level of ingestible collagen peptide was necessary for absorption at a level that could be absorbed during digestion so it can actual be absorbed on a cellular level into our skin. A new study published in January 2019 by the US National Library of Medicine that were the culmination of 11 different studies with 805 patients confirmed these prior studies, but highlighted the need both for high potency hydrolyzed collagen. Unfortunately, not all collagen supplements are high potency, and some even contain harmful fillers. It is important to carefully choose the proper supplement in both form (hydrolyzed collagen) and potency (measured in grams/day). Generally, the higher the potency the better the results. Further evidence has found that the use of biotin (Vitamin B 7) can also assist with the promotion of healthy hair, skin and nails. A vitamin B 7 deficiency has been found to manifest itself in the form of thinning, splitting and brittle hair or dermatitis that results in dry irritated skin. In a study published by the National Institute of Health the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recommended a minimum RDA (Recommended Dietary Allowance) of at least 30 mcg per day of biotin for those over 19 years of age. Vitamin B 7 has also been linked to effectively delaying dementia or Alzheimers. Keep in mind that not all supplements are created equal. To get the most benefit from biotin and collagen supplements look for a supplement that does not have harmful toxins or fillers and is made from made from real food sources. As always, learn to read labels of products that you consume. Just as with processed foods or skin care products that are full of synthetic chemicals that can be harmful for your health, Collagen and Biotin supplements need to be taken in sufficient dosage and not have harmful fillers in them to get your maximum desired results.Evidence: Skin Pharmacology and Physiology 2014 study https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0ac5/222bddc8aa0525e6e142872f30563b002145.pdf January 2019 findings: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30681787 National Institute of Health recommended dosage of biotin: https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Biotin-HealthProfessional/"
19,What big skin care manufacturers don’t want you to know,health-fitness," The skin care industry is huge- in fact it is over$ 50 Billion in sales in 2018 and growing rapidly. Most industry observers project it to grown another 20 Billion by the year 2025. However, not all skin care products are created equally. Did you know that in the U.S. the industry is largely unregulated? How does that affect us as consumers? You might be interested to know that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only bans 30 chemicals that cannot be used in skin care products. These include your makeup, lotions, serums, creams, etc. Whereas the European Union bans 1328 chemicals from being used in skin care products! Included in the vast majority of skin care products in America are known toxic ingredients. Have you ever looked on the label of your skin care products only to find a long list of ingredients that you cannot even pronounce- folks, those are chemicals. We all know that processed foods are not good for our bodies- but are you aware that most people in America unknowingly ingest daily harmful toxins into the largest organ we have- our skin. Here are just a few of the toxins and chemicals used in many skin care products that are linked to a variety of health problems: Formaldehyde- yes, you read that right. The same chemicals used to embalm dead bodies are in many skin care products. It is a preservative fluid and is a recognized carcinogen (cancer causing agent) by the National Cancer Institute- with particularly higher risk for leukemia, but many unknowingly put this harmful chemical into their bodies daily while searching for the ""fountain of youth"". Parabens- Parabens have many other names and are used as preservatives in skin care products. They have been linked by scientists to an increased risk of contracting breast cancer and are routinely used in skin care products. A startling statistic is that 99% of patients with breast cancer have been found to have higher levels of parabens in their bodies. The National Chemical Society estimates that about 85% of personal care products in America contain parabens. Synthetic fragrances- These ingredients are not fully disclosed. The requirements for ""fragrance"" or perfume is simply to list Fragrance or Perfume on the ingredient list. However, these chemical fragrances can be filled with thousands of separate ingredients- many which may be toxic. Even the word unscented may use ""fragrances"" to mask the smell of toxic chemicals. Fragrances have been linked to migraine headaches, asthma, and other respiratory problems. By contrast organic essential oils used as fragrances offer no side effects, and even can assist with out health. Phthalates- A truly toxic skin care ingredient used to help your skin care product absorb into the skin- while also absorbing this known toxin that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Health and Human Services have classified phthalates as a probably human carcinogen! All natural products may take a short bit longer to absorb into the skin- but at least you are not also absorbing toxic chemicals into your largest organ in your body@ Petrochemicals- This category of chemical based ingredients encompass formaldehyde, parabens, phthalates sodium laureth sulfates, coal tar and more. They are known toxins used primarily to extend the shelf life of skin care products laden with toxic chemicals that are known to be dangerous to humans. Borates- Boron containing chemical compounds, most commonly called sodium borate, boric acid, sodium perborate and perboric acid. These are used as preservatives and emulsifying agents in skin care products and sometimes teeth whitening tootpaste. Borates are banned by the European Union and have been linked to male and female sexual and birth defects. The above list is but a small sampling of toxic products contained in our skin care products. We urge you to read your labels and choose all natural ingredients only to protect your health. To a more healthy lifestyle!!"

1,What Role Does a Hospital Chargemaster Play in Revenue Cycle Management?,health-fitness," The hospital charge description master, or hospital chargemaster, communicates medical bills to payers and patients. The hospital chargemaster plays a crucial role in revenue cycle management: it’s the heart of the healthcare revenue cycle. It’s the central point from which all billing gets sent to patients and insurers. Organizations that fail to maintain the chargemaster face enormous problems. Poor chargemaster maintenance leads to revenue leakage. It can also lead to inaccuracies, non-competitive fees, and claim rejections. What is the Chargemaster? The hospital chargemaster is a list of all the billable services and items to a patient or patient’s health insurance provider. The chargemaster lists the costs of each product and service offered by the healthcare organization, including any procedures, services, supplies, prescription drugs, and diagnostic tests provided by the hospital. The chargemaster lists the cost of everything related to that service, including any equipment fees and room charges. When a patient receives service from a hospital, the healthcare provider documents the encounter in the medical record. Then hospital staff – like professional coders – assign the service a code for reporting and claim submission. The codes are sent to the chargemaster. Each code is matched with a specific product or service and a fixed rate. Then, the charges are billed to the patient, creating a claim for payers – like insurance companies – to pay. What’s Included in the Chargemaster? Hospitals use chargemasters to keep track of the cost of all products and services offered by the organization. Each product or service offered by the hospital – like a diagnostic test or specific surgery – gets its own entry in the chargemaster. Each chargemaster entry includes the following: Item Number: This number is assigned by the facility and is unique to that product or service. CPT or HCPCS Codes: Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes or Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes help keep track of each product or service in a standardized way. Item Description: Each entry has a brief text description of the product or service. Revenue Code: A unique code based on the revenue of that item. Charge Amount: The fee assigned to the item. Alternative CPT or HCPCS Codes: Sometimes, codes overlap. Or, some insurers may require additional codes. Numeric Designation for Department: A unique code describing the department where the product or service took place. Ledger Number: A general number for organization accounting purposes. A hospital may offer thousands of products or services. There’s a chargemaster entry for each one. Patients Rarely Pay the Chargemaster Rate Healthcare transparency battles raged throughout 2019. In response, some organizations are making chargemasters more transparent. However, it’s easy for patients to get confused about chargemaster prices. The prices displayed on the chargemaster are rarely the prices paid by customers. In fact, most patients do not see the chargemaster price from their hospital visit unless they are uninsured and must actually pay the chargemaster rate. Why are chargemaster rates so different from real prices? It’s because of markups. Chargemaster services are heavily marked up to make negotiations with insurance companies easier. One recent study found that the average hospital in the United States had a charge-to-cost ratio of 4.32, which means the hospital charged $432 when the service really only cost $100. Maintaining marked up chargemaster prices also makes it difficult for patients to compare prices between organizations. Hospitals defend this practice, claiming that markups help hospitals stay open and competitive. However, there’s been a push for transparency in recent years, and hospitals have started changing how they treat the chargemaster. Why is Inadequate Chargemaster Maintenance a Problem? Inadequate chargemaster maintenance is a serious issue. Even the best healthcare organizations experience chargemaster-related issues, and these issues lead to lost revenue. Accurate chargemaster maintenance is crucial for revenue integrity. A lack of maintenance leads to revenue leakage. Poor chargemaster maintenance can lead to overpayments or underpayments. It can also lead to claim rejections from insurance companies, poor patient experience, or compliance violations. Many organizations are surprised to discover they have been significantly undercharging or overcharging for specific treatments because of poor chargemaster maintenance. A chargemaster audit can reveal surprising results. Tips for Maintaining Accurate Chargemasters Hospital chargemaster maintenance is crucial to revenue cycle management. Here are some tips to help your organization manage. First, the American Academy of Professional Coders (AAPC) recommends maintaining chargemaster lists by following the three C’s: correct, complete, and compliant codes. Correct Codes: Chargemaster coordinators should check that the correct codes are billed. There may be differences between what is captured in the order entry system or EHR and what is reported on the chargemaster. Someone may assign an unlisted HCPCS code when a specific code is available, for example, or the entry may be missing HCPCS codes for separately paid drugs. Complete: Chargemaster code sets need to be complete. Hospitals need to capture the charges for all the services and items provided to patients. Failure to maintain complete code sets can lead to missed payments and revenue leakage. Compliant: Chargemasters must also be complaint with coding standards and federal, state, and commercial payer rules. Failing to adhere to regulations can lead to significant issues, including repayments to payers, healthcare fraud, and healthcare abuse. Ultimately, all of these issues can be solved with frequent chargemaster code reviews. Check your chargemaster code to ensure it’s correct, complete, and compliant to ensure good revenue cycle management."
2,Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) Trends for 2020,health-fitness," Revenue cycle management has experienced ups and downs in recent years. What lies ahead for revenue cycle management? Last year, we saw the continued rise of automation and AI. We also saw battles over price transparency. Continuing the trend from previous years, we also saw healthcare organizations contend with patient expectations, government regulations, and a growing number of technology options. Let’s take a look at some of the revenue cycle management (RCM) trends we’re preparing for in 2020. Continued Battles Over Healthcare Pricing Transparency Healthcare pricing transparency battles occurred across the country in 2019. Expect battles to continue into 2020. A Waystar survey released in August 2019 found that lack of price transparency was the biggest factor to a negative patient experience. Governments are pushing for increased healthcare transparency, and healthcare organizations are adapting. Last year, we saw healthcare organizations implement strategies to better manage the patient financial journey. In 2020, we expect healthcare organizations to take the next step. Some organizations have published the chargemaster online, giving patients full transparency over how much services cost. However, because chargemaster prices are not necessarily the prices charged to the patient, these resources can be difficult for patients to interpret. In June 2019, the Trump administration signed an executive order mandating that health systems provide out of pocket cost estimations to patients upfront. Look for increased transparency and better patient access to prices as we move through 2020. Higher Demand for Revenue Cycle Management RCM Outsourcing Revenue cycle management outsourcing is becoming increasingly popular among healthcare organizations – and it’s been a trend for several years. The trend towards revenue cycle management outsourcing is expected to continue into 2020. Revenue cycle management companies advertise benefits like sharing the risk and reward, which creates a win-win solution for partner organizations. Healthcare organizations can create a sustainable, high-performing engine while still enjoying growing cash flow. As revenue cycle management outsourcing companies become more competitive, outsourcing is an increasingly attractive option for healthcare organizations. More Cybersecurity Battles and Ransomware Attacks Cybersecurity has been a priority for healthcare organizations for over a decade, and this trend is expected to continue into 2020. Cybersecurity attacks aren’t stopping anytime soon. Healthcare organizations need a coherent cybersecurity strategy to stay competitive. In April 2019, the United States government reported 44 healthcare data breaches, which was the highest number of healthcare breaches reported in a single month since the government started tracking healthcare breaches in 2010. The previous record was set in April 2018, when there were 42 breaches. Ransomware attacks are particularly common. Last year, Carbon Black released a study showing that 66% of healthcare organizations experienced a ransomware attack within the last 12 months. Higher Volumes and Patient Revenue Hospitals nationwide ended 2019 with an increase in hospital profitability. The increase was linked to surges in net patient revenue and service volumes. Hospitals were treating more patients – and making more money from those patients – than ever, according to a report by RevCycle Intelligence. This profitability increased despite a slight increase in supply expenses, increases in bad debt, increases in charity care, and mixed performance on expenses. Over 800 hospitals across the country saw particularly high volumes in adjusted discharges, emergency department (ER) visits, and operating room (OR) minutes. It was a positive trend after a tough year. The December 2019 increase was the first year-over-year operating EBITDA margin increase in six months. Hospital operating margins also increased by 171.8 basis points compared to November 2019. Overall, EBITDA margins rose 136.9 basis points year-over-year in December 2019. It’s possible this trend will continue into 2020. CFOs Are Becoming More Involved The role of the healthcare CFO has been changing in recent years. 2020 might be the year it becomes even more evident. CFOs are expected to continue taking a leading role at every level of the healthcare organization. Modern healthcare CFOs don’t just listen: they act. Healthcare IT Leaders Revenue Cycle Lead, Larry Todd, recently recommended that CFOs go beyond listening and start implementing: ""…any implementation will affect the revenue of the organization so it’s very important for CFOs to be involved in the implementation project and to be informed of key parts of the project that could put the organization and its revenue at risk."" In the same article, Linda Hoff of Legacy Health described how CFOs need to take a specific interest in not just financials, but also patient satisfaction and quality. All metrics are closely intertwined: ""You have a passion for what you’re doing within your facilities, how you’re interacting with patients. You have to be as interested in patient satisfaction and quality as you are in the financials. If you don’t have that passion for all those aspects, you’re really not going to land yourself in a CFO role especially today."" Surprise Billing Will Continue to Be Attacked Surprise billing took a beating at the end of 2019. In December, members of Congress announced the expansion of a bipartisan investigation into supress billing practice. Because of that expansion, the investigation will now look at physician staffing companies and health insurers. That same month, a Health Affairs study found that annual healthcare spending for patients with employer-sponsored health insurance would drop by $40 billion if specialists were not able to bill out-of-network. A Kaiser Family Foundation report released in June, meanwhile, found that one in six Americans received a surprise medical bill in 2017 despite being covered by health insurance. As surprise billing continues to make media headlines nationwide, surprise billing practices will continue to be attacked. Look for these trends and more to make headlines across the revenue cycle management field in 2020."

5,What are the health benefits of CBD Oil?,health-fitness," CBD Oil has enjoyed much popularity in recent years. Think tanks like ""Global Markets Insights"" predict the CBD Oil market will be worth $89 billion by 2026 (Health Europa). One particular area of growth has been in Europe who account for 25% of global Hemp cultivation to supply to manufacturers. These companies convert the raw material into a myriad of CBD products such as Full Spectrum Hemp Oil, CBD spray, CBD tinctures and CBD capsules. Much of this growth can be attributed to the lack of psychoactive benefits found in Hemp Oil. This is because Hemp Oil contains only 0.2% THC whereas so called cannabis oil has much more THC and is used recreationally. This is due to cannabis oil being sourced from the bud of the Marijuana plant, which most people can distinguish from Hemp plant as being concentrated with much THC content. This has urged many European countries to legalise CBD Oil entirely as a food supplement. Although there is talk of changing the status of CBD Oil to a novel food like in the UK, consumers have sustained trust in their favourite brands to support them through various issues. In this article we will explore the major health benefits of CBD Oil responsible for the industry's market growth and dedicated consumer following. Firstly the theory is that Hemp Oil works with your natural Endo-Cannabinoid system. This system includes cannabinoid receptors. In the body these cannabinoid receptors act as support bases for our bodies. Therefore when Hemp derived CBD and its related cannabinoids including CBDa, CBG, CBGa and CBC bind to these cannabinoid receptors they can act as a support base for our bodies. But what makes this possible? The hypothesis is that by binding to our internal cannabinoid receptors CBD can help maintain their natural processes in acting as a support base for our bodies. Therefore this is a source of all round health and wellbeing. Subsequently this has been behind much of the market growth of this industry not just today but in past generations also. As more research develops over time, people are seeing the correlations between our Endo-cannabinoid system and CBD supplementation. This garners many sales for many companies. Secondly a number of companies are branching out and innovating dual combination supplements whereby CBD and other healthy supplements come together as one. For example vitamins and minerals when mixed with CBD in tincture form can allow consumers to gain their daily influx of normal supplements alongside their Hemp Oil. Another unique example is the mixture of Turmeric and Hemp Oil where Turmeric and its active ingredient Curucmin work with cannabinoids in synergy to create a dual-purpose health supplement. A simple Google search will show numerous results on the benefits of Turmeric as an anti-inflammatory. So when supplementing Turmeric with Hemp, you can gain the cartilage support they need and the benefits of CBD in one. This has provoked many to keep up their CBD supplementation as they search the Internet for these interesting offerings as they gain more from their money when purchasing these two in one supplements. Thereby increasing sales and growing the market's size. However there have been some setbacks in the rate the market can grow. This is because the purported health benefits of some CBD supplements can be compromised due to false information spreading in the industry. This comes in the form of some companies lying about the contents of their products. These products state they have ""x"" amount of cannabidiol, but lack lab reports to back this up. Therefore the amount of CBD in these products is rarely accurately reported on the label. This has brought many to stop trusting the industry as a whole. Newspapers like the Daily Mail constantly fear monger about ""fake"" CBD supplements overstating their contents to the public. On the other hand most companies are taking the time to procure lab reports to mitigate the aftershocks of such practices. This well documented but often expensive third party lab testing by organisations such as Phytovista can regain the trust lost by some consumers. For instance we at All Round CBD openly publish these lab reports after they have been checked and rechecked by the relevant authorities to show we mean what we say on the label. But why exactly are lab reports a crucial factor in the major health benefits of CBD Oil? This is because the amount of CBD dosage stated on a label mirrors the health benefits gained from a product. For example a customer looking for low strength CBD Oil will know they are just starting out in urging their cannabinoid receptors to receive CBD. Accordingly they will take the lowest dose. But the respective benefits they get from this dosage can be skewed if there aren't the necessary lab reports at hand to show they are getting what they pay for. To finish things off hopefully you can see the major health benefits of CBD Oil as complimenting your Endo-Cannabinoid system in order to help maintain your body's normal functions. Secondly the benefits of CBD Oil are enhanced through combining it with other natural ingredients. These two factors have allowed CBD to grow as a market and gain consumer trust. Although there are some bogus CBD products out there the vast majority of companies accurately state what’s on their label thereby allowing sales to continue."
6,Quarantine? Training in small spaces never so important,health-fitness," Quarantine? Training in small spaces never so important With the loss of our physical training routines - social situations of a regular exercise class, walking, running and training with friends - the lack of these, has been one of the stresses imposed by the restrictions of COVID-19. However, maintaining, or possibly increasing, your level of physical activity seems even more important than usual in the face of this new corona virus. Even though we don't know how training and exercise can affect the fight against this particular virus, we know that regular physical activity stimulates the immune system in a moderate way. There are studies that show that a moderate to high daily training can strengthen the immune system. Therefore, a strong immune system can help combat the effects of viral diseases. So, exercising daily brings several benefits to all systems of the body, from bones, muscles, heart and lungs to the brain. It is worth mentioning that it increases insulin sensitivity and decreases stress hormones, which further helps the body to fight diseases. Exercise helps people manage anxiety and depression. Even a single exercise can help to remove concerns, fears, anxieties and boredom due to quarantine. But how can you train in a confined space and without access to your usual machines or exercise classes? Be flexible and less rigid Moving your exercise to your home in a trusted space may require some frustration for not being able to maintain the same pace of training as: weight training, aerobic, functional and other sports. In this age of Corona virus, be more flexible in your choice of exercise and less rigid in maintaining previous habits. Keep in mind that: The change can be good for the body. Perhaps your usual activity is weight training, yoga, Pilate's, indoor cycling or functional training ground. Your body is used to the muscles worked and the intensity of this activity. Varying your choice of exercise reduces boredom and decreases your chance of miscalculate injury due to repetitive movements. You can also develop new muscle groups. Your muscles are indifferent. Muscles don't know and don't even care what kind of workout clothes you're wearing, what space you're in, or what kind of music you're playing. Your muscles are highly adaptable. That is, if you apply a new series of exercises, increase the repetition in doing squats, your muscles will become stronger to allow you to meet the new requirement. And you can do this even in a very small area. Less weight and more repetitions, concentrating the maximum each repetition of each exercise, will make your muscle expand differently. Do exercises using your body weight as: push-ups, barbells, squats, yoga poses, Pilate's among many others. It is also very valid to practice balance training, try to challenge your standing balance and perform a balance work and develop new muscle groups Make a new exercise routine at home Here are four ways to change your exercise routine during the COVID-19 pandemic: Use on-line exercises, if possible in a group with friends. After all, it is important to socialize while training and doing new types of exercises. Look for different types of exercises to perform at home that are available on the Internet Consider taking live exercise classes on-line, if your gym and / or personal is teaching on-line. This adds a little social connection (ask a friend to join, so you can see him in class). In addition, for many of us, making an appointment for a live class will improve compliance compared to on-demand videos, which can be watched - or avoided - at any time of the day. Get out. One of the few excuses for leaving home, besides getting food and medicine, is to exercise. Exposure to nature is particularly beneficial in combating the depression of relying on the home. Try something new, at home, have fun. If you have never felt comfortable taking part in a Zumba or dance class, this may be your opportunity to try it out at home with no one around. You can choose to turn off your camera (at least until you get the moves). Do not worry, if you are not going to the gym to lose strength or muscle volume, because muscles have ""memory"" and very soon everything will be back to normal. Keep a healthy diet, as in this difficult time it is risky to go on crazy diets to lose weight. Always consult a nutritionist and check if you need food supplements and / or vitamins if necessary. Health is the most important thing now."

9,Dental Crowns and Bridges in Singapore,health-fitness," How Much Do Dental Crowns Cost in Singapore? The prices for dental crowns can vary greatly. A dental crown can cost anywhere between $600 - $2000 in Singapore on average. Crowns made of high-purity yellow gold can be very expensive. Crowns made of cheaper base-type metal may be much cheaper but may have their own drawbacks and disadvantages. Factors Determining Dental Crown Prices: Crown material/type selected. The quality of the fabricated crown How natural you need the crown to look Tooth size and tooth position / number The need for additional dental procedures such as rebuilding the tooth core, crown lengthening gum surgery etc. The skill and experience of the dentist performing your crown procedure How is a Dental Crown Made? Step 1: After assessing that your tooth would benefit from a dental crown, the dentist normally checks for signs of infection. If required, you may be advised to consider root canal treatment to remove any internal infection as necessary. Step 2: If needed, the center parts of the tooth are built up with suitable materials to form a core. This will form the central support for the crown on the tooth. Step 3. A small impression may be made of the tooth beforehand. The tooth is trimmed down (under anaesthesia if necessary to avoid discomfort) to a suitable size to accommodate a dental crown. Step 4: A dental impression or dental scan is taken of the trimmed tooth. Your dentist may record the way your teeth bite together with some impression material which hardens in the mouth. These will be used to make your dental crown. In some cases, the dentist may temporarily place a piece of soft woven cord string in the gums around the tooth, or do additional procedures, to push the gums away for a better impression / scan. This is usually removed immediately after the impression / scan. Step 5: If your dental crown is expected to take some time for processing, the dentist may use the original small impression of your tooth to immediately make a tooth-colored temporary crown for you to wear. The temporary crown is temporarily glued onto the tooth with cement that is easier for your dentist to remove. Step 6: When the crown is ready, the dentist fits the crown onto the tooth and adjusts it to fit the space as needed. If all is well, the crown is permanently cemented onto the tooth. An X-ray may be taken at this stage to check that all looks good. While dental crowns protect teeth well, they can still chip / break if under heavy use and they can still decay at the natural tooth portions! Proper brushing / flossing is always a must!"

11,Bill Gates does not want to spoil the party,health-fitness," Answering questions during an interview on CNN in the evening of April 30, 2020, billionaire Bill Gates said that, as much as he is praying and working hard with other stakeholders to make Covid-19 vaccines available in the future, it is not an easy task.  He pushed back on rumors circulating in some circles accusing him of betting against Covid-19 vaccines. ""I wouldn’t do such a thing, and I do not have anything to lose if the world were to have a vaccine tomorrow,"" said the founder of Microsoft. He was just realistic, he said. A lot of work and preparation goes into the making of a vaccine. Of paramount importance is determining whether a particular vaccine would be effective. Nobody wants a half-baked vaccine that would worsen the disease that it was supposed to prevent.  Strict guidelines are required, Bill Gates said, before a vaccine is deemed suitable to be used in humans, especially those who are healthy. Think about the prospect of injecting a substance that could endanger the safety of a healthy person, he said. No vaccine regulator would want to take that risk. Answering questions from Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Bill Gates emphasized that vaccine regulators would only support a vaccine if it is proven to be safe and effective in humans, not just in animal models like monkeys. Progress made so far in the race towards a vaccine for Covid-19 has been very impressive, he said, but even if research steps line up and researchers are lucky, he does not see Covid-19 vaccines rolling out before 2021. Bill Gates pointed out that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the infectious disease expert and leader of President Trump’s White House Coronavirus Task Force, agrees with his position on the timing prospect of a Covid-19 Vaccine.  After the vaccine is developed, the next step would be thinking about how to make it in a large enough quantity to get to people who need it the most. Responding to a question by Dr. Gupta as to whom and which countries should first get the vaccine when it becomes available, Bill Gates said that the issue of distribution is ultimately going to be worked out by the World Health Organization (WHO). To help them in this decision, the WHO uses specific guidelines:  which countries financed the vaccine research, which countries participated in the human trials, and which countries are being hardest hit by the virus.  Rationing of the vaccine is a possibility if it is in short supply, he said. A cheap and plentiful vaccine supply may not need any rationing and could reach anyone who needs it. Without an effective vaccine, people’s way of life will dramatically change, he said. Meanwhile, Covid-19 testing with same-day results, isolation of people who test positive, and follow up and quarantine of their known contacts, in addition to other precautions (social distancing, hand washing, etc.), should continue. As people wait and pray for a Covid-19 vaccine, no country, even those as hot as Nigeria, is exempt from this virus, said Bill Gates. Every country should prepare for their moment of onslaught. End"

14,What Parents can Expect as Babies Develop,health-fitness," Book Review: Touchpoints - Birth to Three by Berry Brazelton, MD From the day they are born, babies’ motor movements and their social and emotional abilities steadily unfold and develop alongside their physical appearance. These changes, most of them completely normal, may still concern their mothers and fathers. An alteration in the shape of their baby’s head is an example of physical development that worries parents, according to Brazelton, a pediatrician and a child psychiatrist.  A variation in levels of alertness is an example of a behavioral change in babies that confuses some parents. Some developments are subtle, like when a baby tracks its mother’s movements out of the corner of its eyes, while others – like smiling and laughing out loud – are dramatic and surprising to parents. When certain changes occur, or fail to occur, parents become anxious and worried, according to Brazelton.  The list of parental concerns is long. They worry whether the baby will be able to grow teeth, sit, crawl, walk, talk, or develop a normal level of intelligence. In his book Touchpoints - Birth to Three, Dr. Brazelton points out that every parental worry is an opportunity for the medical practitioner to explain what is going on in the body and the mind of the baby, and whether it is an expected but transient physical or emotional occurrence. Parents who understand what is causing a particular behavior in their children are generally eager to become part of the solution and participate in prescribed remedies, explains Brazelton. Part of what is driving the behavioral changes in the newborn is their maturing nervous system, as well as their developing desire to assert autonomy, in violation of the mothers' natural tendency to remain in charge. Therefore, the more the mother tries to restrain the infant, the more the infant pushes back against the mother. Learning how to respect, recognize, and support what the infant is trying to accomplish is necessary for parents and children to develop good relationships. Any parental concern is what Brazelton terms a touchpoint, providing an opportunity for the practitioner to give an insightful medical opinion, thereby enhancing parental understanding as well as alleviating their anxiety. Being upfront with parents on what to expect in their newborn as it learns to sit up, crawl, and eventually walk is essential. Although every pediatrician has their own style of interacting with children and their families, framing parental concerns and challenges encountered in child development in such a concise manner requires a tactful and knowledgeable approach. What each pediatrician brings up and discusses during routine office visits with families depends on his or her level of clinical experience, as well as their interest in child social-emotional development – an area which I feel many pediatricians have shied away from.

16,How to Understand the Physical Exercise,health-fitness," Exactly how to Recognize the Physical Dimension Workout measurement includes caring successfully for our physical body, eating the ideal type of foods, obtaining enough rest and relaxation, and working out often. Exercise is just one of those high utilize tasks that most of us do not do continually since it isn't urgent. And also, due to the fact that we don't do it one way or another we discover ourselves managing health issue and situations that come as a natural outcome of our disregard. A lot of us assume we don't have sufficient time to workout. What an altered standard! We do not have time not to. We're discussing 3 to six hours a week, or a minimum of thirty minutes a day, every other day. That barely seems an inordinate amount of time considering the remarkable benefits in terms of the impact on the other 162-165 hours of the week. And, you do not need any type of special equipment to do it. If you want to go to a fitness center or health spa to make use of the devices or enjoy some ability sporting activities such as tennis or racquetball, that's an included opportunity. But it isn't required to hone the saw. An excellent exercise program is one you can do in your own residence and one that will construct your body in 3 areas: Endurance, Versatility, as well as Toughness. Stamina comes from aerobic workout, from the cardiovascular effectiveness-- the ability of your heart to pump blood through your body. Although the heart is a muscle, it can not be exercised straight. It can just be worked out through the large muscle teams, especially the leg muscular tissues. That's why exercises like rapid walking, running, biking, swimming, cross-country-skiing, and running are so valuable. You are taken into consideration minimally fit if you can enhance your heart rate to at least one hundred beats per minute and keep it at that level for thirty minutes. Ideally you must try to increase your heart price to at least sixty percent of your maximum pulse price, the top speed your heart can beat and still pump blood through your body. Your maximum heart price is usually approved to be 220 less your age. So, if you are 40, you ought to aim for a workout heart price of 108 (220-40=180 x. 6 = 108). The ""training effect"" is typically thought about to be in between 72 and 87 percent of your individual maximum rate. Flexibility comes through stretching. A lot of experts suggest heating up previously and also cooling down/stretching after aerobic workout. Prior to, it aids loosen and also heat the muscles to plan for even more strenuous workout. After, it helps to dissipate the lactic acid so that you do not feel sore and tight. Stamina originates from muscle mass resistance exercises, like straightforward exercises, push-ups, and also from collaborating with weights. How much emphasis you place on developing toughness relies on your circumstance. If you're associated with physical labor or sports tasks, raised stamina will certainly boost your ability. If you have a basically less active work as well as success in your lifestyle does not call for a lot of stamina, a little toning with exercises along with your aerobic as well as extending exercises might be sufficient. When you exercise your perseverance beyond your previous limits, the psychological fiber is damaged, nature overcompensates, as well as next time the fiber is stronger. The essence of renewing the physical dimension is to hone the saw, to exercise our bodies often in a way that will certainly maintain as well as enhance our capacity to work as well as adapt as well as take pleasure in. We need to be wise in developing a good workout program. There is a tendency especially if you haven't been exercising in all, to overdo. That can develop unnecessary pain, injury, as well as also permanent damage. It's finest to start slowly. Any kind of exercise program need to agree with the most recent research study findings, with your medical professionals referrals as well as with your very own self recognition. If you haven't been exercising your body will most certainly protest this modification in its comfy downhill instructions. You will not like it at first, or you may also despise it but, be positive. Do it anyhow. Even if it's moistening the early morning you've set up to run, do it anyway. Ask anybody that has actually done it consistently. Little by little, your relaxing pulse price will decrease as your heart as well as oxygen processing system comes to be more effective. As you boost your body's capability to do even more requiring things, you'll find your regular activities a lot more comfy and pleasant. You'll have much more afternoon power, as well as the fatigue you've really felt that's made you ""also weary"" to exercise in the past will be changed by an energy that will rejuvenate whatever you do. As you act based upon the worth of physical health, instead of standard yourself, your self-worth, your positive self-image, as well as your stability will be exceptionally influenced."
17,The History of Psilocybin Mushrooms,health-fitness," Pre History The use of mind-altering mushrooms has pervaded human society since long prior to the birth of civilization approximately 6000 years ago, and potentially even multiple hundred thousand years into antiquity. The earliest concrete evidence consists of rock etched murals depicting mushroom iconography found in Northern Australia - with archaeologists and geologists suggesting the psychedelic-themed illustrations date to 10,000 B.C.E. While there is no hard evidence supporting earlier use it’s logical to assume humans have consumed psychoactive fungi since homo sapiens became evolutionarily distinct. Evidence of mushroom iconography in a mural found in North Africa dating to 6000 B.C. This premise is logical for two reasons; Firstly many other species actively seek out and consume psychoactive substances, such as the reindeer of Siberia/North America who eat Amanita Muscaria mushrooms, Dolphins that ingest the psychotropic venom of pufferfish, and Jaguars who consume vine, root and leaf of the hallucinogenic Caape plant. Secondly Psilocybe mushrooms are common on every inhabitable continent, therefore early hominids venturing out of the jungle onto the savanna and beyond surely saw and likely consumed them, unwittingly achieving an evolutionary advantage through the heightened state of awareness brought about by the fungi. Psilocybin (the active compound in psilocybe mushrooms) has been shown by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to create a state of hyperconnectivity between brain networks, foster an increase in neurogenesis (the creation of brain cells) and drastically alter thought pathways. The culmination of these effects may have allowed early hominids who ingested Psilocybe mushrooms to ""think outside the box"", and share deeper connection and communications with those around them. These assumptions linking mushrooms to expedited human evolution are central components of The Stoned Ape Hypothesis, put forth by legendary ethnobotanist and psychonaut Terence McKenna. This theory postulates that, along with many other factors (like cooking with fire) mushrooms were the catalyst for a doubling of human brain size in, from evolutionary perspective, an extremely short period. Mckenna argues that over the course of time, ingesting psilocybin occasioned both technological advancements and the genesis of evolutionarily advantageous ideas like language, religion/spirituality, and cultural tradition. Ancient History Returning to the (comparatively) recent past, it has been repeatedly documented that tribal societies across the globe revere psychedelic mushrooms and have used them in spiritual and therapeutic context for millenia. Various forms of indigenous Central American artwork indicate they thought these mushrooms were a means of communicating with the gods, while their nomenclature gives even more evidence of this. The Nahuatl language used by the Maya and Aztec peoples named these mushrooms Teonanácatl - which literally translates to ""flesh of the gods"". Many religious myths of the Aztecs, Maya, and Toltecs are rife with mention of mushrooms, even stating they were ‘given’ to distant ancestors by the serpent god Quetzocoatl - worshipped as the creator of life by all of these cultures. Mesoamerican mushroom sculptures dating to approximately 1000 B.C. Indigenous tribes in Siberia also ritualized a hallucinogenic mushroom, the same red and white spotted Amanita Muscaria which reindeer commonly consume. These cultures were and still are known to collect and drink the psychoactive urine of these reindeer, which is significantly less toxic after metabolism by the undulate. This mushroom produces effects markedly different from those of the Psilocybe genus, and unlike mesoamerican use of Psilocybe for solely divinatory purpose, Musciaria also had practical applications. Siberians utilized the altered state of consciousness elicited the Amanita to exceed ‘normal’ physical capacity, and endure inhospitable temperatures through the disassociative effects of Muscimol (the active compound in Amanita Muscaria mushrooms). It wasn’t only tribal peoples who engaged in the use of psychedelic fungi, philosophically and scientifically advanced ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Romans, and Greeks all left evidence suggesting that they too had fondness for psychedelics. In Ancient Greece cults worshipping the goddess Demeter held ritual ceremonies involving the use of a psychoactive brew that possibly contained Ergot fungus (what LSD is derived from) Psilocybe mushrooms, AND Amanita Muscaria mushrooms - which undoubtedly made for an intensely powerful experience. These ceremonies, colloquially known as ""The Eleusinian Mysteries"" were shrouded in secrecy, at the time bearing penalty of death for exposing knowledge gained during the rituals. This severe penalty made the ceremonies somewhat exclusive, often attended by members of the upper-class and preeminent scholars, artists and philosophers, such as Plato, Homer, and Aristotle. Ancient Greek carving depicting the gods Demeter and Persephone holding mushrooms The Egyptians, similar to mesoamerican societies, created numerous forms of artwork depicting mushrooms, and had vernacular terms for the psychoactive varieties translating to ""sons of the gods"" or ""food of the gods"". They believed that since mushrooms do not sprout from a seed) that they were placed on earth by the god Osiris, and therefore their consumption was limited to the priesthood and upper classes (who were also thought to be descended from the gods). It has even been theorized by Egyptologist Stephen Berlant that ancient Egyptians cultivated these mushrooms on barley grain, showing how culturally and spiritually significant their use was. Modern History The earliest reliable documentation (by a ‘western’ civilization) regarding mushroom intoxication occurred in 1799, and involved a british family who unknowingly picked several Psilocybe Semilanceata (Liberty Caps) from the shores of the Thames river and cooked a meal with them, soon after experiencing typical effects of pupil dilation, hysteria, and euphoria. This spurred the taxonomic classification in 1803 of a new species - which was first named Agaricus Semilanceatus then changed in 1871 to Psilocybe Semilanceata. The term ""Magic Mushrooms"" was introduced nearly 100 years later in a 1957 Life Magazine expose entitled ""seeking the magic mushroom"". The piece was written by banker and hobby mycologist R. Gordon Wasson who in 1955 along with his wife Valeria were among the first ""westerners"" allowed to participate in an indigenous mushroom ceremony, guided by the famous shaman Maria Sabina. Their experience took place in the small village of Huautla de Jiménez in Oaxaca Mexico, and profoundly affected Gordon, who went to great lengths publicizing it. News quickly proliferated and attracted the attention of figures like Albert Hoffman (the chemist most famous for discovering LSD) and Roger Heim (the mycologist who confirmed from samples Wasson sent him that the mushrooms were Psilocybe Cubensis). By 1958 Hoffman (who also received samples) had successfully isolated and identified the compounds psilocybin and psilocin as active ingredients, and produced synthetic versions of both compounds which were sold by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals under the name Indocybin. Excerpt from the 1957 article ""seeking the magic mushroom The popular Life article also piqued the interest of Harvard professor Timothy Leary, who was inspired to travel deep into the Mazatepec region of Mexico and experience these mushrooms for himself. Upon returning to harvard, and with the help of Richard Alpert (who later underwent a spiritual awakening and changed his name to Ram Dass) founded the infamous Harvard Psilocybin Project. Due to their personal experiences Leary and Alpert had high aspirations for psilocybin, believing that it could solve the emotional problems of ""the western man"". This project acquired (legal at the time) pharmaceutical grade psilocybin from Sandoz and used it to conduct a number of experiments; from administering to prison inmates in an attempt to reduce recidivism, to dosing Harvard students in an attempt to elicit a divinatory or spiritually significant experience (which all of the subjects had). Although the project had ethical motivations and honorable intention, there were many concerns regarding safely, administration protocols, and abuse of power over students (graduate students in leary’s classes were required to participate). These concerns were aggravated in 1961 when two students ended up in hospital after a negative psilocybin experience, and culminated during an internal meeting of Harvard professors on the 14th of march 1962, which was arguably more of a trial for Leary and Alpert. The pair were accused of abusing the substances they were researching and reprimanded, but were allowed to continue research on the condition that they remained sober. In the spring of 1963 the pair was caught giving psychedelics to undergraduates, although only graduate students were allowed to participate in the project. Leary and Alpert were both immediately dismissed, leaving to pursue their next venture ""The Zihuatanejo Project"" - a short lived psychedelic retreat in Mexico to which thousands of people applied, but only a few were selected. During the 1960s all forms of psychedelic drugs proliferated quickly throughout the countre-culture movement, until their use was banned by the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic substances. This convention sought to curb both the rising popularity of these drugs, and the subsequent disillusionment with ""the system"" which often follows their use. Interestingly (in the case of Psilocybe mushrooms) the convention prohibited the molecule Psilocybin and not the mushrooms themselves. This oversight allowed UN member countries to decide for themselves whether to ban both the psilocybin molecule and Psilocybe mushrooms, leading to a legal double standard that has allowed the mushrooms to remain legal in multiple nations (notably Brazil and Jamaica). For almost thirty years there was a hiatus in the (legal) research and proliferation of the fungi, ending in 1997 with the first post drug war Psilocybin study conducted at The University of Zurich. A team of researchers led by Dr. Franz Vollenweider explored whether brain function under the influence of psilocybin was consistent with the brain function of chronic schizophrenia patients, finding that these brain states were significantly contrasted. They also found that psilocybin increased cerebral glucose metabolism (in layman's terms brain activity) in many areas, and had dampening effects on the ego-influenced Default Mode Network. This study catalyzed research at numerous other institutions, like The Heffter Institute, The Beckley Foundation, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of Toronto. These subsequent studies have found psilocybin to be effective in the treatment of a myriad of psychological conditions, and chronic pain from conditions like cluster headaches and neuralgia. Some of the universities engaged in psychedelic research This growing body of research has also fostered a change in sentiment at all levels of government, and has propelled activists across North America to push for legal reform around ""entheogenic"" substances as a whole. Prominent and progressive cities like Denver, Chigaco, Oakland, and Santa Cruz have all decriminalized mushrooms, and there are ballot initiatives underway in more than 100 additional localities, with 3 states (California, Colorado, and New Mexico) considering state-wide decriminalization policies. The Future of Psychedelic Mushrooms The potential of decriminalization/legalization and scientifically quantifiable examples of medical benefit raise the important issue of fair access to Psilocybe mushrooms. A prime example of legalization reducing the ability of medical users ability to access the drugs they need is currently unfolding in Canada, where approximately 1 in 4 medical cannabis patients are less easily able to find cannabis post-legalization. Currently, although mushrooms are still illegal, many websites exist offering magic mushrooms online. This accessibility despite lack of regulation does not come without risks, namely a lack of regulation to ensure consistency and quality, and higher risk of a negative experiences as a result of the lack of education on proper administration. If you want to learn more about how to prepare for a psilocybin experience, maximize both the acute effects and long term benefits of psilocybin, and mitigate the risk of a ""bad trip"" check out our preparation page. In the coming years we can expect further research and clinical trials (which are currently underway - click here if you want to sign up) corroborating and expanding on the findings of studies already conducted. Exemplification of the efficacy psychedelics possess in treating psychological conditions has recently served to concrete what shamanistic societies have known for countless generations, while future archaeological discoveries hold the potential to confirm these substances have exerted significant effect on our evolution. We stand at a pivotal moment in the human history of psychedelic mushrooms - on the precipice of ending prohibition with mushroom use more widespread than ever before. We should utilize the power of democratic process to influence governing bodies into expansive research on, and the fair distribution of these profoundly metaphysical substances.

18,"Exercise To Reduce Belly Fat For A Female At Home: Hips, Kicks & Sides",health-fitness," Exercise To Reduce Belly Fat For Female At Home Keep in mind that a single abdominal exercise performed repeatedly won't give you washboard abs. Instead, use a combination of abdominal exercises to strengthen and tighten your waistline. Exercise to reduce belly fat for a female at home should incorporate the deeper and lower abdominal muscles. Applied knowledge of your anatomy along with consistency and patience are the keys to a smaller stomach. So let’s start with a basic study of our ab muscles, then examine exercises to shrink your tummy. Ab Muscle Anatomy 101 Basic knowledge of how the abdominal muscles work can be helpful to reduce your stomach. For example, know that the rectus abdominis muscle is a postural muscle. It is also a paired muscle that runs vertically, with distinct segments on each side. Furthermore, this ab muscle causes a six-pack waistline to be visible. Another notable ab muscle is the transverse abdominis. Within the abdominal region, it lies horizontally and deep beneath the rectus. Look at this muscle as a supportive one, it acts as a girdle to strengthen the core. In addition, another purpose of the transverse abdominis is to decrease the risk of a back injury. Side Plank Transition into a side plank position. Accomplish this through a horizontal leaning position on the floor. Place one elbow directly underneath your shoulder and use it to support you. Stack your legs and feet in a parallel manner, with your ankles touching. Place your other hand on your hip. Your body should remain in a straight line, with only one elbow foot and ankle touching the floor. Hold this position for about 10 seconds and maintain regular breathing consistently. Dead Bug Lay on the mat face up on your back like a dead bug, then raise both knees up simultaneously. As you raise your knees, hold your abdominal area, and allow it to contract. Maintain a natural curve of your lower back. Keep your knees raised, then fully extend your arms and legs outward. Lower your right arm and left leg simultaneously until it touches the ground. Bring your right arm and left leg back up into the position from step 1. Hold that position for a second, then extend the right leg and left arm. Hold for about five seconds. Return your right arm and left leg back to the step 1 position. Perform a total of 5 reps using the opposite leg and arm each time. Extension of the leg should create enough space between the heel and the ground beneath you. Also, your hands should maintain a little space as well. With the proper positioning, you will keep constant tension on your abdominal area and the lower back. Remember to keep a slow and controlled breathing pattern, and maintain natural spine curvature. Hip Bridge Lay across your mat with heels positioned just in front of the midline of your knee cap. Place your arms either on your chest or alongside your body. Next, drive your hips upward towards the ceiling, then hold for 5 seconds. Lower your hips, then repeat another upward hip thrust. Perform each thrust for 10 reps. This workout is very intensive on the hamstring, glutes, and lower back. Before each elevation of the hips, purposely allow your glutes to contract. An Alternate Version of The Hip Bridge Lie down on your back against the exercise mat, facing the ceiling. Raise your knees towards your chest and hold for 5 seconds. Lower your knees and hips back down to the mat. Repeat each knee raise and lower for 10 reps. Roundhouse Kicks In martial arts movies, you may notice a defensive attack called the roundhouse kick. This move is not just made for ninjas, it’s also a great exercise to reduce belly fat for a female at home. To start, elevate your leg off the ground and quickly sweep it in a sweeping half-circle motion in front of you. It should look as if you kicked with your leg in a frontal roundhouse motion. Repeat the same kick with your other leg, then the opposite for additional reps. With each roundhouse kick, keep your abs tight, your spine straight, and breathing consistent. Alternate between each leg and perform a total of 10 kicks. The Truth About How Our Food Is Altered The truth about our food can be hard to swallow, and unhealthy food is difficult too once you’re aware of its truth. A specific type of flavor enhancer commonly used in junk foods is MSG or monosodium glutamate. Avoid any food that is wrapped in a package or box, but most of all avoid this ingredient. If you eat MSG-tainted foods, it will surely be difficult to drop the weight from your waistline. Those who eat this type of food experience an increase in their appetite and they eventually gain weight. Consequently, this food additive is mind-altering and will cause your brain to remain in a state of malnourishment. As a result, the person who consumes MSG eats and eats, sometimes excessively. So don’t always assume your food is healthy and pure. In order to sell their foods, companies don’t always provide MSG labeling. Instead, they disguise the MSG as some other additive name. Hence, we must always read the ingredients of food and be aware of the ingredients to avoid. Stay away from anything with modified food starch, modified corn starch, autolyzed yeast extract, natural flavors, and smoke flavors. Conclusion In conclusion, combine applied knowledge with determination, consistency, and effort in your exercise in order to win.

19,Exercise To Reduce Belly Fat For A Female At Home: 3 Ab-Strengthening Workouts,health-fitness," Exercise To Reduce Belly Fat For Female At Home Although you may be caught up in daily responsibilities to survive, that should not be an excuse. With the right mindset and effort to produce change, miraculous results can occur in your life. Ultimately, it is up to you to take a good hard look in the mirror and fix what’s currently in your way. Then you can begin to climb over the barrier of belly fat and reach your dream body. So don’t hit the floor and start to work up a sweat just yet. First, ask yourself ""what is holding me back?"" Also, tell yourself that you will win in the end. Furthermore, know the reason why you want a smaller waistline. These questions and answers are the foundation for exercise to reduce belly fat for a female at home. Let’s discuss six different strength training exercises that focus on your core. Each will help prevent lower back pain. The Surfer Workout Lower yourself onto an exercise mat. You should feel pressure in your palms and both knees. Keep your body at a straight angle throughout the entire exercise. Extend your right arm and the left leg and then hold for 5 seconds. Then return those limbs back to the start position. Repeat the same limb movement with the opposite arms and legs, using your left arm and right leg. Fully extend your limbs with each move, using a bent foot and straight leg position. Repeat for 5 repetitions. This exercise to reduce belly fat for a female at home is possible to perform within a minimal space. Just grab your exercise mat and begin in your living room or bedroom! Rule of thumb: focus on the engagement and tightening of your core during this workout. In other words, as you exercise, work your back and abdominal regions. As a result, the effort you produce during this workout will aid in belly fat loss. With each leg and arm extension during this exercise, your abs will tighten. Cat and Cow Workout This is an excellent and simple abdominal-strengthening workout. Furthermore, it will increase the flexibility of your spine and allow for better body movement. Get face-down down on your mat with both arms and hands positioned directly below your shoulders. Position your knee directly below the hip area. Maintain both arms and legs in this crouched position. While crouched, gently arch your back and midsection upward. Arch yourself similar to how a cat would when they’re threatened. Hold this pose for a second, and then slowly drop it back down to normal. Allow your abs to sag like a cow’s midsection, once you lower your back. Repeat each raise and lowering of your midsection for a total of 5 reps. McGill Curl Lower yourself onto a mat slowly and curl your body up. Place your exercise mat underneath the small of your back for support if necessary. Bend one knee and maintain the bend throughout the whole workout. Extend your other leg fully and point your toes upward towards the ceiling. Stack each of your hands on top of each other and interlace your fingers for support. Next, perform a set of V crunches. To begin, raise your shoulder blades off the mat while you contract your abs. As a result, you should feel your abs become tighter. Hold this position for about five seconds. With each repetition, push through the elbow region and maintain that contraction. Get Wiser About Your Food Choices Exercise to reduce belly fat for a female at home is beneficial, but avoid unhealthy foods as well. If you still consume junk foods due to habit or lack of knowledge, belly fat will be harder to reduce. Many women simply do not know or care about the ingredients inside their food. Furthermore, they have no idea of the effect that each has upon their body after digestion. Ideally, we would like to live in a world where worrying about the ingredients of our foods wasn’t so critical. But unfortunately, companies are fraudulent and put numerous additives inside the food they sell. As a result, we must arm ourselves with the difference between organic and processed foods. Organic food is pure and undiluted and processed food is altered with artificial ingredients. So make the right choice, skip the junk foods, and go organic! Conclusion In conclusion, work hard at exercise to reduce belly fat for a female at home while you schedule yourself accordingly. It’s not easy being your own boss, but you must be strict on yourself in order to see results. It is often our willingness to self-critique on a new level of scrutiny that will help us achieve new goals. However, we are not always able to judge the person in the mirror enough as necessary. So be your own boss and get out of your comfort zone today! Determine what are the best times to exercise for you daily. Don’t make excuses to not work out, instead make excuses to workout. Hence, you must create your own schedule rather than let your schedule create you. Be the type of person who works their way around things in order to remain consistent and goal-oriented."
20,Exercise To Reduce Belly Fat For A Female At Home: Basic Ways To Lose Weight Through Exercise & Diet,health-fitness," Exercise To Reduce Belly Fat For Female At Home As the old saying goes, practice makes perfect. Exercise to reduce belly fat for a female at home is not easy. However, simple mindset decisions can make your weight loss journey more enjoyable. As a result, time and work will go by easier and before you know it your waistline will shrink. For example, train your body to work as you adopt a new mindset simultaneously. Also, think more optimistically about the challenge of exercise in order to prepare yourself. Practice to reduce your negative thoughts and instead of feeling down, create a positive outlook. Train yourself to be more optimistic about life, and your actions will follow. Optimism is the fuel for your exercise and the key to reducing your belly fat. Basic Ways To Lose Weight Through Exercise & Diet Focus on one move, such as squats, and include them within a sequence of other exercises. For instance, perform 10 push-ups, then sit-ups and squats. Aim to perform as many rounds as you are physically capable of 5 minutes. Most weight loss is achievable through walking, swimming, and eating right. A huge 80% of your weight loss will come from exercise and diet. With that said, let’s get into examples of exercise to reduce belly fat for a female at home. Toward the end, I also provide tips on how to maintain a healthy diet which is also important. The Medicine Ball Crunch Using a medicine ball or other ball of equivalent size, place it in between your knees. This will work the muscles of your inner thighs as well as your abs. While holding the ball, touch your heels as your feet touch the floor. Then, perform a reverse crunch lift. Place your hips off the floor, then squeeze that ball as much as you can. Repeat for 5 to 10 repetitions. Push-Ups Push-ups are a great exercise to tighten your abs, shoulders, and chest. Fortunately, you don't need any equipment to perform this simple workout. So drop to the floor and let’s get this started! Get onto the floor with your hands widely-positioned, supporting your elevated body in a face-down position. The wider your hands and arms are from your chest, the easier it is to perform push-ups. This is because you use less of your triceps or more of your chest. Position your toes and legs straight in the back of you so that they align closely. Your whole body should be in a straight line. Using the strength of your arms, elevate your body down and up at a steady pace. Try to perform a total of 10 push-ups. If you choose, rest your knees on the floor with your lower legs crossed behind you. This is an alternative to the standard push-up body position of straight legs. Planks Effective belly-reducing exercise doesn’t have to include a bunch of heart-racing movement. In fact, you can shrink your core and sculpt your shoulders with a 20-second plank. Here’s how this 2-step routine is done: Get in a horizontal push-up position, but with your forearms laid on the floor. Unlike a regular push-up position, you support your body with your forearms. Hold this position for a total of 20 seconds with a flattened back and tightened abdomen. As a beginner to this exercise, try a total of 10 seconds instead. Gauge your own physical capability as you choose how long to plank. Alternating Reverse Lunges Lunges will likely cause a burning sensation in your glutes and thighs. However, lunges also work your ab muscles and back. As a result, it is a nice exercise to reduce belly fat for a female at home. Your abs will tighten as you keep your body in an upright position during each lunge. Here are the steps: Put your hands on your waist as you stand straight. Bend your left leg and stand your foot on its toes as you remain standing straight. In this position, elevate your body down to a kneel. Make sure your knee stays back behind your toes. It is important to remain in one place with your upper body locked in a vertical position. Do not allow your body to move forward during each lunge. Your glutes, hips, and thighs should begin to tighten while performing. Stand back up into the position of step 1. Repeat steps 2 and 3, then back to step 1 for a total of 10 lunges. How Our Metabolism Affects Our Ability To Lose Belly Fat One factor which results in weight loss is an elevated level of metabolism within the body. Active metabolism will occur through proper pre and post-exercise nutrition. Therefore, you must not starve yourself right after physical activity. Lack of nutrition during this time will cause your metabolism to drop. Another key to a smaller stomach is a diet of smaller-sized meals at increased intervals daily. Small meals throughout the day rather than 3 big meals will keep your metabolism up. Wise Up And Read Your Food Labels Protect your waistline from accumulating more belly fat with the knowledge of food additives. The problem with processed foods is that they have flavor enhancers and MSG. One food additive is the flavor enhancer which is an elusive technique used by corporations. This flavor enhancer is a trick to sell lower-quality food to the masses. The better the food tastes, the more likely uneducated consumers are to buy it. But unfortunately, this trick is at the cost of our nutrition. To avoid the trap, just read your food labels and ingredients on a regular basis. Stay away from modified food starch-modified. MSG, modified food starch, modified sodium glutamate, modified food starch, and natural flavors. Conclusion In conclusion, combine the power of your optimism, actions applied knowledge, and activity to lose weight. As you merge these powerful tools and use them to your advantage consistently, you will feel better than ever. It is really quite miraculous what we can achieve with a new realization of our potential. In addition, the new potential is the path to a new life and the achievement of your dreams. So equip yourself with the tools that are already at your disposal and get going! At the end of the day, your mind, heart, and body are your greatest weapons.

2,Eliminate Negative Thoughts And Lose Weight,health-fitness," You think thousands of thoughts each day. You talk to yourself more than anyone else. You are your most trusted advisor and confidant. Many of the conversations that you have with yourself you would never share with anyone else because to do so would expose the ""real"" you. The you that is filled with self doubt, worries, sadness, guilt, hurts and disappointments. But this is not the ""real you"" at all. This is the you that your ego and belief systems have constructed. These negative beliefs have been constructed by you, and accepted by you as truth. The sad thing is that nothing can be further from the truth. Where did these false ideas about you originate? They mostly came from others; parents, teachers, co-workers, and friends. They might have planted the seed by saying something like ""she is fat"" and you have cultivated those comments to the point that they have become your truth. You are allowing your entire life to be controlled by some obscure comments made years ago. Nobody has the right or power to dictate who you are. Only you know who you truly are and what’s in your heart. When you were born you entered this world without the burdens of you current negative belief system. You entered this world as a beautiful bundle of joy filled with unlimited potential and possibilities. I’m here to tell you that you have not changed. You are still and will always be a beautiful bundle of joy with unlimited potential and possibilities. The only difference is what you give your attention to. Let me ask you a question. If you stopped all the negative talk that you currently have with yourself such as; – I’m too fat – Why would anyone want to love me – I will never be thin – I always fail And the list can go on and on… How would you feel ? Do you think that you would feel emotionally lighter ? Do you think that you would feel happier ? Do you think that you would feel more confident ? Now how do you think your life would change if you were to go one step further and modify your self talk by only speaking positively about yourself. If you take some time and focus on what you like about yourself and focus on only that your emotional state will become positive to the point that you will be able to accomplish anything. Once you begin looking for the positive things within you, you will be surprised to realize your magnificence has always been there just below the surface. You have never been anything other then that shining bundle of joy that entered the world years ago. It’s easy to uncover positive aspects of yourself by asking some questions. – What am I good at? – Who has benefited by me being in the world? – Who am I, what is in my heart that only I know? – What do I like about my body? Your goal is to feel good now. How do you feel now? If you only observe what you feel is positive about you, you will feel good, you will be happy. Decide right here and right now how you want to feel. Decide that you will always look for the good within you and appreciate that goodness. So what does all of this have to do with losing weight? Everything!!! Your emotional state is the control valve that determines what you draw into your experience. How you talk to yourself creates your beliefs and programs your subconscious. So you need to ask yourself do you want your beliefs and subconscious programming to be based on false negative thinking. Or do you want your beliefs to be based on the truth, that you are and always have been a perfect being. Begin today to love and nurture yourself. Allow the joy, playfulness and enthusiasm that you naturally had as a child begin to flow into your everyday experiences. Allow yourself to celebrate each and every success no matter how small. Love and appreciate yourself every opportunity you have. Do this everyday and watch your weight begin to dissolve just as your old negative beliefs about yourself begin to dissolve."

4,Differences between ceramic and titanium dental implants,health-fitness," If you are considering getting dental implants, you should research and understand your options before getting them. Various types of implants have different pro’s and con’s and you need to know which ones are right for you. With each types of implants, there are various factors that you should look at such as pricing, reliability, and safety. Due to recent developments in dental technology, some materials are better for you than others due to reaction in some patients. Let’s not forget that the implants are a foreign part to your body and it might react differently based on allergies and other factors. Quick overview of dental implant basics: Dental implants have been becoming more and more popular in different parts of the world and can be used to fix problems or even just for the aesthetic look. •	Dental Implants function in the same way as natural teeth •	They can improve speech problems •	You can literally eat all the foods you enjoy without having to worry about tooth ache’s and other dental issues •	They are durable and last for a long period of time •	Dental Implants are always made to match your natural teeth to avoid any discomfort so you will always get used to them in a quick manner •	They can replace any tooth in your mouth Titanium vs Ceramic Dental Implants The two types of dental implants are either titanium or ceramic implants. In appearance they are the same but they share many differences with each other. In terms of structure, ceramic implants are one piece, whereas titanium implants have a titanium base and an upper tooth which will be secured once the titanium portion becomes stable in the jaw structure. There are other differences such as pricing, how long they last, and the healing after the procedure but both however, can be worn or cracked even though they last for decades. Titanium Implants Titanium implants have been used and tested since 60 years ago. They were developed in the early 60s and have been proven to last in the long term. They are strong and extremely resilient to cracks. Titanium Implants are made from two parts which allow for easier and better placement. There is a bottom part which is attached to the jaw structure and once stable the tooth part is placed and can be adjusted for a perfect natural look. Ceramic implants on the other hand are a one-piece implant and require more skill to be placed in your jaw. Ceramic Implants Ceramic implants have been the newer form of implants but many prefer them over titanium. As we mentioned above some patients do have an allergic reaction to titanium so their only option is ceramic implants. They have been in use since the turn of the century in Europe but in USA, dentist became using these implants since 2009. Even though they have not been used as long as titanium, still many practitioners prefer them because they also allow for a long-lasting result. The down site to ceramic implants is that they are more likely to get cracks and fractures but the repair process is fairly simpler than titanium since they are one-piece. A lot of patients have reported for a more natural-looking results as they don’t have a titanium base which can sometimes be seen when smiling. Replacing a full set of teeth is with ceramic implants over titanium is definitely the better option but keep in mind that your dentist should be experienced enough to do so. Price of both type of implants There is a difference in the pricing between the two types of implants. Due to the manufacturing cost and time-consuming procedure, ceramic implants are more expensive than titanium implants. If however money is not an issue the best cosmetic results will come from ceramic. Titanium implants have a small risk factor that the metal may eventually show through the gum and could potentially develop a color. Which type of dental implants are right for you? When picking between ceramic and titanium implants you should consider all the factors that we mentioned above. Ceramic implants would also favor the younger people since older patients have thinner gum tissue and titanium have a higher chance of showing up when they are placed. Also if you are allergic to titanium then your only option is ceramic. Keep these factors in mind when choosing the right dental implant for you."

6,Does Alli Weight Loss Pill Actually Work?,health-fitness," Alli weight loss pill is an over the counter medication which is meant for overweight people especially adults trying to lose extra pounds. With its easy availability and weight loss commitments, is Alli really the actual reason behind your weight loss? Let’s understand its mechanism. What is Alli? Alli is a 60-milligram, non-prescriptive form of orlistat (Xenical), a 120-milligram prescribed medication. Both Xenical and Alli are intended to be utilized as a major aspect of a weight loss plan that incorporates a low-calorie, low-fat eating regimen, and standard physical movement. Alli is recommended for use in grown-ups 18 and more established who have a (BMI) body mass index of at least 25. Xenical is endorsed for use in grown-ups with a BMI of at least 30 (fat), and those with a BMI- body mass index of 28 to 30 (overweight) who have other health issues, for example, hypertension or diabetes. Are there any concerns about Alli and Orlistat? The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) distributed a survey of orlistat in 2010 as a result of uncommon reports of genuine liver problems in individuals consuming it. The FDA found no proof to affirm that orlistat was the reason for the reported liver issues. In any case, Xenical and Alli labels were updated due to the reports. Converse with your doctor quickly on the off chance that you have signs or side effects that may indicate liver issues: Itching Light-colored stool Yellow eyes or skin Brown urine Loss of appetite What is the working mechanism of Alli? Orlistat (the main component in Alli) elevates weight reduction by lessening the measure of dietary fat preserved in your digestion tracts. Lipase, a chemical found in the stomach related tract, assists break with bringing down dietary fat into littler segments, so it very well may be utilized or put away for energy. Orlistat hinders the working of lipase. At the point when you take the medication with milk, around 25 percent of the fat you intake isn't separated and is dispensed with through solid discharges. How is Alli consumed? One Alli pill 60 mg is taken within an hour of a fat-containing food up to 3 times a day. Daily fat intake should be divided into 3 main meals and should not be more than 30% of the total calories. The manufacturer suggests a fat consumption of about 20 grams a meal. If you intake a meal that includes no fat then you do not require a dose of weight loss pill, if you take it with a high-fat food then you will probably observe more severe gastrointestinal side effects. Does the weight loss pill have side effects? The active component in orlistat and Alli produces gastrointestinal side effects linked to undigested fats passing from your digestive system. They usually subside over time and with suitable use of the prescription. These side effects include: Oily discharge from the anus Abdominal pain or distress Oily stools Gas with oiled anal discharge Hard-to-control bowel motilities More-frequent bowel movements Other potential side effects comprise of: Headache Upper respiratory infection Back pain"

8,How to get built to last a lifetime,health-fitness," Would you like to stay in attention-grabbing muscular shape for as long as you’re alive and be able to exercise? And become mentally and physically tough to withstand the stress, pressure and problems that come your way during your time on this planet? If you say ""yes"" to both of these questions, then read on. Proper weight training can give you this – and contrary to the general opinion, it doesn’t have to take joint-busting, spine-crushing poundages. Your muscular look can last a lifetime, without soft-tissue damage or a lot of work, if you train smart. Whether you’re 18 years and just starting your muscle building journey or a 50 year old trainee who has been lifting for years, training smart means training in the most efficient, safest and fastest ways to build muscle and burn fat. Over the past decade, Steve and Becky Holman have developed a workout system for men and women, that they call the F4X Training System. It is a revolutionary way of combining four specific exercises done in literally a matter of minutes. That’s all you need! And you can’t find this youth-enhancing system anywhere else! You don’t have to do endless cardio sessions, as the F4X Training System is a great cardiovascular workout, and you don’t have to spend an hour a day in the gym. The F4X Training System will be your personal breakthrough, to achieve your ideal body, to stay in tip-top shape with minimal time, and to have a life outside the gym. However, you have to be prepared for some hard work – anything that gives you this kind of radical age-defying results that have stood the test of decades, will never be like a walk in the park.But it’s fast, efficient and safe. This is a routine you’ve never seen before, and you will get in and out of the gym in record time. Our bodies all age, one day at a time, but you can slow the aging process down and totally reshape your body, to the point to where you look ten years younger in less than 90 days. The F4X Protocol has three phases. Each phase is designed to give you exactly what you want for your body. These few simple variations in the F4X Protocol plus the F4X Lean Meal Plan, will get you exactly where you want to go. If you want to lose 50, or even 100 pounds or more, you will be doing Phase 1, with slight variations in movement, style and nutrition. After you start to lose all the weight you desire, only then you should proceed to Phase 2, the F4X Shape. Once you lost all your fat you wanted, you can get some more muscle on your frame. Here you will slightly change your lifting style and nutrition plan. An added benefit of the F4X Shape phase is that you burn even more body fat because you’ve added lean muscle. Muscle burns 95% of your calories at rest. So the more muscle you have, the more food you can eat! If you like the look of a fitness pro, or what is called ""a mini bodybuilder, you proceed to Phase 3, called the F4X Build. You can build 15-20 extra pounds of muscle on your frame. It’s the same foundational plan with some slight variations to the lifts and diet. You remain in total control. Here is the really good part, and especially for the ladies, you are in total control. You can simply stop when you have gained the muscle you want. And then you maintain it while using an even easier protocol. Steve and Becky’s motto is: Make it simple, yet make it challenging! If you like to wake up energized before the alarm goes off, rarely if ever be limited by typical age-related aches and pains, radically alter the shape, tone, and body fat you currently have and drop all the weight you desire in just 90 minutes per week, and so much more, than make a wise decision and start with the F4X Training System.

Glutathione is essential for life; without it we could not survive. High levels of Glutathione are essential for health and vitality. As we age our immune system becomes weaker and more susceptible to outside invaders. It is well known that Glutathione is a center piece of our immune system. Blood Glutathione levels have been identified as being one of the most important indicators of our overall health. The Y-Age Glutathione patch increases the body's glutathione levels in a safe and natural way. Medical experts say that lifespan is directly equivalent to the amount of Glutathione in your body. With its ability to protect and detoxify, it also provides crucial immune system support. It's also worth noting that glutathione is incredibly well researched. In fact, thousands of clinical studies have been conducted on this powerful antioxidant. As the primary defense against invaders from outside and inside the body, the importance of the immune system cannot be overstated. Present methods Oral supplements of Glutathione are destroyed by stomach acids. Glutathione is a tri-peptide It is made from several amino acids; cysteine, glycine, and glutamate (also known as glutamic acid) by adding these amino acids to the diet it does not guarantee elevated levels of Glutathione. Injections of Glutathione does translate into elevated levels of Glutathione in the blood however you will find this method is undesirable on a daily basis, it is expensive and inconvenient.

After 24 hours of using the Glutathione patch, the average blood Glutathione levels of all individuals increased to over 3 TIMES HIGHER than normal. , How do the patches work The science of photo therapy, which has been around for about 100 years, uses light to improve the health of the body. And modern forms of photo therapy such as Low Level Laser Therapy, which helps reduce wrinkles in the skin, are very well understood scientifically. But this idea is nothing new. As far back as two thousand years ago, the ancient Greeks had a centre for studying the effects of different coloured lights on human health. Even the ancient Egyptians, who promoted health by focusing sunlight through coloured glass on certain areas of the body, understood this concept. How Our lifewave Patches Work Your body emits heat in the form of infrared light. Our patches are designed to trap this infrared light when placed on the body, which causes them to reflect particular wavelengths of light. This process stimulates specific points on the skin that signal the body to produce health benefits unique to each LifeWave patch. Each patch is exclusively designed to reflect particular wavelengths of light that stimulate specific points on the skin. This enables each patch to provide unique health benefits. No drugs or chemicals enter your body. How Does This Relate to Immune System Support? Y-Age Glutathione reflects particular wavelengths of light, which stimulate specific points on the skin that increase production of glutathione in the body. This helps decrease inflammation and increase antioxidant production, all of which leads to a stronger immune system that can support your body to fight of sickness, disease and viruses.

Brew for one or two minutes before enjoying it. The brewing time can also determine the taste of the tea. If you want to enjoy a cup of green tea with a strong flavor, you can brew it a little bit longer. For a mild taste, just brew the tea for no more than 2 minutes. Choose Dried Green Tea You can find a variety of green tea products in the market such as dried, powder or extract, and even instant green tea. The best one for a green tea diet plan is the dried green tea. Dried green tea is considered as the best one because the ingredient is still natural.

Indeed, you can still get health benefits from the green tea powder or extract as long as there are no additional ingredients. Instant green tea is not a recommended diet because most of the products are mixed with sugar, milk, cream, or any kind of sweetener that is not good for your health.

The most important thing is that you know how to drink the tea correctly so you get a maximal result and reduce the risks.

I believe that if each and every one of us were to become curious about our own connections and disconnections we would relate to each other and live our lives so very differently. This, in-turn, I believe, would have an impact on society, the environment and the planet we live on. I believe that the most important relationship is the one you have with yourself. And when you know yourself and live your life in a way that is true to your ""Self"" this creates a positive ripple effect which will start to impact those around you. They, in-turn, may then become curious about themselves and cause more positive ripple effects, the movement of positive ripples and their effect is infinite. I believe, each and every one of us are connected to a web that stretches out across the world. A web that connects us all. When I reflect on a counselling session that I have had and think about my clients, I often reflect, meditate and consider how unique, different and similar to each other we are and how connected to each other we are, even though sometimes we lose site of this. Clients that find themselves in my therapy room normally have done just that, lost sight of this (it may ,however, take some time before they become conscious of this) And at the same time I find myself considering how disconnected with ourselves we are and how perhaps this disconnection with ourselves has perhaps caused us to disconnect with the earth that we live on, the planet that sustains us, which keeps revolving and sustaining us regardless of our disregard for it. ""We live on a blue planet, that circles a ball of fire, next to a moon that moves the sea"" And you don’t believe in miracles? (source anonymous) I believe by reconnecting with ourselves, perhaps we will reconnect with the earth, a longing for that reconnection, I believe, is buried deep within each and every one of us. I believe that we need to reconnect with ourselves in order to truly connect with the earth and my hope is that by doing this work on ourselves we will stop taking this amazing blue planet for granted, without which we would cease to exist. Coronavirus perhaps is a stark reminder of how connected each and every one of us is with the other and how this connected web stretches out across the whole world. The paradox is, at the time of writing this March 2020, most of the world is on lockdown, or at least heading that way and most of us are practising Social Distancing, to keep ourselves, our countries and each other safe. This crisis is devastating and extremely tragic, the impact and the enormity of this Pandemic will have a lasting impact on us for many years to come. I have also found myself reflecting on Shamanic philosophy. Shamans describe tipping points, which I believe this is, as times that are full of possibility. I have reflected and meditated on this philosophy at various points in my life over the last few years. First, I noticed a lot of resistance to this possibility and now I find myself fully embracing and embodying it. If any of this resonates with you, or perhaps even if it doesn’t you may want to consider embarking on a course of psychotherapy, or you may be curious enough to play the video, found on my website, www.findingyou.co.uk (Video coming soon) which invites you to tune into yourself for a few minutes using your breath and asks what do you notice? The breath is the first Spirit you connect with when you are born and from that moment on, the breath that gives us life works so automatically that we take this Spirit, this Life Force that flows through our bodies pretty much for granted. The breath can be used as a tool to connect with the ""Self"", cleanse, balance and heal the body, curious? perhaps give it a go. Self-care which is ""part and parcel"" of the counselling process, invites you to figure out what you find useful, what helps you and what does not."
2,Our Battle with corona virus and effectiveness of hand wash,health-fitness," The threat from the coronavirus multiplying rapidly worldwide. Yes, the whole world is now at war, and our hands are at the front lines in the fight against Covid-19. You can pick up droplets of the virus, and they will enter our bodies if we touch our faces. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health organizations are emphasizing on the importance of washing hands to slow the growth of this pandemic. Why is handwashing with Soap and Water important? Our hand is exposed to thousands of dangerous germs and bacteria each day—Thats, why Proper handwashing with soap and running water, is very crucial. Soaps are molecules with dual nature. One end of the molecule is attracted to water and resisted by fats and proteins. On the other hand, the other side of the molecule is drawn to fats and opposed by water. This dual nature of soap makes it useful in killing germs. One side of the soap molecule, which is attracted to fat and repelled by water, breaks the virus's coat and makes it soluble in water.E Even if every virus is not destroyed, you will still get rid of them from your hands with soap and water. How to wash: •	Wet your hands •	take soap •	Lather •	Rub your hands together for 20 seconds atleast •	Rinse with water •	Dry Diseases You Can Prevent Just by Washing Your Hands Believe it or not, only 5% of people correctly wash their hands. The following are just a few of the ones that you can prevent with careful handwashing. •	coronavirus •	Norovirus •	The flu •	Pink eye •	Salmonellosis •	Mononucleosis •	Cytomegalovirus •	Staph •	RSV •	Hepatitis A •	Strep throat •	Giardiasis •	E. coli •	common cold Hand washing Mistakes According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, washing hands with soap can protect about one third young children who get sick with diarrhea and almost one fifth with respiratory infections like pneumonia."" If you want to make sure your hands aren't carriers for germs, make sure you are not making the following mistakes: •	Don't reach for the soap first. Wet your hands first, as damp skin can easily absorb the solvent and produces a better lather and more efficiently removes bacteria. •	Once you wet and soap up your hands, make sure you lather them for at least 20 seconds •	Make sure you are using enough soap. •	Don't forget to dry your hands after washing. Germs can be transferred easily to and from wet hands. You might re-contaminate your hand again if you grab the door handle with wet hands. •	Wash your hands frequently, not just after using the toilet. •	Germs and bacteria can quickly get stuck under your fingernails. Washing hands won't be useful if you're not careful about your nails. •	Do not skip the soap entirely while washing •	Do not touch the faucet right after washing. You can use a paper towel to turn off the tap. •	Do not touch the door handle after wash? •	Hand Dryers are not better than Paper Towels •	Do not Neglect the Backs of Your Hands When to wash your hands: •	Before and after caring for sick people •	While preparing or eating food. •	After using the toilet •	after touching raw food •	After coughing or sneezing. •	After touching an animal. •	After touching garbage. How to Keep Your Skin Healthy While Washing Your Hands frequently. Thorough hand washing may keep germs away, but damage your skin. Wash in warm water instead of hot water to prevent it from getting dry. You can use hand sanitizers temporarily when hands are extremely roughened. If you have eczema or psoriasis, use skin balm like Vaseline directly onto sores or cracked areas. •	according to skin experts, the following things can help: •	Wash with warm water •	Use moisturizing soap or hand wash •	Apply moisturizer after wash •	Wear gloves •	use skin balm •	use hand sanitizer •	Blot dry instead of wiping Cold Water vs. Hot water According to a recent study, cold water is just as useful for killing germs as hot water. The scientists looked at several variables like hand wash technique, lather time, use of antibacterial soaps, water temperature, etc. They found there is no real difference between hand washings at 15°C and 38°C. Instead, the study suggests lather time is more critical. A minimum 20-second scrub is more effective in reducing germs than a 5-second lather. The Centers for Disease Control also recommend the same. Hand sanitizer vs. hand wash Hand sanitizers are convenient to use on the go. They are available as wipes or in gel form. You can use them where soap and running water are not available. Before you purchase one, check ingredients and make sure it contains at least 60 percent alcohol. But soap and water are more effective than these dab of gel. You should use a hand wash where possible. Soaps are more effective because when you wash your hands with soap and water, you're demolishing the viruses. Tips for kids Here are several tips and tricks that parents, teachers or care givers can follow: •	Pick your child's favorite song and have them sing it while washing their hands. •	Make sure the sink is within their reach •	You can use fun stuffs like foam, liquid soap with colors, products with child-friendly scents or bright colored bottles. •	Play a game while hand-washing."

Before you go shopping a lip gloss, you need to know about some basics. Lip gloss is mainly used to add some shine and color to your lips along with moisture. Some people love to use them because of the added flavors as well. These are available both online, drugstores, department stores, etc. Before you pick, think about which features you want. Is it the color, the shine, the flavors, or all of them? If you don't want to wear lipstick underneath, you can pick a colored lip gloss. Colored glosses can be two types- full-colored or sheer with a hint of colors. Choose a color that is darker than your skin tone. If you are wearing heavy makeup or eyeshadow, avoid colored lip gloss. This can provide too much color. Pick clear glosses if you are going for classes.

Never apply gloss on your rough, cracked, or chapped lips. There are many good lip scrubs available in the market. You can make your own at home, as well. Use petroleum jelly or lip balm after you exploit. Apply the gloss once you have finished your face makeup. Use lip pencil at the edge of your lips to make it look natural and blend it while you apply the gloss. If you want to apply lipstick underneath, use it now. Then apply your gloss. The applicator can be a wand, roll-on tube, or sponge. Apply it starting from the middle of your bottom lip and spread it lightly toward the edges.

4,Two Days a Week Strength Training,health-fitness," 2 Days a Week Strength Training Training twice a week is something I've tried several times and always had success with it. Lots of people have an all or nothing attitude to training. Many people either stop training because they are busy and believe they have to spend loads of time in the gym to achieve any results. They would be better off doing two days consistently as everyone can get to the gym for two sessions a week if it's a priority for them. In my first year, I started strength training I only trained twice a week for and had good results. After that year, I could deadlift 180kg easily and gained 12kg in body weight. I have since had several short, but successful spells with twice a week training. I also have a few clients who only train twice a week, and they have all been making good progress Who could this be a good option for? Someone with a busy schedule and struggles to make it to the gym more often. # Someone who simply don't want to go to the gym more often, but wants to be in shape. For people who play sports and have other training commitments that are their priority, and only strength train to help improve their performance in their sport, and so can't spend an excessive amount of time lifting weights. Someone who recovery issues. People who have not been able to stick to a routine. For a short time when life is crazy. The key to making progress is doing this consistently over a long period of time. No matter how busy life is I can always train two days a week and make progress. I can then train I'm not writing this article expecting people to change their routine if they're able to do four times a week and are making progress. This is a good option for How did I set up my training? There were two ways my assistance work. Option 1 A -  Squat - Bench press - Lower assistance exercises B - Deadlift - Bench press - Upper body assistance exercises Option 2 A -  Squat - Bench press - 3/4 Assistance exercises B - Deadlift - Overhead press - 3/4 Assistance exercises You can use different main exercises. I sometimes used the trap bar deadlift, overhead press, and dips. Main work progression I would pick a rep range for each exercise such as 10-5 reps. Work up to a top set of 10. Every session you'll add weight until you can only do 5 good reps. You'll then start the cycle again with a weight you can do 8 reps with. This should be more weight than you used at the start of the last cycle. I do use other rep ranges as well such as 14-8 reps, 12-8 reps, 10-6,12-3 reps etc An example of what it might look like Week 1  100kg x 10 Week 2 102.5kg x 10 Week 3 105kg x 10 Week 4 107.5g x 9 Week 5  110kg x 8 Week 6  112.5kg x 8 Week 7 115kg x 8 Week 8 117.5 x 7 Week 9 120kg x 6 Week 10 122.5kg x 6 Week 11 125kg x 5 Week 12 110kg x 10 ( The start of a new cycle) With the squat and deadlift you'll do 2-4 back off sets after the top set with 80% of the weight you used for the top set and for the same amount of reps. These sets shouldn't be to the limit, and the bar speed should be fast for every rep. So it could look like this 200kg x 9 160kg 3 x 9 Personally, I progress well without doing any back off sets, but  some people need more volume. With the bench press, overhead press, and dips (if used as one of the main movements) you'll take 90% of the top sets and do 2-4 back off sets for the same amount of reps  as the top set. So it would look like this 100kg x 12 90kg 3 x 12 Assistance exercises would be done for 2-5 sets of 8-15 reps. I would do 3 or 4 assistance exercises a workout. Rest periods would be kept fairly short and often done as supersets so the workout didn't take too long. Another way I like to do assistance exercises is the 350 method I got from Paul Carter. With this method, you do 3 sets of as many reps as you can with 2 minutes rest in between. The aim is to get 50 reps over the 3 sets. Once you manage to get 50 reps you can add weight the next time. 100kg x 17 Rest 2 minutes 100kg x 13 Rest 2 minutes 100kg x 8 That gives me 38 reps, so I would keep the same weight until I got it to 50 reps in total. Upper body assistance exercises Upper back work (chin-ups, pull up, machine row seal row, t-bar row, dumbbell row, lat pull down etc) Dips Close grip bench press -Dumbbell bench press Lower body assistance exercises Squat variation Glute ham raise Romanian deadlift Leg press Core work (rollouts, side bends, hyperextensions etc) Option 2 assistance exercises Normally the assistance exercises would be 2 upper body pulling exercises 1 upper body pushing exercise 1 lower body exercise What could a training week strength training week look like? For option 1, it would like this, Workout A (squat, bench press and lower body work) Squats 20kg x 10, 60kg x 8, 80kgx 5, 100kg x 5, 120kg x 5, 140kg x 5 170kg x 8 135kg x 3 x 9 Bench press 20kg x 10, 40kg x 5, 60kg x 5, 80kg x 5, 100kg x 8 90kg 3 x 8 85kg x 10 RDL -  350 method Glute ham raise - 3 x 12 Wheel rollouts - 3 sets Face pulls x 200 Done between sets of other exercises Workout B (trap bar deadlift and  press and upper body workout) Trap bar deadlift (our trap bar weighs 32kg) 72kg x 10, 92kg x 5, 112kg x 5, 142kg x 5, 162kg x 3, 182kg x 3, 202kg x 1 212kg x  8 172kg x 2 x 8 Press 20kg x 10, 30kg x 5, 40kg x 5, 50kg x 5, 65 x 8 60kg x 9 55kg x 4 x 9 Close grip bench press- 3 x 12 Seal row 6 x 15 Lat pull down 3 x 12 Curls -  Rest pause set 3 sets with 15 seconds rest between sets Face pulls x 200 done between sets of other exercises For option 2 it would look like this. Workout A (squat, bench press and assistance) Squats 20kg x 10, 60kg x 8, 80kgx 5, 100kg x 5, 120kg x 5, 140kg x 5 170kg x 8 135kg x 3 x 9 Bench press 20kg x 10, 40kg x 5, 60kg x 5, 80kg x 5, 100 x 8 90kg 4 x 8 Dips 4 x 12 Chin ups 4 x 10 Seal rows 4 x 10 Glute ham raise 4 sets Workout B (trap bar deadlift and  press) Trap bar deadlift (our trap bar weighs 32kg) 72kg x 10, 92kg x 5, 112kg x 5, 142kg x 5, 162kg x 3, 182kg x 3, 202kg x 1 212kg x 8 172kg x 2 x 8 Press 20kg x 10, 30kg x 5, 40kg x 5, 50kg x 5, 65kg x 8 60kg x 9 55kg x 4 x 9 Romanian deadlift 4 x 10 Close grip bench press 4 x 10 Dumbbell row 4 x 12 Lat pull down 4 x 15 What were the benefits of twice a week training? The main one was that fitting in the workouts into my life while I had a lot going on was very easy. I tried to keep the same training days that were spread out evenly (Sunday and Wednesday), but with only having two workouts to fit in I could be flexible without it causing any problems. It does take away the excuse of not having time to train as everyone can find the time for two sessions a week. I found my motivation went up. I was looking forward to each workout and excited about training and that I would try and get a PR. I was itching to get into the gym and made training fun again. I haven't had a bad workout since I started training twice a week as I always feel recovered, fresh and excited about training when I start the workout. If you're going through a stressful time, or not getting much sleep you are likely to find this easier to recover from than if you were training 4+times a week. My joints felt great doing this after doing this. if strength and building muscle isn't your main priority it can give you more time to do cardio and mobility work. I did more much-needed mobility work at home while watching TV as I had a little more spare time. Jim Wendler has a template in his books called 2x2x2.  With this, you do two strength workouts, two mobility workouts and two conditioning/cardio workouts. This can be a well-balanced way for you to train. What are the main negatives of just training twice a week? There is only so much you can do in just two workouts. You can't spend as much time working on weak points and it can be hard to get a lot of volume in The workouts have to be really hard, and I had to push close to failure a lot, and I had to cram so much into the sessions. Mentally this was tough. One of the most frustrating things about being a personal trainer is seeing people throw all their hard work away by stopping training completely, or by taking large breaks so they end up just working to regain what they had done before. I would rather they trained twice a week consistently for a long time, than four times a week and stop once life gets busy. Or just keep two days a week as a short term option for when life gets crazy. You might surprise yourself with what you can achieve while doing so little. It' certainly much better than giving up and then having to start from scratch."

6,Your muscles is your power and beauty!,health-fitness," How to build muscles at home? You can pump up anywhere: on horizontal bars, in a free street hall, and even at home. It takes a little patience, moral resistance to various distracting things, and time. Yes, muscles grow fast only in fairy tales about ""12 weeks from IT specialist to Hulk"" or ""8 weeks from an accountant in Miss Bikini"". Workouts at home can be effective if they are conscious. A person must understand what he is doing - basic anatomy, differences between exercises from each other, technique, periodization should not be empty sounds. Do you not understand? Alternatively, you can take a good program. Or evaluate in detail the technique of each movement from the video that is shot during training. But first, you need to understand the theory a bit and go through a couple of programs for beginners. What happens to the muscles during training? The most common thing - training injures muscle fibers, nutrition and recovery helps them grow. During the lesson, we perform exercises that damage muscle fibers and create incentives for growth. When we relax, eat enough proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, and sleep, the hormonal background of the body switches to anabolism. Muscles are ""repaired"" because the body ""understands"" that they are needed, a person will soon load them again. Over time, the muscles increase, and the person acquires the physique that he wants. In fitness theory, changes in the body and muscle tissue are divided into training periods. If you are a newbie in bodybuilding Imagine that someone spent his whole life on the couch. At school, he had an exemption from physical education or some irregular activities like running or football. At the university, for a couple of years, he did not go anywhere except bars, at all, and when he saw that no one likes belly and thin pens, and shortness of breath does not add personal effectiveness. Our imaginary hero decided to build muscle. He bought home dumbbells, a horizontal bar in the doorway, stops for push-ups and dug up a set of weights at the grandfathers' cottage. He does not go to the gym, because their greedy coaches breed newcomers for money. He goes to YouTube, where some blogger teaches him to do push-ups from the floor, and pull-ups with compensation for part of the bodyweight with a jump. So our hero is engaged in push-ups, pull-ups, squats without weight, and light exercises with dumbbells. Within a month, his nervous system gets used to ""digest"" the load, sleep, appetite improves, and the strength that goes after the beginning of each lesson goes away. Power gradually grows, so he can already be wrung out more than 20 times, and is forced to acquire stops and a heavy vest. In the first 3-4 months, the growth of power is directly proportional to the growth of technical skill, therefore, when working with a trainer, tasks like pumping muscles are not posed. But you can’t motivate a beginner with this! He wants to quickly see the cubes in place of the soft abdomen, and the peak of the biceps in place of thin ""chicken"" hands. Therefore, a competent trainer in this difficult period will tell the ward about proper nutrition. With the help of normalization of the diet, a person will look better in a matter of weeks. This will be the first visual result. For training at this time, exercises with bodyweight or minimal weights are preferred. The program is built around push-ups, pull-ups, goblet squats, lunges with minimal weight, squats without weights and direct twists to the press. These exercises need to be performed slowly, follow the technique. Beginners Mistakes To begin with, those who want to know how to pump up at home google biceps exercises, and begin to carry out them fanatically. But the point is not at all in the biceps but in the absence in the body of the prerequisites for creating an anabolic background. Simply put, a person simply ""has nothing to grow"" muscles, especially if he was neglectful of nutrition, and believed that if he practices at home, then mashed potatoes with sausage will be the athlete's diet. The biggest mistake is a reluctance to develop power. Yes, yes, all the Golden Age athletes were good security officials. And even any modern cross fighter will perform CCM on individual movements in powerlifting. But the gloss from sports convinces us that ""it will do so"" - bend your hands with something, do some exercises in a multi-repetitive mode, and you’ll be inflated. Not. Strength, by the way, can be developed to a certain limit at home. The only question is desire."
7,How to get a well-defined muscle mass in a short time?,health-fitness," Today we will discuss a revolutionary product that any beginner should know and consume when he wants to start bodybuilding. We will talk about how to manage the mass gainer and its composition and which is the most ideal mass gainer for you. Where do you get your energy reserves? Another fundamental point: to ensure maximum muscle development, you need to supply your muscles with all the nutrients they need to grow. Foods are made up, to varying degrees, of macro and micronutrients. The first category includes carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, while the second includes minerals and vitamins to which we add water for completeness. No food in itself is able to provide all the nutrients in the right proportions, so one of the first tips that are given is to follow a varied diet. The second point concerns the concept of ""balance"", the ability, that is, to take all the nutrients in the right proportions. And it is precisely on this point that the debates ignite. How many grams of protein per kg of weight do you need per day? It depends on many factors such as type of training, percentage of fat mass, absorption capacity, recovery, hormonal balance, type of protein consumed, lifestyle, a form of intake, presence in the meal of other foods that promote absorption, etc. We are from the beginning. In general, it is advisable to stick to what the experimental research suggests, which claims that in strength and power sports it may be advisable not to stay below 1.7-1.8 g / kg and not exceed 2.3 g / kg - not so much for the negative effects, but for the uselessness from the metabolic point of view. What should you know as a beginner? As a beginner, you want to put on muscle mass as quickly as possible. You want to have well-defined muscles and an enviable abdomen. An unbeatable product in this area is the mass gainer. This product contains all the necessary substances to develop a well-defined muscle mass in a short period of time.

8,5 Insights For Your Physical And Mental Health,health-fitness," Yep, it’s official. We, NYS, have received the ""Major Disaster Declaration"". These are tough times. How are you making out as this crisis continues to ravage our area and the world? It is imperative that we are extremely proactive in helping not spread the virus and that we are extremely proactive on how we set ourselves up to weather this storm… I strongly encourage you to read last week’s issue for the mindset and strategies for not only surviving but thriving during this terrible time. It’s on our Blog: 9 Tactics for weathering your quarantine I know that when our immediate surroundings and everyday life are thrown into a tizzy and our very security, safety and even survival are threatened, that it makes sense to feel a bit freaked out. To feel panic. To feel overwhelmed, anxious and whirly. To feel desperate. To feel powerless and paralyzed. To feel discouraged and hopeless. To feel devastated. You might feel some or all of these feelings. You might cycle through them. You might still be in denial or resistance or you might be in shock and these feelings haven’t kicked in yet. Please know they will, and they are totally normal. These are uncertain and scary times. It makes sense they affect how you feel… But this is not an out of jail free card in that because you are impacted you let yourself and your stuff go. You let your feels take over and derail you… You allow yourself to sink down. You put your life and what’s important to you on hold, or just down right neglect it… You give up your self-agency. You let the wind blow you around… This makes things worse for yourself and your life… Don’t do this! As the infection is ramping up in the states and we expect a longer-term impact, it behooves us to be mindful of building emotional resilience, mental spaciousness and bandwidth, and physical stamina: Police your thoughts: Become vigilant of what kind of thoughts you allow yourself to have, to rent space in your head and to take you on a ride…. Watch out for apocalyptic, doomsday, major disaster, financial depression, and the like thinking that just trigger more panic, paralyzes and survival-mode. Yes, we live in dire times, but tapping into compassion, gratitude, creativity and problem solving mitigates this… We don’t have to feel like crap! Honor your feelings: Do feel your feelings, acknowledge them, and learn from them. They tell you what kind of thinking you are having and how you are able to cope. They serve as informants for how to better manage yourself. Feel your feelings. Heed them. And, take care of what they suggest – clean your thinking and be proactive about properly taking care of self… Become super conscientious: Move your thinking from drama, fatality, reactivity and such to thinking outside the box and resourcefulness… Any obstacle you encounter, think on how you can get around it. Whatever issue you face, find a creative solution for it. Stay ahead of what’s coming. Not by overreacting and being an alarmist, but by accessing your higher-level thinking and intuiting what will be needed, what will be impacted and how to respond conscientiously and industriously. Be proactive. Be responsive. Be intentional. Be progressive. Transcend the noise: Now is the time to become aggressive about streamlining, simplifying and minimizing everything in our life. We live such a life of excess, in all areas of our life… From how much stuff we buy, including food and toilet paper (ha!), to how much we do, to how much entertainment we need… It is not uncommon for people to not be able to be alone and in quiet, to be with themselves, to entertain themselves… To require constant engagement and stimulation. I say there is an opportunity for growth here with the imposed Social Distancing and Quarantining… If you can’t go outside, go inside… Here is where Juice is anyway… BE with what is and Transcend the crisis… Then operate from an Inspired state… Practice health, wellness and self-care: Now is more important than ever to ensure our physical health. It goes without saying to minimize exposure! If you are usually pretty mindful of your health and wellness habits, make sure you stay the course. Don’t let the upheaval throw you off. Tweak your routine and details of your practice as needed, but make sure you do right by yourself. If you have been slacking on your health and wellness, and self-care practice, Dude, what are you waiting for? Now, is the time to step up your game. You can use this as a new area of focus to keep yourself engaged and stimulated… It is important that we pay attention to what gets triggered for us, how we like to cope, and what defense mechanisms we use… All kinds of things get triggered in disaster or crisis situations – trauma, lack and scarcity, abandonment and aloneness, unworthiness, survival and existentialism, visibility, guilt, anger, etc. We might turn to self-soothing with more consumption like any and all kinds of shopping, eating, drinking, using substances and other kind of indulgent or reactive behavior. We might become more dramatic, needy, naggy, controlling, emotional, reactive, shutdown, withdrawn, absent, unfeeling, uncaring, callous, impatient, intolerant, self-righteous, etc. The more we exercise personal awareness, the more we can be proactive about putting in place structures, systems, routines, practices, rituals and the like to help us better manage ourselves. This ensures we inoculate our physical and mental health, so we are better prepared to withstand the onslaught of this crisis. It behooves us to be proactive in creating health and wellness. I say this is our number one priority as we weather this storm, for from this place we can handle the rest of it… It is Mental Health Month after all… Yes, weird times we live in… ​​ ASSIGNMENT: Take stock of how you are doing… Take a moment to gain more awareness about how you are really doing, what comes up for you, and how you usually deal. Knowing who you are and how you do you, be proactive in putting in place what you need to prevent triggers, use positive and healthy coping tactics, and prevent your defense mechanisms.

9,How much do treatments cost for rheumatoid arthritis cost?,health-fitness," In most cases, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) requires consistent aggressive treatment for many years to control symptoms, manage pain, and stop disease progression. There are a number of different treatment options, which can all be combined to create a well-rounded treatment strategy. Your local Riverside arthritis doctor can provide several different treatment options including: •	Medications •	Physical and occupational therapy •	Assistive devices, supportive products, and adjustments made to the home or work office •	Surgical procedures Know your insurance It’s important to know and understand what your insurance will cover so you can make informed decisions about treatment or prevention of increased symptoms. Some insurance plans only cover a portion of treatment and medications and patients may wind up paying large portions of their RA treatment  out of pocket. Prices for RA drugs have skyrocketed over the past 5 years. According to the GoodRx List Price Index, average list prices (the official prices set by the manufacturer) for RA drugs have increased by 92% since 2014, well surpassing the price increase for all brand and generic drugs. As prices for RA treatments continue to climb, some predict that treating RA will cost the U.S. $9.3 billion in 2020. While health insurance may cover a portion of treatment, it becomes difficult to pay for these medications out of pocket. In some cases, patients who are covered by medical, for example, can still end up paying 30% or more of the total costs of certain medications. Even with insurance, a patient could pay up to $600 a month in copayments for a RA prescription. Least expensive to most expensive Below is a summary of the some of the more popular and conventional treatments for RA, and their approximate cost to patients. NSAIDs Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) are medications that reduce inflammation without the use of steroids. For patients suffering from RA, reducing inflammation is an important part of managing symptoms and alleviating pain. NSAIDs  are very popular in our society, and so their availability which makes them affordable. DMARDs Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), help to reduce the swelling and pain that patients experience during flare-ups. Most patients can expect to pay between $1,500 and $2,000 annually for conventional DMARD medications. Biologics Biologics are the newest forms of RA treatments. Depending on the type of biologic medication being taken, the monthly costs can range from $1,300 to $3,000 per patient. Surgery Some patients develop side effects to medications or build up tolerances to where they are no longer effective. In other cases, the joints begin to deteriorate rapidly and doctors may recommend specific types of surgery, such as joint replacements or arthroscopic surgeries, to restore mobility and reduce pain. The average cost of a total knee replacement surgery, for example, is about $31,124 (according to Blue Cross Blue Shield). This number can range from as low as $11,317 in Montgomery, Alabama to as much as $69,654 in New York, New York. Prevention is the best medicine Unfortunately, for many patients who aren’t fully or even partially covered by health insurance, the decision as to which treatments to pursue often becomes a tradeoff between the treatment’s effectiveness and the costs. Fortunately, patients can also try other forms of relief found outside of conventional medicine. Since inflammation is the main cause of RA, reducing the intake of foods that cause inflammation such as sugar, may help to reduce the symptoms. Other less expensive treatments may include specific exercise that helps build back joint tissue, a warmer climate such as in Riverside, heat pads, and dietary supplements. Be sure to ask a qualified rheumatoid arthritis doctor before taking any medications or supplements or pursuing an exercise program."
10,Locating the best rheumatoid arthritis doctor in Riverside,health-fitness," Your rheumatoid arthritis (RA) doctor may be one of the longest relationships of your life, so it’s important that the two of you can work well together. Finding the best doctor quickly is vital in order to prevent irreversible damage to your joints. It’s best to see a doctor who knows rheumatoid arthritis inside and out, even if your condition is mild. Ideally, you should see a rheumatologist near Riverside -- a specialist in arthritis. If your family doctor suspects you might have a type of autoimmune arthritis, they will refer you to a rheumatologist, who can officially diagnose you with RA. If all goes well, you and your RA specialist will be able to communicate well, and work together as a team. What to look for in an RA doctor A doctor who listens As with any other new relationship, listening is key to building trust. It's incredibly important that they take your concerns seriously, and they listen, hear you, and answer any questions you have with care. Friendship If you can find a doctor that takes the time to get to know you on more of a personal level, you have also gained a friend. Not necessarily your best friend, but one who remembers past conversations about your family for example, and can get caught up at each appointment. Ultimately, you should feel like you have some measure of control over your care and your health, and your doctor should not feel like a stranger to you, nor you to them. Feelings of superiority or patronizing you may be a sign that it’s not a good fit. x It’s important to feel confident in your care and empowered to follow your treatment plan. If you feel rushed, dismissed, or belittled by a doctor in any way, you will want to look elsewhere. Your doctor should take the time to help you better understand your RA, what to expect from treatment, and what complementary treatments might help or hurt your condition. A few questions to ask a doctor: • Can I get an appointment on short notice if I have an RA flare? • How soon do you typically return calls or reply to your emails? • Do you work with other RA doctors that I can contact if you’re not available? Where to look for in an RA doctor The first person who can help you locate a good Riverside rheumatologist is your family doctor, who should be able to refer you to the best and most qualified. You can also call your insurance provider or hospitals in your area to ask for a list of rheumatologists close to where you live. Someone you know who also has RA may be able to give you a recommendation, or you can visit the American College of Rheumatology website where they offer a process to find a rheumatologist in your area. Location of your RA doctor With today’s technology, it’s easier than ever to stay close to your family that lives out of state, or your RA that might live some distance from you. You may be able to contact them by phone or email to ask questions in between appointments, or get on a two-way video call such as Skype or Zoom. A good doctor will be flexible and be able to treat you long distance at times, or be willing to work with your family doctor as a liaison. Be sure to ask a qualified Riverside rheumatoid arthritis doctor plenty of questions before committing to a long-term relationship with them."
11,How to squat,health-fitness," How to Squat The squat is often performed incorrectly. After reading this guide you'll know how to back squat. Setting up for the squat The first part of this guide will be about how to set up for the squat. I’ll explain where the bar should be positioned, hands width, elbow position, bracing, getting tight, walking the bar out and creating full-body tension. Bar position There are two basic bar positions on the back squat, high bar, and low bar. With the high bar squat, the bar rests on the traps, while the low bar squat rest on the rear delts.  The biggest thing to avoid while positioning the bar for the high bar squat is to make sure it’s on the traps and not on the neck.  Having the bar too high is generally the reason people have sore necks after squatting. With the low bar squat, some people get on the shoulder blades. That generally comes from letting the bar rest directly on the spine of the scapulae. Just slightly moving the bar up or down of the scapula should remove the problem. People who have shoulder problems and lack the mobility to have the bar that low without pain are better off using the high bar position. The low bar causes a slightly more forward lean low bar than the high bar squat. Ensure you are in the middle of the barbell as you set up.  Placing the bar asymmetrically on the back will cause one side to take most of the load and it will be hard to maintain your balance. Hand position In general, you should try to get your hands as close as comfortably can get without it causing pain in your wrists, shoulders, or elbows. A narrow grip will help keep your upper back tight. Elbows Try and keep your elbows down and pulled into your sides. It should feel just like you're doing a lat pull down. This will cause tension in your lats which will help with upper back tightness. Some people benefit from driving their elbows up behind the bar when doing low bar squats. This is because some people don’t have very big rear delts and driving their elbows back creates a bigger shelf to put the bar. Bracing and getting tight Getting tight, bracing and creating full-body tension is important as it reduces the chance of injuring yourself and it allows you to lift the most weight. Strong legs and hips aren’t enough to squat. You need to be able to transfer the force into the bar through the torso. To get your upper back tight, you should actively pull your shoulder blades together and maintain this the whole time the bar is on your back. As mentioned before, pull your elbows down and in towards your body unless you need to drive your elbows behind you. Before every rep, you need to take a big breath into your diaphragm to create Intraabdominal pressure. When breathing into your diaphragm, your stomach should inflate out. This helps protect your lower back. If you’re chest and shoulders raise while you take your breath you’re not breathing into your diaphragm. You will hold this breath during the rep at least until you’re 2/3 of the way back up. Contract your abs like you’re about to get punched in the stomach. This combined with taking a big breath will ensure you’re core is braced. Foot stance and angle toes point out How wide people’s stance is will vary depending on individual anatomy and their mobility. You’ll need to use trial and error to find your best stance. A good starting point is to have your heels at shoulder-width apart and slightly pointing out. See how that’s feels. Then try it an inch or two wider, and an inch or two narrower. Try with the toes pointing out and driving the knees out, and try with the feet pointing straight ahead. See how comfortable and how deep you can squat with each stance width without your back rounding. Walking the bar out of the rack First thing you need to check that the hooks are a good height. You shouldn’t ever have to tiptoe the bar out of the rack. This is a common mistake people often make. You also don’t want it too low that you waste too much energy. A good starting point is to have the hooks set so the bar is level with your sternum. With your feet the width you plan to squat with. Start your hips a bit behind the bar, take a deep breath into your stomach, tense your back, and get your hips under the bar and squatting the weight up out of the hooks. Be aggressive when unracking the bar. Once you unrack the bar, wait for a second and let the weights settle. Take a small step back with one foot, then a little step back with your second foot, and then a third step if an adjustment is needed. You want the walkout to be as efficient as possible so that you waste minimal energy. You shouldn’t ever need more than three steps to walk out. Once you’ve walked the bar out, you will already be braced and the upper body will be tight. You now want to get even tighter so you have complete control of the bar. You need to ensure you have your weight evenly distributed across your big toe, your little toe, and your heel. Next, you need to create tension in your hips. With your feet planted into the floor try and rotate your hips outwards. Do this by imagining trying to touch your heels together and move more toes towards a wall either side without actually moving your feet. Setting up for the squat 1  Place the bar on either the traps or rear delts. Ensure you're set in the middle of the bar. 2  Grip the bar as close as you comfortably can. If you’re getting wrist, elbow, or shoulder pain or discomfort, move your hands out. Drive your elbows under the bar, or behind if you need to. 3  Take a deep breath, get tight and brace before lifting the bar out of the rack. Walk the bar out, using as little energy as possible. 4 Get in your preferred stance width 5 Take another deep diaphragmatic breath. Brace like you’re going to take a punch to the stomach6 Create total body tension. The Squat When squatting, look straight ahead or slightly down. Focus on something and don’t take your eye off it. Two cues when doing the squat is sit down and sit back. When sitting down you break at the hips and knees at the same time. When you cue to sit back you break at the hips first by pushing your butt back as if you’re going to sit on a chair. Sitting down tends to keep your body more upright but there isn’t a massive difference. For most people breaking at the hips and knees at the same time will be best to start with. Try both and do what feels most comfortable. You should descend as fast as you can while being able to remain tight and remain in complete control of the barbell. Try and squat to just below parallel. Parallel is where the crease of the hip joint is level with the top of the knee. Some people are able to go lower, while some people will struggle to reach depth due to mobility issues. When at the bottom drive your traps into the bar and push your feet into the floor. Your hips and shoulders should come up at the same speed. This will keep your back angle the same throughout the lift. A common mistake is to allow your hips to rise up faster than your shoulders and end up bent over. Driving your traps into the bar should prevent that. https://chrisadams-personaltraining.com/"
12,Physio for Jaw Pain,health-fitness," Temporomandibular joint disorder, commonly known as TMD, occurs when there is a problem with the temporomandibular joint (the jaw joints). Problems with the temporomandibular joint can result in jaw pain, joint noises and abnormal jaw movements. The good news is that TMD is a treatable disorder. Physio for jaw pain often shows positive results in the treatment of TMD. What is the Temporomandibular Joint? The temporomandibular joints (TMJ) connect the jaw to the skull. They are located on either side of the face, just in front of the ears. These important joints are responsible for movements such as chewing, speaking and facial expressions. The TMJ performs two movements as it opens the mouth. The first is simply a hinge action that opens and closes the mouth as you would imagine. The second is a sliding motion called translation. This is when the jaw joints move forward allowing a great degree of freedom in the opening, as well as side to side actions. The TMJ is one of the most used joints in the body and sometimes things can go wrong. Often this is due to overuse, jaw injury or inflammation. What is the Temporomandibular Joint Disorder? Just like other joints in the body, the TMJ can be injured. Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD) can cause many symptoms such as: Jaw pain, particularly when eating Abnormal jaw movement Popping or clicking noises from the jaw Ear pain may spread to the face Uneven bite Headaches Tinnitus Locking of the jaw There are a number of causes for TMD and occasionally there is no obvious cause. Some of the common reasons for TMD include: dental issues, joint wear and tear, trauma, jaw clenching and teeth grinding. What Is the Best Treatment For TMD? Treatment for TMD will depend on the diagnosis, the cause of TMJ dysfunction and how long it has been occurring. Generally, there are two types of TMJ disorders that require different treatments. TMJ closing disorders and TMJ opening disorders. TMJ closing disorders: this is often due to teeth occlusion and teeth grinding. A dentist is usually involved in treating TMJ closing disorders but this can involve an experienced physio. TMJ opening disorders: this type of TMJ disorder is due to a problem with the movement of opening and closing the jaw due to issues with muscle and joint control. TMJ opening disorders are often treated successfully with movement techniques such as joint mobilisation, strengthening, and movement retraining exercises, massage or dry needling. These treatments can be provided through qualified and experienced jaw physiotherapist. What Jaw Exercises Can I Do For TMD? There are various exercises to treat TMD that a physiotherapist may prescribe, some of these may include: Muscle strengthening exercises Jaw stretching Relaxation exercises Jaw mobility exercises Other management techniques during treatment may include: eating a soft diet, avoiding chewing gum, limiting large jaw movements such as yawning and maintaining good neck strength and posture. Does Physio Help TMD? Physio for jaw pain is an effective treatment with around 75% of patients resolving their condition within three months. Quite often physio for jaw pain provides positive results within a few weeks of beginning treatment, however, each patient will differ depending on the severity.

13,Dissociative Identity Disorder,health-fitness," During the past few years, there have been drastic improvements in medication and disease treatment, either on a genetic, neurosurgery or psychiatric level. These improvements have resulted in curing numerous illnesses and improving the lives of people in moral, social, economic and environmental ways. It is said that every one out of four people in our world suffer from some kind of mental problem today. Professionals are trying desperately to cure these disorders using psychological or medical treatment. Although, since all diseases are different, it can sometimes be difficult to predict how, when or to what extent is the person going to recover. Some treatment takes years and years of therapy and hand work. One of these kinds of disorders is Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), previously known as Multiple Personality Disorder. (MPD) DID is one of the rarest, most complicated diseases. Statistics show that only as little as 1% of the world’s whole population is diagnosed with DID. It is described as a ""condition in which two or more distinct identities or personality states, also known as alters are present in-and alternately take control of an individual."" It is a coping mechanism for extreme, continuous traumatic events that happened at the ages of 6-9.  Dissociation or detachment from reality can be a way of protecting the person from painful experiences. In this way, different personalities experience the trauma, leaving the host with no memory of the event. To be diagnosed with DID, the person must meet all of the symptoms and criteria common for this decease. The symptoms include a sense of ""losing time"" while the other alter has control of the body, confusion, feelings of dissociation, memory gaps and amnesia between the switches to different alters and out of character behavior, which is caused by distinctive personalities of alters. It is also important to take into account that all people with DID also experience flashbacks and persistent nightmares and therefore are sure to have post-traumatic stress disorder. The first person to discover DID was a French physician Jean-Martin Charrot, in 18080s. At first, there wasn’t much known about this disease, so it was thought to combine traits of hysteria and epilepsy and so they called it Hystereo-Ehilepsy. Later on, the assumption was proved wrong and the name was changed into Multiple Personality Disorder, up until 1994. By this time, the condition was described as proliferation of new, separate personalities, although this idea was was also proved wrong by further  investigations and better understanding of the disease in the later years. It’s name finally changed to Dissociative Identity Disorder, as it’s characterized by fragmentation of a personality, rather than a growth of a new one. One of the essential parts of treating DID is through long-term psychotherapy, with a goal of integrating different personalities into one. However, DID can also be treated in numerous other ways, including psychiatry, some medication, desensitization and reprocessing  method, clinical hypnosis, creative therapies, dialectic-behavior therapy, eye movement and cognitive-behavior therapy. During the psychotherapy sessions, the therapist’s main goal is to to ""relieve the symptoms, ensure the safety of an individual and those around him or her and ""reconnect"" the different personalities into one integrated, well-functioning identity."" It is important the the person learns to safely express and process the traumatic memories, develop new coping skills and improve relationships. If during the treatment, some cognitive-behavioral therapy is included, then the focus will also be in changing dysfunctional thinking patterns and behaviors. Another technique that’s called eye movement desensitization reprocessing (EMDR), is meant to treat people who experience flashbacks, nightmares and other symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Creative therapies, for example art therapy or music therapy allow people to express their thoughts, feelings and experiences in a safe and creative environment. Meditation and relaxation techniques focus on helping people to better tolerate, understand and communicate with their alters. They include digraphic breathing, 2-minute relaxation, body scanning and much more. Clinical hypnosis-another way of treating DID can be similar to meditation and relaxation techniques. This method uses intense relaxation and concentration to ""achieve an altered state of consciousness"" and allows people to explore their hidden thoughts, feelings and memories that might have been lost from their conscious minds. Last but not least, medication too, can help on the way of treating DID. Although there is no specific medication to cure the dissociative disorders directly, people still highly benefit from taking some antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications. All this effort put into the treatment of different mental diseases clearly  have a very outstanding result. Different kinds of treatment may effect different parts of person’s lifestyle. Proper treatment can improve person’s moral values and social life. For example, researches have shown that most people who receive psychotherapy show a huge benefit from it. In most cases, they  experience symptom relief. With less mental problems to worry about, people focus on their goals and become much more productive. Without any more worries and weights on their shoulders from all the pain caused by the illnesses, they become more high spirited, positive and start working on a more sustainable and healthy lifestyle with improved states of mind. This improves their moral values and a way of living. People also start to have better and healthier relationships with people around them, which effects their social life. As a proof of this, we can discuss a small experiment, conducted in Henry Phipps Psychiatric Clinic, where twelve patients were given four tests before and after psychotherapy. Two of these tests were given to the patients’ therapists. ""People who improved tended to revise certain of their moral values in the direction of their therapists’, while the moral values of patients who were unimproved tended to become less like their therapists’."" But of course, like everything else, treatment comes with it’s own disadvantages. As mentioned before, while treating DID antidepressants can be used in benefit of the patient, but antidepressants, along with other medications can have side effects. They are mainly aimed to correct chemical imbalances of neurotransmitters in the brain and increase their numbers, but because antidepressants don’t only effect one of our brain parts, in some cases they might cause jitteriness, dry mouth and blurry eyes, which typically go away after a week or two. But other symptoms caused by them may last much longer. Such is: nausea, increased appetite and wight gain, loss of sexual desire, fatigue and drowsiness, agitation, irritability and so on. This can be explained by the fact that antidepressants work on every parts of our brain, like frontal lobes, temporal lobes, hippocampus, amygdala, brain stem and so on. Along with incorrect use of antidepressants, psychotherapy may have negative effects as well. Firstly, therapy is very expensive, so getting a proper treatment may not be affordable to everyone and put huge debts on person, which will highly effect their financial status and economic well-being. But many other things can go wrong during psychotherapy sessions. The person might not be a professional and instead of curing the patient, unproved treatment and false diagnosis will result in far worse results. This might cause the person’s condition to worsen and destroy their social and moral status. In this case, therapist might face malpractice because of legal responsibility towards the patient. Many therapists today don’t really understand what the patient needs and therefore, their interventions are ineffective. This is caused by unprofessionalism and limited range of knowledge in some specific diseases. An evidence of this can be a website on internet called ""very bad therapy"" which uses podcasts to give voices to the stories of people’s terrible experiences with their therapists. Just the fact that there are so many people active on this website is a proof alone that many therapists can’t be trusted. Treatment surely comes with a lots of advantages, along with disadvantages. Although, since the number of mentally ill people nowadays is still relatively high, avoiding any kind of treatment because of their disadvantages will be unreasonable. Antidepressants may have their side effects and some therapists might not know how to properly do their job, but most of the people who have gone through psychotherapy have changed their therapists numerous times, until they found the one they were comfortable with. So it’s only a matter of finding the right psychotherapist and some financial support for sessions and medications. Therefore, mental health treatment should be available to everyone and must be achieved by those who need it, because untreated people are most likely to contribute to higher medical expenses, poorer performance at school and work, fewer employment opportunities and increased risk of suicide. In the end, we can state with confidence that treatment is an important part of healthy life for mentally ill people and studying these diseases is even more important. Without a proper understanding of the illness, people can not find the cure and treat them. Just like dissociative identity disorder, which was previously misunderstood and mistaken for a completely different mental condition. The very first patients with this disorder used to be treated in ways unimaginable for modern society. The ""treatment"" included electric shock therapy, which meant electric currents were passed through the person’s brain, which would cause a seizure. This was thought to adjust self-view of the patients, which would cause the symptoms to go away, but of course, since they had no understanding of the disease itself, their treatment methods were not effective and therefore worsened the conditions of the patients. This is exactly why, in today’s society, it is very important to have educated people working as psychotherapists, psychiatrists and other professionals who are dedicated to improving the lives of ill people."

16,What is the most effective weight loss diet over the long term?,health-fitness," We spend our lives looking for solutions when, quite often, we have the answer right under our own noses. Something as simple as eating! We are fascinated and blinded by ""wellness"", ""weight loss magic"" or the latest miracle diet of the month pushed by self-proclaimed gurus or clever marketing companies. The hooks are invariably the same: ""loss weight in time for the summer"", ""only X weeks with Y diet will make you look like this"" or something similar. It never ceases to amaze how easy it is to mislead and manipulate people. To make matters worse, usually the weight loss (if it hasn´t been put back after a few months) is at the expense of one´s health. So what should we do to lose weight (and keep our health intact)? Should we try, say, intermittent fasting (IF)? Or do we subscribe to the paleo(lithic) diet and eat as our (distant) ancestors did a long, long time ago? Or should we follow the Mediterranean diet doing away with processed food, sugar, unhealthy fats and the like? The answer to all these questions should be obvious: go to a nutritionist and get personal advice on, firstly, whether we really need to lose weight and how much. Secondly, assuming we do need to lose weight, to get a personalized diet plan. But if you don´t want to do that (or don´t have the time), a group of scientists from the University of Otaga (New Zealand) published a study last December in which we are given several very useful clues about what we should do about our diet. THE EXPERIMENT AND RESULTS To carry out their research, the scientists selected 250 subjects who were somewhat overweight (but in good health) and invited them to select one of these three star diets: intermittent fasting, paleo or Mediterranean. They compared the evolution of each subject over 12 months, using as a reference the calories burned daily (which accounted for an application), the weight and the proportion of fat (measured both at the beginning and at the end of the experiment). They observed that only between 35% and 57% of the participants, depending on the diet they had selected, had been able to maintain their diet throughout the year. Although everyone experienced small losses of weight and fatty tissue, they found that the diet had been clearly more effective in some specific cases. As expected, those who opted for intermittent fasting (the most common form was dividing each day into 16 hours of fasting and eight for eating) managed to lose weight much faster than the rest. However, the researchers found that maintaining it over time proved to be a greater challenge than to follow a Mediterranean diet. A lot of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, olive oil seeds combined with a moderate intake of fish, eggs, poultry and dairy products formed the basis of the Mediterranean diet. These subjects were also allowed to have red meat once a week (at most) and drink a glass of wine daily. On their list of forbidden foods were processed foods (which were the most difficult to avoid), butter and soft drinks. Subjects on the Mediterranean plan were able to follow it for 365 days. Finally, those who chose paleo (which prioritizes the consumption of lean meats, fish, eggs, organic dairy, fruits, vegetables, nuts or seeds and excludes grain, such as wheat, rice, corn or oats) did not have difficulties following it over time however they were the ones who lost the least amount of weight. The researchers at the University of Otaga concluded that, although intermittent fasting helps us lose more weight and faster, the Mediterranean diet (named the best in the world of 2020 by US News & World Report) help us both to maintain our ideal weight and is much easier to follow throughout our lifetime. Most Mediterranean diets will bring huge benefits to one´s overall health. But two have a very high ranking according to Bloomberg´s Healthiest Country Index. THE BEST MEDITERRANEAN DIETS According to the 2019 edition of the Bloomberg Healthiest Country Index, Spain is the healthiest nation on Earth. It scored 92.8 out of 100 and the Mediterranean diet is, of course, a key reason. The index evaluates the quality of different factors that contribute to guaranteeing well-being in 169 states such as eating habits, the health system, life expectancy, smoking, obesity, the environment and other health related factors. It is followed by Italy. Further behind are Iceland, Japan, Switzerland, Sweden, Australia, Singapore, Norway and Israel in a ranking where you have to go to 35th position to find the United States. Actually Spain has one of the highest life expectancies at birth in the world, according to United Nations data. By 2040, Spain is forecast to have the highest lifespan, at almost 86 years, followed by Japan, Singapore and Switzerland, according to the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation."

19,How do you start a hairdressing career?,health-fitness," Develop confidence in yourself You won't go far without her. Remember, even experienced masters sometimes make mistakes. Do not be upset if there are a lot of them in the initial stages. If there are scandals, take them as part of your professional activity and work on your mistakes. Everything will change with time. Learn to accept and understand customer wishes Most customers will ask you to cut or colour them as they please, not as your sense of style tells you. You will, of course, be able to recommend other ideas to change the opinion of the visitor, but the final decision will still remain with him. In many cases, the explanations will be confusing. To understand what customers have in mind, show photos with different hairstyles during consultations. This way you will better understand what the client will like and what not. Prepare yourself for the fact that you will inevitably encounter clients who are not satisfied with anything. Don't take scandals seriously. There won't be many cases like this. Talk to your colleagues at the salon and online... Feel free to ask questions to more experienced craftsmen. Not only colleagues, but also numerous forums and groups in social networks are at your disposal. What to do at the start? Start with the hairdressing salons of the economy class. Do not be upset if at first you are denied employment by prestigious salons. Go boldly to the hairdressing salon economy class. The main thing you need to do at the start of your career is to ""put your hands"" and gain experience. Hairdressing salon with a constant flow of clients is ideal for this. But! Consider working in such a salon as a continuation of training and only the first step of the career ladder. Do not pay attention to colleagues, focused on speed and earnings. Focus on sharpening your skills, clients and improving the quality of services provided. Take photos of examples of the best work for your portfolio. Attend additional courses and seminars at the same time. Thoughts from ""A, maybe stay here to work..."" How do you make your work fun and outperform your competitors? Focus on your favorite services... At the start of your career, identify the services that bring you sincere pleasure. By focusing on them, you will gain confidence in yourself more quickly. Run away from the saloons with discordant teams... Working in the ""hornet's nest"" isn't going to do any good. Keep learning. Fashion, technology and hairdressing are not standing still. To keep abreast of all trends and offer clients a full range of services, read professional magazines, attend master classes and acquire new skills. So you leave your competitors far behind. Try to get into one of the best salons After ""putting your hands"", gain experience and expand your competence, send out your resume with examples of the best works to prestigious companies. If you stay in the economy class salon, ruin your talent. How do you get regular customers and what do you communicate with them about? Be not only a hairdresser, but also a psychologist... Many clients (especially women) go to hairdressers and beauty salons not only for services, but also for communication. To attract, rather than intimidate, the client, use the following psychological subtleties. When you first meet them, ask unobtrusive questions. So you determine whether the visitor wants to communicate or not. Name your clients by name. Avoid nicknames. Try to look people in the eye. Don't interrupt. Listen carefully, nod, keep the conversation alive and otherwise prove interest. Pay attention! There are a number of topics that are not worth discussing. This: religion; politics; salary. If you are not sure that the thoughts expressed on these issues will not scare away the client, change the topic. It is also not worth discussing relationships within the salon. Keep an eye on yourself. Your hairstyle should look spectacular. It's what the client will notice when they first meet her. Beautiful, well-groomed hair is proof of craftsmanship. Close by, clients will see your hands. Do not forget to do a quality manicure. If the client asks for your phone number, don't say no. It all depends on salon policy here. If it is forbidden to give personal numbers, use business cards. Happy customers will call and sign in to you. If everything is allowed, please don't hesitate to give your contact details. Firstly, it will strengthen the relationship, and secondly, it will allow you to take additional orders. For communication with clients start a separate SIM card. Pay attention! When providing a number for communication, you must understand that you will be called and written. If clients will often hear the message ""The subscriber cannot answer your call ..."", you will lose them. Therefore, when sending your contact details, please, specify the time when you will be available and will be able to answer promptly. Use social networks for promotion To promote private services, start a group in ""Vkontakte"". Invite customers to it, make interesting posts, conduct competitions repost with prize haircut, perms, styling and coloring, write on behalf of the group in the thematic public. You can also provide a phone number in the community to contact. In addition to the group, create an account in Instagram. But remember, users are very demanding about visual material, so it's better not to put photos of your works in bad quality. It will only scare away your potential customers! 4 main mistakes of beginner hairdressers, and how to avoid them? Now let's talk about the mistakes that beginner hairdressers make most often. Lack of consultation and blind adherence to client requirements... Rendering any service in the beauty-sphere requires preliminary training, which many novice masters often forget about. Remember: the more questions you ask a client, the better the result will be. If a visitor to the salon asks for a haircut or styling, which frankly does not suit him, the work may end up with a scandal. In this case, your task is to calmly and argumentatively justify your opinion. If the client insists on his own, warn him about the possible consequences. Too aggressive additional sales While working in the salon, you will most likely face the fact that you will have to sell additional services and cosmetics to customers for bonuses and %. Do not do it too actively. Be careful and start with unobtrusive questions. In this case, additional offers are more likely to interest customers and will not scare them away. Non-compliance with technology More often than not, novice hairdressers break the technology of chemical curling and coloring. The curling mixes are too thick. The unsuitable oxidizing agents are diluted with water. In these cases the colours are dull and the curls are not elastic enough. The result is customer dissatisfaction. So, if you don't have the right product at hand, reschedule the session. Not being able to stop in time Many newcomers are fond of cutting precious millimeters to their clients. Be careful and leave small ""stocks"" (especially when working on bangs). After drying your hair will get extra volume, lift it up and get the right length. The importance of continuous professional development Professional and physiological knowledge is just as important as it is not strange. For example, vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies, chronic diseases, diet abuse, and skin dehydration can affect hair. Hair becomes dry, dehydrated and split at the ends. In this case, a dry hair mask, saturation of hair with keratin, will be a salvation for your client. But you should pay attention, as well as to the solution of internal problems, as the external effects will have only a temporary effect. And because of ignorance, the client can scold you for ineffective means. In order to give reasonable recommendations, you need to constantly update your professional knowledge and improve."
20,3 Big Diet Mistakes You May Be Making,health-fitness," If you have tried one weight loss program after another without ever being successful for long, you are probably making some big diet mistakes. You can be given the best diet plan in the world, but it won't work if your attitude is wrong. You are probably making some big diet mistakes if you have tried one weight loss program after another. Even if you are given the best diet plan in the world it will not work without the right attitude. The 3 major diet mistakes responsible for people going off plan and failing to achieve the desired weight loss are listed below: Nobody is perfect. We have all heard that statement countless times, but many of us still find it hard to apply it to ourselves and our diets. We take an all-or-nothing approach, thinking we have to stick to our diet plan 100% of the time, perfectly, or there's no point following it at all. This puts huge pressure on us and makes us feel terrible if we slip up. It also means that after a slip-up we are likely to think, ""I've messed up yet another diet, I just can't do this,"" or ""This diet doesn't work,"" and abandon it. In short, perfection-related diet mistakes mean that we will use the smallest slip-up as an excuse for a massive binge. This problem is worst for dieters who like to follow very restricted plans where no treats are allowed. Inevitably, life gets in the way and instead of planning how to cope with the challenge of a party or a wedding, they try to eat nothing all day and then cave in, abandoning the diet completely. People who see a diet as a temporary measure will often pick very restricted eating plans and then go back to their old eating habits after the diet ends. If you do that, all of the weight will go back on, in 99% of cases. Unless you only have a few KG to lose, it is much better to pick an eating plan that gives you flexibility. You need something that you can follow for weeks, months or even years. In fact, you need something that will allow you to live your life. In anything that we do, goals should be clear, set out in steps and achievable. In terms of weight loss, this means that as well as having an idea of your ideal weight or clothes size, you should also set smaller goals along the way, and reward yourself for each one achieved (but not with food!). Be flexible about your final goal: as you approach it, you may want to change it. That's OK. If you avoid these diet mistakes and have the right attitude toward dieting, you will be able to achieve a weight that you are happy with - and that is much more important than numbers."

1,Helping The Others Realize The Advantages Of Guidelines Of Mesothelioma,health-fitness," The diagnostic approach starts when troublesome symptoms need health care notice. Warning indications of pleural mesothelioma, which varieties within the lungs, contain problems respiratory, coughing and chest ache. Each relevant paper was browsing in entire by a minimum of two users on the GDG and a proof desk entry was accomplished for every paper accustomed to help a suggestion/excellent apply level. When she's not giving 1-on-just one guidance to sufferers, Dr. Smart stays present-day on the newest medical investigation, looking through peer-reviewed research and interviewing oncologists to study enhancements in diagnostic resources and most cancers remedies. An important threat element for developing mesothelioma is staying subjected to asbestos previously. Around nine from ten, those with mesothelioma are exposed to asbestos up to now. Mesothelioma may well even happen nearly 50 decades Once you have been exposed to asbestos. Vaginal cancer Some vaginal cancers haven't any signs or symptoms inside their early phases, and only result in indications at the time they've got invaded other areas of the body... Chest pain.

2,Pre-workout supplements,health-fitness," Pre-workout is a category of supplements for those who go to the gym. You've probably heard the term through the locker room. This is what it is called, but in many cases, it is already late if you take it fixed before training. It depends ... how long is your path to the hall. If you do more than 20 minutes, it is okay to take it in the locker room. Pre-workout gives you extra energy during your workout and helps dilate your blood vessels. Its effect is comparable to about five espressos. Plus something else to help you feel like you can move mountains. I tell you from now on that this supplement is not for everyone. Cardiacs, for example, should be kept away. Then, even if you are a very healthy person, you may not like taking the supplement. I make a comparison again in plastic terms: we keep the parallel with the espresso and put a few palms from the clear. It gave a strange feeling of restlessness and sometimes unpleasant tingling in the palms. When you should take the Pre Workout supplements? If you go to the gym late at night or early in the morning and feel that your workouts do not go at the pace you could take. If you are already shooting to the maximum and have minimal breaks between sets, no supplement is required. Improvements in training will be marginal. It is not advisable to use pre-workout supplements even if you are a beginner. The risk of injury is very high when you want to move the hall two stairs away just by pushing it. The reverse also appears: you will find workouts boring without. It is best to get used to going to the gym and to shoot properly, increase the intensity naturally and resort to pre-workout only when you are capped. However, you must understand that Pre Workout does not take the place of sleep and is not good for energizing if you had any thoughts in this direction. What does a pre-workout supplement contain? Caffeine. A consistent portion, comparable to several coffees, but served at once. Things do not end here, because there are several substances with vasodilating effects. If you push hard enough during your training, you will feel that you are very close and your muscles will burst from how much they swelled. But don’t be afraid, this thing doesn't happen in reality. Depending on the variant, pre-workout also contains amino acids, as well as other substances, including carbohydrates, as an energy source. This is something you need to consider in case you follow a strict regime. The most common vasodilator found in a pre-workout supplement is arginine. It supports your body in the generation process of nitric acid, which causes blood vessels to dilate and stimulates the process of protein synthesis. To an extent, you can get most of the benefits of a pre-workout from two cups of coffee and an amino acid concentrate that also includes BCAA. But it will not be the same and you may miss the dosage. Creatine is another common ingredient for many pre-workout formulas, but it is found in fewer products compared with caffeine or arginine."
3,Bone Regeneration: All You Need to Know,health-fitness," Bones have an intrinsic ability for regeneration. It does not involve scar tissue formation. However, it is a complex physiological process. We can see it during normal fracture healing. There are different types of cells and bio-signaling pathways involve for this purpose. However, this physiological process does not work well for avascular necrosis, non-unions, osteoporosis, and large bone defects due to trauma, tumor resection, infection, etc. Therefore, we have to find a way to facilitate the healing process to treat these kinds of injuries successfully. How do we treat them? Autologous bone grafts, allograft implantations, mechanical stimulation, growth factor therapy and osteoconductive scaffolds (implants) are some treatment methods. Also, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound and pulsed electromagnetic fields act as adjuncts to augment bone regeneration. These methods are mostly used in orthopedic, odontoiatric and craniomaxillofacial surgeries. All about bone grafting you should know This is a common method to enhance bone regeneration. The anterior and posterior iliac crests are the commonest donor sites for autologous bone grafts. The main advantages are minimum immune reactions and infection transmissions rates. However, the patient has to undergo an additional surgical procedure for bone harvesting. Also, donor site morbidity, inflammation, and reabsorption of implanted graft are some disadvantages of autologous bone grafting. Allografts are alternatives to autologous bone grafts. Human cadavers and living donors are common sources of an allograft. Type of the allograft depends on the requirements of the recipient site. These types are the demineralized bone matrix, corticocancellous, morcellised and cancellous chips, osteochondral and whole bone segments, and cortical grafts. However, immune reactions and infection transmissions are the main disadvantages of allograft transplantation. Effects of mechanical stimulation on bone regeneration This is achieved by various fixation devices. The mechanical stress of these devices affects the regeneration process by stimulating or inhibiting various tissues. Therefore, high shear stress stimulates connective tissue formation around the bone. On the other hand, less shear stress stimulates cartilage and bone formation. Also, the mechanical stability of the bone segment enhances new vessel formation. For example, dynamic external fixation allows patients for weight-bearing and early walking. Also, it prevents tropic changes and joint stiffness of the affected leg. Place of growth factors and scaffolds on bone tissue regeneration *Growth factor therapy Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor-2, and platelet-rich plasma enhance fracture healing. They have osteoinductive properties. Since 2001, BMPs have been used for the treatment of large bone defects. However, there are some drawbacks to these growth factors. They are ectopic bone formation, high cost, and safety issues on clinical use. *Bone substitutes/Scaffolds These are synthetic bone graft substitutes. They are called as ""scaffolds."" Collagen, hydroxyapatite, beta-tricalcium phosphate, calcium phosphate cement, and glass ceramics are some of these scaffolds. They can mimic bone structure and composition. Therefore, they can promote bone cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. But, there are ongoing researches to improve their mechanical properties and biocompatibility for a better quality of care. Future of bone repair There are several limitations and disadvantages associated with current methods in clinical practice. Thus, tissue engineering, gene therapy, systemic enhancement therapy, sclerostin antibody therapy, low-level laser therapy, and single-pulsed electromagnetic field therapy have emerged as potential new therapies. The purpose of the tissue engineering This aims at generating new cells and functional tissues. Therefore, it consists of a combination of stem cells, growth factors, and scaffolds to enhance fracture healing. So that, the engineered scaffolds serve as an artificial extracellular matrix to support newly synthesizing bone tissue. Also, bone marrow aspirate supplies mesenchymal stem cells. However, some areas of tissue engineering are currently under investigation for the better quality of care. Gene therapy in clinical practice This is a novel method. It facilitates the transferring of genetic material into the genome of the target cells. It helps to express different proteins for the cellular purpose of bone regeneration. These genes can be transferred effectively in vivo by viral and non-viral vectors. Fortunately, we can use gene therapy shortly as several animal studies have shown promising results for bone tissue regeneration. Systemic enhancement therapy for bone regeneration There are hormones and several drugs currently under investigation for bone regeneration. For example, growth hormone and parathyroid hormone are the popular hormonal agents. Two parathyroid analogs ( PTH 1-34 and PTH 1-84) have already been used for osteoporosis. Also, the novel hypothesis has suggested that some drugs like bisphosphonates and denosumab have bone regeneration properties. Furthermore, another approach is using prostaglandin agonists(Stimulants) to augment bone healing. These agonists act on prostaglandin receptors of the bone tissue for the healing process. Other methods of bone regeneration *Sclerostin antibody This is a glycoprotein in osteocytes (Bone regenerating cells). Several studies have shown promising results in increasing bone formation and preventing bone loss. *Single-pulsed electromagnetic field This has proven osteogenic(Bone formation) effects in preclinical studies. The potential advantages of this therapy are the shorter treatment course and frequency daily application. *Low-level laser therapy It supplies light energy to improve the expression of bone formation factors in the body.

4,Hidden Stress & Illness in Women,health-fitness," This month is Women’s History Month, and as discussions of women’s importance spread, so too do discussions of women’s health. Throughout history, there have been certain risks and conditions that affect women more so than men. Many of these risks are influenced by a multitude of factors, including stress and mental health. Many women suffer from undue stress and feeling the need to hold it in or minimize their own needs can not only cause mental health issues but can make physical health issues worse as well. To help raise awareness of women’s health, Red River ER wants to talk about how women, and those in their lives, can help to alleviate the harmful stress they might experience. Hiding Illness When we find ourselves overwhelmed or feeling unwell, many of us might try to hide it. Whether we don’t want to worry anyone around us or we’re trying to power through a difficult work week, anyone can mask sniffles, coughs, or an achy feeling from time to time. Women, though, are more likely to hide their illnesses frequently, which can increase their health risks. Traditionally, women are seen as caretakers in the family, and this preconception makes them more likely to try ""toughing it out"" instead of seeking care. Whether it be working long shifts during a cold or even hiding symptoms of the flu and pretending that they are fine, many women will try to work through infections. When women hide their sickness, they can make themselves more likely to be seriously ill in the future. Hiding symptoms can make it harder to tell when a cough is just a cold or something serious like bronchitis. This makes it crucial for not only women to properly care for themselves, but also for friends and family members to encourage women to get the rest they need. What Stress Impacts While it is easy to see how hiding symptoms of an illness can be bad for your health, it might be harder to tell why stress is such an influential factor. After all, everyone feels stressed sometimes, and small amounts of stress can be natural motivations for people to get things done. But not all stress is normal, and when someone feels overwhelmed, it is important that they have an outlet or people to confide in. Similar to the tendency to hide symptoms of common illnesses, many women are also prone to hiding severe stress. When women feel overwhelmed or especially stressed about something, they may try to carry on as if everything is fine. This can be harmful to mental health as well as physical health, as unresolved stress can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of serious conditions like heart attacks or strokes. How to Encourage Wellness -When a woman in the family feels overwhelmed, offer a supportive ear. Exhibit sympathy and remind women in your life that they are not a burden on others and that their feelings are important. This will help them to open up and not feel overly worried about confiding in loved ones. -If a woman in your life seems to be getting sick, express your concern to them. Tell them that you want to make sure they’re all right and offer to help take care of them. Spouses can offer to step in with parental duties and large chores around the house while children can offer to take on extra small chores so that the women most important in their lives can have an opportunity to rest and heal. -Women should be more vocal about their needs when they are sick or feeling overly stressed. It can be challenging for some, but it is important to remember that maintaining your health and wellness is part of maintaining the health and wellness of your entire family. Women shouldn’t be afraid to speak up when they need to rest and should ask their loved ones for help when they feel overwhelmed by stress. -Take time for self-care. This goes beyond just taking medicine or sleeping in when you have the flu; it should be built into your weekly routine. Self-care are small ways that women can take care of their body and their stress levels regularly. It can be as small as 15 minutes of meditation or as big as an at-home spa day, but no matter what self-care technique you try, it is important to make that personal relaxation a priority. -Find healthy outlets. To help manage stress, find a healthy outlet when you feel pent up or overwhelmed. This can be something like participating in a sport or physical activity. It can be engaging in arts and crafts. Anything that helps someone let out their stress in a safe environment can be good ways to manage overwhelming stress. -Make positive changes in your life. If frequent stress is an issue for you, then it might be time to make changes to your schedule. Women should look at their daily routines if they feel frequently overwhelmed and talk with their loved ones about how to make positive changes. It could be shifting household chores or cutting out certain activities which have become stressful. Women altering the things in their lives that they can control goes a long way to improving stress levels. Since it is so important for women to not only express their stress and get the TLC they need while they’re sick, there are things that everyone in the family can do to help. Friends, family, and women themselves can all try some of the following to help lighten the load of internalized stress and illness: Making women and their wellbeing a priority in your home can go a long way to helping with stress relief and proper care for illnesses. When everyone in the family knows how to be aware, they can work together to make sure that mothers, grandmothers, aunts, sisters, and even friends take care of themselves. Red River ER supports every woman in our community as they find ways to eliminate stress in their lives and work towards better self-care. In the case of emergencies, our facility is open 24/7 with highly trained doctors and nurses ready to give you the best in concierge-level care.

9,7 Health Pointers for the Fitness Women,health-fitness," Exercise is an essential in life. Most people will certainly nod their heads to this. Exercise is not only perfect for losing weight, it is also good for keeping a reasonable body weight, for giving a boost on the metabolic rate and also for burning those unwanted excess calories. Exercise also revs up the heart and the lungs' machinery making them more efficient in doing their natural functions. Aside from these, exercise also works for strengthening the bones and keeps people looking good and feeling good about themselves. Exercise also gives people the stamina to enable them to keep up with the pace of their lifestyles. Unfortunately, not many people chose to do what is good for them. Most people could not decide exactly what to do when waking up in the morning; whether to exercise or to press the snooze button one more time. The following tips are very helpful in reaching and maintaining the ideal body weight. This is especially great for women since they get through a lot of things going on in their bodies and are more susceptible to osteoporosis. Not to mention that many women are under the pressure of keeping themselves beautiful. It is recommended that one or two of these tips at a time are incorporated to the work out routine. Worry not that the exercise routine is not enough. It is important to keep the commitments one makes. Ideally, it is advised to exercise three to five times a week for 20-60 minutes. However, this is not exactly the case in the real world. One should not frustrate herself by aiming for the ideal when she knows for herself that it is utterly impossible. If she an manage it two times a week for twenty minutes per session, that will do just great. It is best to focus on doing what one knows she can do than to reproach herself for having not done enough. She can start from this point and then progress on afterwards. This should make her feel successful for having kept her commitment to herself. Weight lifting should always come first. Many women always do cardio exercises first before weight lifting. A disadvantage of this is that it is possible to miss a critical component of the routine and spend all of it on cardio training. A women may notice this by not being able to see results even after devoting long hours at the gym. This can be avoided by reversing the order. This will guarantee visible positive outcome. Remember to monitor heart rate. It is recommended to exercise at 75-85% of the maximum heart rate. Many people stick with just pumping up only 50% of their maximum heart rate. To ensure that one is working out at the prescribed target heart rate, she should use a heart rate monitor or any exercise equipment with this feature. Work out for only an hour or less. Doing this will keep one from dreading the gym. Focusing on the exercise and the aim to be accomplished will make each work out session more and more efficient. Have some sort of fitness social support. Being in a fitness community maybe the important element lacking in your training program. A social support can do amazing wonders and therefore should not be underestimated. It would be helpful to work out in a gym once in while if one customarily does her work outs at home. One can also try classes in activities that have always been interesting such as yoga, pilates or sailing perhaps. One can also join clubs such as a walking club or a running club for instance. Pep talk yourself. One should not pressure herself too much; rather, it is best to congratulate one's self and give out words of encouragement in between exercises. One should never forget to say some positive feedback for herself."

In this way, the receptor areas for these neurotransmitters are particularly fitting for an authority with opiate prescriptions. These neural connections are related with torment control, weariness control, and opinion of pleasure.

11,The Rapid Spread Of Acupuncture In The Western World,health-fitness," Chinese acupuncture dates back to the Shang Dynasty in China from 1600 – 1100 BC, so it has been around for a very long time. However, it has only sprung to prominence in the West since 1971 when a US journalist suffered from appendicitis in the country, had his appendix removed, and had acupuncture used to hasten his recovery. He subsequently wrote an article about it in the New York Times. Since then – which is not yet 50 years ago – acupuncture has become used more and more in the West to deal with a range of different health conditions, and according to the latest figures from the Chinese government there are now some 200,000 acupuncturists practising outside China. Indeed, the marketing data research group QY Research recently estimated that in 2017 some 9.7 billion acupuncture needles – which are, of course for one-time use – were manufactured globally, generating a total revenue of around £70 million for the manufacturers. There is now a World Acupuncture Day and on November 15th 2018 acupuncturists from all over the world met at Unesco Headquarters in Paris for the 8th World Acupuncture Day celebrations where the chair of the Governing Board of the British Acupuncture Council, Phillip Rose-Neil said: ""We see huge potential for the continued growth of acupuncture…… and the advancement of medical technology will support acupuncture to achieve more impact."" Indeed, acupuncture has become acceptable among celebrities such as Madonna, Sheryl Crow, and Meghan, now Duchess of Sussex. Acupuncture is not only used to cure such things as headaches, back pain, knee pain, and nausea, but is also used for conditions such as weight loss and stress relief. The Medical Director of The British Medical Acupuncture Society, Mike Cummings, said: ""Acupuncture holds a unique position in our medical world today, because some of the benefits it brings to the human body find no substitute in other medical practices."" Acupuncture started to spread from China in the 6th century when Korean traders gained knowledge of it. Japan and Vietnam caught on to it soon after this. However, the first ever mention of acupuncture in Europe was when a Dutch doctor, Willem ten Rhijne, wrote about it in the 1680’s after he had seen it being practiced when he worked for the Dutch East India Company. In the 1800’s there was a certain amount of interest when, in Britain and the US, there were articles written about it, although it was mainly seen as a novelty rather than serious medicine. In the 20th century Chinese immigrants began to flourish in Britain and the US, and some other Western countries, and acupuncture began to take a hold, although it was still mainly confined to Chinese communities. However, this changed in Britain in 1993 when a Chinese acupuncturist in London, Luo Dinghui, managed to cure several patients of Chinese heritage of eczema. This makes the skin itchy and red, yet even today Western medicine has no cure for it. There is even a National Eczema Society in Britain whose scientists investigated and confirmed that, indeed, Luo’s acupuncture treatment had been successful. This caused a huge upsurge in Chinese acupuncture in London and then in the rest of Britain, and more and more clinics began to open. Today, it is possible to get undergraduate degrees in acupuncture in several British universities including Middlesex, Southbank, and Westminster. Acupuncture is also growing elsewhere. In Switzerland, for example, it has been the form of alternative medicine most often used since 2004. It is also available under the public health system of Brazil. According to Chinese government statistics, acupuncture and/or Chinese herbal medicine have been used by one third of the world population. Wang Tianjun, who studied acupuncture at Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, came to Britain in 2007 and worked as a lecturer at the University of East London for their acupuncture programme. He said: ""Many on these programmes are mature students whose fascination with Chinese traditional medicine led to them to look for a career change."" In fact, 90% of his students are not Chinese or of Chinese descent and have worked in a wide range of professions such as law, accountancy, banking, and office management. Their ages range from 30 – 60. It most certainly seems that the practice of acupuncture will continue to spread in the West."
12,Stress Is A Major Problem In The 21st Century,health-fitness," One of the major health problems that we have in the 21st century is that of stress. It is known to be behind many different illnesses, and it can have many different causes. In fact, stress can attack anybody for any reason. For instance, one of the problems that many people suffer from is money worries. People who feel that they do not have enough money worry constantly about how to pay the bills, how to buy new clothes for the kids, how to pay for repairs to the car before its’ MOT, how to buy a new car, how to pay the rent, how to save for a holiday – the list is almost never-ending. The interesting fact is that even those who do have enough money for all those things, and indeed may be wealthy and have more money than they need, can also suffer from stress about money. In this case, it is worrying about the fact that some disaster may strike, and they will lose all their money. To those who really do not have enough money, that may seem astonishing, but the fact is that it happens. Other people may have a successful business with sufficient personal income but stress over the fact that they need to build the business up even further in order to ensure an ever-growing level of income so that the business doesn’t fail. Of course, money is by no means the only cause of stress. As I am writing this article, I am stressed about the fact that I may not get it finished by the end of the day and I will therefore be late in delivering it, which in turn will mean that my client will not be happy with me. Many people have stresses at work. Simply getting there on time every day can be stressful, especially when you get held up on the motorway, or the trains fail to run on time (which is most of the time!). Stress can come from a boss who is not happy with something you have done or not done. It can also come from work colleagues who shun you and won’t talk to you because of something you said or didn’t say, or for reasons that you don’t understand. Then there is the stress of getting home again in the rush hour, perhaps to an ""other half"" with whom you are having relationship problems. All couples experience relationship problems from time to time because none of us is ever going to agree with each other all the time. Of course, you might also be stressed because you don’t have an ""other half"" and have to go home, do the washing and ironing, clean the house, cook dinner etc., all by yourself. You might simply move home. That is known to be one of the most stressful things that we ever do, even if moving to a nicer/bigger/better home, and yet on average in the UK we move home every seven years. Ten times in an average lifetime. You might lose your job, or be fearful of doing so, especially if your company is going through a hard time and laying people off. Will I be next? You might have been diagnosed with an illness or perhaps lost a loved one. Yes, there are many things in this world today that can cause stress. How we handle it can have a big effect on our lives overall. Some people take a holiday in order to relieve stress and get a bit of ""me"" time. However, other people suffer stress even on holiday because they worry about how their dog is getting on in the kennels. One thing that has been coming more into fashion in the last few years is acupuncture for treatment of a lot of physical and mental problems. Stress acupuncture in London has been found to have a calming and soothing effect on many people suffering from stress and has had many beneficial other effects. For instance, stress and worry has been found to be behind infertility in both men and women, and this has been treated with acupuncture and produced some very good results. Couples who have been unable to conceive as a result of stress, have gone on to produce a son or daughter."

15,Healthy Smile: The Best Gift You Can Give Yourself and Your Loved One This Valentine’s Day,health-fitness," Valentine’s Day and the month of February is all about showing your loved ones that you care about them. This could have been on the 14th of the month, over a romantic dinner or a family outing, or it could be through a vacation over the weekend or dining out when the Valentine’s Day hype has died down a bit. While jewelry, chocolates, and flowers are the usual gifts that come to mind in relation to Valentine’s Day, the best gift you can give yourself and your loved ones this month is a healthy smile. Gifts are usually seen as tangible objects that can be wrapped in colourful paper. You can do this with jewelry, clothes, and books, but how exactly do you gift someone a healthy smile? The answer is simple: By dedicating yourself to making healthy lifestyle changes. By changing your daily routine and eliminating bad habits, you can improve your oral hygiene and even your overall health. This is a gift not only to yourself, but to your loved ones too. Daily Routine Maintaining an oral health routine doesn’t require much additional effort. By making a few changes to your daily routine, you can take better care of your teeth. A few things you can do is to brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes. Use a fluoride toothpaste and be sure to brush your teeth right before going to bed. Neem Dental Clinic also recommends cleaning between the teeth, which is why flossing is a practice to add to your daily routine. You can visit a South Harrow dentist to know what your oral health routine should include depending on your lifestyle. Reduce Your Sugar Intake Throughout the month, you will be tempted by discounted chocolates as well as other sweets. From cupcakes decorated in red, cookies in the shape of hearts, and chocolates with delicious fillings, candy, sweets, and desserts are an important part of Valentine’s Day and other celebrations. However, sugar causes tooth decay, which means that you are likely to spend your nights or weekends nursing a toothache or visiting a root canal specialist at Neem Dental Clinic as opposed to taking your family out for a movie. Tooth decay may also require extractions, which will definitely mean you won’t have a healthy smile. What you can do is to have sweets only during mealtimes. This way, you can have a sugary treat after your meal and brush your teeth soon after. If you snack on sweets throughout the day, you are not going to brush your teeth after having sweets and your teeth will be vulnerable to sugar throughout the day. Stay Hydrated Water is better for your oral health as well as overall health. Drinking water right after a meal removes acids from the mouth, thus reducing decay. Most carbonated drinks have a high sugar content. Alcohol also has a lot of sugar in it and, while you may have enjoyed a glass of champagne during your Valentine’s Day dinner, moderation should be practiced when it comes to alcohol consumption. Regular Check Ups While these practices will improve your dental health, you will want to visit a South Harrow dentist regularly. Whether you need a root canal specialist to take care of a cavity or a South Harrow dentist to perform a simple tooth whitening procedure, regular visits to a dental clinic like Neem Dental Clinic is one of the best gifts you can give yourself as well as your loved ones."

19,UK Prisoner Alcohol Monitoring Tags A Waste Of Time Say Rehab Group,health-fitness," Over 70% of UK prisoners say that they had been drinking when they committed the offence for which they were incarcerated, according to The UK Alcohol and Crime Commission Report. Overcrowding in prisons, perceived light sentences for offenders and the role alcohol plays in criminal behaviour have all came to light recently and non more so than the suggestion that released prisoners should wear ""alcohol tags"". ""The government and the think thanks are missing the whole point. The point in rehabilitation is to cater for the needs of the prisoner so they won’t need or want to reoffend"" And the news that prisoners in Scotland in the UK may be forced to wear these monitoring devices that remotely screen if they have consumed alcohol, is part of a new proposal to help curb alcohol-related crime. The potential new system will see offenders wear tags strapped to their ankles, like those worn by people under house arrest or on probation. Designed to detect if the wearer has consumed alcohol or not. The tags examine a person’s perspiration every thirty minutes, looking for traces of alcohol in their sweat. They are waterproof and can be worn in the bath or shower. However, if a criminal has any ideas about taking the tag off, or tampering with them, the authorities will be notified at once. The Scottish government has given the private security company G4S the task of overseeing electronic monitoring operations until 2025. This comes in the wake of MSP’s voting to pass the Management of Offenders Act in 2019. The new law permitting various forms of electronic monitoring, and remotely checking if someone has consumed booze. The government maintains the legislation was introduced to broaden the scope of electronic monitoring. This is as well as bringing in other innovations such as GPS, while monitoring alcohol consumption remotely. More Drug Deaths Than Any Where In Europe – Even Higher Than US This could result in people in Scotland convicted of crimes linked to alcohol abuse wearing the device, often referred to as ""sobriety tags"". And, it’s not just alcohol that’s the problem; according to a recent report Scotland has the highest drug deaths in the Europe – now even higher than the US. Many of these drug victims no doubt had criminal pasts – perhaps a drug monitor is needed too? With 58% of adult offenders who are discharged from prison serving a short sentence (less than 12 months in custody) reoffending within 12 months. perhaps the tags are part of a solution, if not THE solution. The tags have been utilised in some European countries, while many convicted of a DUI (Driving Under the Influence) in the United States have been forced to wear one. The British government is currently mulling over implementing the system in England and Wales. However, almost inevitably, the proposal has not been without controversy. Many are concerned it may see offenders avoiding prison, where they may be forced to wear tags when they would have previously gone to jail. Campaigners Say Proper Rehabilitation Needed Free addiction treatment service Which Rehab says: ""Of course tags and any other form of reoffending is a good idea from a statistical point of view. But it won’t work. The government and the think thanks are missing the whole point. The point in rehabilitation is to cater for the needs of the prisoner so they won’t need or want to reoffend and can integrate into society and be a productive member of it – they need education, skills, psychology, transitional courses, motivation, and of course alcohol and drug rehabilitation."" There is no doubt looking for a solution to alcohol-related crimes, and what to do with offenders, can be a contentious issue. But many may question if fitting a criminal with a tag monitoring their alcohol consumption is the answer. We believe the answer is rehabilitation in its truest form, not just criminal reform but rehabilitation from alcohol and drugs – surely that’s the answer to cut crime and prison numbers if 70% of convicts are in prison due to alcohol?"
