1,Children for Adoption - What’s the Difference Between Adopting a Child and Sponsoring a Child?,news-society," Kind-hearted people confronted with photographs of needy children in the world’s poorest countries sometimes ask, ""Is adoption the answer?"" Celebrities such as Angelina Jolie and Madonna have, after all, adopted several children from developing countries. They are bringing these children up a world away from their poverty-stricken beginnings. Adoption is a huge undertaking. Even when it involves children from within the United States, it means complete life changes for both the adopter and adoptee. The child becomes part of the family forever, with all the joys and responsibilities that brings. Children available for adoption overseas present more challenges, such as  legal and financial obstacles. The new parents are aware that the adopted child is leaving his or her community, culture and heritage far behind. Sensitive adjustments are needed to make the transition a happy one. Overseas adoption can certainly be worth the effort. But adopting a child, particularly one from a far-off country, is a serious and lifelong commitment. Would-be adopters are truly compassionate. They want to help children who are barely surviving in the poorest regions of Africa, Asia and Central and South America. So many of these children are malnourished and lack even the basics such as clean water or adequate shelter. They have never had medicines or health care and may never be educated. There is, though, a simpler way to help a child in need. It is not as complex as adoption, but it will still transform a child’s life forever. That way is through child sponsorship. So what’s the difference between adopting a child and sponsoring a child? By paying just a few dollars a month, a sponsor ensures that the sponsored child is supplied with: •	food and clean water •	safe shelter •	medical checkups including immunizations •	educational opportunities •	life-skills training Many charities that offer sponsorship programs also provide Christian teaching and support as well as practical help. Children learn about God’s love and see how it alters their existence for all time. With the support of a sponsor, a child usually can stay within his or her community and country. The difference is that there is real hope for the future. A child who is properly nourished, educated and trained in different skills can grow up to lead a purposeful life. Instead of continuing in a downward spiral of poverty and ignorance, the sponsored child can be a force for good. He or she could even train to be a doctor or teacher, and help others in turn. A sponsor is linked to one particular child from the start. The two get to know one another through exchanging letters and photographs. Sponsored children treasure the fact that someone far away cares for them. They love to know about their sponsor, and to share information about their very different lives. Over the months and years a real and rewarding closeness develops. Some sponsors even travel to meet their child and build even stronger links with them. Both adopting and sponsoring a child involves building a long-term loving relationship. The important aim is to bring the most effective help to a child in need."
2,The Struggle To Save Money And The Death Of Christmas,news-society," It started in 2009, or at least that is when I first noticed it: the first real clear signs of the death of Christmas. ""Christmas"" is an institution that has been around forever. It means different things to different people. Whether it be a religious event, a commercial event, or both to people, it is something that happens every year, without exception, and it requires one to spend money on gifts for family and friends. Christmas is part of Life. Well, it has been … until now. It may not be fair to say it started with the coming of the 21st Century, but definitely since the start of this century, the world has changed and is changing dramatically. The first major turn of events was September 11, 2001. The World would never be the same again. A new low was reached for Mankind again in September, 2008, with the crash of the US Economy and the resultant domino effect on the rest of the economies of the world. Since then, Life has become tougher than ever before for many more people. The 21st Century could have been a great opportunity for Mankind. It could have been the start of a new renaissance. Instead we are seeing the continuing destruction of Ethics and Morals, and the accelerated poisoning of the concepts of ""right"" and ""wrong"" and a new Generation of young people who know nothing other than these ""new"" anarchistic, and chaotic ""anything goes"" concepts and whom will be our future world leaders. Babylon and Rome all over again! In 2009, here in Australia, Christmas was almost a non-event. Yes, there were still all the TV ads and the pamphlets and fliers in our letterboxes promoting all the ""specials"" but Christmas was so far from people’s minds being replaced instead by an impending sense of doom and gloom brought about by the instability of the ""global economic downturn"", then into its second year, and the ongoing backdrop of the senseless ""War on Terror"" joke, going into it’s 8th year, and still continuing to wear people down! People stopped buying and if they did, they were not spending the money they would have been expected to spend. This was the first signs of the demise of the financial side of the ""Christmas Spirit"" in Australia. In 2010, the same thing has happened, although only worse. We see the TV ads, we get the pamphlets, but the shopping malls are empty, and the shops are not even open late this year! Christmas is on the demise. For Merchandisers and the whole Retail industry this situation is a RED ALERT. For most merchandisers, Christmas is ""the time when you make your money."" If you don’t have a good Christmas, you may as well, shut up shop. That has always been one of the fundamentals of Retail in Australia (and probably the rest of the world too, I would expect!) The remainder of the year is a series of usually predictable ups and downs, but overall a treading water scenario until the next Christmas. The Retail Industry DEPENDS on Christmas to survive. So, no Christmas? What does that mean? It means the demise of the Retail Industry. Why is Christmas dying? People are not spending money. People are more concerned with their struggle to SAVE money in terrible economic times. This concern has become senior to anything else, including the ""peace and good will to all Men"" at Christmas time. To the man and woman living in 2010, anything that encourages SAVING is welcomed. To the man and woman living in 2010, anything that encourages non essential SPENDING is off the agenda. Christmas is always a time of spending. That spending has to be reigned in. The world has changed. The 21st Century marks the continuance decline of Mankind. The Renaissance never came. Kill Christmas and you kill Retail. Kill Retail, and you just create more tough times, more bankruptcy, more unemployment, more dissatisfaction, more conflict, more desperation and more crime. It snowballs and snowballs. And it has already been snowballing since the turn of this century. Empty shopping malls at Christmas, no one talking Christmas up, people making agreements to not give each other gifts this Christmas – these things are all the signs that the death of Christmas is near. Until the world economy recovers (if it ever will) and CONFIDENCE is restored in the minds of the people of societies we have nothing but black clouds on the horizon. Buy now while you still can. Some of those products you are looking at now won’t be there in 2011!"

4,Strained Pressure of Anti-Smoking Law,news-society," This was stressed at an orientation aimed at guarantee effective implementation of anti-smoking laws, organized by The Network for Consumer Protection on Monday. On the occasion, Dr Arif Azad, executive coordinator of The Networks, Murtaza Solangi, director general of Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC), Dr Anwar Raffay, advocacy and research coordinator The Network, Afzal Butt president National Press Club, and media persons from print and electronic media were present. Participants stressed that drastic measures needed be taken for the implementation of anti-tobacco laws to make Islamabad a smoking-free city. They asked the Ministry of Health to make a comprehensive plan to check violations of anti-tobacco rules. Participants said that the majority of government offices were violating anti-smoking laws as one could find even high government officials smoking in their offices. They called for urgently monitoring and punishing people violating this law. ""Though printing pictorial health warnings on cigarette packs is a great achievement by anti-tobacco advocates, implementation of anti-smoking laws is still an uphill task,"" said Dr Azad. He said that there were about 22-25 million smokers in the country and every year 247 people die of tobacco-related diseases daily. ""The sale of cigarettes to children under 18 and smoking in public places continues unchecked due to our feeble law implementation machinery,"" he maintained. Dr Azad further said that even retailers sold cigarette packs with stickers of their shops pasted on pictorial health warnings, but there was nobody to take action against them. He said it was unfortunate that this practice was continuing in Islamabad, where the law implementation machinery was relatively stronger. Dr Raffay said that at least 25 per cent of deaths in the country occurred due to tobacco-related disease such as heart attacks, cancer and chronic respiratory conditions,"" he added. Participants also accused the government of being ""negligent"" towards the increasing trend of Sheesha among youngsters. They termed it a serious public health issue. They said that students were increasing tobacco consumption of the product because they were unaware of its harmful effects. They criticized the Capital Development Authority (CDA) for allowing the sale of Sheesha at various food markets and commercial hubs. ""Sheesha is more hazardous to health then cheap cigarette as its 30 puffs are equal to four cigarettes and the smoke produced from a single pipe contains nicotine approximately to 20 cigarettes,"" said Dr Raffay. According to a study conducted by the World Health Organization, however, an individual must smoke Sheesha for 45 minutes to consume 1.7 times the nicotine of a smoker. Raffay further claimed that many Sheesha cafés use unhygienic conditions where people from ‘all backgrounds’ use the same pipe. ""This could become a cause of other diseases such as tuberculoses (TB) or mouth infections,"" he maintained. On the other hand, Zaffar Rahim, owner of a local Café that also provides Sheesha, said, ""We provide disposable mouth pieces to all our costumers and I’ve seen all other Café’s in Islamabad do the same."" Dr Azad said that it was difficult to discourage Sheesha trend in the country as it had become part of people’s lifestyle and was considered a fashion statement.

5,Audio Visual Installation,news-society," Audio visual installation at an event venue could be difficult, especially if you have a limited budget. However, it is not a wise idea to compromise with quality, as this is what the success of your event depends greatly on. There are ways in which you can lower your cost without compromising on quality. Tips to Lowering Your Audio Visual Installation Costs Following are a few tips to help you impress your clients. •	Consult experts: AV systems on hire are the best choice if you are planning on containing costs. Consult experts about your situation. Rentals that cater to small budgets will definitely have something that fits within your budget. •	Be choosy: A large budget gives you the luxury of hiring professionals to take care of all details of the audio visual installation and operation. When on a tight budget, identify what you can do without. •	PA system options: If you have a band playing at your event, you need to know details of the equipment in their possession already and what else you need to get to complete the setup. The band could have brought its own PA system, but you may still have to provide for the audio visual installation at the event site. •	Knowing the event to install the lighting: The event management company needs to be clear about whether your event requires specialised lighting. A proper stage lighting rig could be expensive in contrast to automatic lighting like dizzies which are cheaper and easier to use. They just need you to press the switch once they are set up. •	Projectors for cheap display of audio visuals: Projectors rigged to a DVD player are perhaps the cheapest way to display quality audio visual images. •	Use a PA system: Find out if the venue you are using for your event has a PA system. If they do, use it for the background music as well as live bands and any other sound requirement at the event. •	Choose a playlist over a DJ: An unfortunate choice to make. While a DJ is any day a better option, given he/she can tweak the music to the mood of the audience, play list is the option for you when you are on a tight budget. What You Should Know About Audio Visual Installation While your budget may be pulling you in all directions, what you should be looking at is value for money rather than a pure minimisation of costs. For this, it is essential that you understand the four fundamental factors that you need to get right for any audio visual installation. The first of these is clarity, which is critical for audio visual presentations. You can cut costs on audio visual installation by not hiring technicians, but it is well worth spending a little more on good AV systems in this category. The second factor is simplicity. Make sure that the AV equipment is easy to operate. The third is reliability. Look up reviews of the system that you are considering to avoid losing connection during the event. The fourth factor is realism. You need to ensure that the overall effect created by the audio visual installation is that of people participating together and feeling no barriers even if they are separated by distance. Planning any event is not easy and you can find an event management company even on a small budget. Smart thinking and a good understanding of your needs will help you the most in this matter. The ultimate aim is to hire AV systems and get technical support without emptying your coffers or sacrificing the success of your event."

7,Leonardo DiCpario A Leading Ambassador for the Environment.,news-society," The American actor Leonardo DiCaprio may be well known for his leading male roles within his Hollywood movies and his handsome appearance; however Leonardo DiCaprio is an avid activist and ambassador for environmental concerns. The Leonardo Foundation was established in 1998 and raises awareness of environmental issues by participation with organisations such as the Natural Resources Defence Council,  is on the board of trustees; Global green USA, where he serves as a board member, and  the international Fund for Animal Welfare, where he is on the honorary board of directors. The website for the foundation has allowed for a wider outreach and also helps promote current environmental campaigns such as ""the world wide movement to eliminate the use of plastic bags"" and more recently the Tiger Summit in Russia as covered by Just4theplanet recently. DiCaprio has donated US$1 million to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in a bid to save wild tigers from extinction.  As covered in our recent report there are fewer than 3,200 tigers left in the wild with a prediction of extinction within 12 years if something is not done now. ""If we don’t take action now"" said DiCaprio, ""one of the most iconic animals on our planet could be gone in just a few decades."" In 2001 Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation as an ambassador for the environment and conservation, was honoured by Environment Now, and in 2008 the Foundation joined the California Community Foundation and is known as the Leonardo DiCaprio Fund at CCF. Leonardo was honoured as an environmental ambassador when TAG Heuer celebrated 150 years in Basel, Switzerland.  At the event he commended TAG Heuer as an organisation who was moving to help save the planet.  It is apparent during his speech at the event that he is passionate about his environmental beliefs.  We urge readers to take five minutes to click on the video below and listen to what this wonderful ambassador has to say. Whilst we have prominent celebrities such as Leonardo, and political leaders such as Mr. Putin in Russia, news platforms such as Just4theplanet, companies such as TAG Heuer, and an abundance of charitable organisations bringing the needs of our planet to the forefront of peoples mind set; we just may have a chance.

8,The Best Emergency Power Systems,news-society," There are speculations more than ever about wars, famines and world governments of some sorts.  This is a reason to be prepared because you and I do not know exactly what and how they will do this, but we know that we should be prepared to a certain degree.  We should always resist their efforts to try to multilate us and if you are interested in freedom, then it would be a good idea to learn more about this.  Of course my first recommendation is prayer and then use what we have, which is our brains and wisdom and get prepared.  That is why buying the best emergency survival kits is the best investment for our families and ourselves. In this post, we will discuss some of the best emergency gear to buy.  If you have had concerned about issues like world domination and the energy grid being controlled and want to get prepared, then listen up.  I do not mean to scare everyone, but I do mean to grab your attention.  Emergency gear is not just something to take lightly.  You might depend on this supplies to keep your food hot, your water filtered and your cell phones powered. The first piece of equipment we will discuss is water filteration.  Having water filters will be able to help you keep your water clean without having to use the tap water.  Not to mention that most of the water has been diseased with so much fluoride that it can cause damage to your pineal gland.  It also can cause cancer.  Yet there are still dental assistants that think that you would have to drink a whole tube of fluoride in order for it to effect you.  Hello, what do you think is happening when you do it over a long period of time, like 1-40 years.  That is about 2 if not 4 tubes of fluoride that is being consumed.  Also, if you plan on purchasing water filters, make sure you get portable bleach tablets.  This water will be able to take water from the ground, filter out the dirt, then drop the tablets in and drink. There are some other way like boiling and then dropping in bleach tablets.  Then other people purchase water in bottles and keep 72 to 148 packs in their safety room.  Whatever you decide, having clean water is essential to living. Another very good piece of emergency gear is having portable solar power.  Buying solar power for emergencies will help to keep your electronics, heaters, ac unit, blenders and many more items charged up.  A small hot plate for example would be able to keep your food hot and help in boiling water as well. Some of the popular solar emergency equipment include the Base Camp Solar Kit and Sherpa 120 Explorer Kit.  You would be able to produce with the Sherpa 120 up to 120 watts of power and everything included is very portable.  And the Base Camp Solar Kit would be able to help you out in powering over 650 watts.  It is also portable just not as much, but could easily fitted into a truck, car or boat. Some people have decided to get many types of solar chargers for these types of reason.  From solar chargers for their cell phones to complete solar solutions to power their main electronics.  You can also connect more power to the base Camp Kit and that is exactly what consumers have done to have extra wattage. Another wise idea when buying back up emergency gear is to look into knives.  Having a knife can keep you safe from the crazy people who might attack you as well as the animals.  As much as it might be hard to sallow, we say this to let you know ahead of time.  If anything happens and your in a position where you could get ambushed from other people, having a knife would be a smart idea.  You can also protect yourself with other tools like tasers, batons, pepper spray.  But having a knife is important because those other devices would only be able to subdue them.  We don’t recommend that you have to kill anyone but we do recommend that having knives to protect yourself and scare others to leave you alone is smart.  You have to be careful because they might not be harmful to you at all, but in those times.  You can easily figure out if they want to harm you if they look like they desire to bring harm to you with a crazy look or if they stumble over their words way too much and if they make sudden moves with their body. These are some of the ideas to think about when buying emergency gear.  You should think about getting prepared for some nutso times because things tend to come up &its only when you are not ready that it seems really bad.  If you would like more information or to buy any survival gear, be sure to follow the links provided."
9,MaloneEditorial.com: Structure and the Novel: 4 Steps to a Bang-Up Opening Line,news-society," So okay, we talked in overview about structure and the novel in a previous post, so now let’s dive in.  And where to begin but at the beginning - of your novel. This sounds easy enough, no?  You have written your tome, whether from outline or discovery, and are now ready to dive into revisions. So, what should the opening of your novel accomplish? If anything has to be perfect, this is it.  This is the first thing an agent, editor, and reader will see, so you have to hook them in from the get-go.  Lose them there, and you’re done.  We used to call this the first fifty pages.  Noah Lukeman has distilled it down to the First Five Pages, which is much more accurate.  Because, agents used to say they’d look at those first fifty pages and of course, if they didn’t find something compelling on page one (and then page two, and some would give you until page five), they stopped.  For our purposes right now, let’s focus on the first line. Throughout your book, you have a reader to entertain, no matter through which venue you publish.  Readers are a bit more forgiving than agents and editors (the jaded section among us).  But readers are savvy folk.  They gravitate to individual tastes, specific genres, and are used to getting their fixes right off the bat. So, what exactly does that first sentence need to do? First and foremost, you must grab your reader.  That opening sentence is paramount.  ""It was a dark and stormy night"" works if you’re Snoopy (and already have a huge readership!), but for the rest of us, our best work needs to be spit shined to open.  Think of the great opening lines of novels you’ve loved.  While ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"" may seem pretty outdated today, still, you remember it.  When all else fails . . . call me Ishmael. What I often see—literally—are novels that open with ""It was a Saturday night in the city.""   Or, ""Thelma Sue was the youngest child of Peter and Marsha Smith, and she grew up in Pittsburgh in a yada yada yada.""  By then, you’re already zoned out.  And what follows is a laundry list of familial characters and their histories and traits (but we’ll get to the body of the beginning chapter in another post. Right now, let’s stick with our opening sentence). Okay, so you’ve written a four-hundred-page masterpiece.  How on God’s green earth do you distill all of that down to a bang-up opening line? Ask yourself these four questions: 1). What is your novel about in its essence?  Tell me that in one sentence.  (You won’t use this as your opening line, but the gist will come into play.)  For example: ""You better not never tell nobody but God.  It’d kill your mammy."" 2). What is the overall tone?  Is it poignant?  Funny?  Darkly serious?  Romantic?  We want the first line to reflect that tone: ""In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing."" 3). Who is the main character?  What is his outlook on life?  We want that reflected here as well: ""Gestures are all I have; sometimes they must be grand in nature."" 4). And last but by no means least, who is your audience?  How is that audience intended to relate to this main character or the broad scope of your opus?  Take that into big consideration.  I know, I know—we all write for ourselves.  But we’re hoping to take others along for the ride as well! Finally, you can spend as much time fashioning the perfect opening line for your novel as you do in polishing the rest of the book. Goes with the territory.  So, unless you nailed it right off the bat, find your opening line once you’re finished with the entire novel.  Much of the time it will spring into your consciousness unabated as you go through revisions, like a linebacker who by the fourth quarter has found his shot to the quarterback. So now, go bang out the best opening line in the world, and convince me to read your novel!"
10,Will President Obama win in 2012 Election?,news-society," The political cost of overhauling the health care system turned out to be higher than President Obama had expected. American voters bruised by economic hardships handed a crushing defeat to the Democratic Party in the US mid-term elections. Even a strong Jupiter could not help President Obama this time. President Obama is in Jupiter Main Period and Rahu sub period from Feb 2010 to July 2012. Transit Jupiter was weak and badly afflicted by transit Saturn during the months of May, June, July, August, and September 2010.  US Economy showed no signs of improvement, and was the main reason of Democrat’s defeat. Transit Jupiter will be strong next four months until Mar 10th 2011.  This will still be a good period for President Obama as main period lord Jupiter will be strong by transit. But President Obama has a difficult road ahead and will face new challenges between Mar and Sept 2011. Mahadasha lord Jupiter will again come opposite transit Saturn during the months of March, April, May 2011, not good at all. During this time Mercury, Venus, Sun, and Mars will also be in Pisces along with Jupiter directly in the fire power of transit Saturn from Virgo. During this time the sub period lord Rahu in President Obama’s astrology chart will also become unfavorable as Rahu will be transiting Ketu’s nakshatra and Ketu will be transiting Mars nakshatra, the badhaka planet for President Obama, from Feb 2011 to Oct 2011. These are very Sensitive months for President Obama and the United States. Finally mahadasha lord Jupiter will again come opposite Saturn one last time during December 2011, January, February, and March 2012. This will be again a very difficult period for Obama. This will also be a very difficult period for Vice President Joe Biden. During this time the Administration may seriously think of replacing him with a new Candidate for the 2012 elections. In nutshell President Obama will not be able to accomplish much in his first term. President Obama’s approval ratings will continue to drop during this time. There will be no improvement in the economy and the unemployment rate will continue to stay high. After July 2012 the momentum will again shift in favor of President Obama as he will come out of 12th lord Jupiter’s mahadasha and will enter ascendant lord, and 2nd house lord Saturn’s mahadasha. Saturn is a very good planet for President Obama. At the same time transit Jupiter will enter Taurus sign on May 16th, 2012, and will start aspecting the natal position of Saturn and Jupiter in Capricorn in President Obama’s astrology chart. This will be excellent time for Obama when luck will be on his side once again. President Obama’s approval ratings will go up after June/July 2012, and the public opinion will again shift in his favor just before 2012 elections. Hillary Clinton will replace Joe Biden for the Vice President’s position in 2012 elections. Obama will win 2012 elections very easily and will get re-elected as the President of United States for the second term.  Year 2013 and 2014 will be the golden years in Obama’s second term and for United States. The economy will be doing better in US, and President Obama will solve many domestic and international problems during this time. Obama will be able to end the two wars and bring troops home during this period. Obama may even win another Nobel Prize or some kind of award during this time. During this time Jupiter will be transiting Gemini sign from May 30th, 2013 to June 18th, 2014, and will aspect transit Saturn in Libra, the mahadasha lord in Obama’s chart, by its 5th aspect. President Obama will run out of luck between Oct 2014 and Dec 2015 when transit Saturn will be in Scorpio. Saturn in Scorpio will aspect all important planets in his astrology chart while Obama is in Saturn’s mahadasha. Transit Saturn in Scorpio will aspect the natal position of ascendant lord Saturn  and 12th lord Jupiter in Capricorn by its third aspect, the natal position of the 7th house lord Moon in Taurus sign by its 7th aspect, and the natal position of Rahu and 10th house lord Mars in Leo sign by its 10th aspect. During this time President Obama will find it very difficult to complete his second term.  The enemies of the United States are represented by the 7th house in Obama’s chart. The lord of 7th house Moon is in Taurus sign at 10 degrees in Obama’s chart. When Saturn goes to 10 degrees in Scorpio it will aspect the natal moon, which will happen three times between Oct 2014 and Dec 2015 will be a very sensitive time for President Obama and the United States."
11,Human Lungs Can Be Attacked Not Only by Smoking,news-society," Indoor air pollution and not smoking cheap cigarettes is the most important cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in India, reported a prevalence study conducted by Pune-based Chest Research Foundation (CRF) in collaboration with the KEM Hospital, Pune, and the Imperial College, London. In the West and other wealthier countries, smoking is the single most important causative factor of COPD. The CRF study found that the prevalence of the respiratory disease was 6.9 per cent in the Indian population. Among those identified with COPD, only 7 per cent were tobacco smokers while the remaining 93 per cent were non-smokers. Almost 700 million people in India suffer from high levels of indoor air pollution affecting women and young children as 75 per cent homes use biomass fuel like wood, crop residue and dung cakes. Other research declared that exposure to wood smoke through home heating and cooking or through ambient neighborhood pollution may further increase the risk of COPD and related pulmonary problems in smokers. The age factor was particularly disturbing. ""Approximately 23 per cent of COPDs occurred in people less than 40 years of age. It was believed that COPD starts after 40 in people who have been smoking for over 15-20 years. In India, where the exposure to indoor air pollution begins from childhood, it occurs in younger people,"" said chest physician Sundeep Salvi, director of the CRF. Statistics show that on March 2010 were found 10 causes of deaths in Maharashtra, and COPD was the main cause of these deaths. What can help at this moment is a national COPD control program. ""We have such programmes for malaria, filariasis, tuberculosis and AIDS. The mortality is far too high in COPD than any of these diseases. Policy makers should take up the issue and act fast, ""said Salvi. ""Even though there is no similar report from other states in India, it seems likely that COPD may be one of the leading causes of death in other states too. The WHO had compiled a nationwide analysis in 2002, and reported that deaths due to chronic respiratory diseases accounted for the second largest cause of death, with COPD as the main cause of respiratory deaths,"" said Salvi. He spearheaded the study along with social scientist Sanjay Juvekar from KEM Hospital and Peter Barnes, an eminent professor of respiratory medicine at Imperial College, London (UK). The study was conducted in 22 rural villages in Pune district with a population of over 1 lakh. As many as 3,000 adults over the age of 25 years were randomly selected for the study which used a standardized respiratory health questionnaire and spirometry (lung function test for determining COPD). In the western, tobacco smoking is believed to be the most important risk factor for COPD. However, recent evidence refutes this. ""Exposure to biomass fuel smoke is the biggest risk factor, not only for India, but even globally. Compared to 1.1 billion smokers, more than 3 billion people use biomass fuel for cooking and heating purposes worldwide,"" Salvi concluded.

12,Asthma Rates Decrease Among Children Due to Reduced Number of Smokers,news-society," Currently fewer Canadian children are being diagnosed with asthma, due to reduced number of smokers and consequently because of reduced exposure to second hand smoke, according to statistics. In more than a decade rates of the chronic inflammatory disease dropped to substantially reduced levels among children aged two to seven. ""A variety of environmental factors, as for example reduced exposure to cigarette smoke contributed significantly to these statistics,"" the study declares. Canada's national statistical agency (Statscan) showed that 9.8% of children aged two to seven were diagnosed with asthma in 2008-09, significantly lower than 13.2 % in 2000-01. This drop occurred mainly because fewer Canadian children live in families where adults smoke, according to study. About 6% of children aged 11 and under were regularly exposed to second hand smoke at their homes in 2008, if compared with 24% in 2000. As about teenagers 13% aged 15 and older smoked regularly in 2008, dropping from 19% in 2000. In present a few parents smoke because there were no statistically proved differences in asthma rates between children in smoking and non-smoking families between 2006-07 and 2008-09. ""This data shows that adult smoking rates dropped significantly, thus parental smoking is not seen as the leading cause of asthma in young children,"" declared the representative of Statscan. This link between reduced smoking and fewer cases of asthma are not unique only for Canada. For example, after Scotland prohibited smoking in public places, serious cases of asthma fell among preschool and school-aged children. For instance researches from western countries discovered that asthma rates among children rose steadily for several decades before decreasing. Statscan declared that reduced disease rates might also be due to changes in the population structure, changes in diagnostic methods, decline in the predominance of respiratory allergies, advances in air quality and changes in hygiene practices. As well as asthma, ear infections are related to exposure to second hand smoke. Canada’s national statistical agency found out that asthma predominance decreased in the Atlantic Provinces, Ontario and Quebec, but remained quite stable in the West. This survey also discovered that the number of children who had had an asthma attack in the past 12 months dropped to 36 % in 2008-09 from 53 % in 1994-95. The give study is based on data presented by the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, a long-term study that capture information from thousands of families. The survey has been led every two years since 1994-95."
13,Election Day Online,news-society," All too frequently, voting on Election Day is done in confusion and uncertainty. Sure, we all know the big-ticket elections like the Presidential races, and possibly some of the simpler gubernatorial races, however when you step up to the voting booth with your ballot, there's likely to be a lot on there that you didn't hear much about. The less publicized races (including district attorney, city councilor, or even town clerk) and the ballot questions are given some amount of support in voter packets, but those can be often ignored or fail to discuss the issues in depth. Thankfully, the Internet provides a vast amount of assistance in preparing for Election Day. The 1st and easiest bit of information available online to help on Election Day is your proper polling place. Google Maps will now actually allow you to type in your address and not only find your polling place's address, however also directions to that location. Brief information on major races is also represented there along with the proper contact information for local and state election offices. Your state election office may also provide this information on an election information website, that will also likely contain additional information about the candidates up for election. Digging down a little deeper is required to obtain additional information about the various candidates. Initial investigation will yield their campaign websites at 1st, that can be solid places to being looking for details however which are also very much public relations attempts by the campaign staff. That you can get a good general idea for a candidate's stance on the issues on an official site, however further investigation is definitely necessary in order to get the whole story. If you are examining an incumbent candidate's position on the issues, OnTheIssues (ontheissues.org) provides a substantial amount of detail on elected officials' voting record across a wide variety of issues. For challengers without an established voting record, a little more investigation is necessary and can require some extensive searching. Relevant news sites can help provide the candidates' recorded statements, although these kinds of need to be taken with a grain of salt due to the likely bias of the hosting organization. Ballot questions, initiatives, and propositions are also very often confusing to anyone who hasn't researched them prior to voting. The text of these types of is often so legalistic that it's nearly impossible to make an immediate judgment about them. Thankfully, in addition to the somewhat helpful voter information packets mailed prior to the election resources exist online to aid here as well. Project Vote Smart (votesmart.org) details all state ballot questions with not only the normal text of the questions, however also simplified breakdowns thereof. Vote Smart also provides details on the major supporters of each side of any given ballot question, as well as notable statements made about the question. When investigating ballot questions or candidates, however, you must exercise some caution. It can be tempting to simply head straight to Wikipedia for information on a candidate, however doing so is risky when it comes to the quality of information presented. Politics being the inflammatory subject that it is, it's entirely possible that your visit to a candidate's entry may coincide with vandalism on that same entry, that would in turn provide you with potentially false information. In addition, visiting only one source for information on a political matter is ill-advised. As opposed to depend on a single source, visit several different sources and form your own opinion dependant on what you find."
14,Where Is The Way Out?,news-society," Have you ever wondered how it feels when you were in an office and suddenly you heard a voice announcing that there is a bomb plotted in the area? Most probably the news will drive you crazy. What happened during 9/11 attack is truly devastating. Many people died for no reason at all.

Otherwise, it might cause huge problems that you will never forget. Furthermore, If a certain situation would call for emergency evacuation, always remember, in the advent of any uncertainty, be mindful of your security and safety above all else."
15,Tips To Create Unique Wedding Chair Covers,news-society," Whether wedding chair covers are used, trimmings are added, or the two are combined, the results when you decorate your venue chairs will be magnificent.  Whilst wedding chair covers instantly and easily revamp venue chairs, other decorations can work wonders as well.  Plain white or ivory covers work as a ready canvas for your wedding colours.   Decorative accents may include greenery, ribbons, or festive ornaments.  With so many alternatives, one thing is certain - no wedding venue has to be spoiled by unsightly, unattractive chairs. Ribbons and Bows Ribbons are a great way to accessorise your wedding chair covers.  A lone band of ribbon may be used for a modern and clean effect, while multiple bands of ribbons can give a more elaborate appearance to your wedding chair covers.  Simple bows can have an extremely eye catching effect when placed as an accessory for wedding chair covers.  Giant bows can be used to signify the important tables, or can just be placed on every chair.  Available in every shade you can imagine, ribbons, bows and sashes are a simple, effective way to introduce colour and add interest, particularly if the rest of your wedding linen is white. Fabric Fabric strips and sashes can be used much like bows can. Having a strip of draped fabric on the back of a chair in a different colour can add a classy look to a wedding chair cover.  Cut a wide length of material in a colour or pattern that suits your theme and drape it gently from the chair back or tie it in a neat band in a ruffled or pleated effect.  Instead, two toned material could be pulled in a diagonal sweep across the chair. Pillows Use decorative throw pillows, or smaller pillows that you can cover with fabrics to match your theme or wedding colours.  This suggestion offers comfort as well as style, although it is perhaps only appropriate for less formal weddings. Flowers Flowers can be used on the backs of your wedding chair covers, adding a splash of colour.  Flowers that compliment the centre pieces could be slipped into chair bows or sashes.  Otherwise, ask your florist about producing flower chair backs to co-ordinate with your floral table centres.  If your budget doesn't stretch to a floral garland for each guest, then just decorate the chairs at your head table.  Otherwise, you may want to contemplate using artificial flowers.  Rather than garlands you could use small posies and hang them from the chairs with ribbons.  Attaching a single flower to the side of the chair with a decorative ribbon is a very subtle way to style an informal wedding. Personalising Draw attention to the bride and grooms chairs by adding their initials to the covers or sashes in embroidered letters.  Personalise each chair with the name of the guest assigned to that seat.  This will create a more contemporary reception look as your tables can be less cluttered; just fasten your place name tags to the backs of chairs.  Ensure you use a bold colour and clear writing so that guests can find their place setting easily. Themes If you have a theme, rather than a simple colour scheme for your wedding decoration, the possibilities are endless when it comes to your chairs. Snowflakes are great for winter themed weddings while spring flowers can be used for a fresh look in March.  Dazzling, vibrant colours work well in summer for wedding chair covers and autumn foliage can be used to add warmness to your wedding venue."

17,Smoking Warnings Can Be Accidentally Cool When Supposed To Be Scary,news-society," Earlier this week the Food and Drug Administration unveiled proposed warnings for cigarette packages in the U.S. In place of the current Surgeon General’s Warning, which politely taps smokers on the shoulder to whisper about risks about tobacco related diseases. These graphic labels, which would occupy half of the package’s surface area, shout that you are going to die. That’s the idea, anyway. There’s the nice-looking man in a suit lying in his coffin, the emaciated, ambiguously gendered hospital patient gasping for life, the still-alive but fairly grotesque man, post-tracheotomy, blowing smoke through the hole in his neck. Of the thirty-six proposals, some are graphic (a Tetris-style cigarette pack and gravestone icon with an arrow from the former to the latter), some evoke comic books (a man injecting a cigarette into his arm as though it’s a needle bearing heroin, with the words ""WARNING! CIGARETTES ARE ADDICTIVE"" in a comic-book-style font), and some strive for realism. When photography is employed, it’s more likely to make you cringe for being cheesy than for being gruesome: a woman sobbing; a stone-faced man with a shaved head pulling apart his outer shirt, Superman-style, to reveal a T-shirt that says ""I Quit""; a man blowing smoke in a woman’s face with the oversold, defiant pucker of the villain in an after-school special. And school-aged kids are part of the target audience. The New York Times writes that ""every day, about 1,000 children and teenagers become regular smokers, and 4,000 try smoking different cigarette brands starting from Winston Cigarettes or Bond cigarettes for the first time."" (The statistic raises the question of at what point one crosses over from being a novice smoker to a ""regular""… when the bodega worker knows your order?) That points to another problem: the illustrations, though less snicker-worthy than the photographs, carry the risk of being cool. Tim Jacobus, who illustrated the covers of the ""Goosebumps"" series for a decade, is an expert on freaking out twelve-year-olds, and he worries that these drawings might have the opposite effect. ""The illustration style, there’s an appeal to that,"" he told me. ""Kids may be, like, ‘that’s kind of gruesome, but it’s cool, I’m going to hang on to this.’ "" Gahan Wilson, who does his share of creepy illustrations, including for this magazine, says these drawings are ""coddling"" smokers. Wilson believes in the power of scary imagery (his rule of thumb: ""if it scares you it’s going to scare them""), but, as a former smoker, thinks the F.D.A.’s warnings would be more effective as straight text. ""The extreme thing"" to do, he says, would be to write, in the style of a poison warning, ""Caution: contents will cause cancer,"" and leave off the drawings. ""Words are much more to the point,"" he says. That has been the approach in other countries, where cigarette packages must bare bold, Helvetica warnings about the risks, which seem to vary, by country, in severity and likelihood. In London ""smoking kills""; in Spain it ""can kill""; in Nicaragua it ""seriously harms""; and in Ireland it ""can damage the sperm."" But in all, the message is clearer than that of a comic-book arm getting injected with a cigarette. If images are to be used, Jacobus and Wilson agree that they need to be grosser. ""Go after the fact that smoking is rather disgusting,"" Wilson suggests. ""That would up the ante."" And run with it: ""Exaggeration is what makes all the difference in the world,"" Jacobus says. ""A set of fangs or an evil eye or something like that—you’re trying to push that, make that as extreme as possible."""
18,Vertical Garden: The Green Revolution,news-society," Birth of the first vertical garden architecture green revolution and energy saving, through innovative projects and botanical studies. Developed from an original idea and intuitive French architect Le Corbusier was developed by the botanist Patrick Blanc has inherent in itself and many innovative concepts and design for both the ecology and the lines to follow in this regard. Just respect for the environment and its maintenance and upgrading was born on vertical garden located within a shopping center in Rozzano, conceived and designed by Francesco Bollani of a fruitful collaboration with the architectural firm of Montpellier and Peverelli the company, and is the largest green wall in Italy. Built through the composition of forty-four thousand two hundred different species of plants grows well for 1250 square meters of green, innovation, energy saving and above all beauty. In a historical moment in which the preservation of the environment and experimental forms of protection and ecological sustainability on the agenda this wall represents a true revolution in that auspicious will be taken as an example for many others and for developing a beautiful and natural form of protection. There are many points in favor of this ecological design: the building's thermal balance due to sun protection and energy saving, reduction of fine particles and the absorption of CO2, the reduction of ambient noise so the sound insulation from 'outside. In addition, the vertical garden can be removed and replaced with ease, unlike stationary walls and walls. As already said more than two hundred plants are used to make up the wall, ranging from the evergreen flowering plants that give it an impressive and festive thanks to all the variety of colors ranging from pink, yellow, red, white and blue on the basis moss that gives firmness and strength. The substrate also allows high-capacity water to irrigate with ease and keeping costs down. A single color effect that meets all the standards of environmental sustainability that will be expanding as: beauty, easy maintenance and low cost of installation and composition. Just plants, after the solar wind power, in fact, are becoming the new frontier of renewable energy as he had anticipated and hoped for the architect and Austrian artist Friedrich Hundertwasser. In its ideal vision of the office because he saw the original architect an environment that fosters creativity and surrounded by nature, like a great forest. ""An office must have natural air, it is possible that the windows do not open even if they can simply enter bad air. Do not install a central heating or air conditioning to central direction, so that it works only if there is no open window. It must be a change of air set in a natural way. They may, for example, holding an office environment with grass roofs. Under a roof of grass there are headaches. The people who work in this office are, of course, much better than if they had a sad roof without plants, which affects the soul and head. Instead of curtains and blinds should be some plants that are on the windows. I think a very simple adaptation of the window, a shelf for plants, a kind of shelving for books. ""A very original and idealistic vision that, although it cannot be grasped in its entirety, can certainly provide interesting ideas for the architecture of future."
19,The Impact of the Proposed Legal Aid Changes,news-society," Justice Secretary Ken Clarke has been laying out proposals for changes in legal aid that will limit the types of cases where legal aid is available, therefore savings significant costs. Currently over £2 billion a year is spent on legal aid in the UK, an amount that is more than ten times that of France. Areas where legal aid will no longer be available will include claims against hospitals, doctors and schools, immigration, benefit and employment disputes and family law cases. Also in the proposals is that fees for legal aid solicitors will be cut by 10%. It is being seen by supporters as removing legal aid where it is being wasted but keeping it where it is really seen as necessary, while critics say that it will mean the poorest members of society will in some cases be unable to get justice. So, what will be the impact of these changes should they go ahead? One area of law that has significantly increased over the last decade is no-win no-fee suits. Currently the costs, and therefore solicitor’s fees, are recovered from the losing side. This is something that will no longer be possible. In most cases legal aid will no longer be available in cases against public institutions such as doctors, hospitals and schools. Cases that will be affected will include those seeking legal action after medical mistakes. With regard to schools it is likely to limit the number of accident claims and appeals against school entrance. Some would argue that not being able to take legal action for genuine accidents is a good thing while other say it means that institutions will no longer be held responsible for a lack of care. Family Law is seen as an area that will be impacted most by these proposed changes. Half of the total money saved will happen in the area of family law alone. Legal aid will still be available in cases that involve domestic violence, forced marriage and child abduction, but in a relatively straight forward case it will not be the case. In general it is expected that the number of so called minor legal disputes will be less commonplace. This is something supporters see as a major plus points, on top of the obvious fact that it will save public money. The changes may put to an end (to an extent anyway) the increasing culture of looking for blame to profit from unfortunate situations, such as minor accidents. Some see certain cases as people taking advantage of legal aid where they would not pursue the case if they had to pay for it themselves, even if they could afford to. This will therefore reduce unnecessary legal action. There are, of course, potential problems. Some are worried that the less well off will suffer unfairly, that there will be situations where people will not get justice where someone better off, and able to afford legal advice themselves, will be able to carry a case forward. It could also lead to irresponsibility with businesses, organisations and individuals held less responsible for their actions. Andrew Marshall (c)"
20,Decline Among Beer Drinker & Smokers,news-society," In past recessions smokers and beer drinkers kept puffing and drinking. This time it could be different. The downturn and associated austerity measures may actually be accelerating a long term decline in both bad habits in the developed world, raising pressure on the two industries to innovate. For example cigarettes sales in developed countries are affected by price, and price is mainly driven by taxes, something austerity-minded governments are busy rising. ""They will look at tobacco as an easy way to tax, much as they would look at the alcohol industry,"" declared RBS analyst Robbie Aitken. It is important to add that beer sales in Europe and North America rose in the temporary recession of 2001 and 2002 for both Heineken and Interbrew, the predecessor of Anheuser-Busch InBev, prompting AB InBev's finance Chief Felipe Dutra to remind investors of beer's status as ""cheap entertainment"" in a 2008 presentation. But last year, the world's top four brewers all sold less beer than in 2008. Volumes in Europe and North America have dropped particularly sharply. In some countries with a bar drinking culture, consumers have opted en masse to drink at home. Britain's Punch Taverns announced this year plans to sell more pubs as it struggles to keep them profitable. This is not necessarily a negative for brewers, but third-quarter results show they also have problems that are a direct result of economic hardship. Heineken added that weak consumer sentiment and austerity measures led to poor third-quarter trading in the Netherlands, Greece, Italy and Spain, parts of Eastern Europe and especially Britain. AB InBev, with almost half the U.S. market, has noted that drinking has tailed off in key demographic, young males who have been disproportionately hit by the financial crisis. Tobacco companies are facing the full force of the downturn. Recessions have not always limited smoking cheap cigarettes in the past, but spiraling taxes on the habit are now turning smokers off, or at least sending them in search of a cheaper option. International tobacco analyst Don Hedley, adding that tax increases, smoking bans and health warnings mean official consumption typically falls 1-2 percent per year in the developed world. British American Tobacco said in October the current downturn was having an impact that showed no signs of abating. But in Japan, BAT expects the market to fall by about one fifth next years. Even in the European Union tobacco sales fell 5.5 percent in the first nine months of 2010, mainly due to declines in Greece, Poland and Spain, Philip Morris International said. The company blamed tax rises, some imposed as part of austerity measures. Meanwhile BAT and Imperial Tobacco say they are increasingly losing smokers to black market producers. Emerging economies and new product lines are the most obvious source of much needed growth for both brewers and tobacco companies.

2,Getting a Green Card,news-society," A green card visa is needed for foreign nationals to live and legally work in the United States, and is valid for ten years.  A green card may be obtained in several ways.  One method is to marry a United States citizen.  Another way is an employer can petition for a foreign national to become a permanent resident.  Yet another way for a foreigner to gain U.S. citizen status is through the EB5 Visa Program which is also known as the Immigrant Investor Program.  In addition, a relative of a foreign national may sponsor him or her provided he/she is a United States citizen, or a permanent resident. A green card is a privilege, not a right, and they can be revoked under certain circumstances. People immigrate to the United States for many reasons, including professional reasons, economic reasons, and to escape persecution.  To stay in the United States it is important for foreign nationals to become a permanent resident.  Sometimes, conditional green cards are issued to spouses of permanent residents.  Conditional cards are valid for two years.  If the marriage lasts and the spouse has not committed a crime, a permanent resident green card is issued. There are obligations that foreign nationals must adhere to once they receive their green card visa.  Any change in address must be reported to Immigration Services within ten days of having moved.  Permanent residents may travel freely; however, a valid passport from the foreign National's host country is required.  If the permanent resident expects to leave the United States for one year or more, a reentry permit is needed before leaving the country. Permanent residents must obtain a social security number.  Furthermore, males who are of an age to serve in the military must register with the Selective Service.  The proper forms are available at any U.S. post office.  Permanent residents must also pay income taxes, and failure to pay income taxes may result in the permanent residence status being revoked. The green card is officially now called a permanent resident card.  This document is evidence of a foreign national's legal status in the United States.  Permanent resident cards must be replaced if they have been stolen, destroyed, or mutilated.  If a foreign national's green card was issued before they turned 14 years old and are now over that age, a new green card must be issued.  To receive a replacement green card, an individual needs to fill out Form I-90 from the USCIS. Should the application for a replacement green card be denied, the foreign national is notified by mail.  Should he or she receive a rejection, the decision cannot be appealed.  While the decision cannot be appealed, the person can file a motion for a reexamination of the case.  In this situation new documents must be attached to the motion.  This evidence may correct information that was in error when filing the first application for a replacement green card.  Documents submitted with the motion to reopen the case must prove that a mistake had indeed occurred regarding the initial application. In simpler terms, for a foreign national to become a permanent resident, the individual must obtain a green card visa. There are a variety of ways of going about this, but it is important that the recipient of the permanent resident card know that his/her status is a privilege, and not a right."

StockMarketFunding.com and it's CEO Mario Marciano will continue to provide you with live updates on the equity and option prices for Human Genome Sciences (NASDAQ Symbol: HGSI). Accord to Human Genome Sciences's website: ""BENLYSTA® is an investigational human monoclonal antibody drug. It is the first in a new class of drugs called BLyS-specific inhibitors that recognize and inhibit the biological activity of B-lymphocyte stimulator, or BLyS, which was discovered by HGS in 1996. We and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) are developing BENLYSTA under a co-development and commercialization agreement entered into in 2006."" In lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and certain other autoimmune diseases, elevated levels of BLyS are believed to contribute to the production of autoantibodies – antibodies that attack and destroy the body’s own healthy tissues. BENLYSTA® has successfully met its primary endpoint in two pivotal Phase 3 trials in seropositive patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In June 2010, HGS and GSK submitted regulatory applications seeking approval to market BENLYSTA® in the United States and Europe. The FDA has granted BENLYSTA® a priority review designation with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target date of December 9, 2010 – so it is possible that BENLYSTA® could receive regulatory approval in the United States before the end of 2010.

4,Kanye West Says Bush is not a Racist – What Do You Think?,news-society," A couple of days ago on the Today Show Kanye West, one of the most outspoken black men in America, was interviewed by Matt Lauer and was asked to apologize to George Bush for calling him a racist.  In typical Kanye West fashion, Kanye turned the interview, which was supposed to be about racism and George Bush, into a several day news cycle about poor Kanye and how he is perennially misunderstood and is constantly persecuted by the media.  This is unfortunate, as Kanye had the perfect opportunity to address an issue that has caused so much confusion, anger and distrust from black, brown and white alike – is American politics motivated by racism? For those who don’t remember, Kanye West was on a concert benefit on NBC in 2005 and blurted out on national TV that George Bush was a racist based on his slow response to the largely black victims of Hurricane Katrina.  George Bush told Matt Lauer recently in an interview that the remark by Kanye was the ""lowest point in his presidency"".  Everyone watched the events on TV unfold in the summer of 2005 in Louisiana.  Black people dying on rooftops, brothers and sisters dying in the streets, and the looting and anarchy that took over the streets of New Orleans was a an international news story.  The slow response by the federal government to provide food, water and medical assistance played out before our eyes as too many black people suffered and died.  These events surely brought out the many negative emotions that caused Kanye to call Bush a racist for not providing immediate aid to the largely black victims, but the honest truth is that Bush’s slow response was not a race issue, it was a class issue. Although not focused on in the media, we all know that many people escaped Katrina unscathed.   People who had cars and places to go left New Orleans before Katrina even came.  In the early hours of the Katrina aftermath, paying hotel customers (black and white alike) were whisked away in helicopters to safety.  Individuals and families who had the means to access federal and local public officials and services did so, and again were skirted off to safety.  It was only the poor (mostly black but many white) people who had no resources or access to resources who were doomed in the wake of the storm.  Bush and the response team did not act outrageously they simply did what the government, corporations, and those in power typically do – they took care of the rich and influential first and everybody else second.  Bush was not being a racist, he was just doing what politicians do. Too often we collapse ""black"" and ""poor"" as the same thing.  We also subliminally collapse ""rich"" and ""white"", ""Mexican"" and ""immigrant"" and ""gay"" and ""weak"".  If we as Americans stop doing this we would truly see how America works and how any individual can succeed in it.  If you are black and have money you can have everything that a white man with money has.  The most thugged out rapper can live in Beverly Hills if he wants – as long as he pays his mortgage.  The darkest brother can influence and control a party littered with racists and homophobes, just ask Michael Steele or Alan West.  A gay man can hit a baseball farther, jump higher, and run faster than 95% of people in this world – just check out, Glenn Burke, John Amaechi and Carl Lewis.   Success in America is a game where money, power and influence are the pieces you need to collect to win.  Racism, sexism and homophobia are blockers, but they do not determine whether you win or lose.  Focus on the pieces and avoid the blockers and you can have whatever you want. Remember – everything that happens to you or people you know is not a result of racism."
5,The Power of an The Right Treatment Center and What it Can Do for You,news-society," Deciding on a drug rehabilitation center can be overwhelming as well as difficult if you do not fully understand the correct things for which to look. Whether it's for yourself or perhaps a person you care about, you want to try to get the right fit to begin with. Coping with addictive problems is a heart wrenching process, and you want the very best possibility for being successful. Frequently, when people get in a drug rehabilitation program, they have relapses as soon as they return to their normal day to day activities. That's why it's doubly essential to pick a qualified service, given it can become more expensive, and not to mention emotionally draining, to have to do the program multiple times. One option to guarantee an effective drug rehabilitation program might be to search for something that may be personalized, and not just a cookie-cutter copycat. When you have a program which is created specifically to your personal necessities, you then have a much better prospect of concluding the plan and also leaving the addiction behind once and for all. From start to finish, you need personal attention as well as assistance that can handle not only the substance abuse, but any unwanted side effects as well, like depression. A good drug rehabilitation facility should take you step-by-step through the process so you don't need to do it by yourself. Look for a program that encompasses your family in the process too. Your family must understand what your situation is, and in case you are a family member thinking about facilities for a loved one, you need to know how you can help. When contemplating drug rehabilitation centers, individual comfort plays a sizable role in helping people conquer addiction. Check out amenities and find what is important for you, whether that be yoga exercises, massages, acupuncture, spas, hiking or something else entirely. Obviously, several aspects of drug rehabilitation are going to be less than comfortable, and that's why you want to be as comfortable as you can for the entire time. A facility ought to treat you with respect as an individual for treatment, not as somebody to be punished for harmful addictions. Comfort is a very important aspect for deciding on a drug rehabilitation center, because you will be more likely to be successful if you feel at home. You need this to become a good experience, so it's worth the money to get the best facility for your requirements. This gives you the best likelihood for being successful and results in fewer relapses. Besides checking out the quality and practical experience of the employees, if you are thinking about drug rehabilitation centers you ought to also think about the level of privacy of the center. Naturally you're concerned with privacy, however, you need to look for a center that values it as highly as you do. For the person receiving treatment and their loved ones, privacy needs to be a high concern. Privacy is an important factor in selecting a drug rehabilitation facility, but the after-care plan is important too. With the proper after care, a person can remain drug free and continue on the path they began during rehabilitation. This plan needs to be customized to the individual’s addiction, environment and background. When looking for an ideal program, you must above all, seek out something that fits your needs."
6,724 dead in Haiti's cholera outbreak,news-society," Three brothers recuperated Thursday afternoon in a once-open field now speckled by the bright blue tarps of a cholera rehydration clinic in the Haitian town of Bercy, where an outbreak has sickened hundreds of people. A cousin brought the young boys to the clinic, set up by Samaritan's Purse, said Roseann Dennery, a spokeswoman for the Christian charity. They plopped down on cots, drained by severe diarrhea and vomiting. What they did not know yet was that the night before, their father had frantically tried to find a motorcycle so he could bring in their mother for treatment. He could not find one in time. So while the boys were regaining their strength with the help of an intravenous drip, their father was making funeral arrangements for their mother. They had survived the earthquake, but this family was ripped apart by a disease that is now feared to be spreading rapidly. The death toll in Haiti's cholera outbreak climbed Thursday to 724 people, said Gabriel Timothee, director general of the Haitian Ministry of Health. An additional 11,000 people have been sickened. Epidemiologists predict the outbreak could last for months and say the entire nation of almost 10 million people is at risk because they have no immunity to cholera. The United Nations warned that Haiti is facing one of the most severe outbreaks of the disease in the past 100 years. It appealed to international donors for almost $164 million in response money. Of grave concern now are four confirmed cases that originated in the tent cities of Port-au-Prince, camps that sprang up to shelter those left homeless by the earthquake last January. Health officials fear that infection could spread quickly in congested, unsanitary conditions and in impoverished neighborhoods where clean drinking water is at a premium. Symptoms of cholera, an acute, diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine, can be mild or even nonexistent. But sometimes they can be severe -- profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting and leg cramps, which can cause rapid loss of body fluids and lead to dehydration and shock. If left untreated, a person can die within hours. Aid workers like those of the American Red Cross have been going tent to tent in Haiti's makeshift camps, telling people of the importance of drinking clean water and outlining practices that can help avoid contamination. Spokeswoman Julie Sell said Red Cross workers also have been handing out bars of soap. ""Wash between your fingers,"" they tell the camp residents. ""Don't dry your hand with a dirty towel."""
7,For Ex-Smokers Cravings May Never End,news-society," A recent study found that smoking craving by watching others smoke cheap cigarettes may actually increase with time, study finds New research suggests that the seductive power of smoking cues does not diminish over time for those who are trying to kick the habit. The finding adds a new challenge to efforts to prevent relapse among those struggling to embark on a tobacco-free lifestyle. ""The main point is pretty straightforward,"" said study author Gillinder Bedi. ""When people are exposed to things that they associate with a drug they use, they often feel an increase in craving."" Bedi, who conducted the research while with the department of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Chicago, said that the new twist her team discovered is that the impact of such cues apparently does not weaken as the period of abstinence lengthens. ""This means that quitting smokers may find that they are surprised by having a strong craving response when they come into contact with cues related to smoking, even after they have gotten through the initial withdrawal,"" she noted. To explore the issue of cravings, Bedi and her colleagues focused on 86 healthy male and female smokers who had not yet kicked the habit and weren't trying to do so. Participants were divided into three groups: one instructed to stop smoking for a week; the second instructed to stop for two weeks; and the third instructed to stop for five weeks. As an incentive, all were paid $30 a day to try to quit. On the last day of each group's abstinence period, each participant was exposed to a series of randomly presented cues designed to be either ""neutral"" or smoking-related. A fourth group of smokers -- asked to abstain for the full five weeks -- was also exposed to smoking and neutral cues at one, two and five weeks. Heart rate, blood pressure and salivary cortisol levels were measured before and after all cue exposures. All participants also completed a questionnaire to gauge their feelings of cravings after all the cues. Bedi and her team found that even though both withdrawal symptoms and independent cravings subsided with abstinence, cravings triggered by exposure to smoking-related cues actually increased the further down the abstinence road a former smoker went. Such cue-induced cravings were found to be more prevalent among the smokers at the five-week abstinence mark than among those asked to stop for just a week. Similarly, those exposed to smoking-related imagery along the way showed more cravings at the five-week point than at the two-week point. As a result, the researchers suggested that clinicians should consider the possibility that ex-smokers might actually face a more difficult long-term struggle with cravings than previously thought.

8,Punk Culture And New Punk Releases,news-society," Punk is defined as a loud, fast pace, and aggressive type of rock audio that is common in the 70’s and 80’s. New punk releases have great influence like their father, the punk rock. The art of music, attitude and trend that would evolve into 'punk-rock' originated with the garage rock bands of the 1960s. Velvet Underground and the Stooges would pave the way for the mohawked, pinned punks of the seventies, with their uncooked sound and obvious embrace of the anti-image. Punk rock, as we know it now, initially surfaced in the mid 70’s when the US, UK and Australia saw the arrival of quick, edgy, straightforward songs that shocked the music business to its core. Punk advanced from garage rock and stripped songs of its complexities to produce a quick, sharp edge that contrasted drastically with the glam-rock and roll and disco of the era. As punk moved from the underground clubs to the conventional, the trend, attitude and behavior would be replicated. The Sexual Pistols would self-destruct right after just one studio album at the finish of a tour of the US. At the last part of a chaotic gig at the Winterland Ballroom on January 1978, Johnny Rotten addressed the crowd with ""Ever get the sensation you've been cheated?"" This appeared to be mocking the crowd. Rotten left The Pistols and the band was no more. Although the Pistols would attempt to carry on under Malcolm McLaren's lead, the band’s fate has concluded and the genre had its first casualty. The Ramones would carry on touring for about 22 years, with a constant line-up. The Clash would evolve and started to become a major success in the USA with their newer, polished style. New punk releases of today have still resemblance to the original punk rock. Punk showed up amidst a bombardment of obscenities and sputter, with such a fierce intensity that its shelf-existence was inevitably shorter. As the mainstream caught on to its popularity, pop-tradition diluted the anarchic, angry, rage into a far more worthwhile and contrived revolution. Punk bands wore the correct clothes, made the right"
9,Valuable History Of Punk Records,news-society," The 70’s was when the original punk was discovered. It was the time of punk records hitting almost every household. If that stage of punk was the only thing you are familiar with, you will be amazed with its punk offspring of today. In the modern punk culture, there are still glimmers of the original punk music existing. The teenage angst which was very visible in modern punk is an obvious example. And the usual main theme of punk culture is some form of rebellion. Punk records rebellion is almost always centered on those with authority that practice it the wrong way. The usual target of these kinds of music is parents, police, bosses, military and the government itself. The fans may seem to be rash and radical but they are supporting and fighting what they believe in. they are aiming for a better society for everyone. The point that they want change in our society deserves respect even if we believe it or not. If you had been a punk rock fan from the 70's you would also become aware of the essential pieces of contemporary break-away punk audio is related. The edgy guitar is the greatest part of this resemblance. The ""Power Chord"" is the most common chord. It was the most popular in the starting of the music and it remains that way these days. These chords are basic enough for novices to play and with little or no talent can make someone sound skilled. By using these electrical power chords all around the fret board you can make numerous different combinations and sounds that come off as extremely special. Punkers did this all the time and carry on to do right now. Punk rock evolution has occurred with this to modify the styling and chords but majority of it is performed the very same way. Over the years punk rock has evolved but the pieces have remained almost the same. Aside from the original punk records and music, there have been various genres. Some of the new subgenres are Ska Punk, Pop Punk, Emo and other fads and indie rocks. These musical genres are offspring of their father, punk rock."
10,Patenting Your Own Invention,news-society," It is not easy to indulge in several processes to create a unique invention and in a long run somebody will just pirate and steal your hard work. In the United States, if a particular creator can prove the distinct invention as his own, he will be granted with exclusive rights to patent a particular idea. In todays modern world, there is already a particular scheme to protect your ideas and creations in a speedy and reasonable manner. Provisional patent works for all those with unique ideas and creations to gain sole ownership of their own craft. In this way, the creators exclusive rights will be protected against those who will counterfeit their original composition. You can find several ways which need to be considered to strengthen the claim of ownership. Following these ways will guarantee the inventor for possible success of his claim. This is a great idea to label a distinct product with detailed information, properties and how it works. The inventor of a particular composition will gather at least two witnesses and allow them to sign some important documents with date of initiation in front of a legal officer and allow the notarized officer to stamp and sign the documents to make it legal. Once completed, it is the sole responsibility of the inventor to keep the documents and his own distinct craft in a safe area while expediting the process for provisional patent application. At this point, the United States Patent and Trademark Office will confirm the date of the first invention or when the time the craft is completed. After filing a provisional patent, the creator makes sure that he has to file an application for regular patentability of his invention within a year in USPTO. After, when one has already decided to complete his application for exclusive rights over his own invention, he has to be opted to hire a patent lawyer to expedite the entire processes the best way possible. Then, the lawyer will do its power to check if the particular invention is completely original and no one has filed a provisional or regular patent on the invention. Once its genuine uniqueness will be legally proven, the creator or inventor will fill in different official documents and forms that will strengthen his claim. After the completion of official forms and documents, it will be sent to the Patent and Trademark office. An officer will continue to solidify the search to make sure that such invention has no records that it has been already patented by others. Once claims are proven valid, the inventor will be issued a notice stating that he will soon get an official number after fees will be settled. However, if certain problems arise, appeals can be raised to the Board of Patent Appeals."
11,Mother Russia Listens to Mother Nature,news-society," The Russian government approved a 221 million Euro energy efficiency programme in October 2010. The programme will try to address the efficiency of factories and how the buildings are run. Russia has finally developed a growing consensus that climate change is really happening, and thus there is a will to develop a more efficient economy. Until quite recently, many in Russia, including the elite where sceptical about global warming and frowned at scientific data. Today this is different and with the weather related anomalies and other unprecedented droughts and floods around the world, Russia has bowed down and finally accepted that something needs to be done. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin once quipped that global warming meant Russians would need to spend less on fur coats, but thankfully President Dmitry Medvedev is taking a much tougher approach. The World Bank says that increasing energy efficiency will improve the country’s productivity and competitiveness, which has helped improve the attitude towards climate change, global warming and the need to make change. There is also the obvious economic reason as the investment into the sector could save Russia almost 70 million tonnes of oil equivalent a year according to Medvedev ($38.5bn). Paradoxically, the pace of negotiations and actions around the world has slowed, leaving the public dumbfounded and frustrated at the ability of governments to effectively address the clime change problem. Despite the backsliding in other countries (UK being a prominent backslider) Russia appears to have realised that investment makes economic sense, whilst it moves to help combat global warming. Medvedev is reported to have aims to make Russia’s economy 40% more energy efficient by 2020. Just4theplanet has recently published information on China, and their increasing investment into these new sustainable technologies, but Russia lags far behind China. However, Russia is moving in the right direction and the government has plans to build eight plants that will produce energy-saving lamps as well as the first Russian solar plant expected in the city of Kislovodsk in 2011. Rostovteploelektroprovekt, a Russian company who designs energy plants and equipment, reports to have plans to develop wind and solar power worth almost $300 million in the Krasnodar region, with Siemens looking to cooperate in the project. Russian energy giant RusHydro also has plans to build a wind-power park in the city of St Petersburg. Hydro power and Biofuels development are also making progress in Mother Russia. In August 2010, The Natural Resources and Environment Ministry drafted a bill to promote recycling meaning that factories will have to start recycling the material they currently throw away. Living examples of this means that pulp and paper factories could easily sell waste to Biofuels plants with obvious win/win outcomes. To finish the story of hope, this year Russia’s carbon trading sector has also got off the ground with the government penning 15 project to the value of $30 million and more in the pipeline. As a global nation, we may feel that the Copenhagen conference did not live up to expectations. The considerable divide between developed and developing nations may have stood in the way of the main ambitions of a global climate deal. However, it is a pleasing notion that the mighty Mother Russia has made an environmental U turn for the better that will help combat climate change and global warming, whilst also making economic sense.

12,Fundraising and Motivating Your Troops,news-society," You’ve picked out your fundraising charity, you’ve decided what you will be selling for your campaign, you’ve also picked out local sites with the most amount of likely buyers, but have you done the most important step for your campaign? Have you prepared your volunteers for what to expect as they start the campaign? Focusing your Troops Just before you send your troops into the trenches you’ll have to prepare them in what to expect. How many times have you allotted chocolate bars to your volunteers only to have them hand back their share at the end of the campaign because they were too shy to ask for the donation. One great way to motivate your team is to redefine the selling aspect. Many people are timid to approach strangers and ask for donations. Ask them to simply start with friends and family. Ask them to take out the notion of the hard sell to people. Simply mention to your close acquaintances that you are part of a fundraising campaign for a charity, or institution. Mention what service or product is given in exchange for the donation. If the potential donor is open to the conversation simply mention the price and would he like to proceed? This is process of talking about your campaign is very simple and not stress inducing. People will simply tell you if they are going to take part in this or not. Getting Your Troops Past Objections Fundraising can intimidate some people. They feel pressure, seeing the job as a sales gig. Your job is to encourage your volunteers. Get them to set a time every week that the campaign runs to get out and sell the product. Donors see fundraising as an act of charity and not an aggressive sales tactic. Donations tend to come fairly easy. Your volunteers should experience little resistance but actually encouragement from most donors. In addition to this, many volunteers are said to have the feeling of ""helpers high."" This feeling is an uplifting feeling knowing that you’ve just contributed to the general good of the team, organization or community service. Keep your team updated on the fundraising and how close they are to the goal, or what the money is going towards to give them an extra boost. Reward Them for a Job Well Done Your troops have gone out into battle, worked hard and raised money. It’s time for a reward for your team. Throw a little celebration for them. Depending on your budget or group order out for Pizza, present achievement certificates or some kind of age appropriate recognition. Who doesn’t want to be thanked for the work they do. This builds good relations and continued support for your future fundraising projects."
13,What is Stability Testing?,news-society," In the pharmaceutical industry, stability testing refers to the process that tests how well a product retains its properties over the lifetime of the product. This type of testing offers a highly flexible and compliant way to conduct tests during the development phase of almost any pharmaceutical product. A small-scale stability testing unit can be set up in minutes and can allow for the simulated exposure of the effects of various environmental conditions, including weather, temperature and humidity, on a pharmaceutical product.  It is important to note that there are many small-scale stability testing units available. When selecting a stability testing unit, it is important to conduct extensive research in order to find the product that is best suited to the needs of a particular project. Stability Testing: A Step-by-Step Guide Professionals have established what stability testing is but what does it entail? The next section of this article will give a brief example of how stability testing can be used to test how the properties of a pharmaceutical product reacts to different levels of humidity. A humidity capsule will be used to generate the required humidity. This humidity capsule needs to be pierced and placed in the stability testing unit. Humidity capsules can provide relative levels of humidity in the range 0-95% are available in 5% increasing increments. The appropriate humidity capsule should be selected based on the objectives of the test. Place a sample of the pharmaceutical product in a separate compartment of the stability testing unit. Seal the stability testing unit with a sensor cap. The sensor cap will measure the level of humidity within the unit for the duration of the test. Dock a logger cap onto the base of the testing unit. Connect the logger cap to a computer via a USB cable to collect and record the humidity readings for the duration of the test. If the initiated tests are outside wireless range for communication with the base station then cabling and aerials can be used to ensure wireless communication. Incubate tests at the required temperature. When the tests are complete dispose of the humidity capsule and test chamber. Benefits of Small-scale Stability Testing Units: Using small-scale stability testing to conduct tests during the development of a pharmaceutical product allow for a variety of practical benefits. These benefits include: • The need for environmental chambers is eliminated • Each test is monitored in its own micro-humidity chamber • A full range of humidity and temperature conditions are available • Continuous data is collected throughout the study for each test • Improved sample integrity and less risk of cross contamination • Sensors can be easily calibrated • Only a small  amount of space is requirement • There isn't a need for salt solutions or desiccators • It is easy to set-up • It is ideal for use with toxic materials • The system can be used for monitoring and mapping applications • Data can be automatically backed up"
14,Resiliency Lessons From The Chilean Mine Triumph,news-society," A worldwide web of viewers watched 33 miners being pulled to the surface following a 600,000 ton cave-in that happened nearly one-half mile below the ground on a barren plain in southern Chile. Besides showcasing the tenacity of rescuers and the miracle of technology, the miners themselves offer dramatic lessons in resiliency that anyone can learn.  If your business and/or personal life has taken a downturn or if you can't seem to get over the tough times then these tips are for you. Lesson one:  Hope relies on possibility not certainty.  Shift foreman Luis Urzua practiced intelligent optimism when he reframed the event and steadfastly refused to give up.  He maintained his leadership position and convinced the miners to eat only every 48 hours for 17 days.  Without optimism, it could have been anarchy in that dark hole. When the probe reached the men, Urzua’s note that came to the surface expressed that hope: ""We are fine in the shelter, the 33 of us."" This is not a note of desperation but one of optimism. Lesson two: Action is the antidote to anxiety. The miners stayed busy, continually clearing away rubble, monitoring gas levels, praying, and using the materials and medicine that eventually were sent down the shafts. In short, they controlled what they could control. Lesson three: Play to your strengths. Reports indicate that different men served different roles. Victor Rojas kept a journal throughout the ordeal and became the writer who sent updates to the rescuers. Yonni Rojas used his experience in nursing to serve as the chief paramedic. Mario Heredia and Jose Gonzalez became the spiritual leaders, with Mario even requesting that a crucifix be sent down so he could erect a shrine. Edison Villaroel led the group in song, requesting that Elvis Presley songs be sent down.  Imagine Elvis the Pelvis gyrating more than a half-mile into the earth. Lesson four: Laughter lightens the load. Surely bringing a load of rocks to the surface as a memento for rescuers showed a sense of humor. Sing-alongs, as described by reporters, did not appear to be funeral dirges. Lesson five: Faith can move mountains. Many of these miners expressed a deep religious conviction through their Catholic faith.  Faith, however, is not the sole property of one religious group. To have a sense of a power beyond one’s human limitations is to tap into a wellspring of confidence and courage. Lesson six: Don’t bounce back.  Grow through.  After 69 days, many of the miners expressed that they found another side to themselves and their lives. Changed men rose from the earth, men who vowed to live differently. Whether marrying a long-time girl friend, finding new comfort in family, or advocating for changes in mining operations, each of the 33 now have the possibility of becoming better and stronger through this ordeal. So it is for all of us who face events that might seem as dark and crushing as what happened on a cold day in Copiapó, Chile.  The lessons offered by these 33 miners might spark a chord to help many discover personal resiliency. © 2010, McDargh Communications.

15,What Motivates the Tea Party?  Fear of a Black Planet,news-society," Tea Party Pundits Before we can talk about what the tea party is scared of we must first define who the tea party is. Contrary to misconceptions perpetrated by the media, the tea party is not a group dominated by backwoods, racist rubes from Bumblestraw, Arkansas.  Sure there are some wing nut, racists in the tea party, but the vast majority of tea partiers are a combination of poor, middle and upper class whites who generally align themselves with Republican ideals of small government, low taxes and free market capitalist principles.  Plainly speaking, the tea party believes that people should be free to form businesses, make money, and live their lives however they want with minimal government interference.  That doesn’t sound too bad, right?  So why are tea partiers so vilified and hated by democrats and other non-tea partiers?  Because too many tea partiers believe that America is an exclusive club reserved for white men and the women and few minorities they allow in. For most of American history the whole country was one big tea party.  Outside of the up and down of the great depression America has experienced an unencumbered period of growth and success based on capitalism and free market principles.  White people were free to form businesses, make laws, form exclusive clubs and get rich.  Sounds great for the people in power, but it was a struggle for those who were not stereotypical white Americans.  Women couldn’t make laws (until the 20th century).  Blacks couldn’t get rich (they were victims of slavery and Jim Crow).  Mexicans could come here and work for those in power, but the vast majority were not allowed into the exclusive clubs or even given the path citizenship.  Gay people simply had to stay in the closet for fear of being ostracized or worse. White men (whether republican or democrat) historically have had the unencumbered path to be middle class OR rich OR powerful OR basic citizens, and they took full advantage of that freedom to become all these things.  For every arrogant rich white man there is a good and peaceful rich white man.  For every racist white organization there is a white organization devoted to equality for all.  The point is, there was unencumbered path to choose your own destiny if you were white in America.  For those white Americans who truly believe in equality for all, America is turning into a beautiful place: minorities and whites are integrating, marrying and creating beautiful rainbow children; our culture is rich with music, food, sports and entertainment that represent the true melting pot of America; and our political landscape has advanced enough where minorities can hold public office and even the highest public office in the land. For the tea party these changes are not to be celebrated.  These events all point to a loss of power and control that symbolizes the destruction of the US as they know it.  The economic downturn in America is seen by many tea partiers as being caused by the degeneration of our society through the infusion of hip hop culture, freedom given to women, the allowance of Mexican immigration and the granting of power to the black president.  If left uncontained, tea partiers believe their way of life will be forever lost, with all the wealth they have amassed lost and redistributed to others and the country being blown off the map by the ""evil Muslims"".  The tea party sees all this and is in complete fear – fear of financial loss and fear of a brown planet. Clearly from a social standpoint the Tea Party is correct that things have changed dramatically in America in the last 20 years.  Where black and brown people have been given unfettered equal opportunity (music, sports and entertainment) they have taken full advantage and have produced a mixed bag of results.  For every Drake there is a Li’l Wayne.  For every Kevin Durant there is a Lebron James.  For every Beyonce there is a Kanye West.  Tiger Woods is a womanizer but for every Tiger Woods you can name 100 white athletes who have had multiple affairs.  In reality, men with power have always had multiple women outside of the marriage almost as a ""right of power"".  The difference today is that Tiger Woods issues and all the issues mentioned above are all over the media. Tea Partiers are bombarded daily with images and stories on all the popular websites, news channels, newspapers, i-pads, and cell phones about: how bad the US economy is, how black and brown people are doing wrong, how thugs have taken over music, how there are no jobs out there and the Mexicans will take them all.  Of course they are scared.  I would be scared too if any of these things had anything to do with reality or real power.  The truth is, none of these items have anything to do with real power in America.  Real power in America comes from having money and the vast amount of money is in the hands of billionaire republicans. Billionaire republicans still run this country through their corporations and their influence over the political bodies that make and enforce the laws of this country. They have co-opted the tea party as their representatives to make sure that the masses vote for the political bodies that will best serve billionaire republicans.  The tea party members are willing recruits, as their moral, political, and social value systems are most aligned with billionaire republicans.  As a tea partier who is scared about losing control and power in America, it is only natural to align yourself with the group that has all the power to restore things to their ""natural order"".  In order for power to be restored billionaire republicans are going to have to make some changes.  Crackdowns on programs for the poor and disenfranchised must come.  Healthcare for all, social security after working all your life, and Medicare for the sick and elderly all take money out of tea party pockets and must be changed or eliminated.  Mexicans must go back to Mexico so white people can have their jobs.  Okay, so white people won’t do those jobs, but Mexicans must go back anyway because the tea party just says so. The republicans, backed by the tea party have formed a posse to come and get their country back and unfortunately after November 2nd there’s gonna be some new sheriffs in a lot of towns. More on the Republican crackdown later…"
16,How Many People Have Died From Texting While Driving?,news-society," Other than the internet, mobile phone technology has been one of the most significant developments in modern times. In fact, the mobile phone has become so integrated in daily life that it becomes difficult to imagine just how people used to get by without it. Gone are the days of hoping that the person you are calling is sitting next to their fixed phone line whether at home or in the office. Nowadays, as long as you have someone's mobile phone number, you can reach them virtually anywhere they are as long as a signal is available. And thanks to the convenient (though expensive) roaming service, this is not only true within their home country but abroad. But as with most of life's conveniences comes a word of caution when it comes to mobile phone use - do not use a mobile phone while driving. This covers both texting and voice calls. If you must speak on a mobile phone when driving, the most jurisdictions only permit speaking via a hands free function. Even then research has shown that hands free use, though far safer still introduces a significant form of distraction to the driver. That is why a number of states have resorted to a complete ban on mobile phone texting or voice calls when driving. All in all, it took the US federal and state governments and other countries around the world a while to realize that mobile phones were to blame for a number of accidents and thus develop legislation that would control the use of mobile phones when driving. You might ask ""Is mobile phone use when driving really that bad?"" Well, yes. The statistics are quite grim. A recent scientific study based on NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) and the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) data showed that about 16,000 people died in the US between 2001 and 2007 as a result of distractions from mobile phone use whether through driving or texting. Released in September 2010, it is considered the first or one of the first attempts to quantify the number of road fatalities that can be directly linked to mobile phone use. Another point worth noting from the research is that a higher proportion of these fatalities were in their 30s when compared to the total number of under-30 drivers on the road (relative to drivers over 30). This is consistent with the higher frequency use of mobile phones among younger people. The growing use of text as a form of brief and quick communication has not helped matters. In 2002, the total number of texts sent in the US each month stood at 1 million. By 2008, this number had risen over 100-fold to stand at 110 million. The research also indicated that for every 1 million new mobile phone subscribers in the US, there is a 19% rise in the number of deaths caused by distracted driving. Other studies and statistics have shown an equally negative trend in America. For instance, 1 in every 5 experienced adult drivers admits that they text while driving. Half a million people were injured in 2008 due to mobile phone related road accidents. And if you thought drunk driving is the primary cause of road carnage, guess again - 4 in every 5 accidents in the US were because the driver was distracted (due to a mobile phone or otherwise) while only 1 in 3 was a result of drunk driving. A driver that is using a cell phone when driving has an 18% slower reaction rate when faced with an emergency as compared to a person not on their cell phone faced with similar circumstances. Also, dialing has a higher risk of causing an accident than talking or listening. Texting is in many respects much more dangerous than talking on the phone. A study showed that texting while driving increases by a massive 400% the time spent with eyes of the road. Another research along the same lines showed that for every 6 seconds on the road, a driver texting on their mobile phone spends 4.6 seconds with his or her eyes off the road. About 30 states have some of form of legislation that bans texting or mobile phone use while driving including the District of Columbia, California, Alaska, New Jersey, Minnesota, Connecticut and Louisiana. Many other states are contemplating or in the process of approving legislation that would outlaw mobile phone use when driving. Congress too is considering legislation that would warrant a 25% cut on highway funds from the federal government for all states that have not put in place legislation against drivers texting and talking on their cell phones. The fines attracted by violation vary from state to state but would usually start from a low of $100. However certain states have been pushing for a higher fine of up to $700 dollars to serve as a strong deterrent for this widespread but dangerous habit. The magnitude of mobile use-induced distracted driving is not only a problem in the US but everywhere else in the world. This is why the United Nations launched a campaign in May 2010 in an effort to fight the distracted driving epidemic through a simple message - No SMS is in any way worth an SOS. This was reinforced by a ban on the UN's 40,000 strong staff from using mobile phones when driving on official duty. The ban was announced by the Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon. In October 2009, US President Barack Obama prohibited via an executive order all federal employees from texting while driving."
17,"Robin Chhabra  and Sameer Patel Vs. The Financial Services Authority (""the FSA"").",news-society," In its Decision published on 11 January 2010, the Tribunal has found on the balance of probabilities that Mr Chhabra, whilst an analyst at Evolution Securities, passed price sensitive information to Mr Patel, an experienced spread bettor. Mr Chhabra and Mr Patel maintain they did not engage in market abuse. Mr Patel was a prolific trader especially in the stocks concerned. He provided evidence to the FSA that he had legitimate reasons to bet on these stocks in the direction, the size and at the time he did. The Tribunal itself accepted that some of the characteristics of these bets were consistent with Mr Patel’s general trading strategy. The FSA also inferred that Mr Chhabra was in possession of price sensitive information when Mr Patel placed his bets when much of the evidence suggested otherwise. Furthermore the FSA and the Tribunal have reached their decisions even after accepting that Mr Chhabra did not benefit financially from Mr Patel’s trading. Mr Chhabra had no reason to jeopardise his reputation and career by behaving in the way that the FSA allege. Despite having investigated the matter for nearly 5 years, the FSA failed to produce any firm evidence to support their case. The evidence against Mr Patel and Mr Chhabra is circumstantial, and exists alongside other evidence which suggests the contrary. Not one email, phone call recording, witness statement or evidence of financial dealings between Mr Chhabra and Mr Sameer Patel has been produced which bears out the FSA’s view. With less than a week before the hearing before the Tribunal to determine penalty, the FSA petitioned the Tribunal to more than double the penalty that the FSA themselves had originally decided. By proceeding to the penalty hearing, Mr Chhabra and Mr Patel would have exposed themselves to intolerable financial risk in addition to the penalties originally proposed. The FSA has now accepted that the original penalties stand, but only in return for Mr Chhabra and Mr Patel giving up their statutory right to appeal. This tactic may discourage potentially meritorious applicants taking their cases to the Tribunal in the future. Applicants could face the jeopardy of the FSA petitioning for a higher fine than originally imposed if they proceeded to defend themselves."

19,Tax on Tobacco Products Do not Correspond to WHO's Norms,news-society," Tax that is collected by India on tobacco products is one of the most lowest in the whole Asia Pacific region, and at non-conformity with the World Health Organization’s norms. The findings were revealed due to a comparative study led by Mary Assunta of South East Asia Tobacco Control Alliance (SEATCA). WHO adopted an ordinance which states that 65% to 80% of the retail price of a tobacco product has to be levied, the current tax levels for bidi and cigarettes are 9% and 38%, respectively. Bidis are significantly under levied as compared to filter cigarettes. Levies on bidis in 2007-08 constituted 14 rupees for 1,000 sticks (handmade bidis), and 26 rupees for 1,000 machine-made bidis. A recently conducted report showed that between 52% and 70% of all bidis used in India didn’t pay any levy. Assunta’s study shows that compared to India, tax rate in Australia constitute 68%, Bangladesh (67%), Japan (63%), Malaysia (54%), Sri Lanka (77%) and Thailand (70%). Also there are some countries that plan to raise levies on tobacco products, these are (39%), Indonesia (37%), Phillipines (30%) and Vietnam (45%). ""According to our data the increase of prices on tobacco products by 10% will lead to decrease in consumption by 8%,"" Assunta stated. ""Taxation is probably the most important thing that countries can undertake in order to decrease tobacco use. Most governments do not want to understand that the cost of caring people, lost productivity and influence on children through exposure to second hand smoke is almost four times higher than the levy exacted by the government from tobacco products,"" Harley Stanton, president of Asia Pacific Conference on Tobacco or Health (APACT), stated at the conference. ""While the tobacco manufacturers gain a good profit from this situation, government and individuals should pay for the immense health burned that smoking causes. So, it is evident that levies on tobacco products are raised due to WHO’s demands. It is a mutually advantageous situation for a government that not only gains more money from tobacco manufacturers but the health care burden also declines as smoking comes down,"" he noted. Smoking kills one million Indians per year. But according to a recently conducted report an increase in excise duty of bidis and tobacco products could save two million of lives. Without a strong and immediate action, more than 51 million Indians will face premature death due to smoking. Tobacco related illnesses and death cost Indian government about 30,000 rupees. Smokers of bidi and regular cigarettes die 6 to 10 years earlier than their non-smoking counterparts. More than 120 million Indians smoke, and about 10% of world’s smokers line in India. http://www.cigarettespub.com/cigarettes-news/tax-on-tobacco-products-do-not-correspond-to-whos-norms"

3,Pollution: the solution is in the green building,news-society," Have been published a few days ago the annual report data on pollution among various cities in Italy compiled by the Italian green association Legambiente.This year on the podium of the cleanest cities were ranked the city of Belluno, Verbania and Parma and at the foot of the standings there are Palermo, Catania and Crotone. An alarming situation when one considers that, with the exception of Turin, all urban centers with more than half a million people have worsened their conditions of environmental health. Are placed on top of the worsening fact the four major Italian cities Rome, Milan, Naples and Palermo. The ranking is based on several metrics, including public transport, waste collection, sewage treatment, pedestrian areas and other elements that denote sensitivity and activities aimed at protecting the environment. Many are in fact the elements that contribute to the ruin of the environmental status of cities. But certainly the largest and most impressive of these has always been that emissions from cars and homes.

Although these consequences seem inevitable solution from the world of construction technology is becoming increasingly popular through several buildings: green building.

4,How We Lost America :: A Brief History in Ten Points,news-society," Preface:  For anyone of predominantly White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (i.e. European) heritage to bemoan ""How We Lost America"" is the height of hypocrisy.  But for the sake of the Cherokee blood in my veins mixed with that of the Aztecs in my children, I continue: Whether God preceded Greed or Greed preceded God is debatable.  The fact that all forms of government and all flavors of politics are the spawn of their unholy union is not. At the core of Christianity is the pursuit of good.  At the core of Capitalism is the pursuit of gold.  Beginning in 1492 at the latest, these pursuits connected all continents, corruptly conflating in the process. Global empires constructed on this corrupt conflation collided in what we called ""the Great War"", the bloody battlegrounds of which provided ideal breeding pools for the false profits and false prophets that followed. Massive military machinations offered Sheeple on all sides salvation from depression and oppression.  And at the end of what we called ""World War II"", an American military-industrial machine of unprecedented power prevailed. Not wishing to part with their power or profits, the ""rising military-industrial complex"" and Kleptocracy Ike warned us about began clandestinely fomenting fears of foreign foes and promoting puppet politicians at home and abroad. The demise of the Soviet Union brought about the need for a new Boogie Man to keep billions for bullets, bandages and bridges in the federal budget.  And after some behind-the-scenes bargaining by the Good Ole Boys, the Bedouins were happy to oblige. In the ""Coup d'etat of 2000"", the Kleptocracy overrode our Constitution and the electorate to install ""Dubya"", the idiot son of a former CIA Director, as POTUS (knowing that although they controlled Gore as well, he'd be harder to manage). On 11 September 2001, the Kleptocracy allowed or orchestrated the massacre of thousands of innocent American Sheeple as pretext for the perpetuation of their war profiteering and Peak Oil reserve pursuits. With the debris of the three towers still smoldering in Manhattan, political puppets Left and Right proudly voted away large portions of our Bill of Rights in what must have been laughingly labelled ""The Patriot Act"". The 2008 election brought no ""Change"", as Gates stayed in charge at the Pentagon and Goldman-Sachs kept their hands in the Treasury.  And to assure no change in 2010, Citizens United v FEC legalized unlimited anonymous (including foreign) corporate political donations. And THAT's how we lost America, folks..."
5,Taking A Closer Look At Pepper Spray,news-society," By far the most popular non-deadly, self-defense product on the market today is pepper spray or as it is frequently called, mace or ""OC pepper spray."" In the past few years its popularity has grown. It has now become the primary personal defense device preferred by more average law-keeping individuals than any other defensive weapon. A few top selling brands are Pepper Shot, Mace and Wildfire. What is there to know about mace  pepper spray and how it works? Pepper spray is made from the naturally occurring, nontoxic chemical called Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) found in hot pepper plants. OC is the active ingredient in the hot peppers. The effectiveness or hotness of pepper spray is calculated in Scoville Heat Units (SHU). SHU is a scale developed in 1912 by an American chemist named Wilbur Scoville to gauge the hotness or spiciness of a variety of peppers. The number of SHU assigned to a particular pepper indicates the amount of capsaicin that is present. As an example, an ordinary bell pepper is rated at 0 SHU since it has no capsaicin, but Jalapeno's are rated at 5000 and a Habanero is 250,000-300,000 SHU for their potency. In order for a pepper spray to be effective on an aggressor it should be rated at 2 million SHU, however, some law enforcement strength pepper spray is rated even higher at 5 million. OC pepper spray is an inflammatory agent, that when sprayed in the face of an assailant, will force the eyes to close immediately, it also causes temporary blindness, difficulty in breathing, a runny nose and an irrepressible cough that will send him to his knees. Defense spray is also very effectual on ""perps"" under the influence of illicit drugs, alcohol, or suffering with a severe mental disorder. The effects of defense spray usually last from thirty to forty-five minutes, depending on the potency of the spray, with diminished effects lasting for several hours. Usually the attacker will fully recover from the effects of pepper spray once it completely wears off and he will not endure any lasting unpleasant aftereffects. The OC in pepper spray can't be wash off with water regardless of how much is used. The most effective way to diminish the symptoms of pepper spray affecting the eyes is by blinking rapidly to bring about tearing. This will help to flush the irritant from the eyes. Additionally, to prevent the burning sensation from spreading to other parts of the body it is best to avoid touching the affected spots. Rubbing oils or creams onto the affected areas will trap the capsaicin in the skin pores resulting in a more severe burning sensation and possibly cause blistering. Pepper spray normally comes in canisters, which are often miniature enough in size to be carried or hidden away inside a pocket or purse. Defense spray can also be bought disguised as ordinary items such as rings, lipstick, or some other everyday object such as a pager or pen. Additionally, pepper spray will expire after about 3-4 years due to the aerosol propellant escaping from the container. If used after the expiration date, it might not spray as expected. The expiration date of some models can be found on the label. Overall mace defense sprays are considered by civilians to be the best non-lethal self-defense devices available. It is not considered deadly force to use them; therefore, they are legal in most states and with no special permit being required. Nevertheless, there are some states that do limit the possession and application of pepper spray. In New York state pepper spray can only be purchased from a certified pharmacist or firearms merchant. Massachusetts also requires defense spray to be purchased from a commonwealth sanctioned firearms broker. In the state and Wisconsin, OC in pepper spray cannot exceed 2%, and in Wisconsin, it cannot go over 10%. In California and Florida only 2oz size containers of pepper spray are legal. When traveling, OC cannot be taken on board any airplane for safety reasons. Before making your purchase it would be a good idea to check with your local police department for laws or restrictions governing the possession and use of pepper spray."
6,"Green You Say, Why Is This Important To Me?",news-society," I have been hearing all the commotion about going green and save the planet. I guess I really didn’t pay attention to all of it until I realized the potential we humans could achieve. We only have one earth and we really should take care of it! Want to know some of the reasons it is imperative to be green? It’s the alternative to going brown! Makes us less dependent on other countries. If everyone recycled the way I do, we would only need one trash pick up a month. It helps the environment and your surroundings. Okay, I think you are starting to see what I am talking about, huh? Our earth was given to us in great shape, are you doing your part to keep it green? If you are coming up with a blank when you think ""what can I do"", then I am going to tell you at least ten steps for primping our earth and going green. Use Less Water! Load up the washing machine and dishwasher before running them. Take shorter showers. Planting native drought-resistant plants. These require less frequent watering. Use a micro-irrigation system to water your plants. This creates a mist and allows for the roots to soak up more of the water. Collect Water. Use a rain barrel to collect rain water to water your plants. Up and Down Thermostat. Set your thermostat a few degrees lower in the winter and a few degrees higher in the summer.  This saves energy and money! Turn Them Off! Turn off the lights when you are going to be out of the room for more than 10 minutes. Try unplugging appliances when they are not in use, or install ""smart"" power strips that sense when appliances are off and cuts ""phantom"" energy use. Switch Your Bulbs! Switch your regular light bulbs to compact fluorescent lights (CFLs). CFLs use 75% less energy and last 10 times longer! Filter It! Instead of buying bottled water, use filtered water to fill reusable bottles.  This reduces container waster. Compost Now! Use a composter or compost pile to turn your food and lawn wastes into rich wonderful growth mulch.  Contact your local extension office to find out the how to’s on composting. Reuse It! Take reusable shopping bag, they are the current fad. Most of the grocery stores sell them for only $1.  These are so much easier and all that plastic will not clog up our landfills. Buy Local. Buying locally grown food reduces transportation pollution and helps your local economy! Use Less Gas. Carpool with coworkers or take the bus to work whenever it is possible. Walk or ride your bicycle, get your daily exercise also! If  you can’t ride your bike or carpool to work, face it some can’t, here are a few more ways to help us all save gasoline: Checking and keeping your tires inflated to the proper pressure. Keep your oil checked and changed on schedule and always make sure the filter is clean. Step on the gas and brake pedals carefully. Drive at the proper or near the speed limit. Like I mentioned earlier, this is the only earth we are going to get, we must take good care of it! Get involved and hold some seminars on Tree Planting, Fertilizer Education, Landscaping, Micro-irrigation.  Help plan some field trips for Kayaking, Nature Walks or Birding Walks. Don’t forget to get the kids involved, teach them young and going green will become second nature to them! Do some activities such as movie night, showing Disney’s EARTH! Or schedule a time for a group to Build Birdhouses! You see, if each of us does their part, we will keep this great planet of ours GREEN for many years to come."
7,Joe's Jeans Could be a Tight Fit,news-society," Make a decision put on a quarterly earnings report from Joe's Jeans (Nasdaq: JOEZ)? Let us presume one leg at a stretch? The actual advanced jean material specialized posted unimpressive at wholesale prices results, as well as fledgling retail business was throughout the map. The outcome is a sharp dip in profitability, despite a better-than-expected 20% surge in sales. Let's pinpoint the company's bread-and-butter wholesale business, which makes up about 84% of overall revenue. Revenue climbed 7%, with Joe's Jeans growing its offerings beyond its flagship denim. Within the last few year, non-denim sales have become from 3% to 16% with the wholesale top-line mix. Diversification is good, but the intended drop within jean material is problematic. That's right, the economy remains to be as unfashionable as donning black socks in flip flop sandals. This is simply not plumbing service becoming pitching $200 jeans. However, the professionals see double-digit sales growth at rival True Religion (Nasdaq: TRLG) when it reports next month. It cannot be the only thing that bad. Wholesale gross margins dropped annually, but did improve sequentially. That wholesale operating profit dipped 12% to $5.7 million isn't good, but it's under no circumstances a package breaker. The conclusion at Joe's Jeans is tested back when we turn our focus on the fast-growing -- but cash-sucking -- retail division. Truly still one small chunk belonging to the revenue mix, but it is also the apparel company's best potential catalyst. Within the last year, Joe's Jeans moved from just five locations to 14 stores -- with a number of the recent openings as far back as at high-traffic premium outlet malls. Retail sales around tripled to $4.2 million in the quarter, as well as the 223% surge wasn't entirely the handiwork of expansion. Same-store sales clocked in at a superb 23.5%. Unfortunately, the store-level popularity emerged as the result of cleaning dated items at steep discounts. Gross margins took popular, though at the end during Joe's Jeans' retail operating loss narrowed substantially. Joe's Jeans' decision that they are an upscale retailer could be the wild card here. A hot brand can spawn a retail empire. Nike (NYSE: NKE) had been a wholesale winner in athletic footwear before rolling out its stores. Remember when Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) didn't have its namesake stores? Has Joe's Jeans earned the right to function as the next hot retailer? Not, there is however potential. Their blog is rich with snapshots of celebrities photographed with Joe's clothing. Growing its store base is probably as ambassadorial as it would be just good business. We're still 1 / 4 beyond your the telltale winter season. This is when the thesis offers a shot to get off. If Joe's Jeans can deliver strong comps and healthy margins in conjunction with the retail level -- and denim sales ın the wholesale level regain on the -- this is a retail stock worth respecting. Past fast-growing yoga apparel specialist lululemon athletica (Nasdaq: LULU), there could shortage of hot public chains which could be still at the outset of their expansion cycles. True Religion Jeans is capable of it, but that long approach to take to prove it's far created to last."
8,Education in Uganda - Educating children in Uganda,news-society," Education in Uganda - Is Education Really the Best Medicine for Poverty? The shortest distance out of poverty is not a hand out for food, clothing or shelter. If you want to support an entire community to become self-reliant, commit to establishing their education system. We have so many educational issues in the US, why do we care that Ugandan children don't have schools or that their children cannot go to the ones that do exist? The more education a nation receives, the more globally responsible they become.  When you teach a child how to become something, anything, you teach her to expect more.  Expect more from herself.  Expect more from her community.  Expect more from life.  You create an internal gauge of accountability.  With accountability comes contribution.  If we want our children to be responsible, contributing members of society, what do we do?  We teach them how, we teach them why and we expect them to deliver. Imagine a world in which we no longer have to pour millions of dollars into malaria treatments or HIV treatments?  It is possible.  It is possible through education in Uganda.   If we want to reduce the amount of financial support the US provides other countries, we need to invest in education, our own and theirs. In a recent New York Times article by Celia W. Dugger http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/world/africa/09safrica.html more focus is being put on education and low-fee schools in Africa to serve the underserved and they are seeing great results.  These Leap schools are described as bare-bones private schools tucked away in abandoned factories, shopping centers, shacks and high-rises. What makes them a key element in the effort to combat poverty is the schools instill more than a fierce work ethic. Each day, students have a life orientation class, or L.O. as they call it, where they talk about the personal problems that can derail an educationÃ¢â‚¬Â a stepfather who expects a girl to clean house rather than do her homework, a student trying to study in the shack where her family lives and runs a saloon, and another student who goes to school hungry because her mother's salary as a maid runs out before the end of the month.Ã‚Â As a result of the combined efforts by Just Like My Child http://www.justlikemychild.com/ and The Children's Academy for the Collective Heart we too, have also created schools in rural communities that teach more than a traditional education in Uganda.  We have taken the initiative to start a poultry project, plant fruit trees and begin growing a garden that the will be utilized as both an agricultural educational tool as well as a supplemental source of food for the students. A quality education is making a real difference for the most neglected and financially challenged population of our time.  With their progress comes a new reality for their families and the country as a whole. We are consistently raising money to secure motivated teachers who have the vision and mission to engage with rural communities and provide children with an education with far-reaching results.  We also need to supply them with the tools to provide life skills and a knowledge base that will create an opportunity to change an entire country by creating strong leaders. For the sake of themselves and their communities, doesn't every child deserve a solid education in Uganda? Please contribute to our efforts to education children for a better life: https://secure.groundspring.org/dn/index.php?aid=26195&Itemid=108"
9,Recycle Scrap Gold to Prevent Further Mining Accidents,news-society," You see the ads staring, blinking, or flashing at you whenever you use the internet.

Our environment is the world we live in every day, and the world we will be giving over to our kids. Gold mining presents countless environmental hazards, such as, the cyanide chemicals used leaching into the ground causing untold pollution. Also, the gold mines run a lot deeper than coal mines, asking for many more supports, and a lot more trouble. We need look no further than the recent rescue of 33 Chilean gold miners. The rescue was pronounced a success, but what caused this possible calamity in the first place? The Chilean government is as of yet unsure of the cause of the mine collapse, but they suspect that not enough supports were in place. Even as we speak, miners are descending into shafts, putting their lives in danger. The trapped miners were forced to spend 39 days underground in a 540 square foot room with minimal food, water, and worst of all, mental stimulation. The ordeal they went through will impact their lives forever. And there was no need. Gold is a luxury, not a necessity. As such, it doesn’t occur to anyone to try to preserve it. Gold is a finite natural resource. We could greatly limit the amount of gold mining required by simply recycling gold. If we sell gold for cash, the gold is melted down to be reused in new pieces. The seller receives cash for gold in a simple, quick transaction, and the environment, and gold miners are saved a whole lot of trouble. So you’ve been convinced. You’ll sell your gold. Where to go, and how to make sure you’re getting the most money for your gold? There are a number of options. Pawnshops are the obvious go-to place in times of need, but a pawnbroker will be the first to tell you that he’ll give you a minimum payout of cash for your gold due to the quality of clientele, and low turnover rate. For a regular jeweler, melting your gold is almost more of a headache for him, so he won’t either offer that much cash for your gold.  The best option is to sell gold to an online buyer. Check the seller’s ratings to ensure that he is legitimate, and not a scam. Also, be an educated seller by checking the current price of gold on sites like kitco.com. Make sure you’re not being duped. Now, after you’ve decided to sell, chosen a buyer, and done the deal, enjoy your cash!"

15,Chilean Miner near to be Saved,news-society," Medical and rescue personnel will be in place to start extracting and treating the miners Monday night, he said. Rescue crews have been drilling three separate, wider holes to send down the rescue capsule and hoist the men to the surface. Plan B was close to reaching the trapped miners at a depth of 624 meters (2,047 feet). The drill had reached 584 meters (1,916 feet) before it was stopped early Friday morning to replace the bit, Golborne told reporters. There may be light at the end of a nearly completed tunnel for the 33 men trapped since August 5 almost half a mile below ground, with rescuers expected to reach them within a day, Chile's mining minister said Friday afternoon. ""Hopefully before that,"" Mining Minister Laurence Golborne told reporters about the time when a rescue drill is expected to pierce the roof of the mine. As of Friday afternoon, it was 40 meters (about 130 feet) away. ""Maybe tomorrow morning, early Saturday. We have to wait and see."" Once the mine has been reached, the rescue process could begin within three to four days, Golborne told reporters. But mine engineers must decide first whether they need to encase the shaft with steel tubing to prevent rockfalls and further collapses during the extraction process. ""If we do a full casing of the hole, those three to four days could go to eight to 10 days,"" Golborne told reporters. One of the rescue coordinators, Rene Aguilar, an engineer for state copper company Codelco, said this week they may encase just the first 100 meters (328 feet) of the shaft, a process that could take just 10 hours. Before anyone can be rescued, the hole must be widened so that the rescue capsule -- dubbed the Phoenix -- can land cleanly inside the tunnel without getting hung up on obstructions, Golborne said. To accomplish that, explosives will be lowered to the miners for use in widening the shaft, said Golborne, who expressed little concern that the subterranean pyrotechnics would pose any danger to the men. ""We have to take into consideration that we are talking here about miners that have experience, many of them are licensed to use explosives, they know how to manipulate them, they have already made the holes that they need to set the right quantities of explosives. ... So it will be a very controlled explosion that will be made after we break into the tunnel."" Then, authorities will lower a doctor and a rescuer into the chamber, Health Minister Jaime Manalich said. Medical and rescue personnel will be in place to start extracting and treating the miners Monday night, he said. Once the miners have been extracted, they will undergo about two hours of health checks at a field hospital set up at the mine. Barring complications, it will take about 24 to 36 hours to remove all the miners through the 2,300-foot hole, Manalich said. They will then be flown by helicopter to a hospital in the town of Copiapo -- approximately a 15-minute flight. Miners who are healthy enough will be allowed to visit briefly with family members in a reunion area before being taken to the hospital, Manalich said. Health officials have increased the miners' physical activity in recent days to gauge how they can handle the stress of being removed, Manalich said. The overall response has been good, he said, though some miners have exhibited anxiety or have had minor cardiac issues. The miners have been in contact with the outside world through a small bore hole that sends them food, water, supplies and other necessities. Rescue crews have been drilling three separate, wider holes to send down the rescue capsule and hoist the men to the surface. Those rescue attempts have been labeled Plans A, B and C. Plan B was close to reaching the trapped miners at a depth of 624 meters (2,047 feet). The drill had reached 584 meters (1,916 feet) before it was stopped early Friday morning to replace the bit, Golborne told reporters. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said September 19, during his last visit to the site, that he planned to personally hug each of the miners as they were pulled from the rescue shaft. He is due to depart on a government tour to Europe in mid-October. First lady Cecilia Morel Montes told reporters Friday night that her husband was in the south. ""He has a lot of obligations,"" she said. ""Undoubtedly, he would like to be here permanently. But he also has to be permanently in a lot of other places and it's necessary to continue governing."" She said the crisis faced by the miners has brought Chileans together. ""They have become very familiar to every Chilean,"" she said. ""All Chileans are equally expectant, equally nervous; there's a lot of empathy toward the families."" She added that the men's liberation will occur ""as soon as possible,"" but only after every precaution is taken to ensure their safety source : cnn.com"
16,Anti-prostitution law struck down in Canada,news-society," I'm torn on this. Sort of. As I have two differing perspectives on the prostitution industry, and thus a not-so-black-and-white opinion on whether or not to legalize prostitution. I have met dominatrices, escorts, and even street prostitutes who work for themselves and have no (obvious) signs of addiction. They appear to have very lax attitudes and morals on sex, yet didn't necessarily acquire this laxity through abuse. Some of them are in the industry as it is the fastest and easiest way to make money. A few tricks (hours) can net them the same amount of money most of us gross in an entire week. They use their money to fund lavish lifestyles, or in the hopes of starting their own business (typically an escort service), and there are the trans-gendered who are using it as a fast way to get the cash they need to pay for their operations and medications. A majority of these people are there because they want to be. They enjoy this type of work, wouldn't want to do anything else, and feel their rights are being violated by current anti-prostitution legislation. Not to mention that they are not afforded the same protections as every one else. For example, there is still the idea that you can not rape a prostitute. I mean, she's a prostitute, right? If you steal services from a prostitute, as in failure to pay, there is no recourse for them to get their money. A prostitute can not take a john to court and sue him for the services rendered. The other side of prostitution is much darker. A side that most of us are already aware of. The teens and preteens coerced into sexual slavery. Or sold. There are a multitude of children who run away from abusive homes, only to find themselves in much worse conditions. Now they are homeless, starving, as well as scared. There are many ways that a runaway child is coerced into prostitution, but it all ends the same way. The child feels s/he has no other real choice for survival; prostitution or death. A lot, if not all, of these kids rationalize the same way. It may be no better than what they ran from, but at least they are now getting paid for it. Eventually a lot of these kids convince themselves that it is their choice. They rationalize that instead of being repeatedly raped by their abuser, they are now making the choice to have sex for money. Some of these kids begin to view themselves as empowered, instead of the victim they once were. Then you have the girls from Canada's northern reserves who are tricked into prostitution. Someone they know and trust, often a family member, promises them a better life in the city. A better life with a job. Once these girls make it to the city, they discover the ""job"" waiting for them is forced prostitution. Often times the family member sells them to a prostitution ring, and from there the girls are lost. Repeatedly beaten, repeatedly raped, forced onto drugs, and forced into prostitution. Scared and brainwashed, these girls see no way out of their predicament. The question of whether or not to make prostitution legal is not as black and white as many would like to think. It is not about morality, morals have no place in the law. It is about protecting the rights of individuals. It is about protecting the rights of one, while not infringing upon the rights of another. Law is about protecting society at large, not just one group. So how does the law go about protecting the rights of the victims, while not infringing upon the rights of others? Unfortunately it's not as simple as moving prostitution into brothels, or red light districts. Other countries have shown us this. Young girls are routinely sold into brothels and forced into prostitution. Criminalizing street prostitution while legalizing brothels and escorts services is only one small step. If lawmakers wish to legalize any form of prostitution, there would have to be a whole new department within the government. The government would have to find a way to protect the victims being sold into brothels, while not infringing upon the right to run a brothel. I can't even begin to imagine how this could be done. It is just far too convoluted. And I do not wish to run this post into redundancy. I'll just say: I believe prostitution should be legalized. If there is a way to protect victims of forced prostitution, then I see no reason why a person should not be allowed to sell their bodies if that is what they want to do. In the meantime, perhaps we should simplify the issue from the broad topic of prostitution. Perhaps the law should, for the time being, focus on the dominatrices and escorts who are fighting for the right to prostitute themselves. Let them get licensed. Let them jump through the reams of red tape, and pay taxes on their earnings. Let them comply with whatever rules, policies and laws the government dreams up in order to regulate their industry. Lord knows, illegal prostitution rings would never wish to jump through the hoops and cut their way through miles of red tape just to pay taxes."

18,John Olshefski Huntsville City Council Candidate talking points,news-society," http://voteolshefski.blogspot.com/ and http://www.voteolshefski.com/ John Olshefski: Short Bio With nearly 30 years of executive experience in service to our country and more recently with the Tennessee Valley communities and businesses, John Olshefski will bring his passion for progress to the Huntsville City Council. Hailing from Brunswick, Georgia, he attended The Citadel and then rose through the ranks in the United States Army holding numerous command and staff positions and retiring in 2008 as a Colonel. Upon retirement, he was selected to enter into the Senior Executive Service for Army Materiel Command. He and his wife of 29 years, Sharon, made Huntsville, Alabama their permanent home. With public service as his true calling, he is now employed with BFA systems as a Business Development Executive -- a position that allows him to have the opportunity to pursue serving District 3 on the Huntsville City Council. Proven Leader - Real Results Fiscal Responsibility The city council must be responsible for ensuring good stewardship of the public's finances. It must be remembered that every dollar the city generates in taxes comes from the people and that the money must be used wisely.  I have hands-on experience overseeing a $130M dollar budget as the Garrison Commander of Redstone Arsenal from June 2005 - July 2008. During that time I was responsible for providing all the services and programs expected of a major DOD facility despite budget shortfalls of $20M.  This experience, coupled with a Masters Degree in Strategic Resourcing from the Industrial College of Armed Forces (ICAF), gives me a solid background in financial oversight and planning. As an Army officer, I have always worked hard to protect the interests of the American taxpayer, in resources and people, as a City Councilman I will work equally hard to protect and add value to, the financial interests of the citizens of District 3 and Huntsville. Once elected I will work toward the development (within 90 days) of a strategic plan, whose goal will be to stop the erosion within District 3 and improve the quality of life in all neighborhoods. Huntsville Housing Authority (HHA) HHA handled the transactions within our community in a callused and insensitive manner. The lack of visibility of their process and communication was appalling. I will demand and work toward an appointment to the HHA from South Huntsville, to ensure that our interests are protected and that the workings of the board are transparent to all. I will support any measure locally that would provide the people of South Huntsville/Huntsville the opportunity to voice their concerns and have a say in the decision making process.  I fervently support the local delegation to the State Legislature (Senate and House) to continue pushing for 1) greater restrictions on the influence of HHA, 2) increased input by citizens, and 3) improved communication of their actions and future plans. Infrastructure The influx to Huntsville, especially District 3, as a result of BRAC and natural city growth, makes infrastructure a pressing issue to many South Huntsville residents.  To me infrastructure is defined as roads, drainage, nature trails, parks, sidewalks, bike routes, fire stations, police precincts, and other like items that anchor the high quality and safety of life in our neighborhoods that we have come to enjoy. As a result, it is important we plan ahead in order to secure the necessary funding and leverage the use of State and federal dollars. l will work with city planners to determine the best way to incorporate the complete streets program in future road developments as well as reviewing existing danger areas to best protect the lives of citizens. I will work to ensure that we maintain our existing roads and those within neighborhoods, returning to an 8 year paving cycle. Additionally, I will work with city planners and recreational leagues to determine how best to improve and expand our existing parks, and where needed, construct new ones. Declining Property Values - The biggest threat to our community and our way of life is declining property values. Three elements that have the potential to affect our property values are the 1) Huntsville Housing Authority (HHA), 2) the Huntsville City School System, and 3) Closed and abandoned commercial property. We must work closely with the HHA as an equal partner, ensuring that they are held accountable and South Huntsville is protected from arbitrary social experiments. We must protect our South Huntsville schools funding, ensuring that school funds are spread equitably by working closing with the Huntsville School Board as an equal partner in the planning of existing resources. Equally important is the restoration of retail and commercial activity within those business areas of our district that have sit empty for too long. Revitalization - South Huntsville's commercial and tax base has eroded over the years, reducing our ability to garner those city resources which we deserve. I believe a major way to get relevancy is to revitalize South Huntsville along South Memorial Parkway and Bailey Cove. South Huntsville has both the population and income to warrant more retail stores and sit down restaurants. Through my strategic planning process I canvas neighborhood needs and expectation and bring in the appropriate developers to determine how best to attract and retain high quality commercial interests. We should look first at developers providing their own financing, as they did in Jones Valley, but not hesitate, if the business case can be made, to leverage the Tax Increment Financing (TIF) method to help move things forward in a timely manner. Revitalization is one of the key elements to anchoring and improving our property values. Bottom-line, I will: Involve South Huntsville citizens and civic leaders in developing a strategic plan that stops District 3 erosion and improves quality of life. Protect our neighborhoods and schools from negative actions and funding cuts, through direct communication, equal distribution, and transparent representation. Increase financial resources for infrastructure (especially roads and parks) that will aid in protecting and improving property values. Secure economic development opportunities in South Huntsville that will restore retail vitality to empty storefronts. Ensure District 3's fair share of city dollars, police, and fire protection."
19,Fresh Possibilities Flourish For the Property Market,news-society," Costs of homes on the market every where in Florida  are beaten down  from the real-estate collapse of 2008.   They still are. Ft Myers and Lehigh FL real estate properties are currently at a tiny percent of their earlier value and the valuation they commanded just a few years ago. As awful as it is to present home owners, it offers a marvelous prospect to would be house owners as well as investors alike.   Real estate prices right now are at multi year lows.   Combined together with which is the reality that interest rates are at multi-decade lows. Houses Sale In florida Exceedingly Inexpensive And Compelling Ft Myers and Lehigh Acres, Fl represent enormous buying opportunities.  Still, one of them offers greater possibilities than the other. Lehigh acres FL homes constitute a reduction of your lifetime. It befits everybody searching around for a home or housing assets speculation to spring on this opportunity before it vanishes  and is no more. Interests rate will not  keep on being depressed perpetually, and after they commence to increase, these prices and mortgage rates may possibly not ever be witnessed yet again.  Multi -Listing-Service (MLS)  in Lehigh acres is overloaded with amazing offers currently. The market is by now showing signs of recovery.  Unemployment, although stillexceedingly lofty is commencing to shift down. After the recovery is decisively in place, demand shall improve, mortgage charge shall commence to increase and many that sat on the side may have botched an occasion of a generation. Smart buyers are as of now setting out to seek out good values.  It is alleged that lightening doesn't hit the exact same area twice, but it looks as if it's getting ready to do so in Lehigh Acres. Just a few years previous to the out of control  real estate market occurred in Florida,  the prices of  houses on the market in Lehigh Acres, Florida  was  cheap. So also were properties in many more areas of Fl.   Everything altered in a short while as housing prices soared.  However they have plunged back to the bottom. Huge valuation on Lehigh Florida housing  as well as other Florida locations are here once more. Found on the South West Florida Gulf coast, Lehigh Acres  shares a contiguity along with City Hall with Ft Myers. When Lehigh was discovered, its growth was amongst the top within the nation.  Once the real estate bubble bust,   prices came crashing to the floor. They're beginning to stir once more and evidence  of them rising from the ashes are noticed. Valuation are now lower than prior to the preceding run up.  Smart investors are beginning to position themselves in order to make the most of the ridiculously low prices. Second Opening For Huge Real Estate Profit Many people missed the original chance to have the benefit of the very first move up of the prices of Lehigh Acres housing. Lots of people indeed lost big because they chased prices too far as well as too lofty. It is changed at present.  Prices have crashed back to the bottom and now have ushered in a one more time of opportunity for all those desirous to embrace it. Significant amounts of the inventory continues to be whittled  down and residential builders are positioning themselves to start construction yet again.  Some are buying land. It wont be long before  real estate   starts  getting active another time.  When it starts, it may jump 10%, 20% or greater right at the start. There isn't a more attractive period than currently to start focusing on property in Lehigh Acres, Florida."
20,Fascism in Today’s Political Spectrum,news-society," Fascism is commonly placed on the far right of today's political spectrum when it is described. Despite this, most scholars agree that influences by the left and right contributed to its development. Italian Fascism was created with both right and left influences. The ""Fascist right"" was made of members of fascist paramilitary and some ex-members of the Italian Nationalist Association. The ""Fascist left"" included those who wanted to replace Italy's liberal parliament with a national syndicalism and promote the interests of common people and workers. The Fascist paramilitary members desired a dictatorship. The members originating from the Italian Nationalist Association wanted the existing elites to remain while implementing an authoritarian corporatist state. Fascist Italy also had small groups who tried to shift the movement towards their beliefs. These included the ""clerical Fascists"" who promoted Catholic beliefs and the ""monarchist Fascists"" who pushed for an absolute monarchy. Several movements of fascism were self-described as a ""third force"" and not in today’s political spectrum. Benito Mussolini declined to specifically define his version of fascism in an attempt to gain support from as many people as possible.  Benito Mussolini pictured that the economic system of his fascist Italy could be described as either state socialism or state capitalism. Some political scientists have found that the left and right of the traditional political spectrum don't allow for the complexity of the fascist ideology. Some multi-dimensional models of the political spectrum have been devised to help explain this. As fascism started to spread in Italy it gained popularity around the world. The results of World War II quickly dampened this popularity. Marcus Garvy, Winston Churchill, and Franklin D. Roosevelt were all initial supporters of fascist Italy. Following World War II, fascism became quite unpopular around the world. Today, fascist is usually used to describe a preference for authoritarian rule. Fascism is used to attack both left and right wing stances and is often over-used and misrepresented."
