0,Table of Contents,community," I'll probably write this and then the powers-that-be will create a Capsule to do in a few seconds what may take a while to create. Which is fine by me! I wish there was such a capsule! But in the meantime you can do it the way I've done it. If you go to my hub on HubScore, and after what I call the Introduction Capsule, you'll notice that I have a capsule titled Table of Contents. I figured that I have a long hub, and there's information there that people might want to go back to as a quick reference. Rather have them scroll through the entire hub they can browse through the Table of Contents list, click, and jump straight to the bit that they need. To be quite honest I've put it there to make it easier for ME to find the information. I used the Links Capsule to pull it off. You could probably use the Text Capsule to do it too. It's important to note that while you're in edit mode the Table of Contents won't work properly. It won't jump you down on the same browser window. It'll open a new browser window. So keep that in mind. Open up your hub. In the view that the general public sees (ie: not in edit mode). Copy and paste your capsule titles into a Notepad text document (or whatever you feel like using) EXACTLY as they are. Make a list of the ones you want in your table of contents. This is what it looks like when you right click in FireFox. You now have to enter the alien world of HTML. To do this you have to view the Page Source of your hub. A reminder: make sure you're in the normal view of your hub, not in edit mode. In Firefox you Right click and select View Page Source. In Internet Explorer you Right click and select View Source. It will open up a new page, like a Notepad text document. Next you want to FIND each of the titles that you've copied and pasted. One at a time. Now lets say you have a Capsule that you've titled ""Café Royale"", you want to search for that IN the source code. The CTRL F keys should bring up the ability to do a search. Copy and paste Café Royale in and find it. You'll find something like this: <div id=""mod_487697"" class=""module moduleImage""><h2>Café Royale2</h2> If it's wrapped in the h2 tags, then that's more than likely our target! If it's not, then keep lookin (because you may have used the word more than once). What you do next is ""grab"" the div id. In this illustration it is mod_487697. Copy and paste that underneath the corresponding title in your Notepad doc. You'll be using it later. Go through and find every div id for each of your titles. Copy and paste each one. Now lets say your hub is http://hubpages.com/hub/Hubscore what you do next is add a # to the end of that and copy and paste http://hubpages.com/hub/Hubscore# to the start of each of your div id's that you have in your list. So it would look like this: http://hubpages.com/hub/Hubscore#mod_487697 What you have now is a link that goes STRAIGHT to that module. Each of those ""module ID's"" are unique. Try it out with one of your own in the address field of your browser window. BOOM. Straight there. Now go into Edit Mode on your hub and add a Links Capsule. Move it to near the top. I position mine AFTER an introduction. I don't want people and particularly Search Engines to see it straight away. It being in second position seems like a good place to put it. Now go through your Notepad list. Copy and paste each in Link URL/Link Title and Add Link. No need to add a Link Description. But that's up to you. Keep doing that until it's all done. Then of course save it. And publish it. And then try it. Hopefully it worked for you. It should. If it didn't then you've probably made an itty bitty mistake somewhere. HTML is unforgiving. You leave anything out or accidentally put anything in (even a space), and it won't work. If you're unfamiliar with HTML it can be a bit daunting but if you've got a keen eye and a sense of adventure then keep at it and you'll get it right eventually. em_saenz on April 25, 2019: Thank you so much for this tutorial. It was great fun to do. I love adding to my knowledge of how the web works Natalie Frank from Chicago, IL on July 18, 2018: What a wealth of information! A quick questions. Is it really worth it to use a table of contents for long articles with subheadings?  I went to look at the source code and it just seems like it would take quite some time to do and I don't know if it would actually help in terms of ranking or traffic.Thanks for a stellar article! Dexter Whinfield from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on June 25, 2018: I was looking for this. Thank you! Melissa Clason from Fayetteville, NC on June 17, 2018: Thank you for writing this hub, I just made a 4600 word game guide hub with 17 different subsections and having a table of contents will help people navigate exactly to what they need without getting lost. Your instructions were very clear and helped me learn how to do this easily. I never realized there was so much HTML code on one hub! Eric Seidel from Baltimore Maryland on October 10, 2014: Thank you so much for this! Definitely cleans up a long Hub well. I now a new-found respect for people that actually make HTML code. I have to admit it was daunting at first, but your instructions were spot on and very helpful. Shamim Rajabali from Texas on October 06, 2014: Thanks for sharing this. I miss the TOC in Squidoo, it was so easy. CruiseReady from East Central  Florida on October 05, 2014: Many thanks for the wonderful instructions.  Well done!  A TofC is something I have managed to make on another site, but had no idea how to do it here. JanieceTobey on September 20, 2014: Thanks so much for this info on how to create a Table of Contents on Hubpages.  I made them all the time on Squidoo....but the technique was just a little different because of differences in the two platforms.  I'm excited to give it a try on Hubpages as well! Adele Jeunette on September 17, 2014: It's nice that you've given instructions for this. I wonder of the gurus at Hub Pages can give us a way to generate this automatically. It was a really great feature we had in Squidoo. How about it, guys? Jeanette from Australia on September 17, 2014: Ahhh. Perfect. Just what I was looking for. Thanks! MacPharlain on September 09, 2014: The hacks are strong in this one. Thanks for the info, glad to see some of the old workarounds from the other site work here, too. Deb Bryan from Chico California on September 09, 2014: Brilliant! Thank you! I have a tutorial which needs to have links to sections because each person will be at a different step when they arrive. This is perfect! I had module links there when the lens transferred into a hub, but, no idea how to revise it. Thanks again! Deb Karen from U.S. on September 09, 2014: This is very helpful -- thanks!   It does sound a little tedious to create, but there are a couple of ex-Squidoo lenses now hubs which will be more useful if they do have a TOC. Susan300 on September 06, 2014: Bookmarking!!!! :) Rhys Baker from Peterborough, UK on April 05, 2014: Outstanding. Really easy to follow. I am adding this technique to my latest hub. Thanks for sharing such great advice Nathan Bernardo from California, United States of America on March 25, 2014: Very good, easy to follow instructions. Thanks for sharing. SpaceShanty from United Kingdom on March 04, 2014: Thank you sooo much!  The only issue I had is that it puts them in reverse order, so you should start by adding the last link (bottom capsule) first.  Apart from that it works like a dream! Frank Sturm from Massachusetts on January 22, 2014: Awesome article! Took me two seconds to figure this out, when I thought it'd take me forever. Definitely helps organize my longer hubs. Question: Does having a Table of Contents hurt your ranking with Google or Hub Pages because you are linking multiple times to your site? Not sure if that even makes sense..... Evan Smiley on January 18, 2014: This was so helpful!!!  I'm new to making hubs, and I've been trying to find ways to make them easily-accessible and professional! This is great for my information dense hubs! Thank you so much!  The foreign world of HTML is a little less scary! Ronald E Franklin from Mechanicsburg, PA on January 03, 2014: I'm impressed with the way you presented your info - step-by-step with examples. I don't see how anyone could go wrong in following the process. Good job! Ceres Schwarz on April 19, 2013: This is really very useful. I agree that it would be great for long hubs to have a table of contents so that the readers can easily skip to and find what they're looking for. Your hub explained how to have a table of contents in a simple and concise manner. I'll be sure to try this on any hub that might need a table of contents. sarahshuihan on December 19, 2012: super awesome! I might have to try this when I write a long hub. I am definitely sharing this :) seanorjohn on December 19, 2012: Will try to set this up. Great work. Voted up Rajan Singh Jolly from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on December 19, 2012: darkside, got it right the first time. Though it an extra bit of time and work it adds to the value of the hub I believe. I always wondered how to go about getting the internal linking done and this hub is just the answer. Thanks for this very useful and apt tutorial. Voting this up useful, awesome and interesting. Sharing it over so that others may benefit. Nancy Yager from Hamburg, New York on September 14, 2012: Thank you so much. This is awesome. You are right though, the capsule in Squidoo is much easier. Voted up and Shared. Rosa Marchisella from Canada on July 08, 2012: OMG!!!  That freaking AWESOME!!!  THANK YOU!!!  Must share with all my followers! John Crowley from Sheffield on June 27, 2012: Just used this. Works a dream. Thanks again! Lisa from Northeast U.S. on June 19, 2012: Love this - voted up! Blurter of Indiscretions from Clinton CT on June 19, 2012: Fantastic! Voted up and shared! Rajan Singh Jolly from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on June 19, 2012: Awesome hub. Bookmarked to reread later as I'm not good with html stuff. Thanks for sharing. Voted up, useful and shared. Ghostwolfe on April 09, 2012: This is awesome, just tried it on one of my hubs and it is easy to do and doesn't take up a lot of time. Thank you for the information and for taking the time to write this hub. Voted Up. Robie Benve from Ohio on April 04, 2012: Excellent information, very clearly explained. Thanks! :) dragnhaze on March 26, 2012: Great information, I had read a hub from a different hubber who had explained how to put the anchor link in the text, but it did not work properly when I tried.  I will have to give this a try for sure.  Thanks for SHARING voted up and useful, interesting and awesome. Joanna McKenna from Central Oklahoma on March 26, 2012: This is so cool! Years ago when I built web pages from scratch, I knew the code for ""jump to"" links, but had NO idea there was a way to do this in Hubpages! I don't have many hubs long enough to use this tip appropriately or effectively, but do have at least one that could use a TOC. Thanks! Voted UP and useful! ;D wayseeker from Colorado on February 20, 2012: Such wonderful information.  You have a number of hubs that are just invaluable.  Nice work and thank you! wayseeker Brandon Lobo on February 06, 2012: Oh I'm back 2 months later. I bookmarked the hub for future reference and I'm going to use it on my next hub :) Mike from New Hampshire on January 07, 2012: Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! What a helpful and well put together hub. Hopefully hubpages adds tables of contents as an option one day, but in the meantime this will do :) Brandon Lobo on December 03, 2011: Voted up, useful awesome and interesting. Thanks for this wonderful hub. Will try it out on my next hubs smilingjimdickson from Too close to the moon on November 15, 2011: Hey Darkside, you've just stopped me scratching my head, the neighbours will think the fleas are cured. Seriously, I've been thinking about that all week and you've just answered it. Thanks!!! Brittany Kennedy from Kailua-Kona, Hawaii on November 14, 2011: I just posted a forum about this!  Thank you for posting; it really is an evergreen hub! Rosie Rose from Toronto, Canada on October 04, 2011: Wow!  I always wanted to do this but didn't know how.  Thank you so much, Darkside! Have a nice day, Rosie Sharilee Swaity from Canada on August 31, 2011: Thank you so very much! I just found this from someone mentioning in the forums and it is excellent information! I just added a table of contents to one of my hubs and it is so much better! I think it might help with sales, too. Thank you again! Shelly on August 19, 2011: Unbelievably useful. I mean, just EXACTLY what I was seeking! Thanks so much for taking the time to put this up. I write a few rather long hubs and even *I* get weary of scrolling through them. Ugh. Can't emphasize just how useful this is! Sophie on July 15, 2011: This is so useful. I have struggled with internal linking for so long, I am book marking this for future reference. Bruce Chamoff from New York on June 20, 2011: This works perfectly, Darkside, and I have linked to this hub for my followers to read. I am also following you now. Bruce Chamoff from New York on June 20, 2011: Darkside, this works perfectly. Thanks. I have linked to this from my hubs and am now following you. Liz Elias from Oakley, CA on April 22, 2011: Oh, wow!  I was referred to this hub by lronher, after a suggestion I made in the forums. Super cool!  Bookmarked & voted up & useful!  Thanks for this info!  It will be a bit tricky for me, as I'm not a techie-type, but you've explained it clearly and with examples, so I should be able to manage! Thank you! Sue B. on April 03, 2011: Thank you! I found this very helpful!  For some reason internet explorer would not show me the source information on hubpages yet I could review the source on other pages.  Googlechrome worked so if that happens to anyone else- just try another browser. saintodd from Suffolk, VA on February 24, 2011: BANG! I've been doing the table of contents without linking it on my hubs up to this point, its just how I like to organize my articles. Thanks for the tutorial - I'll be using it now until that capsule is made. Thanks. Voted up and ranked! Howard S. from Dallas, Texas, and Asia on February 20, 2011: Oh, yes! I knew this should be possible, and there is a series of hubs I want to do that is hopeless without it. I finally saw it in someone else's hub and she pointed me here. Thanks! Krys W from Abertawe, Cymru on December 06, 2010: Oh thank you, thank you!!! This is exactly what I needed in a hub I finished today. dannylardon164 on November 06, 2010: Thanks a lot, DarkSide. I have an immensely long Hub on astrobiology that needed a navigation section. WoodsmensPost from Arizona on October 12, 2010: How cool is that. I just tried it on one of my hubs fantastic!!!! Bookmarked Voted Up Awesome!!! dubturbo on July 30, 2010: Thanks Darkside for the informative method. I will try it on my first hub as I just became a hubber. Too bad HupPages does not offer a capsule to do this automatically. Glen (author) from Australia on July 29, 2010: Glad to be of service Josh. But no donations required. Josh2008 from London on July 28, 2010: Thank you for this one DarkSide. Not remotely surprised that this one's come from you. Love the HubScore post as well. Got a donate button somewhere? Bhagwad Jal Park from Chennai, India on July 21, 2010: Just used this for my own hub - thanks a whole lot Bhagwad Jal Park from Chennai, India on July 21, 2010: I just wish they had a capsule for this! Squidoo does it automatically for you and I miss that functionality! ss sneh from the Incredible India! on June 01, 2010: Hi!  Very useful info. In fact I made a table of content on one of my site with texts but would have made with links had I read this hub before...Now I can   --Thanks for the Info! FindYourSearch from Las Vegas, NV on May 27, 2010: Great information; exactly what I was looking for. I put a table of contents on my intro to SEO hub. Thank you! Glen (author) from Australia on April 02, 2010: It depends on how much information and how well you need it organised. I've used it on hubs that have me coming back to quickly find the right spot to share with others, that way I can also do a Copy Location and post the URL into a forum post. If it makes it easier for me to navigate through the hub, then it'll be easier for others. But I wouldn't use it on every single hub I've made, in fact I've probably only got it on half a dozen. N. Ramius on April 02, 2010: When do you think you should use the Table of Contents? How long of a hub? Eileen Hughes from Northam Western Australia on February 20, 2010: Darkside, thanks for the confidence from one grandma to another.  I will have to try it now wont I Tony Casey from Manchester U.K. on February 18, 2010: Just found this, done it, love it, works great. Explained really well, how can I repay you; If you need to know how to run a guest house i'm your man. wellllllll. sunforged from Sunforged.com on February 18, 2010: The Firebug add-on for firefox would allow you to simply point the cursor at whatever page elements you would like to inspect, its worth a view if you haven't seen it before. DevinG from Redlands on February 06, 2010: I would like to thank you very much for this hub. It has helped me immensely with my Mousehunt guide hubs. Again, thanks a lot and this is great to know. *thumbs upped* Sufidreamer from Sparti, Greece on January 25, 2010: Top notch, Darkside - worked a treat :) Appletreedeals from Salisbury, Maryland USA on January 14, 2010: oops. forgot the ps. ps. bookmarked it for a backlink GA Appletreedeals from Salisbury, Maryland USA on January 14, 2010: OK, people fuss that short ""great hub"" comments aren't really contributory, but ... anything else, here, would just be filler, thanks for the info, and effort, of course I will use this. I will shamelessly pick anybody's brain, and I never leave a good idea un-copied. Rated hub ""up"" GA thisisoli from Austin, Texas (From York, England!) on January 11, 2010: Great hub, I was tearing my hair out trying to figure out how to make these links for my Hub! Glen (author) from Australia on January 10, 2010: It takes a little fiddling Lou, but once you're done, you're done! lou16 on January 10, 2010: Oh wow, thank you Glen.   Now I can go back to a couple of my hubs and make a few changes and I can also make a few hubs that I thought might be too long - awesome! mel22 from , on December 14, 2009: Wow, this is one of the mosat valuable and well written hubs I have seen yet! Wish we were able to rank the hubs on a score of 1-100. I'd give this one 110! MistHaven on October 17, 2009: Thanks, man. Now I finally know how to add a table of contents to my Hubs. Tim Blackstone on September 10, 2009: This is a great explanation of how to do it and really useful thanks. guidebaba from India on August 19, 2009: Fantastic. You solved my problem. Thumbs Up for you. Simon Cook from NJ, USA on August 17, 2009: Yes this is exactly what I wanted! Thanks Glen (author) from Australia on August 02, 2009: The # seperates the URL from the module number. It is the anchor. It's telling it to go down to the module number that's in the source code. sandra rinck on August 01, 2009: I just wanted to say one thing because I can be a dingy sometimes...most of the time. On the part where you put a #.  Can you clarify?  I spent like 20 minutes putting a number 1 in instead of a #. LOL.  :D But super, it works! sandra rinck on August 01, 2009: Thanks for seemingly having a hub for just about everything I need to know.  You are aw....sssss.....oooommmmeeee!  :D Lily Rose from A Coast on July 30, 2009: This is so cool - I would never had known how to do this without your hub.  I followed your step by step instructions and just implemented a TOC on one of my longer hubs without a glitch.  I'm a huge fan of yours right now - thanks! Jerilee Wei from United States on June 09, 2009: Glad I read this!  This kind of article is the type I crave as it is very difficult when you are my age (60) to keep up with all of this without a guideline. blondepoet from australia on June 09, 2009: Thankyou so so much I never saw your reply for ages as they are going the opposite way up ROFL Om Prakash Singh from India, Calcutta on June 03, 2009: Oh that is a great help. I didn't know that each capsule is already given an id (e.g. mod_487697). All this while I was thinking how to make Hubpages do that. Good little research. Thanks man! traceye from Australia on May 31, 2009: wow great hub.  Darkside I've just become a massive fan of you.  Keep up the good work. Tracey Glen (author) from Australia on May 30, 2009: Blondepoet, that one is easier than what's required to make a Table of Contents. Just go to their profile page and copy the URL in the web address field of your browser, come back and highlight the Hubbers name in your Text Capsule and click on the chain icon in your editor. Or if it's a Links Capsule you just do it as you'd do any other links. blondepoet from australia on May 30, 2009: Maybe you can help me, how do I change the name of a hubber that I have mentioned in my Hub so that when the reader clicks on their name there profile page will open? blondepoet from australia on May 30, 2009: darkside maybe you can help me. In my Hub I mention quite a few Hubbers. How can I put their name in, well their name is already in for eg. Tom Rubenoff (paragraph about him) so that when you click on his name his profile page will come up, I see this getting done all the time Susan Ng Yu on May 30, 2009: Yes, I did it! :D  Thanks, darkside. :) Luna Fae from UK on May 05, 2009: I've used this hub for reference so many times and I've never said thanks. So a belated thank you for such a useful hub :) BristolBoy from Bristol on April 09, 2009: This is a really useful hub.  Thanks for writing it! multimastery on February 13, 2009: This is wayyy cool gotta try it ~ Thanks! multimastery on October 31, 2008: Hey darkside thanks for enlightening us...definitely gotta try it one of these days! aidenofthetower on October 30, 2008: It certainly sounds like a lot of work, but considering the advantage on a longer hub (which I tend to write) it is probably worth it! Thanks Carolyn Augustine from Iowa on October 29, 2008: Brilliant, Darkside. Thank you! anime_nanet from Portugal on September 20, 2008: Fantastic hub! I have at least one long hub where I will implement this! Thanks to Shibashake as well. If I hadn't read is hub of the Do and Dont's maybe I never found this one! sri krsna from Philippines on May 17, 2008: Thanks for the graet info I will try do this one..,. RUTHIE17 on April 26, 2008: Darkside--Just found this Hub----thank you sooooo much!  I use HTML quite a bit on Squidoo and a few other sites and really miss it here at HubPages.  Wish they would include a simple HTML option for those who want it.  Maybe someday!! Again, thanks!! Eileen--trust me, if this Grandma can do it so can you.  It's not that hard if you just take your time and be sure to do EVERY step as written.  I knew NO HTML 3 months ago and was even scared of the letters,(lol) but I'm doing all sorts of things now!  It's sort of like a giant puzzle you have to put together in the right order!  You can do it, gal! Eileen Hughes from Northam Western Australia on April 13, 2008: Thanks darkside, I like it, but may be too much for this old biddie but will have to have a go just the same.  Having fun in here.  And like they say never to old to learn new tricks. MyGenie on April 13, 2008: I love the step-by-step with graphics, best way to learn. Thanks!"
1,How to use Search Engines keywords to increase traffic on Hubpages,community," Danson Wachira is a certified Trainer in Computer Science, Information Technology and related studies. If you are not using Hubpages stats data to optimize your articles, well, you might be missing some traffic if not loads of traffic. Driving traffic using article optimization strategies might not be the primary goal for being a writer on Hubpages but seeing your articles tap on search engines traffic won’t hurt either. After spending some time on Hubpages, you will realize that Hubpages is not just another publishing website to help writers put their content on the web. It is actually a robust publishing platform optimized to maximize writers’ gains for their effort in creating content. Photo via Flickr photos Hubpages is one of the most friendly optimized publishing websites, not because it commands some Google love but because a considerable amount of effort has be used to build content publishing tools. From design tools, stats tools, social media tools, navigation, layout etc. you will find ease of use with most of these tools. Hubpages tools such as “Statistics”, “Traffic Sources”, “Title Tuner” and “Stats” on article performance on search engines can be used to optimize traffic on Hubpages. For the purpose of this article, I will use Stats on “Search Term Data” of one of my articles to demonstrate how you can use search engines stats on search term data to increase traffic on Hubpages. Hubpages article stats Hubpages article stats can provide search engines performance data on a specific article. This data is corrected over a period of time so, for newly published articles and especially those not yet “Featured” there may be few or no data. To access article’s stats on Hubpages, click the Stats link located at the top of every article. Using Hubpages article stats you will be able to know whether your article is searchable on search engines (Featured) or not, when was the last time search engines crawled on your article, which terms are used to search your article. You can also get details of how much traffic is your article garnering daily, weekly, monthly or in total and from which sources. Other details include article word count, view duration, incoming links and whether the article has any winning bids on eBay. Note: Google Analytics can also provide such details and much more, plus you will have more accurate data and better data visualization. If you have not yet setup Google Analytics account, you might be missing on useful information about your hubs’ traffic and trends. Hubpages article stats - Search terms Among the details provided on Hubpages article stats are search terms found on the “Search” tab. From here, you will get to know words that are used in searches but are not in your title. These search words are important because they form probable keywords for your article. It means that if you can include these words in your article title, you may form an exact or close keywords match used by searchers. Be careful though as not every word listed as search term makes sense when used in the title, some actually don’t. To learn how you can use search engines search terms on article stats to increase traffic on Hubpages, let us take an example using one of my articles. Three months after publishing this article, it could only make a trickle of daily views (less than 20 views per day), safe for the few days after publishing which is normal as hubs tend to get significant traffic from other hubbers just after publishing. Hubpages Article Traffic After four or five months of publishing an article, you can be able to tell from Hubpages article stats of which terms are being used in searches for the article. Take note of any word that is appearing often in searches but is not in your title. The word has to make sense when used with your title as you don’t want to use a word that will change the title meaning. From the above image, you will notice that searchers are using the word “demand” often when searching for this article. This word was not in the article title, the article was initially titled: Top 10 Most Popular And Preferred Programming Languages. Changing the article title to: Top 10 Most Popular Programming Languages In Demand will not change the title meaning. Immediately after changing the article title its views increased sharply, stabilized and started increasing steadily thereafter. Hubpages Article Traffic Notice that searchers are also using the word “ten” instead of the “10” used in the title. Although search engines should interpret these two terms in relation, an author can compare the frequency of appearance and decide on which term to use in the title. For example, from the search term data image above the term “10” appears more often than “ten” so I decided not to include the term ""ten"" in the article title but include it in the article summary instead. Hubpages Article Summary The choice of article domain also matters when it comes to traffic. You will notice that there are articles which can attract traffic from a wider audience while others are limited to specific readers. Although the article used here as an example is listed among the top on SERPs, it might not return much hits due to its limited domain as many searchers might not be interested in programming topics. Making little tweaks on your article titles can make all the difference in traffic and luckily Hubpages has several tools to help you on that including the “Title Tuner.” It may take time to analyze searchers' keywords and how they will impact on your article title, summary or body but it pays in the long run. The trick is to continually monitor your article stats to note searchers’ trends which can improve your articles performance on traffic. Larry Rankin from Oklahoma on July 28, 2015: Useful analysis. Thanks! peachy from Home Sweet Home on December 17, 2014: my hubs stats are low, I have never try looking at search, thanks for the info always yes on January 31, 2014: Thanks for the information Dwachira. I learn a lot especially for Java tutorial beginner. But I wonder why you delete your java tutorial for beginner? :( Danson Wachira (author) from Nairobi, Kenya on May 23, 2013: Hi tillsontitan, There are a lot of tools right here on HP, i guess the task is to know how to utilize them.

Smith, Glad that you got it, with traffic here becoming less and less, we need to do something. Just give the hubs you have optimized a few days and let us know of their performance. Thanks for the visit and comment. chrisinhawaii on March 27, 2013: I also find the hub stats helpful for keyword tweaks.  In fact, a few weeks ago, I was checking the search terms on one of my hubs which had recently been getting a larger trickle of google traffic.  It turns out that searchers were using keywords that didn't even appear in my article -- ANYWHERE! I was really perplexed about it.  So I looked up the keyword they were using to come to my hub, and I found out that it was for a product that was very similar to the Amazon products in my hub. I thought to myself, ""Why would Google send these people to MY hub when I don't even have that keyword ANYWHERE in my hub?""  That's when I realized that it must be because Google can't find much info out there on that particular keyword. So what I did was I did some more research on this product and wrote a whole new hub about it.  That was less than a month ago, but already that new hub is one of my best performing hubs =) It always pays to do keyword research...not only BEFORE writing a hub, but AFTER writing it as well. Great topic, Danson!  Voted up and shared! Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on March 27, 2013: Thank you for this very helpful (and well-written), information kidscrafts from Ottawa, Canada on March 27, 2013: Thank you so much for the article Dwachira!  Very well explained.  I love the graphics and the tips!  I know that I can definitely do better! Voted up, awsome and interesting and definitely useful!!! Annette R. Smith from Ocala, Florida on March 27, 2013: Thank you for this tutorial, Danson. I have optimized some of my hubs, but others need improvement. As far as list titles go, I've noticed that my hubs do better when I use a number (10) rather than a word (ten). Also, odd numbers work better than even ones. Thanks again for the great tips and reminders! Danson Wachira (author) from Nairobi, Kenya on March 26, 2013: Hi Bill, Thanks for the visit and comment, those small things we do on our articles can really make difference in traffic, if we can master how to do it properly. Bill Holland from Olympia, WA on March 26, 2013: Very helpful my friend. This is an area I know I could do better in .  Thank you for  the tutorial."

Micro-blogging through mobile phones are presently representing the most rapid means of communication to various people. There are many tricks people use to make money from their blogs. Google defeats them all by introducing new policies. Don't think that you can last for long by using tricks. At the same time remember that traffic to your blog can produce you a lot of money. First of all, you need to know how to market your blogs. By joining blogging communities and make friendship with other bloggers can increase the traffic.Subscribe Blogs: Another way of increasing the traffic is to subscribe to blogs of other bloggers. When you subscribe to other bloggers, they are obliged to subscribe to yours. By networking with conventional bloggers, you can increase the traffic of your blog.Updating your blogs frequently can increase traffic. No one will visit an inactive blog. So it is significant to update your blogs with new blog entries.Make friendship with other bloggers. Many experienced bloggers can counsel you on the path of blogging. They may have made many trials and errors. You don't have to do the same to learn the valuable lessons of blogging. Nothing but seek experienced bloggers about their experience and tips. They can convey to you a lot of information about blogging.Don't Mistake Blogging for work. It is an act of sharing information and knowledge. You may share about yourself and your life stories which are of some interest to your readers. Many are attracted to life stories like how you deal with your friends and relatives, how you overcome your problems, and difficulties, etc. You may also share the interesting moments of life like laughable incidents, and jokes, etc. There are many reasons for youngsters attracted to blogging. Money, fame, socializing with new people are some of the attractive factors which force youngsters to start blogging.Diary Writing: Old fashion of writing a diary daily is changed to blogging nowadays as you cannot expect someone to come and read your diary. Youngsters gave new meaning to Diary writing by transforming it into blogging. They don't care about money. Over a long period, they may start making money from the increased traffic. For some, writing is a passion. Spare some moments of your day for recording the things that happened during the day. It would be a new way of writing a diary.Money: I find that Steve Pavlina, a notable blogger received a lot of money from blogging than his business. Ultimately he abandoned his game developing industry. You may google his name and read more about him. That is another factor that persuaded me to start blogging. He used to discuss odd subjects. His life stories are extremely interesting and many people following him. You can find the statistics in his blog.Fame: Another factor of attraction is fame. Steve has many fans and he is acclaimed. Who does not want fame and prestige in the society? By blogging you can become famous. After reading the blogs of Steve, I was touched by his popularity and fame. That helped me to start my journey of blogging. His blog is the story of the changed life of a youngster.Escape from addiction: Blogging habits or writing habits can help you to change some negative habits of your life as it changed me from wasting my time and energy. It helped me to escape from evil thoughts that were constantly following me. I was used to think a lot of matters in my brain and get tensed by it. Earlier I have been addicted to thinking evil about the people around me. When I started writing, when I focused my attention on exchanging new information with my readers, it helped me from the old bad habit of entertaining evil thoughts. I remember that someone somewhere said, ""A bad habit can only be replaced with a pleasant habit.""That means for changing a bad habit. You need to focus on a new good habit.Sharpen your skills: When you start to blog, you will understand the need of sharpening your thoughts, language, and writing skills. You read more books, search more blogs to get new ideas and themes. Ultimately it will help you sharpen your skills and ability to write. By doing your research about the subject, you are writing about, you acquire great knowledge in your respective area of specialization and will become a pioneer in the area of your interest. Also, you'll get great insights from the comments written by your readers. Ultimately the knowledge is another factor that prompts you to write more.Work from Home: Many loggers find it easy to work-from-home and be your own boss. There is no obligation for you to commence your work at 9 am and work through till 6 pm. You can start your work as early or late as possible and continue as per your convenience. There is no boss or servant relationship in blogging. You will be the boss of your work while generating enough money for sustaining in this world. You can rest as much as you want. You may go for a vacation of a month or two. Even though you are away, your blogs will be generating money for you. Isn't it amazing?Stop googling phrases like ""how to make money online"", there is a possibility of you to end up in losing more money online. It is not as easy as many of us think. It takes time and effort. Get rich slow. But do it steadily. Over a period of time, you will be making money online. Good content and value for the reading time are the keys to success and scale in traffic.The best policy is to stop focusing on ""making more money."" Instead, put your time and energy into creating and delivering real value. Creating means making use of your knowledge and creativity for the benefit of others. Once you create, you need to deliver it to the potential readers who in turn give you the value for the content. Undoubtedly money and fame shall follow you all the days of your life if you put your energy and focus into creating and delivering real value to the work you do. How to make money from your blog?Making money from a blog? It could be an unexpected surprise. (If you are not familiar with the blog and making money using your blog). Regardless, a lot of people are making money from their blog posts. Clever people maintain their own website/blog site to keep with them, all the income they generate from their work. (for that you have to invest and take the risk) If you are not in the full-time business of blogging, you can start with HubPages or Blogger.com or some other sites which provide you a platform to blog and make money. There are lots of ways to make money online. The best and first preference is Google AdSense.I don't know what level of expertise you possess in blogging. My suggestion is that, if you are not an expert in blogging, just start to do that with independent sites like bloggers or HubPages and you will get a remarkably good experience in a very few days/months/years (it depends on your desire to learn/win). My suggestion is that does not afraid of the mistakes you make. Just be afraid of the opportunity you miss every day you pass by, not making money and not utilizing the opportunity to acquire new things. Let me repeat it, Be fearful of the missing opportunity and time. As the days go by, you are missing your opportunity. Do whatever you can undertake to publish an article in a day. Hubpages is an excellent site where you can ask questions in the forum about your problems. You will get an instant answer in the forum. I also suggest you visit old forum posts to get to know more about hubbing.There are pitfalls and setbacks in the way, but you have to push yourself ahead to succeed in the race. As the child starts to walk, it falls many times. But the child never gives up his wish to walk. He tries again and again. In the end, he/she will succeed. You may confront an identical situation in your startup. Don't lose heart. Just try to walk. Do it every day. Do it at every opportunity.Learning cycling is a challenging task. But once you learned it, it will be effortless for you to do it. You will forget very soon the exhausting days when you started to learn. Who cares about your writing? Very few will be recognizing you. Out of the very few will be concerned about your writing. Put every effort to improve your writing.Once you have put the system on the track, it will run by itself. You don't have to worry about it. It will generate money for you for the years to come. What a fantastic idea! But very few comprehend it and implement it.Wish you all the best in your blogging career. Another step is to invite more visitors to your hub. That is the exclusive way to creating enough page views. Ultimately, we can turn these page views into dollars. If you provide a quality hub, people will return to your blog. Therefore make a quality blog. Next visit other bloggers or hubbers and post a comment in their hubs. They will notice you.Once I read in the blog of a young millionaire Mr. Adam Khoo. He stated that if success is not following you, you have to follow the success. If you are not getting an opportunity, he advises that create an opportunity for yourself. That is what he performed. Initially, he conducted coaching programs in the churches free of cost. He convinced the church people to arrange free coaching programs. Once he was established in the coaching industry, he started to charge for his coaching. That is what we require to do. By commenting on other hubbers hubs, we are presenting an opportunity for them to follow and explore us and discover our hubs. Next we would be able to turn them into cash.If I post a fan mail for a hubber, surely, he would be puzzled to identify who I am and possibly explore my hubs. If there is something attractive in my hub he will share it with his friends. That is what is creating an opportunity for ourselves.Wish you all the best in your blogging career. Blogging is a multi-million-dollar sector now. There are a number of reasons why people may consider launching a blog. To express their thoughts and opinions, to promote or market a product, to help others, or to help yourself. These are some of the more general reasons why people from all over the world are launching their very own blogs, every single day. Many are ventured out to blog and gain a decent income through their writings. They offer advertisement in their blogs. Many prominent bloggers endorse products and make money by recommending those products. Principally they earn a part of the sales proceeds from the advertiser.Nowadays blogging is a source of instant information online. It can be utilized as a faster communication medium for local events. Blogging becomes an unavoidable part of human life now. Micro-blogging through mobile phones are presently representing the most rapid means of communication to various people. Details of recently happened earth quick in Pakistan and Delhi and other gulf countries are instantly come into the micro-blogging sites way before it reached the traditional media like TV and Newspapers. jonty on September 22, 2012: Thanks a lot Lamsam for sahring such a wonderful information .....

Welcome to hubpages, Sage"
3,Hitting the Big One-Hundred Mark: I'm Strangely Disinterested,community," I love HubPages, but the senior members in the forums make me feel unwelcome. The big 100! How... numerical? Going with the flow here, I figured I'd do a, ""one-hundredth article,"" piece to celebrate, or at least acknowledge, my incessant need to hear my own opinions on a plethora of different topics. If it weren't for HubPages, well, I don't think I'd have much to do in my day other than exercise profusely and play with my son. So this is also a thanks, I suppose, to the staff and owners of HubPages for giving me a place to fluff my own ego! May there be many more pieces to come, and even more income that is allegedly getting slashed continuously on our end! I've written about my family, their abuse perpetrated against me, my subsequent mental problems, and oh so much more. If you have been following me then I needn't expand, and if you haven't then you don't care anyways and I respect that so I'm not going to expand. Nonetheless, I figured since I write about such things, some of you may appreciate an update on my overall progress in life. Well, not much to talk about other than I will most likely be moving to a new place in the next three weeks. Currently posted up with my girlfriend and son in an abusive household where we must avoid the other occupants, but we have swiftly reestablished our assets and are ready to make a daring escape! I've also been getting into really great shape, sticking to my healthy diet and losing lots of fat while gaining muscle and endurance, and my permanent, degenerating spinal injury has only been acting up on the days where I can't leave the house. My girlfriend and I have developed our business plan, and all we need now is to get an investor or a loan, and we'll be on the tracks to riches and fame! Things are looking up! Still no progress on finding a dedicated illustrator, nor a group of illustrators who want to work on a graphic novel series, but I'm sure that will come in time. Keep your fingers crossed for us! Condescending thumbs-up, yeah! The HubPages community is, generally and as a majority, one of the nicest communities I have ever been a part of. From the good times to the bad, these past almost three months have been made that much more splendid by many of the community members here who have gone out of their way to make it an inclusive and accepting experience. I could not ask for a better place to share my thoughts, experiences, opinions, and beliefs. To be able to produce an income from my writings, a meaningful one at that, is a privilege that I consider to be invaluable. HubPages has allowed me to be a stay-at-home parent with an income, and for that I am eternally grateful. As a male it is often expected of me to be a bread winner, the business man, the provider, and HubPages has offered me the generous opportunity to uphold my normative gender roles. HubPages has given me a new facet of my life, and my undying gratitude is not enough to express just how much that means to me. Heartfelt thumbs-down, boo! I'll start this section off by saying not once, not a single time even by chance, had I ever stumbled upon a HubPages article, nor any from its niche sites. That is to say, until the day I typed into Google, ""self-publishing sites for articles,"" and found this site listed at somewhere around number four or five on an article about publishing sites. Why HubPages is so unpopular continues to be an enigma to me, and asking around doesn't seem to glean much knowledge on the topic. Which leads me to my next gripe, the experience of asking questions, generally interacting, or browsing within the forums. Condescension, unjust criticism, performative cruelty, and overall what I'd describe as regression is ever-present in the forums. Granted, I could be perceived as part of the problem, and I'd agree with certain fair assessments that conclude as such; but I still think more could be done in the way of turning the forums into a welcome and accepting place. A place where new writers of all skill levels can go to immerse in this mostly-wonderful community. To close this out I'd like to add my recent discovery of being able to ask yourself questions anonymously, on your own articles, without any real moderation. This led me to browsing the questions on ""popular"" Hubbers' articles and I found many of the questions written in the same writing style as the author themselves. Perhaps it is a way to take a poorly worded question and rewrite it yourself to have more clarity, but it doesn't appear to be utilized that way often. Of course I only surmise this because people who have never used this site don't seem to use the ""question section,"" rather they, logically, head straight to the comments section to ask questions. I'm afraid to ask about this in the forums, lest I get hassled by one of the regulars as is so often the case when I request information. Not a lot of real complaints from me, other than the lack of organic attention brought to HubPages. This is almost the perfect place to self-publish. So many options! Looking onward at my future, whether it be writing and all that entails or just general life choices, I'd say that my future is quite bright. When I find some investors for my girlfriend's business, or illustrators for my graphic novel series, I will really get to branch off into the greater facets of life and bring all my friends and acquaintances with me. It is exciting to know that real progress is one proper step away from coming to me at a rapid pace. I would hope that all my friends and acquaintances would want to come along with me for the ride as well. If you have any advice for my future plans, capital that needs investing for the sake of diversifying your portfolio, or just generally want to take a more active approach to our interactions then go ahead and hit my inbox. I'm always looking to network and expand my horizons, and adaptable individuals are always more than welcome to get in on the success my life continues to pour out for me! Kyler J Falk (author) from California on April 21, 2020: Shauna, I've felt like I could trust you and have enjoyed our conversations since our very first exchange and I'm always happy to welcome lovely people such as you into my life as friends. You are the most dedicated to keeping up with me for sure, and that alone wins my admiration and affection. Hopefully our interactions and other doings will last for many years to come! Shauna L Bowling from Central Florida on April 21, 2020: Kyler, first I'd like to congratulate you on making a payout in such a short time. I didn't see my first payout until a year or so after joining HP eight years ago. So kudos to you! Also congrats on getting out of another abusive situation. The three of you need to create your own haven where you can control who enters your home (and your psyche!). With a business plan in place, it sounds like you're headed in the right direction and making good choices. As for the forums, many of my favorite writers/friends here on HP avoid them like the plague for the very reasons you stated above. I'm so glad your Google search landed you here, Kyler. It's been a pleasure getting to know you and I now feel I can call you ""friend"". Kyler J Falk (author) from California on April 20, 2020: Ruby, your kind words are much appreciated. It is always nice to hear from my peers that I am a good writer, as I always seem to be my harshest critic! Sometimes, I look at all the kind words you all share to me, and I realize that I'm hating myself and my work for no reason! You all mean so much to me and I hope you all continue to immerse in my writings, also commenting so I can remember to come and immerse in yours too! Ruby Jean Richert from Southern Illinois on April 20, 2020: Kyler, I truly wish the very best for you and your family. It was interesting to get to know you. You are a good writer with many good ideas. I've been oh HP for 10 years, when I first started writing I visited the Forums, I soon found out if you disagree with anyone you're not welcome, esp. if you write poems. Whatever you decide to do, you'll make it. Congrats on 100 hubs. Kyler J Falk (author) from California on April 20, 2020: Thank you, Vidya, I hope to see you coming along with me for the ride! VIDYA D SAGAR on April 20, 2020: Congratulations Kyler. It is indeed a great achievement. Keep going, you will reach the next milestone soon too, with your talent and dedication. Wish you the very best. Kyler J Falk (author) from California on April 20, 2020: Thank you, Linda, and hopefully you keep up with my journey into the future! Always happy to see you in my comments section! Linda Courtney from Bloomsburg, PA on April 20, 2020: Congratulations on your milestone. Hope everything works out for you and your family. Never stop looking ahead and going for your dreams! Kyler J Falk (author) from California on April 20, 2020: Thank you, Titi, your compliment is much appreciated and I hope to see you around more often! Titi Helis from mason city on April 20, 2020: Congratulations You have done well Kyler J Falk (author) from California on April 20, 2020: @Anne: A strange question for a guest to be asking! If by ""made payout"" you mean I have made an income, then yes I have made payout. However, I have seen that phrase used in the forums and I do not know what the colloquial definition of that means. Kyler J Falk (author) from California on April 20, 2020: @Zulma, Fran: Thank you so much for reading! I look forward to writing more, and seeing you guys around in the future! Anne on April 20, 2020: Have you already made payout? fran rooks from Toledo, Ohio on April 20, 2020: Congratulations!  And, you hit the nail on the head! Zulma Burgos-Dudgeon from United Kingdom on April 20, 2020: Well done on reaching 100 hubs in such a short time. That is quite the accomplishment and you definitely deserve a pat on the back. I understand what you mean about the forums and I avoid them like the plague. No one needs that kind of negativity in their life. Here's to another 100. Kyler J Falk (author) from California on April 19, 2020: Thanks, MG, been a while since I've seen you around my articles. Always a pleasure to get a compliment from you! MG Singh emge from Singapore on April 19, 2020: It's a great effort to have got to 100. Your articles are stimulating and interesting including this one.  Good show. Kyler J Falk (author) from California on April 19, 2020: @Mitara: I look forward to seeing you in my comments section, as usual! You continue to be one of the loyal commenters who keep up with my drivel, and it means a lot more to me than you could ever know. I hope to see more pieces coming from you in the future as well, thanks for sticking around! Kyler J Falk (author) from California on April 19, 2020: @AL: If I had to make something up as to what keeps me going in my writings, cranking them out almost every day, I'd say it is my ego. I know, not very poetic and inspiring, but I'm not one to be dishonest just to fluff my ego even more. I love to know what I am thinking, and when I write it is like speaking to a whole new person. Without hearing my own opinions, I get bored, especially when most of the opinions from others are meant to hurt me. I suppose, putting it concisely, writing is the friend I wish I had in a human. Kyler J Falk (author) from California on April 19, 2020: @Shannon, Pamela, Umesh: I'd like to thank you for taking the time to skim/read and offer comments on my articles! It is always appreciated! Umesh Chandra Bhatt from Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, India on April 19, 2020: Nice recap. Interesting reading. Keep going to the 200 milestone. All the best. Mitara N from South Africa on April 19, 2020: Wow time flies when you have a rush of brain inspiration... 100 already, fantastic achievement in such a short span, and all excellent articles. Cheers to the many more increments of 100 at a time that we shall see in the future .... Looking forward to reading them all! AL from South Equator, East Pacific on April 19, 2020: Congratulations on your landmark. A Hundred articles in 3 months is no easy feat. Always curious about what keeps you going. I'm already worn out and struggling to reach my 25 articles target. Pamela Oglesby from Sunny Florida on April 19, 2020: Kylrer, you have written many good article that I have read. Hubpages does not pay as well as it did at one time. I stick in here because I like the people. you cannot make enough here unless you are also commenting on the articles of others. I have written hundreds of article through the years and deleted many as the information becomes out of date. There are also several place where you might write articles that pay more but they will give you a topic and a deadline. I did that for quite a while and got tired of it, but it did pay better. I like Hubpages as I am communicating with people I like from all over the world. That is my choice. You might try one of the other sites and still write on Hubpages, just not everyday. I like your articles Kyler, but I do not have time to read an article every single day from everyone I follow on this site. I wish you the best success for the future. Shannon Henry from Texas on April 19, 2020: So I suppose just one word covers it all - congratulations!"
4,How to Build a Shelf for the Side of Your Above Ground Pool,community," A helpful tutorial on how to build a great shelf for the side of your above ground pool. This can add a much needed accessory to your pool. In this tutorial I will show you how to build this shelf to add to your pool. The shelf has many convenient applications. A great place to have drinks and snacks close by so you don't have to exit the pool every time you need a snack or drink. It comes in handy to hold goggles, towels, or anything else that you may need a shelf for. Easily attaches to the side of the pool. It can be modified to fit your application and pool side. There is a parts list included and cutting guide so that the shelf will fit together without issue. The entire process from start to finish only took me about two hours. Post your recommendations and pictures of your shelf and customize it to fit your needs for others to see. I will also show you how to customize the overlay on the edge to fit the specific thickness of your frame. Have fun with your new shelf!! The above video is a helpful tutorial to show you the exact assembly and cutting of all the parts. The video shows, in detail, the steps that I took to make the shelf. All of the items listed below can be purchased at any local business that supply pvc plumbing parts and accessories. The strongest and the most reliable size connectors to use would be schedule 40 pvc parts and pipes. They create a stronger bond and have less flexibility than other gauges of pvc. In the image below you will see the parts needed (for this exact shelf) for the adaptors and connectors The piece of Lexan or Plexiglass can also be adjusted to fit your needs. You can use any type of material that won't be affected by water. If the clear appearance doesn't fit your taste, an opaque material can be used. For example, a resin cutting board. This is a great option because of its thickness and durability. Note: In my build I used all connectors that need to be glued together. If you would like to remove the shelf and disassemble, these connectors all come with threaded connections. This way you could remove parts and adjust later or make the shelf easy for transport if so desired.  Depending on the size of the side rails of your pool, these can be adjusted to fit. Examples: To reiterate: The 3.5"" pieces can be altered to fit the proper width of the top rail of your pool. Depending on the specs or dimensions of your top rail the dimensions of the 3.5"" top rail mounts will vary. Keep in mind that the side support vertical bars that support the sides of the pool may be spaced differently. In my example I used the 10"" pieces (lower right and left of the image). You may need to make these shorter or longer depending on the spacing of your vertical rails. Hopefully the pool shelf gives you as much joy as it has my family. The shelf has so many applications and variances. It can be modified to your needs and imagination. You could add a hanger for towels, goggles, pool floats, brushes, etc. Whatever you can think of. The great thing about using pvc is it can be painted to match your decor and modified easily with just a few connectors. I hope it works for you and you are able to create the perfect space for anything you may want to set on the shelf. © 2015 James Lydia on August 03, 2020: I made mine and modified it to fit my hard side pool. Dana on July 11, 2020: I just made this and the directions are great.  I read somewhere that PVC pipes should be painted if they are left outside.  Did anyone paint theirs?  And if so what type of paint is safe for the pool? Jake on June 24, 2020: If you want to break it down for storage, glue everything except the middle braces in the Ts...then use bolts long enough to go through the entire T and plexiglass...end of year, unscrew, unattach the braces, store bolts in capped ends and stowaway Rob on June 14, 2020: Thanks great idea love you included supply list very informative video James (author) from Florida on June 14, 2020: Mimi, That sounds like a real nifty idea. May keep falling leaves and some bugs out also. James (author) from Florida on June 14, 2020: Arin, Technically PVC will hold when not glued. I still recommend gluing because it could still come apart in some areas. It will hold somewhat, but not as good as glue. Arin on June 14, 2020: Do you have to glue it all together? I would like to be able to take apart for storage in the winter. Mimi on June 11, 2020: Awesome idea! I am going to give it try. I think I would like a top over it that would shade my drink and phone. Michele D. on March 03, 2020: Thanks for these great directions! Very much appreciated! Sla on July 23, 2019: Awesome video and instructions! Thank you! Maxiel on July 01, 2019: Awesome idea - very creative!! Rdl on July 01, 2018: Very good idea. Thanks for the supply list. v jones on July 10, 2017: Awesome idea. Enjoyed watching the tutorial."
5,"Hubpages, I Quit!",community," Abena is a writer and entrepreneur. In 2016, she took the plunge and moved from the UK to Ghana, West Africa. Medium is currently my favourite place to write, I don't rely on revenue share income, I have a full-time content writing business. However, for some extra income and the freedom to write whatever I want, I enjoy it. That being said, I am on a journey to eliminate anything in my life that does not bring me joy, Kon Marie style. Right now, Hubpages is beginning to get on my last nerve. I am pretty sure that this article will be removed from the feature page but at this point, I am not bothered. The other day, I decided to embark on a 30-day challenge to publish two articles per day. It is my last-ditch attempt to test if Hubpages is actually worth my time. I know many people see Hubpages as a hobby and for the most part, it is. However, I write for a living, I enjoy it and I am lucky enough to actually make money from it. However, I don't want to waste my time writing for hours only to get a few cents here and there. It doesn't really make sense to me, even an extra $100 per month is just not worth it. I think it is time for Hubpages to start rewarding their writers for their hard work and effort. A bonus system would be good, something that actually keeps writers passionate about posting content on here. I know many do it for the fun of it, or for the love of it. However, writers do deserve something, I think too many platforms exploit writers and content creators and pay them pennies. Writers deserve more than pennies. It takes hours to create content, research, write and edit content. Why do some writers frown upon writers who want to get paid for writing? After all, we need money to survive. Right now, I am typing on a laptop that costs money, I am using the Internet that costs money, I am also plugged into an electrical socket to charge my laptop and electricity costs money. Therefore, we shouldn't have to write for peanuts or for the cost of a cup of coffee. Hubpages really need to take the time to review their policies to provide writers with a better incentive to actually stay and continue feeding Hubpages with content. Honestly, some clients pay me to write content and publish it on Hubpages to build brand awareness therefore, I will never stop posting content on here for that reason. However, I still think that it is high time that Hubpages implement a proper bonus system that guarantees prolific writers a certain amount of money per month. I am on day five of the challenge to post two articles per day and so far, I am not impressed at all. Hubpages removed one of my articles from the feature list because they said it featured a spammy link, there was no spammy link. Including a relevant link to a YouTube page is not spam, it's helpful for anyone who wants to research further about the topic. I want to continue with the challenge however, on Medium, I can post articles and get ten views and make $20 depending on the members who read my content. If a member reads your content and they only read your article for the whole day, you get more money. I have had articles receive 100 views and I receive $50 or more. Over the past three months, Medium gave away $500 bonuses to the top 1000 writers. I received $1500 total for being one of the top writers on Medium, Hubpages, where are your bonuses?? I know that most people will leave negative comments telling me that I should stop moaning however, I do have some valid points and I am surprised that no one else actually cares. I know that many writers create content on here as a hobby and have full-time jobs and so do I have a full-time job, my content writing business is my full-time job. That being said, just because it's a side hustle or side hobby, it doesn't mean we shouldn't be rewarded handsomely. After all, Hubpages expect perfect articles that are more than 700 words long with images and perfect formatting but they don't want to reward us with better incentives. Hubpages, do better!  I have a list of titles that I sat down to write out but I am not sure if I want to continue with this challenge for a few cents per day. This article is my first article for the day and I am still contemplating whether I should actually continue this challenge or not. Leave comments! I will read them all.   intriguewriter (author) from worldwide on September 05, 2021: Thanks for your detailed comment. True, newbies can use Hubpages to showcase work to gain client work, that's one great thing. I think the fact that medium have a paid membership system actually limits the platform because you can get a million views from Google and you won't get paid. I had 250k views on one article and only earned $100 from member reads, the rest were from Google. I notice a lot of rude and negative comments at times from Medium, not so much here. I don't totally hate Hubpages I just think they need to rethink their strategy because they are making a lot of money from the platform, they should just reward us more thats all. I don't need the money from hubpages and I don't need content for my portfolio but it would be nice to earn more. I think those that earn $1000 and more put in a lot of time and effort. On medium, I write one article and it pays me for months and months. Not so much here because they don't continue to push your articles after a few months. I am not totally giving up but I just wanted to voice my opinion about this topic. I think it's an important one. John Hansen from Gondwana Land on September 05, 2021: I have been writing here for over 11 years, and like you, I make most of my money writing elsewhere..as a freelance writer. Yes, HubPages pays peanuts, especially for poetry (and short fiction) which is what I write mostly.  I use what I write here at HubPages as my portfolio to show clients, so it does serve some purpose. There will always be the discussion of why people write here..is it for the money or because of the community. For me it is that this is the place that first provided me with a place to publish work I had written decades ago and had never been seen and gave me encouragement to write more. There are those here who do almost make a living out of what they write here. Someone in the forums the other day said they have made $1000 per month at HubPages. I make enough to buy tea and coffee for the month lol. The difference between here and Medium (I do write there but very irregularly) is that Medium has paid membership and writers are paid through views by paid members. HubPages revenue is only through views via traffic via search through Google and other search engines and views of the advertising content on each article. Maybe if HubPages offered a paid membership option they could pay out more to writers. Just an idea. That said, I also love the community here, don’t need money from here, and prefer writing here to Medium. intriguewriter (author) from worldwide on September 05, 2021: Thanks for your comment however, it's definitely not the best revenue share site. People are making thousands on Medium. I have been paid many times from Hubpages too, I have been here for years but to  say they pay well is just the biggest joke. I am from the UK and now live in Ghana and even in our currency its definitely not enough for all the work we put in. We are making them millions and millions of dollars per year, they should reward us with bonuses. Hubpages has been around for a long time now with no major changes when it comes to rewarding content creators. It's time for a change. Other sites are coming up with better incentives, we can't just hang around here for the community, might as well just be a free social media site then.. Writing is not easy, for newbies, I guess its fine however, for long term writers, we deserve more. Dexter Whinfield from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on September 05, 2021: I'm greatful to hubpages, I only have a few articles, but I've been paid so many times. If you ask me, I'd say that hubpages is still the best revenue sharing sites for writers. Sure they have their issues, but they are always working to fix things, I appreciate the team here and I wish them well. Long live hubpages. ValKaras on September 05, 2021: Since I like playing with logic and humor -- if we are getting a share of 60% from this proverbial ""peanuts"", how can HP survive on 40% of it? I definitely agree with you -- we may not be some Shakespeares, but what we are getting as a ""reward"" is an insult. Getting nothing would look more acceptable, for then, at least, we would know it's just another social site where people can make some virtual friends, using their articles as medium for their friendly interacting. intriguewriter (author) from worldwide on September 05, 2021: Most people say they love the community aspect of Hubpages that is why they are still here. However, I think they just need to make it a social media platform then where people can share other people's content and their own paid writers create content and the community remains. Because they don't seem to care very much about the content creators at all. I have been here for 12 years and it just feels like Hubpages is reaching the end of its days. The community is great but in terms of the compensation, it is terrible. Maybe we can work together as a community to increase views or something. I am not sure that would work though because I have some articles that went viral and to be honest, received very little by way of compensation. I don't write on here because of the money specifically as I do have a full-time business. However, I think if writers are going to spend hours creating content, they should be paid for it. It's not like Facebook where you can just post one picture and share it with a few words. They expect you to write 700 words and they have a style policy and other restrictions. If they want to have so much control over us as content creators, they should pay for it. I hope this article gets shared many times so the Hubpages bosses actually start to take notice. One thing I like about Medium, the writers speak up and they are always trying to make changes. At the moment, they have made some changes that are not really favourable to the writers and they are not happy about. In fact, there are many articles complaining about it. I think people on Hubpages like the community so much that they don't want to rock the boat. I am not concerned about rocking the boat, I am concerned about fighting for what is right. The platform is just dragging its feet with no real forward-thinking strategy. They send you emails to say your article has been featured like we should be grateful for that. I have never received a $1000 check from Hubpages. On Medium however, I receive regular $1000 checks. It's not easy to get to that stage though but once you do, it never stops. I stopped writing on Medium for so me weeks and I still earned more than $100 per week for articles that have been sitting there for months. I am on a solid $400 of passive income on there and the rest is from articles that I write and publish every week. Audrey Hunt from Pahrump NV on September 05, 2021: I share your thoughts and often ask myself why I'm still here. After 11 years and going on 5 million views, I earn less than half today than ever before. I love the community which is the only reason I'm still here. Miebakagh Fiberesima from Port Harcourt, Rivers State, NIGERIA. on September 05, 2021: Makes sense to me. intriguewriter (author) from worldwide on September 05, 2021: Hi Brenda, thanks for your comment. I think the whole community aspect is great but they can't expect people to just spend hours on content and get paid pennies. They need a bonus system and I think it's high time. They really need to shake things up here. I think I'm going to write to them lol BRENDA ARLEDGE from Washington Court House on September 05, 2021: Thanks for sharing your frustration. I wish Hubpages would give us more of an incentive, but I do love the people I talk with on Hubpages. It's like a unique little family. As for medium, I haven't tried it yet Maybe I will look into it one day. I hope your test works. Abby Slutsky from America on September 05, 2021: I just write her because I can write what I want. I agree that I would not recommend it for the compensation, but the community is nice."
6,Rain Are Blessing!,community," Everytime when the rains its coming its reminds me of happy and sadness, it makes me happy because I feel lucky to have a home that is a shelter that prevent me from getting poured by the rain.

7,Making Money Online - Hitting 100 Hubs - Progress on HubPages,community," My trophy Victoria Lynn 100 hubs. I'm at a loss for words. For one thing, I'm tired. My big 100th hub is coming in the middle of a 30 hubs in 30 days challenge. So I'm feeling kind of dry. I'd like to thank the academy, and my mom, and God....Okay, I jest, but that's a start. Hmmmmm....Too many people to thank for helping me along in the journey. The ""academy"" music will start playing as a cue to get off the stage. So maybe I'll first look at some accolades I've earned and some tips I've learned. Hey, that rhymed! Rhyme it did. I've shared poetry on HubPages, which has been cathartic. I've shared recipes (and found many, too). I've shared money saving tips. I've written about pets and grammar--two great loves--and a variety of other things. I've enjoyed it. I feel that my creative juices flow better as I am practicing my writing every day. Oh, let's see. How about a few stats? Am I earning any money? The first day I earned actual money was right after my Adsense ads kicked in. A whopping 6 cents. Boy, was I excited. After about six months, I earned the magic $50 payout from HubPages. And now, not even two months later, I'm looking at a second payout soon. My earnings have grown every month, and I hope they continue. I'd love to get a payout every month even if only $50. I feel that I'm building a portfolio of writing samples plus networking with other writers and getting my work out there. The money is nice, but it's not the largest part of the big picture. As for the possibility of earning money on HubPages, yes, I think it's very possible, as mine has grown every month I've been here, nearly doubling over the past month.  100 hubs Over 35,314 views total Lately from 500 to 800 views per day. Before March, it was usually lower than 500. I want more on a consistent basis! Perhaps the 30 in 30 has helped, but my daily revenue more than doubled these past few weeks. Will that last? I don't know. A few days I made nearly $2.50 (3 days in a row). I was stoked! I see the fact that my earnings have increased every month since I started in August as a positive sign. I'll keep my fingers crossed that it continues.  Okay, I have to thank a few people. 100 hubs. Who woulda thunk? I remember JT Walters telling me, as I was overwhelmed with time constraints, to do just one per week and I would have 52 in a year. Well, 8 months later, I have 100. That's cool. Thanks, JT, for the long messages answering my numerous questions. Thanks. Who got me into HubPages? It was Lela Davidson, a local writer who was teaching a two night training on online writing. HubPages was one of the venues she talked about, and she is actually one of the success stories on HubPages. She hasn't been really active lately, as she is also doing other things, such as publishing books! Check her out at http://leladavidson.com/ if you get a chance. I owe her a lot. And JS Matthew, who greeted me and welcomed me, encouraging me on those first few hubs. And poets Vincent Moore aka Saddlerider, along with Epigramman, who told me they liked my poetry. Liked my poetry? Are you kidding me? I was elated. Oh, so many more encouragers and friends from the beginning. Happy to be at HubPages! I've listed four early supporters above. Dare I mention more without hurting feelings? Others have been brave enough, but I don't want to leave anybody out. I can try, though. Just know that you are important to me even if I forget to mention you. There are so many great people and so little space. Some early supporters, besides the four above, were thejeffriestube, Sunshine625, and Arlene V. Poma, who left early comments on my hubs. Wesman Todd Shaw helped me learn about different sites to put links on. Lucky Cats was sweetly supportive, as was Sunnie Day. Vinaya Ghimire always had beautiful things to say. I bonded with Mom'sSecret over loss. MAKUSR and Movie Master had lovely things to share. Ktrapp and Cloverleaf were always supportive, as was dear Lord de Cross. I knew I could ask anything of Just Ask Susan. WillStarr and Cutters would pop in from time to time. And I got to be around lovely ladies chanroth, FloraBreenRobinson, Jedijessicuh, and Cardisa. Knowledgeable homesteadbound came along, as did RealHousewife and MissOlive, all who have taught me so much. And don't forget the controversial hubluvvin' Cagsil and dear, full-of-heart kenneth avery! More keep coming. Sholland from a nearby state, Daniella Lopez from my state, sweet Marcy Goodfleisch, and the hilarious Ardie! Billybuc has become one of my dearest supporters and advisers, and cclitgirl my fellow grammar geek. The PoeticFool and ThoughtSandwiches both make me think. Stephhicks inspires me, as does randomcreative and jeannieinabottle. I love the sweet spirits of Ruchira, vocalcoach, and Sharyn's Slant. So many more I am getting to know: Deborah Brooks, DeborahNeyens, DzyMsLizzy, eiddwen, Fennelseed, fpherj48, davenmidtown, drbj, BakerRambles, marcoujor, tammyswallow, melbel, Patty English, Mark Ewbie, Melovy, Millionaire Tips, mistyhorizon, Curiad, DaisyMariposa, teaches, RusticLiving, AudreyHowitt, PDXKaraokeGuy, Perspycacious, Maddie Ruud, uninvitedwriter, thePracticalMommy, alocsin, molometer, AEvans, Turtlewoman, and A.A. Zavala. Do I have to say more? Oh, please message me to add you, and I will, because that's the fear of listing. Leaving someone significant out. Or if you see I've left someone out, please nudge me. I'll fix it. Forgive my tired brain. There are so many newbies who are also growing on me. Or old-timers who I am just now running into. I am such a perfectionist, and I don't want to slight anyone. I'm sure I will be revising this hub as I think, Oh my gosh, how could I have not listed that delightful hubber? I've also highlighted some of the names so you can click on some of their hubs or hubs about them. I would have highlighted more, but some of them wouldn't bring up links. Go figure. I bet I could do them all if I knew how to do the HTML thingy. There's always so much to learn. The academy people are staring at me. The music is getting too loud for me to speak anymore. I must go. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Will I write 100 more hubs? Will I make more money at this venture? Will I make more friends on this site? The answer to all three questions is yes. There is no other place I'd rather be. #19/30 Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on December 16, 2020: I really need to get back into writing more! thanks for the encouragement! Liliane Najm from Toronto, Canada on June 13, 2020: you inspire others to write fast and furious. Reginald Thomas from Connecticut on June 24, 2019: Congrats Victoria Much time and effort on your part. Good job. Keep it going. Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on April 15, 2012: Thanks, urmil...! Hope you are doing well! Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on April 15, 2012: Thanks, Sunnie Day! You are one to talk, as you are such a blessing to everyone here on HubPages. So glad you stopped by! Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on April 15, 2012: Thanks, Sharyn! I appreciate your comments, especially the one about the humor and sarcasm. I love humor and sarcasm, and sometimes I feel that I may use it too much and at other times too little. LOL. You write great! You don't need to write like me, but I do love that compliment. Thanks, friend. You made my day! :-) Urmila from Rancho Cucamonga,CA, USA on April 14, 2012: Congratulations Victoria! 125 hubs in 9 months, very impressive. keep it up. Sunnie Day on April 14, 2012: So happy for you Victoria. We are very blessed to have you here on hubs..Here's to many more hubs to share. Hugs, Sunnie Sharon Smith from Northeast Ohio USA on April 14, 2012: Holy Crap Vicki ~ I'm late to the party but not that late, gosh, you are up to 125 hubs!   Whoooo hoooo!  Congratulations on your milestone PLUS!  You really need to slow down a bit so I can catch up, ha.  Seriously, I always enjoy your writing. Especially the funny stuff.  I love the humor and sarcasm.  I often wish I could write like you.  Best wishes to you!  So glad you shared your milestone with us, Sharyn Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on April 12, 2012: bdegiulio--So glad you enjoyed my hub and sense of humor. Yes, the 6 cents was exhilarating. Just wait until you hit a quarter! It's an exciting journey. Stick with it! Bill De Giulio from Massachusetts on April 12, 2012: Victoria, I really, really enjoyed this Hub.  You have a great sense of humor combined with your great writing ability.  I've only been here on HubPages for 2 months but it's good to know what can happen over the next few months if I stick with it.  Your excitement over earning your first 6 cents was great to read and I can tell you that I was equally excited when I earned my first 2 cents.  Great job. Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on March 31, 2012: Thanks, mikeydcarroll! Me, too! mikeydcarroll67 on March 31, 2012: Congrats! I hope you continue to keep up the good work!

Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on March 30, 2012: Jools99--Thanks so much!! I had extra time this month, or otherwise I wouldn't have been able to do it. Thanks for the encouragement and feedback. Sharilee Swaity from Canada on March 30, 2012: Wow, that is such an accomplishment to create 100 hubs in eight months! I can't wait to see what you do in a year. A big congratulations to you: you have accomplished amazing things. Way to go! John MacNab from the banks of the St. Lawrence on March 30, 2012: Congratulations Victoria.  You've accomplished a monumental achievement - may the pennies keep mounting for you. Jools Hogg from North-East UK on March 30, 2012: Victoria, this is a wonderful achievement and I am in awe of you!  I have enjoyed lots of your 30 in 30 days hubs along the way, well done!  I will never do 30 in 30 days - it would be too much for me; I find it difficult enough to do 2 per week. Awesome, voted up and shared - it will inspire others! Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on March 23, 2012: Thanks, Epi! Great to see you. I have missed you and have been meaning to stop by the music and cinema group. Busy, busy--but will try in the next month after this crazy 30/30 challenge. Great to see you! I meant what I said in this hub about your encouragement. It has meant so much. You have been an integral part of my growth and accomplishments here at HubPages. I do thank you! epigramman on March 23, 2012: ...congratulations dear friend and respected colleague for 100 hubs plus and counting - you are greatly admired by me for what you have accomplished here and I am thrilled with your shout out to me in this hub - will post it on my homepage at FB for all to see your remarkable achievement(s) and drop by our FB group Let's just talk music and cinema - if you can - would love to see you there and sending you warm wishes and good energy to you from lake erie time 11:18am Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on March 21, 2012: Thanks, donnaisabella! I have seen you around but haven't got to know you as well as I would like. I hope to get to know you better in the next 100! Blessings to you, too! Isabella Mukanda from Fort Myers on March 21, 2012: Congrats Vicky! Wish you all the best for the next hundred, stay blessed! Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on March 21, 2012: It takes me a while to write a hub, too, Blossom, especially to find and edit photos. Plus I have to keep revising and going back to the hub. I just happen to be in a position now where I am home more. It's a huge challenge, and I may never do it again, but I will finish the 30! Thanks for your great comments, Blossom! Bronwen Scott-Branagan from Victoria, Australia on March 21, 2012: Thirty in thirty days! Wow! You certainly deserve the accolades, it's a great feat. It takes me quite a long time to write a hub, find the right photos and I haven't even added a video yet. Congratulations! Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on March 20, 2012: GirlsTalk--Isn't it exciting to get those comments? More to come, I am sure. Hope you enjoy HubPages. Sure, you can ask me for help anytime. :-) Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on March 20, 2012: random--Thanks!

You are very kind, and I think you are one that I forgot to add to my 100th hub! I remember your being around for a while. I thank you for your support; I really do. :-) Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on March 20, 2012: Lord, yeah, it seems like just yesterday that we met. You've been such a cool friend and writing buddy. Glad you like my puppy, even though I have cats! haha. You are a  multi-talented hub writer, which is impressive. You're a star, for sure. Here's to many, many more good times at the Hub. :-) Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on March 20, 2012: homesteadbound--Glad to hear that you'll be here, too.

Joseph De Cross from New York on March 19, 2012: Hi there Victoria my friend. felt like yesterday when you were asking if there were ways to improve the statistics... and we met in here, like any other hubber. What struck me was your humor and your puppy. Then you told me you had cats... then came the recipes and then the challenges. Hope to see you up there with the rest of the stars. We are a click away for any suggestion and friendly words. You are such a sweet thang of a friend. LORD Cindy Murdoch from Texas on March 19, 2012: Congratulations Vickie! Such an awesome milestone. Thanks for the mention. I always look forward to reading your hubs and I have learned a lot from you. As you stated, it seems like there is always so much to learn. Congrats on getting payout so quickly as well. Yea! Looking forward to the next 100. I'll still be here as well, because I can think of no place I would rather be either.

Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on March 19, 2012: Thanks, MarieAlice. I plan to keep on going! bdegiulio--100 seemed impossible to me when I first started. You just keep writing and it happens. I was working full-time for most of that time. I would just get on a roll at times. Keep after it! Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on March 19, 2012: Hey, dear CC sis! YOU are an inspiration, as well! That's a great idea about teaching a class about online writing. There will be more and more of a need for that, ya know. I love your comments. You're awesome, sis! Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on March 19, 2012: teaches, Thank you so much.

Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on March 19, 2012: shuck72--I can't seem to delete my lower-scoring hubs. I do go back and revise them from time to time to try to improve them, though. The minimum payout for HP ads are $50. Google is $100. My Google ads total is building much more slowly. Sinea Pies from Northeastern United States on March 19, 2012: Congratulations, Victoria! This is wonderful. And all those views? Awesome! I'm bringing up the rear here but am looking forward to the day that I will have 100 out there, too. Many blessings to you. Voted up and beautiful.

We won a Q & A prize together. Gotta go! Commercial is coming. I really appreciate you and your support! Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on March 19, 2012: You're welcome, Flora. I met you shortly after I started on HubPages! I've made it this far with the 30/30. I'm going to have to go the rest of the way. Thanks for the support! emilybee on March 19, 2012: Way to go!!! 100 hubs, what an accomplishment!! I think I am about half way there.

It has been my pleasure to follow you and read your wonderful hubs! Bill De Giulio from Massachusetts on March 19, 2012: Congratulations.  100 seems like a long way off but so did 25 when I started 5 weeks ago.  I guess patience and persistence will have their reward.  It is good to see success stories to keep us newbies motivated.  Hopefully I'll be writing about my 100th somewhere down the road. Maria Alicia Cardenas from Spain on March 19, 2012: This is great!!! congratulations on this achivement not only professional, but also personal.  Keep going Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on March 19, 2012: HC Porter--You are one of the ones who has been around a while that I am now discovering! I'm glad I did.

And you gave me a GREAT idea: teach about online writing!  We could do that!  You teach one at your community college, and I'll teach one at mine!  Then, we will pepper it with some Spanish and voila!  There we go!  ;)  Hehe.  You are such an inspiration.  Keep on hubbing!! Victoria Lynn (author) from Arkansas, USA on March 19, 2012: KDF--Thanks! savahah1--Thanks! You're actually one of the newer ones I was talking about getting to know.

8,50 One Sentence Tips to Increase Traffic Without Google,community," Susannah is a Journalist and Blogger with a total social following of over 100,000 people & whose content receives over 15,000 visits/day. 50 One Sentence Tips To Increase Traffic Without Google Ryan McGuire CC0 Pixabay When I first started writing online (5 years, 30 websites and 1000+ articles ago) I found learning the tricks of online promotion were like wading through mud. For every article I wasted 20 minutes reading, I might find one workable tip. After the 2011 Panda algorithm change, I decided that I needed to learn how to bring in more traffic from more than just one source, so I'd never again run the risk of losing more than 50% of my traffic in one hit. Since then I've learned how to dig up the best tips faster and make use of multiple promotion methods, but I've never shared them all in one place. My goal with this article is to share some of my best tips which meet my high standards of laziness and penny pinching. In other words: And here's the bonus: Increasing your traffic from sources other than Google will usually boost your Google traffic, too. Variety is key on social media - use a combination of photos, links, text posts, comedy, seriousness and conflict to maintain interest.

Hope I can implement all Susannah Birch (author) from Toowoomba, Australia on October 19, 2015: Hi Glen, What content you have also determines how many shares it gets. However on sites such as Headtalker and Copromote, you ""earn"" shares by sharing other people's work. It's a good way to meet the 1:10 rule so you're not just sharing your own content on social media all the time. Tweepi allows you to follow the followers of people on similar topics. For instance if I had an account devoted to Paleo, I'd follow all the followers of @PaleoHacks who had tweeted within the last 24 hours. You can then unfollow those who don't follow back. Empire Avenue lets you basically ""invest"" in virtual shares of other people. The more investments you have, the more dividends you earn each day. I earn about 500,000 eaves/day in dividends. You then invest these back into ""missions"", paying people to engage with your Facebook page, or a particular Tweet. Glenn Stok from Long Island, NY on October 18, 2015: I'm reporting back after trying Headtalker as you had suggested, Susannah. As it turned out, nothing came of it. Dozens of other people responded with requests to support their cause, which I did. But most people didn't reciprocate. So I didn't see any value in using Headtalker, and no traffic resulting from it. You had listed two other sites that you also recommend. Empire Avenue and Tweepi. You just mentioned them in this hub, but you didn't say how you use them. I would be very interested in reading about your own experience using these sources for traffic and how you made them work for you. I think this would be of value to all your readers. You always are very helpful and you provide very useful ideas for other writers. I hope you publish a follow up hub with this information and I look forward to reading it when you do. Charito Maranan-Montecillo from Manila, Philippines on October 14, 2015: These are such great tips, Susannah! I'll surely try some of them. Thanks for sharing. Fay Favored from USA on October 14, 2015: I appreciate the information and site links. They have been helpful. somethgblue from Shelbyville, Tennessee on October 11, 2015: After visiting your forum topic on Google Rankings, I decided to bop on over an look again at some of your hubs, this one caught my eye probably because I read it before. If I were to do this full time and was really into making some money I would have to use all of this info but most of my articles are based on extensive research which doesn't lend itself to having the time to getting some of this stuff done. However there is some really good tips that I may begin to use thanks for sharing this info. Audrey Selig from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on September 17, 2015: Thanks Sue for all the great tips in this hub. You have done many things over five years, especially writing that book. You help others, which is one of your greatest attributes. You and Marisa are a lot alike with your help,  except you go overboard helping with hubs with tips, title help, SEO, and individual attention. Thanks for sharing. Pinning.  Blessings,  Audrey Katherine Tyrrell from London on September 15, 2015: Great hub - and practising what you preach! Wednesday-Elf from Savannah, Georgia on August 17, 2015: Thanks for the tips. I found some very helpful and will be trying them out. Linda Bryen from United Kingdom on August 10, 2015: This is a very useful hub Wrilit, thank you for sharing. Alex moya fernandez from Barcelona on August 04, 2015: Amazing tips!! They're really useful and it's clear you've used them several times before sharing... Thank you! Heidi Vincent from GRENADA on August 02, 2015: Short and to the point tips! Thanks for sharing them. Ruth from St. Paul. MN on July 30, 2015: Thanks for the advice on how to get more traffic! I'll try it! Paola Bassanese from Ireland on July 29, 2015: Brilliant article, thanks! Peggy Woods from Houston, Texas on July 28, 2015: This is an eye opening article for me.  Thanks for sharing all of the tips you have learned through the years.  I plan to bookmark this so that I can come back and start trying some of the ideas. Chitrangada Sharan from New Delhi, India on July 28, 2015: Great hub with lots of useful suggestions and tips!  I would follow the  advise  as  mentioned by you . Thanks for sharing this, voted up, pinned  and shared on HP! Kristen Howe from Northeast Ohio on July 27, 2015: Great tips on how to drive traffic. I would have to keep it in mind for HP and for my blog. Voted up for useful! Rachel L Alba from Every Day Cooking and Baking on July 26, 2015: Hi Susannah, A lot of useful information here.  I certainly would like to get a lot more views.  My hubs are only recipes so I guess I have to rely on people who are looking for something to cook.  I was surprised to read that Goggle isn't the most reliable place to get views.  I was counting on that.  I also would like to make more money.  I hardly made anything so far.  Thanks for sharing.  I voted up, useful and awesome. Larry Wall on July 26, 2015: Responding to your comment about my earlier comment, Content Mills are where client put up stories they want written and writers, with the right qualifications attempt to write the stores. I have had several stories may pay more than $100 from these mills, such as TextBroker. Hire  Writers pays less. Regarding picture placement, I go my to my journalism school day when the bible for design was Elements of Style of Edmond Arnold, who stated that the primary optical area was the upper left had corner. A good picture will attract attention and lead the reader to the headline at left. You may disagree, but Hub Pages should allow pictures on either side of the page. I found a way of doing it, using a PowerPoint trick I wrote about. Being forced to break a Hub with a picture in the middle, is a good way to lose readers. Venkatachari M from Hyderabad, India on July 26, 2015: Great article with wonderful tips and guidances. I should consider at least on some of them presently to improve my traffic. Thanks for sharing. Voted up and awesome. English-lion on July 25, 2015: Great article I just joined Empire Avenue ..... it looks like a lot of fun Suhail Zubaid aka Clark Kent from Mississauga, ON on July 25, 2015: Some awesome ideas to take home from here for a niche writer like me :-) Glenn Stok from Long Island, NY on July 24, 2015: You gave a lot of useful ideas here Susannah.  One in particular caught my interest - Headtalker. I spent some time on their site trying to figure it all out. It seems the minimum you have to offer is $20. They also say this is optional, but that defeats the purpose. So I'm confused with Headtalker. At a penny a view on average, this would require 20,000 views just to get that money back. Have you found this to be worthwhile?  I assume you do since you included it in you list, but I'd be interesting in hearing more details on your experience with Headtalker. Eileen from Western Cape , South Africa on July 24, 2015: Fascinating hub with wonderful tips. Will be bookmarking for future reference BODYLEVIVE from Alabama, USA on July 24, 2015: Very informative, I've made a few notes to use myself. I haven't been here for awhile due to my success elsewhere. So, great hub and I'll be checking out some of your other hubs as well, I do that when I'm interested, LOL. Susannah Birch (author) from Toowoomba, Australia on July 23, 2015: In answer to some of the hub comments below - all others have been answered in the forum thread (let me know if I missed any!): @PurvisBobbi44 - there is nothing wrong with coming from a business background. Many businesses and websites are always looking for corporate writers. @Abby Campbell I have gone further into this on my forum reply to C L Mitchell @Larry Wall Not sure what you mean by content mill? Many people see Hubpages as a higher quality content mill. According to HP A/B testing, top right is the best place for images. Their formatting options are limited to avoid bright and annoying in your face content like certain other sites have. Sure, I write clickbait sometimes. But it's THE BEST clickbait available on Google (when there's competition) or the ONLY article style content available online (you'd be surprised how many forum posts rank top of Google due to no article competition). As you'll see by some of the examples of popular content in the quote boxes in the hub, not all my content is just clickbait or content style. Dianna Mendez on July 23, 2015: This is one of the best articles I've read on this topic. Congratulations on your success in writing. Dawn Henderson from Ohio on July 23, 2015: Thanks for sharing this information. I was unfamiliar with some of the websites listed in your article. I have been researching these sites and will begin using them. sweetypie1968 on July 23, 2015: Excellent advice!  Thanks for sharing. Susannah Birch (author) from Toowoomba, Australia on July 23, 2015: I'm going to be putting answers to all your questions in this forum thread, simply because there are already so many and yes, some of these one sentence tips do have lots more info behind them. https://hubpages.com/forum/topic/132014 I am at one of my day jobs today, but later I will answer all questions re: the use of these methods in the forum. Confused, negative or personal comments I will answer in comments :-) Larry Wall on July 23, 2015: If you're not writing about personal experiences, ideas, etc., how does Hub Page differ from Content Mills? I made more in six months on one of the mills than I made in a year with Hub Pages. Your tips are good, for some people. I do not seek to create arguments, though I will participate. I do not do articles on subjects that have already been done, and I think the lay out issue are a major issue. The limitations of Hub Pages dictates that a picture is either full width, totally breaking the hub in half, or all sent to the right side of the page. Basic layout design says the upper left corner is the primary optical area. If we were allowed to place a picture or graphic there with the text to the right the eye appeal would be better. I am a former newspaper reporter and was good in design. I have been on Hub Pages about four years, took a few breaks. Most of my alleged followers have probably moved on and some have died, but the number never changes. You make it sound easy, but I want to write my content and not try to fill up space on the latest trends. It works for you and others that is great and I wish you continued success. Your approach is not for me. Alicia Rose Harrell from Central Oklahoma on July 23, 2015: Been doing similar as you Susannah for my traffic sources, but through your article learned about other avenues you were using that I overlooked or decided not to use for my own reasons. This hub was a great share! :D I voted it up! :D I agree with you that one needs to be cautious as they pick their traffic venues, especially with the pay per traffic sites for some deliver while others do not. Good luck to everyone with generating massive traffic for your hubs! :D Amada Gonzalez from Quartzsite on July 23, 2015: This is incredible information for someone just starting out on Hubpages. Thank you Wrylilt! This is very inspirational and I am eager to put all your advice into play with my own work. I am looking forward to reading so much more from you. Great Job! Marlene Bertrand from USA on July 23, 2015: This is a lot of information - excellent tips. I can see I need to step up my game plan. Thank you for sharing such valuable tools with us. Heidi Thorne from Chicago Area on July 23, 2015: Good stuff! Sharing on HP and Twitter. Thank you! junko on July 23, 2015: Thanks for directions to the Yellow Brick Road and the Traffic Wizard. Timothy Arends from Chicago area on July 23, 2015: Great hub. I would like to know what promotional methods using Fiverr you find to be worthwhile, Don't name specific sellers--just the types of gigs you find useful (maybe a separate hub on this?). In fact, many of these tips could easily be spun off into a separate hub!! Dr Abby Campbell from Charlotte, North Carolina on July 23, 2015: Susannah! You have such wonderful tips. Thank you for sharing them. I do have a question for you. How do you find time to do all the sharing (marketing)? And, how much time do you spend on it each day? I have the most difficult time with time as I'm so busy with writing, but I know I need to do this. Help! vasantha  T k on July 23, 2015: Useful information provided. Voted Up! Kristine Manley from Atlanta, GA on July 23, 2015: This is by far one of the best articles I've seen written on this topic. This gives me hope in gaining more traffic to my blog. Thank you so very much for sharing these wonderful tips that work. Akshay from India on July 23, 2015: 7 days have passed and i have got around 500 visitors. Akshay from India on July 23, 2015: Very good article I am following already some of the tips you told  and people are viewing my hub and that whats really matters to m C L Mitchell on July 23, 2015: This is by far the best article I have ever read on this topic. Thank you so much for providing this honest and in depth information. I've just created a new website and this is really going to help me to promote it. Do you keep track of all of the promotional activities that you do? e.g. when and what you pin to pinterest, when and what you tweet, when and what you promote in forums etc... If so, how do you do it? Stella Kaye from UK on July 23, 2015: A very useful article and I will try to implement some of your tips. As you don't go into detail on how lucrative your online writing ventures have been, I can only assume they must be, purely from the amount of traffic you receive. I often feel despondent with online writing as it has not provided me with any remuneration to speak of although it has been fulfilling in other ways . I was with the Helium site until it closed last year and I'm currently reposting all my existing articles on Hub pages, so it's great to read your article to see how traffic can be boosted. Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 23, 2015: Thank you for sharing your tips on success. Voted up and useful. Shampa Sadhya from NEW DELHI, INDIA on July 22, 2015: It seems to be very helpful but I need to understand it properly. Marilynn Dawson on July 22, 2015: Thanks for writing this.  Many lists are not very informative, but this one is helpful!  I'll be sharing it for sure. Michelle Harlow from Calgary on July 22, 2015: Several methods I hadn't thought of. Thanks! Definitely going to encourage my writers to read this. Snakesmum on July 22, 2015: Haven't heard of some of these promotional avenues, and you have some great tips here.  Thanks. Ingenira on July 22, 2015: Very helpful tips. Thank you so much !! suraj punjabi from jakarta on July 22, 2015: Great tips! I hope I can implement some of those. To be honest those tips sounds very time consuming as it involves doing research and all that. I admit to feeling a bit overwhelmed as I read them. So I guess I will just stick to writing well first and do what I can with the limited time I have for writing. May be one day If I get the chance I will implement some of them. Will bookmark this for future reference. Thanks! Michelle Bentley from Niagara Falls, New York on July 22, 2015: Love the article! Some very useful tips. I'm in the process of releasing my first full-length novel on Amazon and these tips are helpful for that as well. Andrew Smith from Richmond, VA on July 22, 2015: Voted useful!  Thanks! Lawrence Hebb from Hamilton, New Zealand on July 22, 2015: Samantha Excellent stuff here. I'm going to be working through some of these and see what happens. Thank you Lawrence Brian Langston from Languedoc Roussillon on July 22, 2015: Fabulous article Susannah with tons of really useful content delivered in a way which engages those non-techies amongst us!  Thanks for sharing the benefit of your experience with us and for the helpful links which I'm really looking forward to exploring.... most of which I've never heard of before! Aurorasa Sima from Chicago, Illinois on July 22, 2015: Thank you so much for this awesome and helpful post! Linda Todd from Charleston on July 22, 2015: I think that you have posted a winner for everyone here on HubPages.  Truly enlightening and useful. Thanks so much for the important information that can be put to use. Linda Oztinato on July 22, 2015: All good if you want to spend your entire life on a phone with thumbs flailing walking into everybody. How about caching one big fish instead of millions of little ones while just having fun in your spare time? Dora Weithers from The Caribbean on July 22, 2015: Thank you for sharing such helpful information and congratulations on your successes. Thelma Alberts from Germany on July 22, 2015: Thanks for sharing this very useful information. I appreciate that. I have to try some of them. mikeydcarroll67 on July 22, 2015: Great tips! I think it is very important to be able to pursue other avenues besides things such as Google and search engine traffic. Marissa from United States on July 22, 2015: Wrylilt, great suggestions! I have a question: is Google Suggest an actual tool or do you mean to just type in your subject in the Google search bar and see what people are searching for? Bev G from Wales, UK on July 22, 2015: Added to Evernote for future reference. Many thanks! suziecat7 from Asheville, NC on July 22, 2015: Wonderful information - thank you so much. Robert Morgan from Hutchinson Island, FL - Myrtle Beach, SC - Gilbert AZ on July 22, 2015: Awesome information... Thank you so much. Susette Horspool from Pasadena CA on July 21, 2015: Actually, Wrylit, one of your tips hit me instantly - the one about pregnancy problems. I wrote a hub about pregnancy and water some time ago, focusing on problems caused by not drinking enough. It was a great hub, but no one was reading it. I went back just now to change the title and intro to include the phrase ""pregnancy problems"" and posted it on my Google Plus account. Thanks especially for that tip. Chin chin from Philippines on July 21, 2015: Just like in your other hubs, you write a ton of great tips and advice. Thanks a lot for sharing. Linda Crampton from British Columbia, Canada on July 21, 2015: Thank you very much for sharing all the tips, WryLilt. I've never heard of some of the sites that you mention or thought of some of the strategies that you suggest. This is a very useful hub! Shrouds on July 21, 2015: u are right,in some situation we don;t need google if we answer a few niche topic or discussions among Hubpages members.This is the fact ,I depend on Google to spread everything I did online,the feedback was quite slow!Thanks for the great written tips! Olde Cashmere on July 21, 2015: This was packed with a variety of useful tips for writers. I appreciate all of the outside of the box ideas which can help us engage more readers. poetryman6969 on July 21, 2015: A ton of great advice.  Looks like I better get cracking. Voted up! Susette Horspool from Pasadena CA on July 21, 2015: Thanks Wrylit. I'm printing this out, so I can evaluate and highlight the best tips for me. I'm realizing more and more that marketing my site is as important as writing hubs, especially since water knowledge (my main topic) is a huge necessity these days, but is not much searched. Mary Hyatt from Florida on July 21, 2015: I have a lot of respect for your knowledge!  When you so graciously offered to help us write better titles for our Hubs in the Forums,  I took advantage of your help, and I can tell you:  I had a Hub to become unfeatued, and asked you for help.  I took your advice, and that Hub has been featured ever since!! Voted UP, and will certainly share! Sheilamarie from British Columbia on July 20, 2015: These are some helpful tips, Wrylilt. Thanks for sharing them with us. Bronwen Scott-Branagan from Victoria, Australia on July 19, 2015: Thanks for some great tips - most useful and appreciated. Susan Hazelton from Northern New York on July 19, 2015: You include such wonderful information in your hubs.  I have put this article into my favorites. Marian L from UK on July 18, 2015: Some good tips here thanks, I'll try and put some into action! Olly from London, UK on July 18, 2015: Learned a few new things here, thanks for creating an informative Hub:-) Jeannie Marie from Baltimore, MD on July 18, 2015: Thanks for sharing these tips.  I have not heard of some of the websites you mentioned in this hub, so any new information is always appreciated. Barbara Purvis Hunter from Florida on July 18, 2015: Hi, As usual your hub was very helpful. You were one of the first writers I read in 2007 after I quit my job to care for my husband. I will always cherish the fact because it encouraged me to start writing again. And, believe me I knew nothing about writing online and communicating with other writers. My online experience was in business where I managed executive accounts. I was rather too professional at first which I am sure I appeared as cold. Thanks for all your help and sharing as you are one of the few that truly tries to help others. Bobbi Purvis John Hansen from Gondwana Land on July 18, 2015: Wonderful information here Wrylilt. I will certainly put some of these tips to the test. Voted up."
9,How to Reply To Hub Comments,community," There is always a discussion on various forums about how people should reply to comments on their own Hubs and personal blogs. Even though this hub is about replying to comments on a hub, the same thoughts can also apply to replying to comments on any online article you write. Each Hubber is responsible for moderating the comments on their own Hubs, so my view on this issue is to leave it up to the individual Hubber. Some people are busy with family and kids and do not have time to comment every day, whereas other people work near a computer and like to comment on Hubs during their breaks. There is no right or wrong way to respond to comments on your own Hubs, but it should be done politely and with sensitivity to the person who took the time to read your Hub and make a comment. Even if the Hubber does not agree with you, at least write back a response and do not delete their comment right off the bat. Here are a few suggestions on how to comment on Hubs.These are merely suggestions and each Hubber should use their own discretion when commenting on Hubs. Responding to comments on a Hub is very simple Most people on HubPages are busy and do not have all day to write lengthy responses to each comment, but here are a few ways you can try to make anyone feel left out. 1. Write a paragraph highlighting all the interesting points made in the comments.  Note where you agree or disagree with certain points and why.  If possible, try to thank everyone for taking the time to read and comment.  You do not have to say thank you, but I find I enjoy saying it.  I have always liked the sound of the words please and thank you, and it convey gratitude to your readers.  After all, people did not have to stop and read your hub, but if they took the time to read and respond it is good to acknowledge this. 2. Write a large comment with an individual response to each commenter.  This would look similar to a script: John, Very interesting point about the Stock Exchange. Marie, So you worked at the Stock Exchange, I am sure that time you fainted was quite interesting.  I would not want to faint in front of that many people. David, I am not really that interested in the Stock Exchange, but I wrote this hub because my husband suggested I should try something different. The replies to comments above are made-up, but it gives you an idea of how responding to each person in one comment does not have to be very elaborate. 3. Some Hubbers have even suggested to wait a few days and write a general response to all those who have commented.  This may be the best approach if you do not come to HubPages and are crunched for time. 4. If you feel like it you can respond to each and every response on your Hub, as you are in charge of moderating the comments on your Hub.  Through out the day there are many people commenting on forums and publishing Hubs, so making a few individual comments on a Hub is not going to take up that much Hubtivity.  However, if you have sixty-seven comments in an hour you might not want to respond to each one individually, but that is up to you.  It is all about the time each individual Hubber wants to take for responding to comments.  I have noticed responding to comments can be time consuming if you are away for a few hours or a day, so take your time and do not worry about responding to everyone right away.  It is a personal choice and entirely up to you as the Hubber. All of the above ways of replying to comments on your Hubs are merely suggestions at it is ultimately up to the Hubber to moderate his or her own comments. When writing Hubs it is a given not everyone is going to agree with your point of view, so the best way to respond to Hubbers who disagree is to kindly explain your world view. 1. Detail your position and highlight the points that have inclined you to take this point of view. 2. Kindly reply to those who disagree with you, but do not feel you have to demean your own point of view.  The beautiful thing about HubPages is people disagree every day, but it is nothing personal because you can disagree with someone and still like them and there Hubs.  I know several Hubbers that have completely different political views than myself, but they are wonderful people an I am able to see where they are coming from.  Likewise I respect their views and they respect mine, so at the end of the day if someone disagrees with me I am not going to sweet heat.  I am a strong person with high self-esteem and I know my own mind so well, so I the best thing I can do is explain my position to those who question me.  You can kindly disagree with someone while standing your ground and not conceding your point.  Stand your ground and do so respectively, but firmly let people know where you stand.  Never feel like you have to be a doormat just because someone disagrees with you. I have learned from past experience not to delete other people's comments. This of course is entirely up to you, but try not to delete a person's comment as it hurts their feeling and sends and message you did not appreciate their thoughts on this issue. Of course this is entirely up to you, but 99% of the time it is not necessary to delete some one's comments. The few times I would consider deleting some one's comment is if: 1. If the comment is spammy with a link promoting their business or website. 2. If they write a comment making blatant personal attacks. 3. If they talk about lewd acts that really have nothing to do with the topic of the Hub. Once again it is up to you, but use your own discretion and try not to delete comments on your Hubs. It is better to try to respond to a comment and respectfully let people know where you stand. Biil on July 29, 2019: Great points! Susan Hazelton from Northern New York on November 12, 2018: Great suggesting and advice.  When I first started writing on HubPages I was at a loss as to how to reply and comment.  This would have been a wonderful help back then. Joel Lantz from Cincinnati, Ohio suburb on March 16, 2017: Thanks. I just posted my first Hub, and the first (and only) comment thus far showed that the author ignored and blew off solid evidence for a point I was making. Sort of ""I've made up my mind. Don't confuse me with facts!"" Frustrating. I'm inclined NOT to delete this comment — albeit to respond to it. Your advice generally to avoid deleting comments reinforces that consideration. SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on July 15, 2011: Lavendar, All you have to do is go to a hub you wrote, and write a comment back to those who replied. lavender3957 on July 15, 2011: I tried to comment back but can't figure it out. Help. SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on September 30, 2009: Glad I could give you some ideas heysmarty.  I love your name, and I can imagine your toucan in the picture saying this! heysmarty0 on September 29, 2009: These tips are really really helpful for me as I was not sure what to do with the comments.  Thanks SweetiePie for this great hub. SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on February 25, 2009: LondonGirl, I am glad you have not had to delete comments.  I have had to on a few occasions because I had some dillies. LondonGirl from London on February 24, 2009: great hub - and I agree with you. I've never had to delete a comment on my hubs, hope that continues! SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on February 24, 2009: Thanks for reading and commenting Benson and Proud Mom. Proud Mom from USA on February 24, 2009: Great hub, Sweetie Pie!  I appreciate the tips! Benson Yeung from Hong Kong on February 24, 2009: Great suggestions. Thanks for sharing. Clive Fagan from South Africa on October 25, 2008: I think most hubbers are reasonable rational people. Excess profanity is in any event against the Hubpages code. SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 24, 2008: That is a good tactic MrMarmalade.  If someone uses excessively profane language I can see deleting that as that is just bizarre.  One guy came to one of my hubs and asked if anyone one wanted to hook up with him using the f word, so I did delete that. Weblog, Your hub about that movie was very interesting.  The edits made it very good, did not realize it was older. MrMarmalade from Sydney on October 24, 2008: I subscribe to the onus of if you comment on one of my hubs, I should accept responsibility of at least saying thank you. Some times I will say more, as the hub reflects my thinking. I have deleted one hub from a non registered three headed personality. It was full of blasphemy. I did not need it or feel it was pertaining to the hub. weblog from 1India on October 24, 2008: Hi SweetiePie, Thanks for the comments in my old hub that was published 6 months back, I think you got it from hubtivity as I was editing the hub for fixing broken links. June Campbell from North Vancouver on October 24, 2008: Thanks for this hub. You cover some excellent points. I try to respond to most comments. I would never delete a comment until it was clearly inappropriate, vulgar or hateful. SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 24, 2008: I think most people here agree with freedom of speech sixtyorso.  Thanks for pointing this out :). Clive Fagan from South Africa on October 24, 2008: Hear Hear Sweetie Pie! SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 24, 2008: Jerrico, That is your right as the moderator of your hub.  To me etiquette is important because I am not going to say something overly insulting to someone.  Everyone has a different defintion of ridiculous, so who am I to judge if their comment is ridiculous?  I believe in freedom of speech, and so long as someone is not attacking hubbers I will allow all comments.  It has nothing to do with being the cool kids in high school, it has to do with keeping the Internet open to free speech. Jerrico Usher from Bend, Oregon on October 24, 2008: Are you guys serious? MY methodology is this. I put the comments box there to get feedback on the hub. I'm not responcible for responding, and if I don't like your comment or your comment is rediculous I will delete it in a second. I am not by any means going to let anyone tell me what comments I can and cannot delete or approve. The hub is my webproperty and I have the right to do as I please with it. Alot of people are just too darn sensitive in this area. I respond to a comment if I have something to say, not because I feel some responcibility to respond. I had a battle with a certain hubber awhile back who got upset because I deleted his insulting comments. I was writing a hub about a book I wanted to write about hubpages and he selfishly thought that I was being rediculous to even think of such a thing because I wanted to sell it, he wrote a bunch of ignorant crap about how I was scamming the public blah blah.. this guy truly had no clue, so was I going to let his ignorance taint my hub? make my hub readers listen to his banter? no frikken way... If a bunch of people got into the forum to discuss &quot;comment edicate&quot; or big brother laws for comment boxes then I think your really wasting your time. My philosophy is if you don't want me to delete your comments then don't leave rediculous comments. I have no problem with someone having an opinion, but when you outright call them names and make rediculous accusations you cross the line. I think its rediculous to not delete a comment simply out of fear of being judged or whiplashed in the forum, what are we in high school and the cool kids won't like us? give me a break! SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 23, 2008: I see what you are saying Marisa :). By the way your blogs must have quite a great following because very few subscribe to mine.  I have to admit I like interacting with people on HubPages, especially after the lack of communication on Squidoo, blogger, and other sites. Kate Swanson from Sydney on October 23, 2008: Hi Sweetiepie - there's a good example, I happened to notice on Hubtivity that you had replied so I thought I'd check it out.  Of course I'm not saying that Hubbers shouldn't engage in dialogue if they want to.  Veronica (one of my favourite Hubbers) often engages in quite long dialogues on her Hubs. I just wanted to point out that the comment system isn't really designed for interaction, so people shouldn't feel it's something they have to do. SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 23, 2008: First off let me stress that the main point of this hub is that moderating comments it up to the hubber.  I am not here at HubPages to socially network with a large group of people, but I do enjoy responding to comments as there are a few hubbers with whom I do have an ongoing dialogue.  If I take the time to respond to a comment I am leaving it open for some to come back, thus it is a great way of expressing gratitude and this makes me feel good.  Some of us hubbers talk on email or the hubs, but this is our recreation and really does not hurt anyone, does it? By the way, I have hubs that receive a great deal of search engine traffic and never receive many comments.  It just depends on the hub. Thanks for sharing your interesting observations on this issue. Kate Swanson from Sydney on October 23, 2008: I find your attitude to comments interesting.  If you were talking about comments on a blog, I'd agree with you 100%, because the commenter may well have subscribed to your RSS feed and will be notified if you reply to their comment.  However on HubPages, the commenter wil never know if you've replied - unless they happen to notice it come up on Hubtivity ,or they are interested enough in the subject to keep checking back. When I make a comment on someone's Hub, I rarely expect a comment from the author in return.  But then I write my Hubs to attract general readers rather than as a means of social networking. SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 23, 2008: C.S. Alexis, I try to think about others because I was taught to do so as a child.  However, I think part of it is just innate because I worry a lot about other people, and often I do not like to see people in pain.  Also, I have always regarded you as a very kind person because you were one of the first people to leave fanmail telling me how you enjoyed art as I do, so I have always been interested in your hubs ever since that day.  I always liked your skin e chicken series and admired how many different techniques you have explored with woodburning, and I was upset to hear your art studio was destroyed by the flood.  I just thought if the same thing happened to me I would be very upset too, so I thought about it after that.  Thanks for stopping by and commenting as always. Anna Marie Bowman, I agree sometimes it is hard to decide whether to keep or delete a comment, I just decided the former is easier for me.  If it is too overwhelming to answer a slew of comments on one hub you can always leave them for someone else to answer.  That way the commenters are interacting with each other, which I always find amusing.  Of course that is up to the individual hubber and each person is in charge of moderating their own hubs.  Thanks for commenting and sharing. Anna Marie Bowman from Florida on October 23, 2008: Excellent tips!!!  I have had to decide what to do about comments a few times, should I delete this?  How do I answer all of these comments?  That sort of thing.  Thank you for this!  I am sure it will help a lot of people out! C.S.Alexis from NW Indiana on October 23, 2008: SweetiePie, I am not anywhere near together after the flood but, it is good to have HubPages as a diversion and outlet. I see where you get your name and live up to it! C.S. SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 23, 2008: Dorsi, I think you have been more than responsive to us fellow hubbers by including us in your tribute hubs.  I also like how you get back to people that ask specific questions, which shows you care about what they are thinking.  I like it when people interact with me and answer my questions on their hubs, although I understand when people are too busy to do this. Dorsi Diaz from The San Francisco Bay Area on October 23, 2008: Great hub Sweetie Pie- I don't respond to all comments but I pop in to say thank-you and respond as I have time- and if my comments don't get responded to I don't get hurt because I know people are busy sometimes. If someone asks me a specific question however I always try to respond to it. Great hub with great tips! SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 22, 2008: Countrywoman, I think it is good you go to the dedication of responding to peoples comments.  Also, keeping an open mind and being informed is the best way to learn new things, so HubPages is a good forum for that.  I think you know more than you think also. countrywomen from Washington, USA on October 22, 2008: Very informative hub. I do agree as far as possible not to delete somebody's comment. Sometimes when people don't respond within a day of my comments I forget to keep a track of the comment I made and the reply. I usually use a lot of tools in office for reminders. But hubpages should have some sort of tagging for certain comments we make on other hubs like the one we have when someone comments on our hub. I love hubpages for the serious writing I get to read (and some in a funny style).My own general awareness isn't strong (my bro always keeps reminding me of that..)hehe SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 22, 2008: Sally, I also love how HubPages is tailored to the social needs of an introvert.  I love my job at the library and working with the public to help them find books and research materials, but at the end of the day I am not such a social gal.  When I come home I enjoy reading books, doing arts and crafts, and hanging out on HubPages where I can still interact with people, minus the club scene.  I am really addicted to HubPages for this reason. Sherri from Southeastern Pennsylvania on October 22, 2008: Ananta and SweetiePie, thank you for the kind words.  To me, a Hub is the opening of a conversation; it's not just a monologue.  I often find I learn as much from reading comments as I do from reading a Hub, and I also find that my understanding of my own Hub topics is often enriched by the contributions of others.  In this way, HubPages is a kind of internet coffee house, where people of different viewpoints can gather to share views and enjoy the ambience, and there are even bouncers here when someone gets too far out of hand! SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 22, 2008: Very true Ananta. Ananta65 on October 22, 2008: Not only do good comments build relationships, they also add quality to a hub and you are a good example of the latter, Sally&rsquo;s Trove. SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 21, 2008: Thanks for stopping by and saying so Sally.  More and more with what is going on in America I certainly would not want to censor someone's comment, even if it were slightly almost attacking.  Ananta made a good point earlier about how a person's comment says more about them than you, so if someone does leave you an attacking comment that reflects upon their behavior and not yours.  Plus I think we all tend to disagree at some time, so it is interesting to see what each person has to say. Sherri from Southeastern Pennsylvania on October 21, 2008: SweetiePie, this is a great Hub.  I've been thinking for a long time about the value of comments to a Hub, and about how those comments, and the responses to them, build or demolish online relationships.  I think this subject is ripe for many, many Hubs and many points of view. I agree with you so strongly that if a person has taken the time to read and comment, and the comment is not spam or vitriolic attack, or profanity, then the person deserves the courtesty of a thank you. Thumbs up! SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 21, 2008: Thanks Trsmd. Trsmd from India on October 21, 2008: sweetiepie, you have provided good tips on how to comment/how to reply for comments.. SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 21, 2008: Why thank you terenceyap07.  I always try to be kind and thoughtful towards others, and I am glad this shows in my writing.  You are also a thoughtful and insightful person, so thank you for saying these kind words. terenceyap07 from Singapore on October 21, 2008: Hi SweetiePie, If more people were like you, this world would indeed be a happy and peaceful one, my friend. Your advice shows much forethought and wisdom. It is articles like these from which I draw much encouragement. *smiles* SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 21, 2008: By and large there is almost never a need to delete a Hubber's comment.  Thanks for stopping by multimastery. multimastery on October 20, 2008: Nice Hub SweetiePie!  Commenting on hubs definitely should not be OVERstressed.  It is a courtesy to respond on hub comments as much as the writer's time permits.  No one should start pulling out their hair to get it done because it is not a requirement, but rather ~ A Courtesy - An Option - And a form of Enjoyment!  Yes Commenting on hubs should be enjoyable and honorable because it shows that a writer is gaining interest.  And that's what it's all about!-)  Some people may not agree with the writer's point-of-view, but I feel that if the commenter is not spammy or rude, then I definitely wouldn't delete their comment. SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 20, 2008: Dottie1, I am glad the simple misunderstanding was resolved in the end.  Kudos to your for taking the intiative to  smooth over the misunderstanding. Dottie1 from MA, USA on October 20, 2008: I not to long ago had a comment on one of my hubs that said ""Jeez Thanks"".  That told me the person was not happy with my comment so I went back to reevaluate what I said.  I completely understood the way that person must have felt especially not knowing my Boston slang.  It got in my way!   I deleted the comments and emailed the person apologizing and explaining.  I asked if we could start over!  Within hours I received back a very nice reply and a new comment that we were both happy with.  Thank you for this hub SweetiePie! SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 20, 2008: Richard, I remember that I accidentally misread your first hub, so I do see what you mean about being prepared for various comments.  Yes as Hubbers we must grow a thicker skin and be ready to respond to a myriad of comments.  It is always interesting to see how people interact and handle these discussions.  Thanks for sharing your views on this subject. Richard VanIngram from San Antonio, Texas on October 20, 2008: Great tips, Sweetie Pie. I will say: a great deal of what I write is political in nature, or in the field of philosophy, and often edges up on religion.  I am also inclined to satire or satirical commentary.  This ensures that, if there are responses, some of them will be from unhappy people, or from people who just don't quite get what I was up to (and the latter issue may be a failing of mine &amp; my writing style). That said, if one writes on topics such as I am driven to address, one grows a thick skin -- or had better, and quickly; and one learns how to counter-punch with good answers and explanations... or with wit &amp; a sharp tongue, depending on the tone of the person's post &amp; whether it appears it will be a waste of time talking with them and clarifying one's intentions. I think you have to be prepared with several different styles and approaches of response, depending on who your audience turns out to be. Constant Walker from Springfield, Oregon on October 20, 2008: You're welcome, and I totally agree. SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 20, 2008: Ananta65, Yes, it is better to try and not delete a comment because at least that way you can respond to it.  The person who disagreed with you may not change their point of view, but at least they might see where you are coming from.  Thanks reading and commenting Ananta :). VioletSun, Like you I enjoy exchanging comments and interacting with others on the Hubs.  In the past I never really enjoyed sites like MySpace and Facebook because if someone new added you to their friend's list, they never really had much to say to you or discuss.  Here at HubPages we write about many issues that sometimes cause quite a stir, but it is fun to see everyone' take on the issue.  Now I just use Facebook and Myspace to blog about my Hubs, which brings a tiny bit of traffic.  I appreciate your comments :). Shadesbreath, I would love to see you write a Hub about this.  It was be very entertaining as usual.  Thanks for stopping by. sixtyorso, Yes the overly promotional ones and the abusive ones do ruin it for the rest of us :).  However, I thought it was great how many Hubbers stepped up to the plate and positively turned around one thread right when it was about to take a very nasty turn.  Thanks for comment sixtyor as always :). Constant Walker, HubPages is a little bit of an addiction to me, so I get excited when I log on and can respond to comments.  It is always fun to read what some of you very witty Hubbers will write, so it is a pleasure for me.  Even if I get a comment that does not agree with me, I am not surprised as I have taken a stance on many topics from time to time.  Actually I am surprised I did not have more McCain supporters come and lambast me for supporting Barack Obama, but maybe that is just because they never found those Hubs LOL.  In my humble opinion I do believe it is important to acknowledge people who comment on your Hubs because that ups to opportunity of retaining reader loyalty.  Your bounce rate will go up if you just delete comments and never respond, but to each his own.  If someone deletes my comment I am not going to lose sleep over it, but I would have liked an explanation as opposed to just seeing them shoot from the hip.  Thanks for commenting Constant :).  Constant Walker from Springfield, Oregon on October 20, 2008: Good subject, Sweetie.  I always try to respond in print as if I were talking (and joking and being a smart-ass) to the person in person.  I think that comes through - that's my theory, anyway.  I like when there's a comment that disagrees with or challenges something I've written, that's where the opportunity for discussion comes in. I like that you said to first thank them for reading.  That is, after all, what we want, right? Clive Fagan from South Africa on October 20, 2008: Hi SweetiePie. as I always say comments enhance a hub and often extend the subject. However people who are abusive or overly self promoting kind of spoil it for everyone. I don't mind people who ask you to read a hub, relative to the subject at hand. I have never deleted a comment as far as I can recall. It is all grist to the mill. Basically, though, I pretty much, in principle, agree with you. Great and timely hub specially in view of the flameout in one of the the forums recently. Shadesbreath from California on October 20, 2008: I think that anyone who disagrees with anyone's opinions should be blasted by vitriolic acidic speak and, in the name of righteousness or some sort of spastic unreasonable logic, be made to look stupid in any way possible within the language permissible by religious or hubpage rules. Courteous respect for disagreement is anathema to a good socialistic democracy. VioletSun from Oregon/ Name: Marie on October 20, 2008: Good tips, SweetiePie!  I personally enjoy the comment exchanges in my hubs and that of others,  this is what makes hubpages such an interesting community of writers. Ananta65 on October 19, 2008: t.keeley: any comment says more about the person who leaves the comment than it says about you or your hub, in my opinion. I can relate to what you say, mind you. Especially when it comes to very personal topics, there are quite a few whacko&rsquo;s out there. Personally I only remove comments if they&rsquo;re spammy or completely besides the topic. In most cases I just leave them there. So basically I subscribe to what you say in this hub, SweetiePie :) SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 19, 2008: All my hubs get traffic now, but there are still a few that do not get traffic every day.  I have found now that I am blogging about each Hub that google seems to find these faster.  You should try blogging about some of your low traffic hub.  I am also now writing ehow articles about a certain aspect of a subject, such as jewelry making, and then I use my Hub as a backlink for more information.  I will see how it goes, but I like ehow more than I thought I would.  You should look at it. SirDent on October 19, 2008: I have hubs that have received no comments also. Some receive no traffic. It's just how it is. I like when my typos are exposed in comments also myself. SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 19, 2008: Why I appreciate you saying so.  I truly believe that it is up to the individual Hubber to moderate comments on their Hub and not delete comments when possible.  Besides that I think it is pretty simple to respond to comments on a Hub, people just need to write a Hub and eventually someone will comment.  Of course I have some Hubs that have never received comments, and those were on my favorite topics.  Oh well :). SirDent on October 19, 2008: Greast tips for comemnting on comments Sweetie. Glad you took the initiative and wrote this hub. SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 19, 2008: Weblog, Thanks as always for your comments.  Are you writing any more stories soon? G-Ma, Thanks for your kind words and I always appreciate you comments. Merle Ann Johnson from NW in the land of the Free on October 19, 2008: I agree with weblog...and even if you read a hub you don't have to comment...and you also don't have to reply...but if someone leaves a comment as you say you can just acknowdlege the fact with a simple Thank You...no more no less...Thank you for a good Hub my dear...G-Ma :o) hugs weblog from 1India on October 19, 2008: I saw that forum, I think you have written this hub in right time and very perfect as usual. Thumbs up, Sweetie! SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 19, 2008: t.keeley, I do see where you are coming from because some comments are completely offensive or wacky.  In the past people did not like it when I deleted their comments, although at the time it seemed as if they were questioning everything I said on my Hub.  I now try to give people the benefit of the doubt, from time to time I do approve some comments that are a little out of line.  I do my best to respond to these comments as I feel that is their point of view, but if someone makes a personal attack or spams my Hub I just delete their comment.  However, I respect your decision to delete odd comments on your Hubs because my thinking it is up to each individual Hubber to moderate. Tim from Philadelphia, PA on October 19, 2008: I'm leaning towards the idea that there is no true freedom of speech. If I find something offensive or useless to the discussion, I'll kindly not approve the comment. I don't hold it against people, but lately I've had some wacky comments here and there and somedays would rather just not have to deal with replying to them. Call is fascist, if you want, but it really is bothering me. Intelligence is not angry ranting or useless debate over something totally not related to the hub. SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 19, 2008: Just_Rodney, I agree, commenting on Hubs is a very sensitive and personal thing.  I think most Hubbers know exactly how they want to comment on their own Hubs, and I respect how ever someone responds to comments.  It is their hub after all. C.S. Alexis, I agree, people should comment on Hubs according to their time constraints and personal preferences.  We were discussing this issue in the forum, so I just thought it would be something interesting to write about.  My philosophy over all is if someone disagrees with me strongly on a Hub I will stand by position, but I will not back down and be a doormat either.  I enjoy seeing how different people respond to different comments on Hubs, which is part of the fun of Hubpages.  I try to almost never delete comments as I think this could hurt someone's feelings, and if it is not a personal attack or spam then why would I delete it?  It is interesting to see why they disagree with me, which I am sort of enjoying reading when people do.  I always appreciate your comments C.S. Alexis and I hope you are doing better after the flood. C.S.Alexis from NW Indiana on October 19, 2008: I do the comments according to individual hubs, individual comments and time factored in too. It just depends on the moment. I do not expect everyone to comment on my comments when I make one on their hubs. Being polite is very important no matter what. And as for deleting comments I have only done that one time because the comment had nothing to do with the hub. Interesting thing to hub about Sweetie. Keep them coming! C.S. Rodney Fagan from Johannesberg South Africa, The Gold Mine City on October 19, 2008: Great tips on a personal and sensitive issue for some. {;-0) SweetiePie (author) from Southern California, USA on October 19, 2008: Hi Hope and Ryan.  I agree with Ryan that even if we are busy we should take the time to communicate with those who visit our Hubs.  It really does not take that much more out of your day, but as I said this is just my preference.  Each Hubber needs to decide this for themselves. RyanRE from Bellingham, WA on October 19, 2008: While we are all busy, I think that online social networks thrive on the personal communication between posters and commenters. Hope Wilbanks from Virginia on October 19, 2008: Good tips! :)"
10,Going Viral: How I Got 5000 Hub Views in 24 Hours by Utilizing Facebook,community," It was an average winter day when I logged into Facebook to see what my friends and family were doing. While viewing my news feed, I saw picture after picture of brooms standing unassisted in kitchens, bathrooms, and on porches. There were straw brooms, angled brooms, one mop and a few Swiffer mops standing on end. One Facebooker even posted a photo of a vacuum. Many people were commenting in disappointment saying that they were unable to get their broom to stand upright on its own. I was curious as to why so many people were suddenly doing this and what made them think it was possible to get a broom to stand alone. After reading many posts and comments, I found that readers were claiming that the brooms were standing unassisted due to the planetary alignment of Venus, Jupiter, and the moon. Participants claimed that the alignment made changes to the Earth's gravitational pull which allowed the brooms to stand upright. Knowing what little I do about science, this theory did not make sense to me. I googled this phenomena. To my disappointment, there were no relevant articles explaining whether or not this phenomena was possible. At this point the light bulb in my mind went off and I decided to research the principles of astronomy and test the theory for myself. Upon reading Newton's standard principals of the laws of gravity, I discovered that a disturbance in the Earth's gravitational pull could not be caused by the alignment of planets in the Universe. The only heavenly body that has influence on Earth's gravitational pull (outside of an object such as a meteor) is the moon. Through further research, I learned that even the slightest change in Earth's gravity would cause much more than standing brooms. ******************************************************************************** Social sites such as Facebook and Twitter often experience sudden trends that spread from user to user. When spotting such a trend, it is important to act on it quickly. While you will want to take the time to write an outstanding article on the trendy subject, it is imperative to get your hub into the cyber realm as soon as possible to maximize views through reader interest. Sharing hubs on trends on social media sites increases views as readers share the article with their friends. Views on my hub ""Can Planetary Alignments Cause Brooms to Stand on Their Own"" break down as following per social media site: Google (all sources) 4243 Facebook 441 Digg 31 Ask.com 147 Pinterest 135 Stumble Upon 5 Hubpages (all sources) 57  www.Facebook.com www.Digg.com www.Redgage.com www.Pinterest.com www.StumbleUpon.com www.Delicious.com www.Twitter.com www.Reddit.com www.Google+.com www.Youtube.com Social media tools are easy to use and great for getting traffic to hubs on Hubpages. This hub was shared on the included social media sites. Interestingly enough, this hub has not been viewed on Reddit or Twitter. Hubpages on trends may have a short shelf life and may not always be considered ""evergreen"" material. If capitalizing a trend on Facebook or other site, consider writing the hub where it may have an evergreen quality. In this case, people may not often google ""standing brooms"" but will do so in instances of planetary alignments which is included in the title. Even if you don't spot a trend on Facebook or any other media site, it is possible to start a trend of your own. If you have a trendy hub idea that would make your friends curious, share it on Facebook and ask your friends to share to it. Sharing leads to more views and bigger hub successes for you. Wilma Henry from Kentucky on May 04, 2021: Thanks for the informative article. I need all the help I can get. P-Sreelakshmi on June 09, 2020: Thanks for sharing this! Rich E Cunningham from Ontario, Canada on May 21, 2020: I can't believe people actually believe that, its troubling Gail Meyers from Johnson County, Kansas on December 23, 2019: That's a cute story about the brooms. These are some great resources. We have used Facebook and YouTube, but our biggest problem has been hackers hijacking our accounts, hacking off the like and share buttons, switching out the photos, and even manipulating circulation, etc. This has gone on relentlessly for nearly a decade now. I was even redirected from my own Blogger blog, and another one just disappeared. It is very frustrating to work on something for years just to have cyberstalking thieves scrape it, then hack the originals. Jacobb9205 on April 27, 2015: tammyswallow, Yes, I agree, I used to use a different account, but then I decided I wanted a fresh start after stopping writing for about a year. Views were definitely better back then! Yes, Facebook is a great social platform to get more views for sure! I also get many views from Pinterest, but my main views are from HubPages which is annoying, I only get around 10-20 views a day even with my 34 hubs! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on April 26, 2015: Hi Jacobb! Views were much better a few years ago. The Google Panda updates have basically stopped all Google traffic to Hubpages which are basically regarded as spam. My success came from getting lots of views on Facebook because of people sharing information. Now, the main source of my views is Pinterest. If you can find a niche there you should be fine. Hope that helps. Jacobb9205 on April 21, 2015: Great quick idea! 5000 views in 1 day is astonishing! I barely get any views from google maybe 1 a day? I average about 10-20 views a day, but the majority of my views are from hubpages itself, I have utilized my keywords, etc. So I'm confused. Willette from Michigan on March 05, 2013: That's awesome. Great tips on trends. Thanks for sharing. Thumbs up and a share Tammy (author) from North Carolina on January 21, 2013: Thanks so much maggs. I appreciate you stopping by! maggs224 from Sunny Spain on January 21, 2013: A very interesting hub Tammy, congratulations on going viral, and thank you for sharing this :D Voting up and hitting relevant buttons on my way out :D Michele Travis from U.S.A.   Ohio on November 26, 2012: Thank you for writing this hub.  5,000 in one day!  Wow that is amazing.  None of mine have ever gone viral, but I will try. Voted up:) Tammy (author) from North Carolina on November 25, 2012: Thanks for sharing your success HoneyBB. Sounds like you had some big success with StumbleUpon. Those are great numbers and views will continue as people share your work. Awesome! H Lax on November 24, 2012: I read this and went and tried it myself by signing up for StumbleUpon. I added about 7 or 8 of my hubs as a page on my profile and within an hour I had almost 100 hits to those hubs; although, only about 45 hits show up as coming through StumbleUpon, I'm not sure where the others show up but I think they must have inadvertently come through StumbleUpon because my numbers were stagnant for hours before this. However, after that initial hour, I have only had a few hits from StumbleUpon within the past approximately 24 hours. Thanks for the tips. 100 hits still beats no hits. Voted +++ Tammy (author) from North Carolina on November 23, 2012: Thanks so much for reading Missy Mac. Missy Mac from Illinois on November 23, 2012: Great hub!  I hope to have similar success.  Thanks for sharing. ChrisStyles from USA on November 23, 2012: Very cool.  I've never had a hubpages page go viral in any way,  but I have had a regular blog post go semi viral on Facebook and that was a fun experience,  though it was totally luck for me. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on November 22, 2012: I have tried but nothing has been as sucessful as this one. It was just luck and timing. :) Megan Garcia from Florida on November 22, 2012: Have you tried duplicating this with other Facebook trends? Tammy (author) from North Carolina on October 16, 2012: Thanks dwachira! Danson Wachira from Nairobi, Kenya on October 16, 2012: Hi tammyswallow, Wow that was amazing! FB is a robust platform and can be very beneficial if one has a large followers. I agree writing on trending topics of the moment can massively increase traffic. Voted up. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on October 02, 2012: Thanks so much for your kind comment healthylife! healthylife2 on October 02, 2012: So impressive! Don't think I would ever have come up with an idea like that in a million years but looking for trends is such a great idea. I can hope one of my hubs go viral. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on September 21, 2012: Thanks so much Kerry43. Your kind comment is appreciated. Kerry43 on September 20, 2012: Hi there! I think this is an awesome idea - capitalizing on social media trends, but what I do think is even better is crafting this article describing the other, and its outcome. What a wonderful idea! Congratulations:) Kerry Jesshubpages on August 15, 2012: interesting! Audrey Howitt from California on July 28, 2012: Wow again!  I am always wondering if I should do more work with social media and it seems the answer is yes! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on July 18, 2012: Thanks for commenting mollymeadows. This seems to be a small part. Whoever does discover the secret is going to make it big. :) Mary Strain from The Shire on July 18, 2012: It's always a mystery to me what causes traffic; it seems to be feast or famine. Thank you for shedding a little light on my darkness, lol! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on July 11, 2012: I appreciate that Magdelene! Magdelene from Okotoks on July 11, 2012: I've never really used Facebook as a method of promotion for my Hubs, now that I've read your article I will have to try out the latest trending events and see how it goes. You make it seem both challenging and fun and that's what it's all about. Great Hub! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on July 10, 2012: Great ideas talfonso. I try not to share too many on Facebook. My friends and family would probably block me (unless I spammed them with cat pictures). You can still use Facebook to spot new trends. Thanks so much for your thoughtful comment. talfonso from Tampa Bay, FL on July 10, 2012: I don't promote my own Hubs on Facebook that much anymore (well, actually I do it when the time comes, like one bookmark every few days or weeks for a new Hub). I'd like to get more Hub views naturally by commenting and promoting others' Hubs. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on July 09, 2012: Thank you Dtutchess O'Blunt and Donnah75! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on July 09, 2012: Congratulations cabmgmnt! Makes you wish all hubs would perform so well. That is awesome! Donna Hilbrandt from Upstate New York on July 09, 2012: Great idea.  Thanks for sharing. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on July 09, 2012: Me to Mary615. I have to put myself on a Facebook schedule so I don't spend to much time on it. All those cats! Good luck with the broom and let me know how it goes! Thanks for your visit. Duchess OBlunt on July 09, 2012: Sounds like fun!  Which I had the time to do something like that.  Maybe I can push my retirement up a few years . . . Enjoyed the read, it will likely stick with me because it was so interesting. Corey from Northfield, MA on July 09, 2012: I never thought it would happen to me but I checked my stats this morning and I had a hub hit 5000 views from one day and it is all thanks to Facebook. Interesting what people find  entertaining. I hope i can jump on the band wagon and get more to launch this way! Mary Hyatt from Florida on July 09, 2012: The problem I have with FB is when I get on, I can't get off, and I waste too much time.  I just get drawn into it. As soon as I take a break here, I'm going to check out my broom.  I'll just bet it won't stand up!~ Great Hub, I voted it UP, and will share, too. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on June 25, 2012: Thanks for reading joanveronica. I agree, FB and Twitter aren't always the best ways to spend an after noon. I try not to overshare and bore my friends and relatives. I appreciate your visit and kind comment. Joan Veronica Robertson from Concepcion, Chile on June 25, 2012: Good information, voted up, useful and interesting! I will have to study trends more carefully, I'm sorry to say I find FB and Twitter a bit of a chore. Must be getting old! Congratulations on the idea and on sharing this idea with us. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on June 25, 2012: Thanks chaturranjneesh. I sure hope you aren't suffering with writer's block! Thanks for stopping by. Rajneesh Chaturvedi from India on June 25, 2012: This is really innovative idea to cope up with writer's block. Voting it up!! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on June 25, 2012: Thanks jlava73! I appreciate the comment. Jennifer Vasconcelos from Cyberspace and My Own World on June 25, 2012: Turning a trend into a useful Hub. Very innovative! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on June 25, 2012: Thanks so much CloudExplorer. I have learned such things from friends like you. This was pretty much an experiment. When I saw so many photos going up I wanted to learn more and there were no internet articles at all on the subject. It just made sense and I got lucky. Thank you so much for your kind and thoughtful comment. It is always great to see you. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on June 25, 2012: Good for you divacratus. Timing and a little luck are essential. My traffic has died down on this hub too. I am hoping it will pick up again during the next eclipse. I appreciate you sharing your story. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on June 25, 2012: Thanks for reading and sharing Gypsy Rose Lee. I appreciate your visit. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on June 25, 2012: Thanks WhydThatHappen! :) Mike Pugh from New York City on June 25, 2012: Now this hub is definitely defying the gravitational fields of a static non upward moving hub, I can sense you've gotten a complete hold and grasp of your social bearings, and azimuth motor drive systems, as well as your GPS, LOL. If you Google those last lines you may also find some evergreen content to look up, and I'm a tech geek so you know the deal with me, hehe. The funny thing is that, for something technical in nature to go viral it must have a social element involved today, or else all systems are a no go for sure (social media topics are a gold mine today for sure). I tend to experiment with differing techniques with each hub I publish as well, and I've noticed some cool trends in my stats as well, but nothing like this viral action in a 24 hours period you've personally been responsible for, wow is all I can say to your skills of observation Gypsy. You are a genuine motivated person, who goes the extra mile to take your skills to the next level. I commend you on writing such a powerful hub here, and I will take much of this as an additional add to my arsenal here of mental tools as a writer and web editor on hubpages and even outside of this network, and mainly becasue I'm also a web developer who definitely need such fine tuned info to help in my efforts. Voted up and you know the rest, Pinned, facebooked, twitted, and shared amongst friends here on hubpages, and G+'ed as well even though there is no longer a g+ button any more, lets hope we get it back soon. Kalpana Iyer from India on June 25, 2012: If you are writing a hub based on a popular topic trending on social media sites, there's a high chance of your hub going viral. I wrote one on Sachin Tendulkar after a World Cup (cricket) win and it reported a nice number of hits per day. People were so enthusiastic about reading the whole thing. Now it has died down but till date I haven't experienced that kind of traffic for any of my other hubs.  It is very essential to keep an eye on what people are talking about but like you said it's also very important to get the page live as soon as possible. That's where I become lazy. I take my own sweet time.. Gypsy Rose Lee from Daytona Beach, Florida on June 25, 2012: Voted up and interesting. Thanks for this informative hub Tammy. Passing it on among my followers. WhydThatHappen on June 24, 2012: This is some great advice that I will put to use. Thanks and sharing maheshpatwal from MUMBAI on June 24, 2012: Great source of information on social bookmarking. Bookmarking of hubs on facebooking can be so much beneficial for the page views never expected it. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on May 05, 2012: Thanks so much for reading and commenting Pamela99. Reddit can be pretty rough if you are not a 20 something. Pamela Oglesby from Sunny Florida on May 05, 2012: After such a large number of comments there is nothing unique to say, except obviously you are doing things right to maximize profit. I post on Reddit too but don't find it particularly helpful. Thanks for the information. Great hub. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on May 01, 2012: Thanks CookwareBliss. I was surprised also, especially when I put so much into other hubs that didn't qet half the views. It is all about timing and LUCK. I appreciate your visit and comment. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on May 01, 2012: Thanks for sharing that Barbergirl28. Facebook has been a great tool. It helps things spread quickly. I appreciate your visit! CookwareBliss from Winneconne, WI on April 30, 2012: tammyswallow- this is a great achievement for you! I have to admit I was shocked that you got that many views from one hub, motivates me to write captive hubs:) Thanks for SHARING! Stacy Harris from Hemet, Ca on April 30, 2012: You got to love using facebook and other social media trends. When I first started writing I didn't really use facebook to share my hubs. I am not sure if it was fear to show what I was doing or what. Now things have completely changed as my friends have doubled... and they are all hubbers. Now I share with ease! Great hub and great tip - I never thought of looking at trends on facebook! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on April 12, 2012: Thanks so much for sharing these sites El Ray. I have never heard of Trendfetch. That could be very helpful and a great way to get new ideas. I appreciate the read and the comment. El Ray on April 12, 2012: Very good article on leveraging topics that are trending on social media sites! I do my best to stick to evergreen topics, but in the past I've used Google Trends: http://www.google.com/trends/, Yahoo! Buzz Index: http://buzzlog.yahoo.com/overall/, and Trendfetch.com: http://www.trendfetch.com/ to find hot topics to create content on. Voted this article Up + Useful! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on April 06, 2012: Thanks for reading and commenting jaswinder64! jaswinder64 from Toronto, Canada. on April 06, 2012: Wonderful article about your experiences with this hub. Congratulations for this. Rajan Singh Jolly from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on April 06, 2012: Tammy, I wonder how I missed this interesting hub of yours. To catch a current trend and make it into an article at that very moment is very vital to make an article go viral, apart from other ways that a write up could go viral. Thanks for sharing this  wonderful tip. Voted up, awesome, interesting and shared. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on April 04, 2012: I am so glad Spirit Whisperer! I appreciate your kind comment. Xavier Nathan from Isle of Man on April 04, 2012: Very clever and well done for spotting the dynamic. You have made me think and the creative flow has been awakened by this great hub. Thank you. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on April 03, 2012: Thanks for letting me know HB.. I missed this one. That makes three. I will report it as well. Thanks for keeping an eye out for these. I wouldn't have known about this theft if it weren't for you! Cindy Murdoch from Texas on April 03, 2012: This hub has been copied: http://education.bigezine.com/going-viral-how-i-go... -Cindy Tammy (author) from North Carolina on March 26, 2012: That is such a kind thing for you to say William Gerace. Thanks so much. I look forward to reading your hubs as well. William Gerace from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on March 26, 2012: Tammy you are an inspiration to me for sure. I joined about 4 months ago as well and see you are doing fabulous that is awesome. I am definitely following you young lady. I don't think I've ever had 5000 views on anything. But I will definitely your other Hubs. Great job. You go Tammy!! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on March 25, 2012: Thanks for reading and commenting AnnaCia! :) AnnaCia on March 25, 2012: Very interesting article and clever tips.  Thank you for sharing. voted up Tammy (author) from North Carolina on March 23, 2012: LOL Thilanwij! Thanks for reading and commenting. thilanwij from California on March 23, 2012: Time to hit all the trending topics! *Goes on Twitter* Tammy (author) from North Carolina on March 22, 2012: Thanks for your visit AEvans. Today is the last day of the planetary alignment. Anything after March 22nd is pure coincidence. Thanks for your kind comment! Julianna from SomeWhere Out There on March 22, 2012: Wow! What an interesting article. I honestly have written several hubs that were trending and now they have many views. Broomsticks standing on their own? lolo! I probably would have grabbed mine to see if it was really happening, in fact maybe I will. Thumbs up! :) Tammy (author) from North Carolina on March 22, 2012: Thank you molometer! I appreciate the share. :) Micheal from United Kingdom on March 22, 2012: Great work Tammy, way to go girl! I love the way you translated the trend into a hub and pronto, and the fact that it does have legs, in terms of planetary alignment searches. Well done. Guess what? dropping this into Facebook too. Voted up, awesome, interesting and useful. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on March 21, 2012: Hi Lilleyth, Yes, I have also heard of people trying to balance eggs. I tried to do that for this experiment but there was no way I could get an egg to stand.. at all. I wonder if they tried to boil them first or something. I didn't want to risk one hitting the floor.. LOL. Have you tried it? Suzanne Sheffield from Mid-Atlantic on March 21, 2012: Have you heard about eggs standing on end during a spring equinox? Tammy (author) from North Carolina on March 21, 2012: I think most brooms will stand up normally. We just never try it under normal circumstances. You are too kind. Thank you so much for reading and commenting! Audrey Hunt from Pahrump NV on March 21, 2012: Hi tammy - Years ago I used my broom to do some sweeping and when I finished I went to lean it against the wall and that broom stood straight up the second I let go of it. I didn't think it was anything special back then, but I do now. So, what have I learned from this hub of yours? Well, first of all find or start a trend, write a hub about it and get it out there pronto! And second of all, that you are a fabulous writer and I should read every hub you've written! Xenza Caladwell from Newberry on March 20, 2012: hope you do Xenza Caladwell from Newberry on March 20, 2012: you is welcome Tammy (author) from North Carolina on March 20, 2012: Thanks Xenza Caladwell. Xenza Caladwell from Newberry on March 20, 2012: Love facebook that is what I be on all day long like OMG....... Tammy (author) from North Carolina on March 18, 2012: Thanks for reading and commenting Londonlady! Deya Writes on March 18, 2012: There are so many ways facebook can be utilized for marketing. Great hub! Voted up Tammy (author) from North Carolina on March 18, 2012: You are too kind Sadie14. Anytime! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on March 18, 2012: Thank you for your kind words Hub Tub. I wish the very best to you as well. Sadie from U.S. on March 18, 2012: Thank you for your response Tammy! I really admire your work on here and appreciate you sharing. HubTub on March 18, 2012: Congratulations on a hub well done and a fascinating read.  Hope your traffic continues to flow like the wind!  Kudos, up, and SHARING! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on March 18, 2012: Thanks RealHousewife. It really does pay to learn about SEO and the not so fun stuff. I really had to force myself to do it. I am not a technical person either. Thanks for your kind comments and visit. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on March 18, 2012: Hi Sadie14, After the initial post there was massive traffic. As the week went on it tapered off. The actual alignment is March 22nd so I expect the traffic to end around that point and HOPEFULLY pick up again for the next planetary alignment in December. Thanks for a great question. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on March 18, 2012: Thanks for sharing that thoughtforce! Best wishes to you as well. Kelly Umphenour from St. Louis, MO on March 18, 2012: Hey Tammy! I was out scouting ..so glad I didn't miss this one! You know I haven't been much into the SEO of things, keywords, but I have been trying to learn it.  This is a wealth of info for me.  I see a few links up there I am going to check out too! AWESOME! Sadie from U.S. on March 18, 2012: Hey Tammy I was just wondering if you are still seeing this kind of traffic a couple days after your initial post? Christina Lornemark from Sweden on March 18, 2012: Interesting article Tammy! I saw some posts about brooms too and I didn't understand what they where talking about. You are so clever to write a hub about it and you must also have been very fast! I am so glad to hear about the success you had and it tells me that I should use Facebook more. Sometimes I think I waste my time on Facebook, but I guess I am not using it as I should! Best wishes to you, Tina iphone-5-release from NY/HK on March 17, 2012: Going viral is probably one of the coolest things in this age of technology. I have had a couple facebook pages go viral and overnight 100,000 of fans liking the page. If this had happened to my hub I would be very happy. Everyone needs to have something go viral its a joy!"
11,Increase Your Traffic - How to Add Your Hubpages Sitemap to Google Webmaster Tools?,community," Adding a sitemap to Hubpages Novel Treasure Please note this feature is only available to hubbers who have at least 10 published and approved hubs. There have been so many forum postings and questions about Webmaster tools and whether or not you can add a sitemap to hubpages. There have been many incorrect statements too. It may have been true that at one time you could not do a sitemap for hubpages on Google Webmaster tools, but the statement is not true today. You can add/create a sitemap for your hubpages and add it to google Webmaster Tools. I am not talking about just creating an account with Google Webmaster Tools, but actually adding a sitemap to Hubpages. Signup page for Google Webmaster Tools Google Webmaster Tools In order to add a sitemap to Google Webmaster Tools for your Hubpages subdomain, you first need to signup for a Google Webmaster Tools account. If you have already been approved for Google AdSense or use Google Analytics then you have already created a google account and can sign in with that account information. If you have not been approved for Google AdSense or do not have a Google Analytics account then simply click on the red ""Sign Up"" button in the right hand corner of the Google Webmaster Sign In screen and follow the prompts to create your account. Click on Add Site button Novel Treasure Google Webmaster Tools Account Enter url for hubpages domain Novel Treasure Google Webmaster Tools Account Once you have logged in using your Google Account, then you need to add your Hubpages Domain site to your site list. On the home screen, you will see a red ""Add A Site"" button on the right hand side of your screen. Click this button and then enter the url of the Hubpages site. When entering your hubpages domain you need to enter it as follows: http://yourname.hubpages.com Enter your Hubpages name (without spaces) where is says ""yourname"". Click continue. If the URL was entered correctly, you should see your Hubpages site added to your dashboard homepage. Click red Add/Test Sitemap button Novel Treasure Google Webmaster Tools Account Now that you have added your Hubpages domain to your Google Webmaster Tools account, you can now add the sitemap. In the dashboard select your Hubpages domain and it will take you to the dashboard for that site. (You can add other sites to your Google Webmaster Tools account). Click on the Sitemaps section at the far right of the screen. The screen will show 0 sitemaps and a note that ""No sitemaps found for this site."" Click on the red Add/Test Sitemap on the far right of the screen. Select the Add/Test Sitemap button. Novel Treasure Google Webmaster Tools Account Enter the sitemap text and click Test Sitemap. Novel Treasure Google Webmaster Tools Account Sitemap test complete Novel Treasure Google Webmaster Tools Account Screenshot of test completed. Novel Treasure Google Webmaster Tools Account Hubpages Sitemap has been submitted After you have clicked Add/Test Sitemap you will need to enter the following text: sitemaps/hub/current/sitemap-hub-yournamehere.xml.gz Where it says ""yournamehere"" you will enter your Hubpages name with no spaces. For example, my sitemap text would look like: sitemaps/hub/current/sitemap-hub-noveltreasure.xml.gz After entering in the sitemap text, I recommend testing the sitemap first. However, if you are comfortable you enterered it correctly, you can skip this step and move on to Submit Sitemap instead. To test sitemap, cick the Test Sitemap button. It will process the test and then show a screen that says ""Tests Complete!"" and there is a button to ""View Test Result"". Select this button. If the sitemap was entered in correctly you should see your sitemap and the number of webpages submitted. Do not stress if the number of webpages submitted does not exactly match the number of webpages indexed. You can fix that later. Special Note: Some people were experiencing 404 errors when trying to submit their sitemap, if you are copying and pasting the text from above, try removing the bold before submitting. It has worked for a few people. If you have completed the Sitemap Test or if you decided to skip that step, you are ready to Submit Sitemap. Follow the same directions as the test by entering the sitemap text as follows: sitemaps/hub/current/sitemap-hub-yournamehere.xml.gz Where it says ""yournamehere"" you will enter your Hubpages name with no spaces. For example, my sitemap text would look like: sitemaps/hub/current/sitemap-hub-noveltreasure.xml.ga Click the ""Submit Sitemap"" button. You will see a screen that says ""Sitemap Submitted"" and you will see a red and blue graph that shows the number of webpages submitted and the number of webpages indexed. Do not worry if they do match. It just means that Google has not indexed those sites yet. You can either wait for the google bots to crawl those urls or you can manually ""Fetch as Google"" later. Hubpages sitemap successfully added to Google Webmaster Tools Novel Treasure Google Webmaster Tools Account Congratulations! You have just added a sitemap for your Hubpages domain. What does that mean for your Hubpages traffic? Adding a sitemap for your Hubpages domain, allows you to tell Google about your hubs that the Google bots might not discover during their crawls. This is great for new hubs that have zero to few incoming links to the hubs yet. In addition to telling Google about all your different hubs, you can also tell Google how often your hubs were updated and how often you expect to add new ones. This will help tell them how often to crawl your site. Google does not guarantee that every hubs submitted will be crawled and indexed. However, it gives your hubs a chance to be noticed that may not normally get that chance. OLUSEGUN from NIGERIA on February 27, 2020: Good, very helpful. Sarah Galli from Sicily on August 30, 2015: Very useful and easy to follow, especially after reading lots of 'you can't do that"" posts!!  thanks so much. With regards to adding sitemap to Bing via Webmasters tools, do I use the same file? sitemaps/hub/current/sitemap-hub-sarahgalli.xml.gz? I tried but it didn't work. thanks so much Novel Treasure (author) from US on May 12, 2015: Hi Rajan, Thank you for your comments and your constructive criticism. I think you definitely have a point and will be updating the title shortly. Thanks for the help!! Rajan Singh Jolly from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on May 11, 2015: I believe you are talking of adding the hubpages sitemap to google webmaster tools. And I have been able to add it sucessfully the first time following your hub. Thanks. However in that case isn't the title misleading because nowhere have you explained how to add the site map TO Hubpages? Am I mising something? Jacobb9205 on April 20, 2015: Thank you! :) Maina Ndungu from Thika, Kenya on February 15, 2015: Thanks for the info. I thought submitting a sitemap is like programming but I've managed to do it. Susie Lehto from Minnesota on January 27, 2015: Novel, I found this hub in Google search. It was listed second. Great easy to follow information, and helpful. Rachael Ryhn - Jones from Forest Lake, MN on January 18, 2015: Hi Novel Treasure, I have been unsuccessful in submitting both the sitemap by following your instructions. I have tried to test and submit it in both sitemaps/hub/current/sitemap-hub-liladybugz26.xml.gz and sitemaps/hub/current/sitemap-hub-liladybugz26.xml.ga forms. The message I receive is: Type -Errors Issue - Sitemap is HTML Description- Your Sitemap appears to be an HTML page. Please use a supported sitemap format instead. I tried to find an answer all day yesterday, and the only thing I could come up with is a hosted sitemap solution that charges $4.99 to host the sitemap on their server. They also link up directly to Google Webmaster Tools and submit the submap automatically. If anybody else can't submit their sitemap manually via the above instructions and wants an alternative option here is the URL: pro-sitemaps.com I hope somebody finds a solution for this. I would love to be in control of my own sitemap. :) Barbara Purvis Hunter from Florida on January 18, 2015: Thank you so much, I would still be lost without these easy instructions. After three years on HubPages---I am still learning. I feel like the cow tail--the last one to get it right. Thanks for being savvy. Bobbi Purvis I will share with Twitter and pin it on my re-pin board. Novel Treasure (author) from US on November 13, 2014: I'm wondering if we might get better troubleshooting results if we posted a question in the forums to see if anyone who received the 404 error when they were registering their sitemap, was able to get around it and how they did it. Novel Treasure (author) from US on November 13, 2014: Hi Rymom28, I'm sorry it's not working for you. I was able to do it by following the steps that I described. Not being too tech savvy, I'm not sure why a handful of people are having issues. I know a couple have tried again a few days later and been fine, one removed the bold and was fine. I do know that it is possible because I have the sitemap. With the hubpages coding that I listed it will allow you to get a sitemap. You have to register with webmaster first though. Rymom28 on November 13, 2014: I'd really like to find out how you or others got this to work.  From all the research that I've done, what others have concluded is that because we do not own or create the actual website we can not add a sitemap.  I tried typing it in without bold and I am still getting the 404 error. As for the need to have 10 hubs published and approved to be able to do this; I have that, so what am I missing?  Any help would be appreciated. Margaret Schindel from Massachusetts on November 12, 2014: Thank you, Novel Treasure and MelRootsNWrites. Unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the problem for me. The last time I tried I copied the text directly from Novel Treasure's comment, which wasn't bolded. But I tried again just now, even copying it into Notepad first to make sure there wasn't any leftover coding. I got the same result. Still hoping for a solution, as this would be a great thing to be able to do. Thanks for your continued efforts to help me troubleshoot the problem! Novel Treasure (author) from US on November 12, 2014: Awesome. I'm so glad it worked for you now. I will pass it on to Margaret because she was having issues too with the 404 error Novel Treasure (author) from US on November 12, 2014: hi Margaret, melrootsnwrites was able to get it to work by getting rid of the bold and it worked. Not sure if that's what the issue was, but try removing the bold. Melody Lassalle from California on November 11, 2014: I'm back to give an update.  I'm not sure if this made the difference.  I noticed that the line to copy and paste was in bold.  So, I thought perhaps it was picking up some formatting that I couldn't see.  At any rate,  I copied the line to a text file and got rid of bold.  Then, I recopied that line to Webmaster Tools.  It worked the first time.  So, I either figured it out or it wasn't working the other day and I manage to hit the right time to try again.  Thanks for your instructions!  They were very helpful! Kevin Sutton from Gulf Shores, Alabama on November 11, 2014: Quite a few things to look at I'll have to do more research and come back to this hub...thanks to the author! Margaret Schindel from Massachusetts on November 11, 2014: @Novel Treasure, that's correct. I just tried again, copying and pasting the sitemap text from your comment and had the same result. After I submitted it and tested the link it said the sitemap was pending because of an error. When I clicked to see details about the error it displayed the following message (the same as from my previous attempts): We encountered an error while trying to access your Sitemap. Please ensure your Sitemap follows our guidelines and can be accessed at the location you provided and then resubmit. #: 1 Type: Errors Issue: Error Issues Count: 1 Description: General HTTP error: 404 not found Example: HTTP Error: 404 Thank you very much for trying to help me troubleshoot the problem. I'm sure @MelRootsNWrites appreciates it as well, since we're experiencing the same issue. Novel Treasure (author) from US on November 11, 2014: so you typed in sitemaps/hub/current/sitemap-hub-margaretschindel.xml.gz and it still gave you the error. There should be no spaces in your entry. Novel Treasure (author) from US on November 11, 2014: Were you at least able to do the first part and add your hubpages site to the dashboard homepage? Or was it giving you the 404 error from there? Melody Lassalle from California on November 07, 2014: I had the same problem as Margaret Schindel.  I copy and pasted the line that was provided.  I replaced yournamehere with melrootsnwrites.  I lcikced on test and it gave me a 404 error.  Any help appreciated!  Thanks! Novel Treasure (author) from US on November 03, 2014: So without being able to see what steps you are actually doing, it will be hard for me to troubleshoot. Also, I should warn you that I am not a tech savvy person. I know a couple people that had the 404 error and they were able to get it to work. However, they didn't share what steps they did to get around that error. If you want to post exactly which step you were at when you got the error, that might help me pinpoint the issue...it could also help other commenters who may be more tech savvy then myself help you as well. I will try my best to help you :) Margaret Schindel from Massachusetts on November 01, 2014: Hi! I just tried adding my sitemap to Webmaster Tools following your instructions. Like commenter Traci Ruffner, I tested the site map and it told me there was a 404 site not found error. Can you please tell me how to fix it? I copied and pasted your example and then replaced yournamehere with my subdomain name (margaretschindel), so I'm not sure why it's returning a 404 error. Any help would be greatly appreciated. And thanks for the very clear step-by-step instructions! LindaSmith1 from USA on October 12, 2014: What I don't understand is why all of my hubs are on part of the site map! Novel Treasure (author) from US on October 09, 2014: Thank you for the sharing and repins. I had seen some other articles on hubpages about it, but to me they weren't user friendly. I am also not a very technical person so rewriting it like this helped me understand the instructions too. Novel Treasure (author) from US on October 09, 2014: I would go ahead and do the sitemap now and get it setup, because then once you update your squidoo articles and publish them the sitemap will automatically include them once they have been indexed by google. Novel Treasure (author) from US on October 09, 2014: I'm glad you were able to find this article helpful! Happy Hubbing :) Aaron Burton from US on October 08, 2014: Good looking out!! Chauncey St Clair from New York City on October 08, 2014: This was a God-send--THANK YOU!!!! Snakesmum on October 03, 2014: Very helpful and easy to follow instructions.   Thankyou.  Voted up Peg Cole from North Dallas, Texas on October 03, 2014: I'll check this out and make sure my site map is still working. Thank you for the detailed instructions for making this user friendly to someone non technical like me. I'll be sharing and pinning this one so I can go back and use it again. Kathryn Grace from San Francisco on October 03, 2014: Thank you for providing this tutorial. I only discovered the possibility of sitemapping our HP account last night, then serendipitously stumbled upon your article this morning. I do have a question. I am one of the former Squids whose account was moved to HubPages in the  merger.  As you may know, we have been given four months to update our articles to comply with HubPages formatting and rules. I work on a couple nearly every day, but it will be awhile before I finish updating all of them. In your opinion, should I wait to do the site map until I've completed editing my hubs? Or should I go ahead now? I would appreciate your explaining the advantages of either doing so or waiting, if you can. If you prefer I post my question in the forum, please advise, and I will take it there. Tawnya from NE Ohio on October 03, 2014: Thanks for this! I was lost until I found your article and completed all the steps in just a few minutes. Great article with easy to follow instructions. I especially appreciated the pictures. Tawnya from NE Ohio on October 03, 2014: Thanks for this! I was lost until I found your article and completed all the steps in just a few minutes. Great article with easy to follow instructions. I especially appreciated the pictures. Donna Cook on September 21, 2014: Voted up! Site map added. Thank you so very much for an easy to follow, step by step explanation of adding a site map. Linda Jo Martin from Post Falls, Idaho, USA on September 21, 2014: Very helpful... thanks, I have done this now. Novel Treasure (author) from US on August 25, 2014: I'm glad to know this was helpful to you! Taiwo Kareem from Salford on August 24, 2014: thank you so much. you solved my problem Susette Horspool from Pasadena CA on August 09, 2014: I just did this and it showed up only 28 hubs out of 76. I went back to my statistics page and counted. Sure enough, the site map is only counting those hubs that are not Editor's Choice. The Editor's Choice ones are being indexed and sitemapped by Hubpages. I looked again at my statistics and noticed that traffic is not affected by Editor's Choice hubs. In other words, whether HP sitemaps my hubs or they're sitemapped under Watergeek, it appears to be irrelevant to search engine results. I still get good traffic to certain non-Editor's Choice hubs and no traffic to certain Editor's Choice hubs. Shrikrishna Potdar from Bangalore on July 28, 2014: Thanks a lot. I was searching a lot for this but could not figure out how to add sitemap. I tried & it is working now. Voted UP Novel Treasure (author) from US on July 09, 2014: Can you be more specific on what exactly you would like me to clarify. It still works with HP, as I use google webmasters daily to see my search content and queries and it is through the sitemap that I get this information. Sunil Kumar Kunnoth from Calicut (Kozhikode, South India) on June 29, 2014: Good advice. Thank you for the post.  But I don't know if it works well with HP as commented by someone here.  Your clarification required. Please advise. Muhammad Iqbal from Indonesia on March 22, 2014: Waawwww... very useful to me. Angie D from Cebu, PH on February 18, 2014: I have tried to follow the steps you have outlined above but Google Webmaster now requires the verification/ownership of the site. Since I only have access to my subdomain, I cannot verify site ownership. Any ideas? Traci Ruffner from Raleigh, North Carolina on January 02, 2014: Yes.  That's what it said. Site not found. Novel Treasure (author) from US on January 02, 2014: 404 is typically a site not found type I think Traci Ruffner from Raleigh, North Carolina on January 02, 2014: A 404 Error.  Not quite sure what it is trying to tell me.  Lol Novel Treasure (author) from US on January 02, 2014: What errors are you getting Traci Ruffner from Raleigh, North Carolina on January 02, 2014: I keep getting errors.  =( Melinda Longoria MSM from Garland, Texas on October 15, 2013: This was so helpful in learning how to correctly add a sitemap for hubpages. Appreciate the tips! :) Novel Treasure (author) from US on July 31, 2013: Thank you for the extra tip for the RSS feed. I was not aware that there was a work around for new hubbers that did not yet have 10 hubs. That is an excellent tip! Imtiaz Ibne Alam from Dhaka, Bangladesh on July 31, 2013: To Novel Treasure, actually, you are right in your point of view. Today, I have again checked your sitemap and it's somehow working! I downloaded your xml sitemap and checked it. I don't know why it was not working yesterday when I checked. However, you can't actually ignore my points as well as suggestions. It is really a technical issue with HP (hubpages), because your method of sitemap submission is only applicable when you have 10 or more featured posts. But with less posts in a HP blog, no one can actually submit a sitemap following your instructions. The only reason for that is HP disallows those hubbers, because HP needs to verify that those hubbers can produce high quality contents on a regular basis. And, when this verification process is done, HP enables them to submit a xml sitemap. However, by following my ways, those bloggers can still submit a sitemap in google or bing webmaster tool using their RSS feed. I hope you will now understand my point of view. Novel Treasure (author) from US on July 30, 2013: To Medical-Reference: you wrote ""But your suggest sitemap url ""sitemaps/hub/current/sitemap-hub-noveltreasure.xml.gz"" doesn't work anymore. It just sends to a 404 error."" This is not true. I am afraid you misunderstood the instructions. My site map works just fine. They are not a url that you can go to, they are for the adding my site map to the google webmaster tools. So you would not be able to have access if you tried to type it into your web browser. So its not that there is a technical issue with hubpages, it is how you are following the instructions. Also, someone should not have to individually enter their site maps for each hub or even do the best, latest, and hottest. Once you have the sitemap, it will automatcially pull in the new hubs into the sitemaps. I'm sorry you are confused by the instructions. If you tell me your specific questions I can try to help you. Imtiaz Ibne Alam from Dhaka, Bangladesh on July 30, 2013: Honestly, you have done a great job by writing this post. But your suggest sitemap url ""sitemaps/hub/current/sitemap-hub-noveltreasure.xml.gz"" doesn't work anymore. It just sends to a 404 error. I was hopeless finding a solution of this issue. But where there is no solution, there is a solution. I have multiple sites in other platforms and I always knew that there is a way out for submitting a sitemap to google webmaster tool. Many other platforms like tumblr, blogger, or wordpress hosted version let users submit sitemap in different ways. So I was just looking for the root Atom or RSS feed for a hubpage blog. And, I finally find out the root rss url. Additionally, I need to mention that hubpages.com have a technical issue with submitting sitemaps. As google punishes low or poor quality contents, hubpages.com doesn't want to let google index all types of contents. So they just coustomized every hubpage blog in three different categories - hot, best and latest. I guess you already understood that hubpages.com actually don't want all our contents to be indexed and I believe for this reason they don't provide an option for submitting a sitemap for all the contents. However, by following the below way, you could actually submit sitemaps to google webmaster tool though it is not necessary. For your blog, the root RSS are: 1. https://noveltreasure.hubpages.com/hubs/latest?rss 2. https://noveltreasure.hubpages.com/hubs/best?rss 3. https://noveltreasure.hubpages.com/hubs/hot?rss So, if you want to submit sitemap for your latest hubs just copy ""hubs/latest?rss"" and paste in ""add sitemap"" section of google webmaster tool. This same rule will be applied for the ""best"" and ""hot"" RSS. Consider submitting all three RSS url, I believe that will help increase search visibility.  In addition, I need to say by this way you will never need to go back to your sitemap section for updating, because all the urls will be updated automatically. Finally, hope that you will not take this comment in other sense. Thank you and have a nice day. :) Poon Poi Ming from Malaysia on July 01, 2013: Novel Treasure, how often should we submit our Hubpages sitemap, or is it a one-time off thing? For my own websites, I have to update my sitemaps every now and then. Poon Poi Ming from Malaysia on July 01, 2013: Amazing! I've been trying to do it without any success but now it's finally done! Thank you Novel Treasure. What else can I do, other than vote this hub up with UABI?!!! Olly from London, UK on July 01, 2013: Very useful thanks so much for writing such an informative hub. Voted Up and Useful. Novel Treasure (author) from US on May 28, 2013: I will definitely check it out. Thanks for giving me a heads up. Much appreciated! Poon Poi Ming from Malaysia on May 28, 2013: Novel Treasure, looks like you may have to update your section, ""Adding Hubpages Sitemap to Webmaster Tools"". I think Google has changed its format. There's a forum thread on this topic. https://hubpages.com/forum/topic/80856 Alex J. Reissig from New Richmond, Ohio on May 14, 2013: Figured it out.  You must have google analytics enabled to verify; it can't be just adsense.  Eerything went smooth after I enabled analytics.  Thanks! Alex J. Reissig from New Richmond, Ohio on May 14, 2013: I understand its part of the setup. But how to you add the html code that google asks you to add to your homepage? Novel Treasure (author) from US on May 14, 2013: That is part of the setup process. Alex J. Reissig from New Richmond, Ohio on May 14, 2013: Maybe I am missing something here.  Google webmaser tools is asking me to verify my site.  Any ideas? Rakshith MG from Greetings From India! on May 12, 2013: Wow,never thought you could add a sitemap for hubpages!Thanks for the information!Great hub! Anamika S Jain from Mumbai - Maharashtra, India on May 10, 2013: I did not know that it is possible to add a hubpages sitemap (except an rss one /hubs/latest?rss) so far to webmaster tools. Thanks a ton for the hub! Voted up! Novel Treasure (author) from US on March 25, 2013: Glad you found it useful! Louise Lately from London, UK on March 25, 2013: Hi Novel Treasure - I'd never heard of this before! I have just published ten hubs so I think I'll give this a go:) Thank you very much for this useful hub! Novel Treasure (author) from US on March 11, 2013: Thank you for the kind comments. I so glad to hear that you found this helpful. I know it was so helpful to me when I first found out about it. Educateurself on March 09, 2013: Love you novel treasure what an easy to adding a sitemap on hubpages. Seriously i really don't know before this that we can add a sitemap on hubpages. Once again thanks. Rasna Aisha from Manila, Philippines on February 26, 2013: hi, thank you for this, I don't have a sitemap on my domain yet. Your article is useful. Keep posting! Julie on February 20, 2013: You really broke this down well,  and made it very easy to follow! Thank you for the great hub! Novel Treasure (author) from US on January 03, 2013: Thank you. It's really nice to hear that this is easy to follow. That's what I was striving for. Glad it helped! Megan Garcia from Florida on January 03, 2013: You made this so easy to do. Thank you so much for publishing this hub. hitesh patel from india on December 11, 2012: very useful information...i finally submited my sitemap.. radiantwriting on December 05, 2012: i will try it - thanks! Novel Treasure (author) from US on December 05, 2012: it looks correct, the only thing I can think of is to check to see if the you need to put a / before the sitemaps. I'm really sorry this isn't working for you. It must be really frustrating Theresa D from England, UK on December 01, 2012: Excellent hub. I did added my hubpages sitemap to Google webmaster some months ago and my traffic did climb up and it has been steady for some times. radiantwriting on December 01, 2012: I have about 26 hubs - I add this text sitemaps/hub/current/sitemap-hub-radiantwriting.xml.gz after the hub url in the add sitemap area on my google account - Am I adding the correct text??? Novel Treasure (author) from US on December 01, 2012: Hmmmm I wonder what the issue could be? You have setup the hubpages account first? Maybe is there an / in the rift spot? Novel Treasure (author) from US on December 01, 2012: Hmmmm I wonder what the issue could be? You have setup the hubpages account first? Maybe is there an / in the rift spot? radiantwriting on December 01, 2012: your instructions are terrific and easy to follow - but I must be doing something wrong on the Google Webmaster Tools - I add the following: sitemaps/hub/current/sitemap-hub-radiantwriting.xml.gz and always get an Error message!!! Novel Treasure (author) from US on November 26, 2012: I'm glad you tried again and it worked! sabrebIade from Pennsylvania on November 26, 2012: Yeah...I have 235 Hubs. But it must have been a glitch because I went back in and tried it and it worked! Thanks! Novel Treasure (author) from US on November 25, 2012: I'm not sure what the difference is between the two you typed. Are you sure you have a sitemap availble yet? I believe you have to have at least 10 hubs before HP will setup a site map for you. sabrebIade from Pennsylvania on November 25, 2012: I tried it but kept getting this.... We encountered an error while trying to access your Sitemap. Please ensure your Sitemap follows our guidelines and can be accessed at the location you provided and then resubmit. I tried both sitemaps/hub/current/sitemap-hub-sabrebIade.xml.gz sitemaps/hub/current/sitemap-hub-sabrebIade.xml.gz Novel Treasure (author) from US on November 21, 2012: Glad you were able to follow and successfully add your sitemap. Comfort Babatola from Bonaire, GA, USA on November 20, 2012: Very useful hub you got here. Easy to follow steps and instructions. Added my page sitemap, though not all were index. Thank you. Voted up and useful. Novel Treasure (author) from US on November 12, 2012: Thank you brakel2. I too had seen my traffic plummet in September and was so dejected. I did the sitemap and my traffic started to climb back up. I don't know if the two are related, but I am hopeful. Good Luck! Audrey Selig from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on November 12, 2012: I did it, and I am so proud of your hub. I made a sitemap and submitted it with your simple instructions. Ever since my new profile page, my traffic has deteriorated. I am hopeful that your creative ability will result in more traffic for me. If it does not, I still believe that you have made a difficult task easier for everyone.  I have shared your hub and hope all will like it as much as I do. Good luck with all your writing. Novel Treasure (author) from US on November 05, 2012: That's a great tip. I was wondering how to put one on for my blogs. Thank you very much! Yveske on November 05, 2012: By adding this robots.txt you will always be able to find you're sitemap on sites like hubpages, blogger, ... If you want a sitemap on a site you made from scratch ofcourse you have to add it you're self. Novel Treasure (author) from US on November 05, 2012: Thank you, I had heard that but hadn't been able to verify it. I will update the hub with this info. Yveske on November 05, 2012: You can only do this after you have 10 published and approved hubs. Other wise you will get a 404 error. You can check this by adding /robots.txt after you're hubpages domain. If the # is gone before the sitemap it will work. Novel Treasure (author) from US on October 30, 2012: I have to give much thanks to InternPete for turning me on to sitemaps. I know some people don't want to share their secrets, but I have seen my google traffic go back up after this. So I wanted to share. Russ Moran - The Write Stuff from Long Island, New York on October 30, 2012: I have followed your advice and I have two sites pending. I really didn't know the importance of a site map until I read your great hub. Thank you. Novel Treasure (author) from US on October 30, 2012: Awesome! I'm glad to hear people can follow the instructions. tamron on October 30, 2012: I just created a sitemap now I need to create a sitemap for each blog.  Thanks Great Instructions! Novel Treasure (author) from US on October 29, 2012: Thank you for the feedback! Christin Sander from Midwest on October 29, 2012: Very good hub - great info and so easy to follow.  Voted up! Novel Treasure (author) from US on October 29, 2012: Thank you. I am really hoping it is helpful to other hubbers."
12,What Should I Do With UnFeatured Hubs?,community," Kate Swanson wrote her first novel at 15, created her first blog in 2006 and has been writing for profit, and creating websites ever since. So your Hub is UnFeatured. What does it mean? On most sites, having a Hub ""Featured"" would mean it's been given special status. Not on HubPages - here, a Featured Hub is a normal Hub. An ""unFeatured"" Hub has been penalised for some reason and is effectively invisible. On HubPages, ""Featured"" just means ""searchable"". It means that Google, Yahoo and Bing can find your Hubs and include them in search results. ""Unfeatured"" Hubs are HIDDEN from search engines. If you're like most writers, you want people to read what you've written - so there's no satisfaction in having a Hub no one can see! So, when faced with a Hub that's become unFeatured, it makes no sense to just leave it there, does it? You have a choice. Either: If you choose the first option, the next question is - how do I revise it? The answer is - it depends why the Hub is UnFeatured. Take a look at your ""My Account"" page and note the symbol next to your UnFeatured Hub. Quality A white circle means your Hub is not good enough OR it has broken a rule If your Hub has failed the Quality Assessment Process, then obviously, you need to revise it so it gets through that process next time - but how? It's not always clear why the Hub has failed. Here are some basic elements to check: Length - Your Hub should be at least 600 words, and much longer to be on the safe side! Grammar and Spelling - Copy your Hub into a word-processing program and run grammar and spelling checkers over it, if you're not confident. Images - You must have at least one image. Make sure all your images are legal and properly attributed (if you're not sure, read my Hub on how to use photos). Rule Violations - Don't assume you know the rules, because they do change. Read this Hub summarising the rules to check if you've broken any. If you can't work it out, don't fret. In the email you received, you'll find a link which you can post on the forums and ask other Hubbers for help to identify the problem. Lack of Engagement A half-moon (half black, half white), means your Hub is good enough, but it's not popular enough. If your Hub is UnFeatured for ""lack of engagement"", the important thing to remember is that your Hub is good enough!  Many people think it means their writing isn't good enough - and that's rubbish. A Hub that's unFeatured for Lack of Engagement meets all of HubPages' standards - it's just not getting any visitors. So, that means revising your Hub to improve its quality may not help - it's already up to standard. What you must do is get more visitors to the Hub. But how? In many cases, the problem is simply that readers can't find your Hub.  Address that problem, and your Hub will stay Featured. To solve ""Lack of Engagement"", you need to help readers find your Hub Note:  You'll find plenty of articles on the internet, telling you how to solve ""lack of engagement"".  However, those articles aren't relevant because ""lack of engagement"" means something completely different outside HubPages. What you need to do is to make sure Google, Bing and Yahoo! understand what your Hub is about, and that they like it enough to include it in their search results.  Traffic from friends, family, and social networks doesn't count so Facebook, Twitter etc. won't help. This subject is too big to cover here.  The following two articles will help: How to Get Readers for Your Hubs How to Optimize Your Hubs to Make Money Unfortunately, some subjects simply aren't very popular, or have a very small audience.  In those situations, it may never be possible to keep a Hub Featured, and it may be better to move the article to your own blog, or to another writing site.  Sites to consider are DailyTwoCents, WeekendNotes, Wizzley, or Infobarrel. Imran khan from Mumbai on May 23, 2019: As helpful as all your other articles. Kathy Henderson from Pa on January 08, 2018: Great article thank you for sharing your wonderful tips to Hub pages. Chitrangada Sharan from New Delhi, India on November 19, 2017: Great helpful article Marisa! You have explained everything  related to unfeatured hubs very clearly. Thank You for your suggestions once again. Bill Yovino on November 17, 2017: I've been unpublishing my unfeatured Hubs and moving them to my own site. My hubber score has dropped to the lowest point in 8 years. - So much for quality over quantity. Poppy from Enoshima, Japan on November 16, 2017: There is some nice advice here! I only have one unfeatured hub and kind of gave up on it after I was told to add a recipe capsule, then when I did, it was unfeatured. Very useful for people confused about unfeatured hubs. Thank you :) Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on October 27, 2017: There is no downside, except that they won't earn much money. There is a logic behind unFeaturing low traffic Hubs.  HubPages doesn't have the manpower to check the quality of every single existing Hub - and that's a problem, because low quality Hubs drag the site down. So they figure, if a Hub isn't getting good traffic, there MIGHT be something about it that Google doesn't like - so to be on the safe side, let's hide it.  They freely acknowledge that there will be ""collateral damage"" - good quality Hubs that simply aren't searched for much - but they feel it's worth the sacrifice. Bill Yovino on October 26, 2017: I have a bunch of Hubs that are not featured due to low traffic. It seems counter-intuitive to me to remove low traffic Hubs from search engines. I've started moving some to my own blog site. Is there any downside to leaving them published on HubPages? There are people who still have links to the HubPages version from Facebook or email. Tamara Moore on September 07, 2017: Thank you! Great information:-) Marie Flint from Jacksonville, FL USA on August 15, 2017: Fortunately, Melissa, my hubs have always been featured (except one where I was trying something new and decided it wasn't worth it). I thank you for the tip about alternative online sites where less successful hub articles might be published. Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on June 28, 2017: That's the weakness in the unFeaturing system!   HubPages always planned to make the system more sophisticated, so dwell time (the amount of time readers stayed on the Hub) counted as well as traffic.  That would have enabled very specialist Hubs, with low search volumes, to stay Featured.  As far as I know, that has never happened, even though the wording in the Learning Center implies otherwise.  It's a shame, and HubPages acknowledged that when the system was introduced.  However they feel it's a small price to pay for ensuring that poor quality Hubs remain hidden. Loretta from United States on June 28, 2017: I had done a lot of writing for some really small narrow niches that I interest in. I've noticed those are the articles in my account that keep getting unfeatured for the lack of engagement/traffic. I've been moving them out to other sites if they can't keep up with the pace here. Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on December 31, 2016: Thanks for reminding me that I need to update this article!   DailyTwoCents is worth looking at. If you are writing about places, then WeekendNotes is worth considering. Caitlin Goodwin from West Palm Beach, FL on December 30, 2016: It looks like Zujava is no longer available.  Are Seekyt, Infobarrel and Wizzley still among the websites that you recommend?  Do you have a preference when it comes to taking your unfeatured hubs? Omar Eldamsheety from Tanta, Egypt on November 23, 2016: Thank you for this useful article. Wendy Iturrizaga from France on July 22, 2015: Thanks Marissa, I am glad I found your Hub not only it is a mine of information, but the links are also very interesting for updating all those unfeatured hubs . Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on July 22, 2015: Be careful with Wordpress.com - you are not allowed to use Adsense or any affiliate ads on a Wordpress.com site. Ben Zoltak from Lake Mills, Jefferson County, Wisconsin USA on July 21, 2015: Thanks Marissa! That is what I meant, I've been avoiding using another platform....I'll check out wordpress! Ben Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on July 20, 2015: Ben, what do you mean by a ""blog site""?  If you mean a site where you can create your own blog, none of them pays - that's not how they work!  A blogging platform, like Wordpress.com or Blogger or Weebly, just provides a location for your blog:  it's up to you to work out how to get it noticed and how to monetize it. https://toughnickel.com/self-employment/Make-Money... Ben Zoltak from Lake Mills, Jefferson County, Wisconsin USA on July 20, 2015: Any recommendations for 2015 blog sites that pay well? I enjoy HubPages, but thinking about this hub, reminded me I should rewrite some of my lemons and get a solid blog up and running....hope you don't mind me asking! Ben Gary Malmberg from Concon, Chile on July 18, 2015: Thanks for the advice. It's like gold to this newbie. Two thumbs yup. Snakesmum on June 16, 2015: Recently some of my hubs have become unfeatured.   Probably I'll edit them and see how they go, and if that doesn't help, any that will fit on my websites will be transferred, and the others junked.   Harsh, but that's the way it seems I'll have to go with some of them. Pollyanna Jones from United Kingdom on June 14, 2015: Luckily I've not encountered having a Hub become unfeatured yet. I think I'd transfer it to my blog rather than chop and change it to keep Hubpages happy. It would rid me of that anxiety of getting enough traffic! Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on February 02, 2015: @The Examiner1, - well yes that's the point of the whole Hub.   In SOME cases, revising your Hub can make sense, but it's not something you should jump straight into without identifying the reasons for the unFeaturing in the first place. The Examiner-1 on February 02, 2015: Not necessarily Marisa. It depends why it is unfeatured; how long it has been since the last time it was updated; and what type of Hub it is. A normal Hub, which can be continuously updated, compared to a poem which wears out after time - the poem can get old. A seasonal Hub can lose traffic when out-of-season but can possibly be updated for the next time it is in-season. If they are 6 months to a year (or more) since last update then it will most likely not be unfeatured again for awhile. Figure out why it was unfeatured. Try to correct the problem(s): It may need more words; you can also add more photos too; there may be problems with the links (promotional, broken, etc.), spelling or grammar; It is best to proofread the entire Hub before you do anything else - unless they specified an error. Catherine Giordano from Orlando Florida on February 02, 2015: 8 months and 81 hubs and all featured and never had one un-featured.  I'll be sure to reread this when it happens.  I'm worried about my cranberry sauce recipe hub in the summer. Do they like cranberry sauce in Australia. I watch my stats. When a week has gone by without a view, I put it on twitter. By the next day, I usually have at least one view.  Sometimes that primes the pump. I get very upset when stats don't update because then I don't know what to promote. Tis is a very good article. I'm voting up and sharing. Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on January 07, 2015: @Examiner, if your Hub is unFeatured for lack of engagement, making even a tiny edit will get it Featured again - but the point is, that's only temporary. It will unFeature again in a few weeks and you'll have to do it again, and again, and again.  Is it really worth putting all that work into a Hub that isn't getting views? @peachpurple, your comment made me revise this Hub, I hope it's clearer now.  If a Hub is unFeatured for lack of engagement, you need to look at WHY it's not getting traffic and address that - keywords, links etc.  If you can't, then it's time to delete and move it elsewhere. The Examiner-1 on January 07, 2015: I am editing (proofreading) my unfeatured Hubs and they have all been re-featured. I add words/change words, update them with new data, add photos/change photos. Kevin peachy from Home Sweet Home on January 07, 2015: if i don't jump in to revise those articles, and I had already share with the social medias, what else can I do? samuel hodges from Winston-Salem NC on January 06, 2015: This is a very informative article. I will get to work and try to get more traffic on my unfeatured articles.  Thanks, Marisa  for the tips. The Examiner-1 on December 21, 2014: I try to do it beforehand but when mine are unfeatured I look at dates of original publish and most recent update. Then I check how its views are doing. If they are no more then I know that this plus old publish and update calls for new update. Reena Dhiman on December 15, 2014: It is always a nice idea to rework on un-featured hubs because if you will delete it then it would be a sheer waste of your hard work. Also, you can't post it anywhere because Google or other search engine will considered it as a duplicate content. So, its better to amend here on hub page. By making slight variations, you can get your hub republished. Tolovaj Publishing House from Ljubljana on December 15, 2014: I understand the logic behind unfeatured hubs, but this is not necessary best move. Looking from my point of view, when I always interlink related hubs, this means a broken (unfeatured) chain, what means lost authority and forces me to write only hubs where I can expect at least few visits per week. Some of the themes I am writing about, simply don't have enough search volume to be featured without non-stop tweaking and investing time in promotion on social networks etc. This is a waste of time, because I can't focus on creating more content. Several of these 'not enough engagement' pieces helped me to get authority in my niche and if they are not indexed, everybody looses. Don A. Hoglund from Wisconsin Rapids on December 15, 2014: Useful information. Early on I misunderstood how to use pictures from sites like wikimedia and a lot of my hubs ended up with poor quality pictures. I have been replacing those with more proper copies. Dolores Monet from East Coast, United States on December 15, 2014: Hi Marisa - first let me say that you are so helpful in the forums, as well as in your hubs. Sometimes I see where people get their feelings hurt because they are not getting the traffic that they want and blame it on hubpages. I have, in the past, saw those big fat glaring zeros in the traffic, and got mad at Google. Well, I can get mad all that I want, I can get my feelings hurt but that does not amount to a hill of beans. The only way to get it worked out, to get that traffic is to play by the rules. Just like in real life! Barbara Purvis Hunter from Florida on December 14, 2014: Thanks for this hub and for all the helpful information on forums you supplied. I have learned a lot by reading the forums and from your answers. Amazingly all my hubs are featured at the moment, but I did have two unfeatured  last week. I worked on them until they were featured again. Every issue on HP about my hubs---I learn something. HP knows more than I do---I just started blogging three years ago, so I learn from them. Thanks, Bobbi Purvis Mary Hyatt from Florida on December 14, 2014: I just recently had a Hub that became unfeatured.  That is the first one I have ever had.  The Hub was enjoying fairly good traffic and had a score of 83.  Then I edited it to add some new info and then it became unfeatured. You have been a great help to me in the forums, and I appreciate that.  I am determined to get that Hub featured again! I voted this Hub UP, etc. and shared. Snakesmum on November 30, 2014: Currently all my hubs are featured, but I have had some unfeatured recently.   If they don't recover after a few months, they'll be moved to one of my webpages or blogs. So far, non have failed the quality test - touch wood!  :-) askformore lm on November 29, 2014: Thank you for the explanation about unfeatured hubs. You have helped me to make a strategy. Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on November 20, 2014: Since Google's recent changes, it's easier to do well with your own blog.  The only rule is that you MUST choose one subject and stick to it.  It should be a broad subject so you don't run out of material too quickly, but it is absolutely vital not to stray from your topic.   You can start a free blog on Blogger but do buy your own domain name to attach to it, it makes a huge difference. Ben Zoltak from Lake Mills, Jefferson County, Wisconsin USA on November 20, 2014: Great topic Marisa. I just keep mine around, slowly pecking away at them, or add/taking away things. I've always thought of trying to build my own blog, but I'm still unsure if there's any type as good as Hubpages? Anyway, I was looking over my list of authors I follow recently, and have to say I was intrigued by your profile pic, lovely eyes! Cheers, Ben Snakesmum on November 15, 2014: Having had a few hubs un-featured for lack of engagement, I found this article to be very helpful.    I'll have to do more keyword research on the relevant hubs, and try to make them more SEO friendly.     Thanks for the tips. Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on September 01, 2014: @brakel2, actually I don't recommend to ""keep revising the Hub until it makes it"" - in fact, I think that's futile, if it's unFeatured due to engagement.   You need to work out why it's not getting traffic before you decide whether even one revision is worth doing. Nick Deal from Earth on August 31, 2014: Thanks for the helpful Hub, Marisa! Audrey Selig from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on August 31, 2014: Hi Marisa - This article is very helpful, especially to new folks at HP. I know it helps to do what y9u said and keep revising the hub until it makes it. I sometimes revise the title, add text, or a poll. Often, people are just not looking for an article like yours. You have told me that in the past, and you are right. You are so helpful to the new folks on the site and also those of us who have been here awhile. Thanks for sharing this information. Sharing  Blessings, Audrey Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on August 15, 2014: Hi Rana, and I wish it was possible to provide such specific information!  It's impossible, really, because so much depends on what you write about, how you write, how much study you're prepared to do, and what Google is doing at the same time. I can tell you that I've had articles on most revenue-sharing sites, and HubPages continues to be the best for earnings in the long term.  However you do need to take a long term view, because it can take a year or more for a Hub to reach its full income potential. As for how many Hubs - on other writing sites, it doesn't matter how many or how few articles you have, because your posts are just part of a huge site.  On HubPages, you have your own sub-domain  (which Google sees as a mini-website of its own), so you must have quantity as well as quality.  A hundred Hubs is a good number to aim for. RanaKm on August 15, 2014: Hello Marissa, so I noticed you mentioned other writing revenue sites and I'm wondering if you can take your time writing about these sites and reviewing them while stating how much one can possibly earn, the period of time in which an article starts to get you good income and the number of hubs that would be sufficient to get you good income? Can you please write about this? I noticed you do have a great knowledge and experience with such sites and things and I would really appreciate it if you write a hub or hubs talking about these and if you already have then please tell me where can I find them in your profile :) I voted up by the way, thanks for this lovely explanation. Have a nice weekend. John Hansen from Gondwana Land on May 01, 2014: Don't give up and transfer your poetry to a blog phoebe180, unless you are having trouble getting them featured. Most of my hubs are poetry and they are all featured, even my micro poems that only have about 60 or so words. Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on May 01, 2014: @word55, you seem to be talking mainly about Hubs which are unFeatured due to quality.  If that's the case then you can choose to try to improve it.  My point is that if a Hub is unFeatured due to lack of traffic, it can be a waste of effort to do further work on it. Al Wordlaw from Chicago on April 30, 2014: Well Marisa, The answer to why the hubs weren't featured is an assumption. I would sometimes rewrite certain parts of a hub and make it more pleasurable to read. I would express the article more delicately than as harsh as it may have been or make it more factual. I'd read it as if I were someone looking to read something more interesting than I previously had written it. Some hubs would get featured right away and some wouldn't. Those that didn't get featured created a challenge to me. For instance, I did a hub on ""Quit Smoking."" It was un featured 2-3 times before they featured it 7 months ago. Then they un-featured it again with a half zero about a month ago. I just let it sit there for a month with the 1/2 zero. 2 days ago I decided to make a change to it and they un-featured it with the big zero. Then I was about to just give up on it when I decided to just zap and scrap it but I wrote the hub as a poem and it was no surprise, then, they re-featured it. I think the prefer that I write poetry. So, I'm just one who keeps trying different things. Thank you for asking. phoebe180 from Philippines on April 30, 2014: Most of my hubs were poems, guess I have to move them in my blog...thanks for this Marisa. Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on April 29, 2014: @word55 - I don't agree.  If your Hub is unFeatured for lack of engagement, you can revise and revise until you're blue in the face, and it won't help.  I wonder if you read the Hub? @Phyllis, Cardisa has a good Hub on how to present poetry so it stays Featured.   Basically, you need to either group several poems together in one Hub, or write some text to go with the poem and illustrate it well, and think about keywords. The Examiner-1 on April 29, 2014: When you have time, research if it is a subject that is worth keeping. If it is then research it and update it perhaps removing some part(s) that is/are no longer useful. Marie Flint from Jacksonville, FL USA on April 29, 2014: Hi Marissa, I actually didn't know about the half circle (I've never had an unfeatured hub). I suppose it wouldn't hurt for me to go through the entire Hub Pages tutorial, as my problem seems to be getting enough traffic to my hubs. I would pose one other solution for failing hubbers, though, and that would be to post a query for help in the appropriate forum section. I often respond to hubbers who ask for help there. Of course, I can't access an unfeatured hub, but once I've made contact with the hubber,  he or she can send their text through Fan Mail, and I'll be happy to offer a critique. Voted useful. Thank you for sharing. Peggy Woods from Houston, Texas on April 28, 2014: I will have to look for those circles or half circles and see if I have any of them and then decide what to do about them.  Thanks for bringing this to my attention. John Hansen from Gondwana Land on April 28, 2014: I have only ever had one hub un-featured due to duplification which I couldn't fix due to the common content so moved it to my blog site. I have been on HP for four years and have 120 hubs and never had any others un-featured yet, even though I only had two hubs for the first two years and only had a handful of views for them. I had no followers at that stage and wasn't really an active member, but I guess they must have been long enough and of good enough quality to hold up. maybe they had enough external views. If it happens I will add a video, some extra content and re-share. If that doesn't work, move it. I will never delete a hub, I am attached to them all. Al Wordlaw from Chicago on April 28, 2014: Rewrite it over and over until they feature it. Proofread it, make changes, make sure that every line is not offensive and makes sense. Have the facts accurate. Watch the spelling and typos. Don't give up but give it the best. Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on April 28, 2014: This is a very helpful hub, Marisa. Fortunately, all my hubs are featured now. In the past, I had a lot that kept sinking down to the bottom till they became unfeatured. When unfeatured, I would do my best to revise that hub and usually it worked to get it featured again. If it became unfeatured a second time, I would remove it from HP and put it on my blog. Usually it was poems that became unfeatured. When I saw that most poem were not doing well on HP, I removed all but my best ones then changed my writing style. I studied my best hubs and stayed with those type of genre -- that really helped me to succeed in better, featured hubs. Thanks for all your very useful tips. Maree Michael Martin from Northwest Washington on an Island on April 28, 2014: Thanks for explaining the difference, now I know what to do with them, nice. David Guion from North Carolina on December 28, 2013: My answer to your poll, unfortunately--procrastinate and not get beyond the thinking about it stage. Oh well, sooner or later. . . I have enough unfeatured hubs that I can't deal with them all the same way. Gypsy Willow from Lake Tahoe Nevada USA , Wales UK and Taupo New Zealand on December 28, 2013: Useful advice. As I have never earned any revenue from Hubpages I just live with it."
13,The Most Popular Topics on HubPages: Here's What People Follow on This Site,community," A professional career coach, Marcy has helped hundreds refine their resumes, improve their interviewing skills, and advance their careers. Writers should, whenever possible, write about what they know, what they enjoy and topics that interest them. If you work as a professional writer, though, this may not be possible (I spent many years writing about highway construction, whether it interested me or not). If your goal is to write hubs that get traffic and to have more followers and readers, you might consider exploring which of the 22 general topics on HubPages seem a bit underrepresented in terms of followers compared to published hubs. It's easy to find the number of followers and hubs on each topic. Just click ""Explore"" at the top of the page, then click ""Topics."" Then, click on the main title of each topic; at the bottom right-hand side of the page, you'll see the number of followers (rounded off in thousands) and the number of hubs published under that topic (which is selected by the writer when creating the hub). Now that you've found where those sneaky numbers are hidden, how do you use this information? Compare the ratio of the number of people following the topic with the number of hubs published. If you see a higher number of followers than the number of hubs, this means the topic might be underrepresented on the site. When you're deciding what to write about, consider that there may be a chance to build your readership by writing hubs on these topics. Important Tip: When checking out the number of hubs and followers for various topics, ask yourself whether your hubs are indexed properly. Take a look at the full list of topics and subtopics, and see if you should adjust where you've categorized your hubs. You can do this in the edit mode, at the top of the hub where it says 'category,' above the title.  Art and Design could use some hubs! Nearly 90,000 followers want hubs on Entertainment and Media Family and Parenting is a popular topic with fewer hubs than followers! Paaaarttaaay!  Holidays and Celebrations has 29,000 followers looking for your hubs on the topic. HubPages is a global community and topics related to the site are needed! Got a pet or some favorite animals? Apparently 56,000 other readers do, too, and they need hubs to read! Sports and Recreation attracts 46,000 readers, who currently have only 36,000 hubs to read. Travel and Places are popular topics for a whopping 103,000 readers! Here are some topics that appear to have a good ratio of more readers than there are currently published articles. The hub numbers shown here are rounded a bit due to the daily changes of published articles on the site:  Arts and Design: With 55,000 followers and just over 24,000 hubs, there's a clear opportunity to find readers in this topic! The number of hubs is less than half of the number who want to read about Arts and Design.   Entertainment and Media:  There are new things happening daily in this area, and the huge number of followers (87,000) will probably enjoy additions to the slightly more than 72,000 hubs currently offered on the site. You can write about movies, the latest music, popular entertainers, classic entertainers from years ago, and a variety of subjects related to media. Reviews are another great subject for this topic category.     Family and Parenting:  About 41,000 readers want to see articles on this topic, but there are only about 28,500 hubs to choose from. Notice that this was the theme of a recent Weekly Inspiration on the forum! Note: Check to see if some of your hubs indexed under the Home topic can be appropriately re-indexed for this topic. Unlike Family and Parenting, the Home topic has far more hubs than readers.  Holidays and Celebrations:  The 29,000 followers here might enjoy some additional choices to the nearly 25,000 hubs currently published on the site.     HubPages Tutorials and Community:  It may be a surprise to you that any writer here can publish under this topic! With 18,000 followers and slightly more than 11,000 hubs, this might be a good topic for your work. Also, it's fair to assume that more than just the 18,000 official followers may be interested in this topic.      Pets and Animals:  It should be no surprise that the loving, helpful people you see on this site care about their animals and pets! The 56,000 followers of this topic have fewer than 28,000 hubs available to help them take care of Fluffy or to better understand their pet snake's personality. Maybe you can contribute some useful hubs to this topic!       Sports and Recreation:  A popular topic with a healthy following (46,000 followers) and only 36,000 or so hubs to help them have a good time and plenty of exercise. Sports can be written about as an activity for individuals or through informative topics about teams, leagues and other subjects fans might enjoy.       Travel and Places: This topic has around 103,000 followers, but fewer than 46,000 hubs. This means there are less than half the number of articles on this general topic as there are followers. This is definitely a topic with room for more hubs!   Books, Literature and Writing is a topic with nearly 70,000 followers. Business and Employment has a solid following. Education and Science is a diverse topic followed by nearly 60,000 readers.  Its 64,000 hubs probably do not cover all the potential themes for this topic. Fashion and Beauty are constantly changing topics; the 42,000 followers here will enjoy additions to the nearly 54,000 hubs now published. Food and Cooking - what's not to like? The 40,000 readers here currently have nearly 49,000 hubs to read, but there's always room for more. Gender and Relationships is an evergreen topic!  The 40,000 followers here now have nearly 46,000 hubs on its various subjects. Health is a broad topic with many avenues to explore. Its 79,000 readers currently have nearly 129,000 hubs available. Home is where the heart is, and it's where 15,000 readers like to learn new things.  Chances are, there are many more topics to add to the nearly 70,000 already published. Politics and Social Issues has 31,000 followers, but there are always ideas to add to the 48,000 hubs now on the site. Religion and Philosophy can be hotly debated on HubPages.  That means the topic's 26,000 followers will enjoy new additions to the 47,000 hubs they now read.  Don't worry!  Even those topics where the number of hubs considerably exceeds the number of followers have plenty of room for more hubs!  A large number of hubs simply means those topics are very popular with writers as well as readers. Notice that none of the topics below are saturated to even a 10/1 ratio. There are still plenty of opportunities for writers in these areas!  Books, Literature and Writing:  The nearly 99,000 hubs in this topic have about 69,000 followers. This shows there's a strong interest in the topic, as well as strong representation among writers. It should be noted that this topic has a wide variety of potential subjects; it can include poems, book reviews and short stories, but also articles on skills related to writing.     Business and Employment:  In today's economy, it's no surprise that at least 48,000 readers want to follow this topic. With slightly more than 88,000 hubs published, there's material on the site but probably room for more with this popular topic. Hubs about jobs and interview skills are quite different from hubs that address the changing business world.   Education and Science: About 58,000 people follow this topic, and the number of hubs published is only slightly higher (just over 64,000). Not bad odds, if you're writing in this field! This is another topic category with a wide range of potential subjects. You can write about educating children or teenagers, getting into college, completing your degree later in life, or any number of education-related subjects. Science can include information about the world we live in or new trends and discoveries.      Fashion and Beauty:  Another popular topic (42,000 followers), and its ever-changing dynamics mean the nearly 54,000 hubs on the subject leave room for many more to come. If you are a fashion writer, you can write about new styles, ways to adapt old styles to new trends, fabrics, clothing construction, the history of clothing and much more. Beauty topics include hair, make-up, skin care, body care and other subjects to help us stay healthy looking and attractive.     Food and Cooking:  There are 40,000 solid readers, with nearly 49,000 hubs. As anyone who's been on the site very long knows, hubs about food are popular! Write about recipes, preparation techniques, shopping for groceries, meal planning and much more in this category.    Gender and Relationships: A healthy 40,000 people want hubs on this topic; with not quite 46,000 articles published, the range of subjects here is nowhere near exhausted. This is a great category for your hubs on dating, conflict resolution, romance, gender differences and other subjects that interest all of us as we meet others and form friendships.       Health: This topic has a whopping 79,000 followers, and an equally whopping 128,824 hubs to address its various subjects. While the ratio might look high, bear in mind that there aren't even two hubs for each reader, so there's still room to grow. Health can include how to take care of yourself or your family and how to stay healthy. Medical information is another subject that might be found here.    Home:  As mentioned above, this topic has quite a few hubs compared to its readership. There are 15,000 followers, with more than 69,000 hubs on the topic. That's more than a four-to-one ratio, which probably isn't bad in terms of Google Search math. It's just something to be aware of when you write and categorize your hubs. This category covers a broad range of potential subjects for hubs, from remodeling to appliances, construction, landscaping, how-to articles and many more.   Politics and Social Issues:  There are 31,000 followers for this dynamic topic, with just more than 48,000 hubs to choose from. Since this is an ever-changing topic, there is likely plenty of room for more hubs in this category. Social issues can include poverty, discrimination, funding for various social services and other issues facing our global population. Hubs about politics can cover current hot topics, election issues, government reform, politicians, voters' rights, political parties and more.        Religion and Philosophy:  The 26,000 followers have about 47,000 hubs available on this topic. As you can see by the Forum discussions the topic prompts, many who read this topic have strong feelings on the subject. Hubbers have written about philosophical theories as well as religious beliefs under this category.         Technology:  Another topic with frequent, dynamic change. It is popular with 40,000 readers, and there are nearly 82,000 hubs available to keep them abreast of current happenings.   The topics below have a number of followers nearly equal to the number of hubs on the site: Autos:  There are 17,000 followers and around 19,000 hubs. This somewhat specialized topic can probably always use hubs related to skills and knowledge, as well as reviews and information about new designs and technologies. Games, Toys and Hobbies:  Almost an exact match in this subject, with 33,000 followers and about 34,000 hubs published! Personal Finance:  The topic has 49,000 followers and not quite 51,000 hubs. The changing economy and universal interest in cutting costs suggests this topic will continue to have a good readership as well as generate new articles. Kelsey Elise Farrell from Orange County, CA on November 30, 2015: Marcy, I'm sure I don't need to tell you (so many positive comments!) but this was a great and informative hub. Thank you for taking the time and doing the research for us! Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on July 30, 2015: Thanks!  So glad you like the information here, Paolaenergya!  Hope you get some ideas from it! Paola Bassanese from Ireland on July 29, 2015: Fantastic article! It should be made to be compulsory reading for any Hubpages newbie :) Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on June 20, 2015: Hi, Melissae - thanks for your comment here, and for reading the hub! So glad you found some helpful information here - all the best to you as you build your inventory of articles, and Happy Hubbing! Melissa Reese Etheridge from Tennessee, United States on June 16, 2015: This is an excellent Hub. You have given us some good information. I learned quite a bit from your article. Kristen Howe from Northeast Ohio on June 08, 2015: You're very welcome, Marcy. It's super useful for all hubbers. We can go with the flow or against the grain in traffic. :-) Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on June 08, 2015: Thanks, Kristen!  It shows what's popular, and also what might not be adequately covered yet.  Glad you like the information! Kristen Howe from Northeast Ohio on June 07, 2015: Great hub, Marcy. This is very useful for new and regular hubbers who need inspiration on what to write next for their hubs. Voted up! Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on May 29, 2015: Thanks, Mary!  You have a great niche if you're writing about specific breeds and tips for pet owners!  I sometimes have trouble finding the right series of topics, so keep trying variations in your searches. I appreciate the votes and the share! Mary Hyatt from Florida on May 24, 2015: I have a tough time when I try to categorize my Hubs!  The last time I looked there was no category for pets.  I will check that now.  I write a lot about my Min. Schnauzer and her health problems, and those Hubs do get more outside views than recipes or poems, for example. Great Hub with some great info.  Voted UP and shared. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on May 23, 2015: Thanks, Peachpurple - I hope you get some ideas here that will be useful in growing your inventory of hubs! Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on May 23, 2015: Thanks, Vocalcoach!  Once we know there's a place to check data, we can use the information as we plan what to write. So glad you liked the hub, and I appreciate your comments here! peachy from Home Sweet Home on May 23, 2015: thanks for your useful tips and you had  enlighten most of the categories very clearly. Audrey Hunt from Pahrump NV on May 22, 2015: Very useful hub Marcy!  One of the most helpful I've come across in a long time.  So nice of you to share these statistics and voted up +++ and sharing. Anna from chichester on August 29, 2014: Voted useful etc and given the thumbs up :) thank you for the info! GClark from United States on May 22, 2014: DEFINITELY A THUMBS UP!  Very helpful and interesting when needing a nudge to one's imagination as to what to write about. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on September 24, 2013: Thanks, Zarrar - so glad you like the ideas here! zarrar from pakistan on September 20, 2013: really good ideas easy to follow.... Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on May 04, 2013: The format for those numbers has changed since I wrote the hub - the only way I've seen the number of hubs recently is to drill down by sub-topics. And I'm not sure how to easily do that.  Take a look at the suggested topics on the forum (in the sticky post about rising stars).  If you click on the topics mentioned in the post, there's some tiny print at the top of each listing of existing hubs that gives the sequence of topics and the number of hubs in the final topic.  For example, the one on Roasted Vegetables goes from Food & Cooking to a few other topics & then to Roasted Vegetables.  Not the easiest route.  It's changed since I analyzed numbers (which only addressed main topics).  I should clarify this in the hub.  Thanks for reading and bringing that up, Yarddog! Troy Yarbrough from Texas, USA on May 04, 2013: Can you show me where you're getting your hub numbers? I see the followers for each topic, but I don't see the number of hubs in the category anywhere. What am I missing? Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 13, 2013: Hi, Ceres!  Welcome to HubPages - so glad to meet you here.  Absolutely, if you write what you're passionate about, you can't go wrong. I wish you the best here on the site - and I look forward to reading your hubs! Ceres Schwarz on April 13, 2013: This is an interesting and useful hub especially for new hubbers like me who are still learning the ropes on HubPages. Thanks for the info. It would be great to write for the popular topics that get lots of followers but I think it's also great to write about topics that you know and love to write about. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 13, 2013: Thanks, Hikapo!  It means a lot to me that this has helped you and other great Hubbers here.  I appreciate your letting me know!  Best of luck with your writing! Seet from California on April 12, 2013: Hey Marcy, you have NO IDEA how this is helping me so much. THANKS!!!! :D Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 11, 2013: Hi, Blond Logic!  (By the way, I totally covet your username!!) - yes, check the numbers and see what looks like it could use more Hub Juice on the site.  Glad you like the information here! Mary Wickison from Brazil on April 11, 2013: I never thought of doing that. What a great idea. I have changed categories on my hubs on a few but it may be a good idea to recheck them. What a good place to start the search for topics. There is always something new to learn. Thanks Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 10, 2013: Hi, VocalCoach!  Thank you for your very kind words!  It's fun to see the numbers - glad you enjoyed it! Audrey Hunt from Pahrump NV on April 09, 2013: What a marvelous and helpful hub you've written Marcy.  Great information.  I enjoyed the statics and numbers. Thank you for all your effort and time put into this! Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 08, 2013: Hi, VvanNess!  Thanks so much for the enthusiastic feedback - I'm glad you found the hub useful! Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 08, 2013: Lol! Gosh - thanks for the HOTD vote!  So glad you like the hub, Baja!  Hope to read your travel hubs soon (I'm ready for a trip!). Bajazid from Sarajevo, Bosnia on April 08, 2013: Good and educational hub for me. I am happy that my favorite topic has enough place for new hubs, because I have a lot to write about travel and places. Thanks for info and advices, for me this is the Hub of the Day :) Victoria Van Ness from Fountain, CO on April 08, 2013: Wow! What a great Hub! You really nailed exactly what people on this site are looking for! I really loved the specific numbers and statistics regarding each topic, the readers it had and the articles related. This should really help me to focus on what to write about along with the rest of us! Thank you! Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 08, 2013: Hi, Georgialgal!  Welcome to HubPages!  You will enjoy the community here - so glad you're part of the group now.  I look forward to reading your hubs! Mrs Frugal from United States on April 08, 2013: Great information! I can see you spent a lot of time and energy on this. Thanks so much for helping this ""newbie"".  Hope your day is wonderful~ Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 08, 2013: Thanks so much, Shll1978!  It's pretty interesting to see what people have chosen to follow here, compared to how many hubs cover those topics.  So glad you like the hub! Shil1978 on April 08, 2013: I love the way you've gone about organizing this hub - easy to read and to the point. Personally, I've written about subjects that I can connect with. I usually start a hub and then go about finding out which topic it falls within before hitting the publish button. However, I can see how useful an introduction to the various topics can be to someone who is not sure about what he/she should write about. Exploring the topics should throw up some ideas and result in a few hubs! Great work with this hub - thanks for sharing! Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 07, 2013: So glad you are liking it here - and yes, it's a great community.  The staff is also a great group.  Hope you have a wonderful time writing here, and success with all your hubs - I think you'll enjoy the site! Linda Bryen from United Kingdom on April 07, 2013: Thank you, Marcy Goodfleisch for welcoming me on Hubpages. I find that writiers here are so kind and helpful too. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 07, 2013: Many thanks, seanorjohn!  I appreciate your comments and votes! seanorjohn on April 07, 2013: Great work marcy.Drilling down to exploit this connection between followers versus Hubs is a great idea. Voted up Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 07, 2013: Hi, llesl - welcome to the site!  So glad you got some ideas here, and I look forward to reading your hubs! Linda Bryen from United Kingdom on April 07, 2013: Thank you, Marcy Goodfleish for a very useful and interesting hub. It helps me a lot as I am still finding my way around here. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 07, 2013: Hi, Kiki!  Many thanks for reading and letting me know you like the information here.  I love your username, BTW - a dear friend of mine is called 'Kiki' by her granddaughter. kikibruce from New York on April 06, 2013: thanks for the helpful information. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 05, 2013: Thanks, Theophanes!  It was an eye-opener for me, too.  Hope you get some  ideas from it! Theophanes Avery from New England on April 05, 2013: I never thought to look at the amount of followers verses the number of Hubs in any given category. Thanks for the helpful tip! Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 03, 2013: Lol!  Thanks, Crystal - you're probably right!  But, if it helps people be successful here, I'm thrilled that the hub may have played a part in it!  I know some have started researching the data in topics to get a feel for the market and its saturation. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 03, 2013: Thanks, bridalletter - yes, sometimes those numbers seem like a mystery.  They can be helpful, though, in shaping what we do with our accounts here.. I've deleted things as well - I like poetry, but I do not want to publish it here; it helps streamline my account and make it more focused to  pare things down. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 03, 2013: Thanks so much for reading and sharing, Suzie!  Glad it's helpful to you! Crystal Tatum from Georgia on April 03, 2013: A very helpful hub, Marcy. I predict that there will be an upsurge in hubs about some of these topics you've spotlighted here! Brenda Kyle from Blue Springs, Missouri, USA on April 03, 2013: I have noticed some of those numbers under the categories I follow. It is interesting and a nice idea to add to the heavier visited areas. I know I have looked more at my existing hubs and deleted a few that just are not an interest for people. A few I realized were to much of a personal experience, so I emphasised the the items that appeal to more readers by placing them at the top of the hub. It is amazing what you learn on here! Thank you for sharing. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 03, 2013: Hi, Suzie!  I'm glad you got some ideas here!  I think I need to massage some of mine, too.  These topics are what puts hubs on the front page of the topics section (where we can 'Explore' topics). So it's even more important to align them with the right topic.  Who knew ? Suzanne Ridgeway from Dublin, Ireland on April 02, 2013: Hi Marcy, What a really interesting hub here! I learnt so many new and interesting things thanks so much for compiling this. I need to revise my titles being in the right headers for sure. I have been finding that a niche for me through the AP has been homemade skincare products which is not flooded with articles either (under Fashion & Beauty) so it definitely makes sense to place work in the correct place. great research Marcy, thanks again! Voted up, useful, interesting, shared. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on March 31, 2013: Hi, MM!  Welcome to HubPages!  We do have a friendly community here; you'll like them - and you'll make great friends here.  So glad the hub was helpful to you; I look forward to reading your work! Danielle from Oklahoma on March 31, 2013: Thank You so much for this list.  This has been really help as I am new to Hubpages and still getting acclimated with the topics.  I have been a mom blogger for years but have decided to branch out and try hubpages so seeing what the territory looks like is nice. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on February 20, 2013: Thanks so much, MissJamie - and best of luck in your writing here! Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on February 20, 2013: Hi, CT92 - Many thanks!  Glad you liked it! Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on February 20, 2013: Hi, Bizna - Welcome to the site!  Wow - you are already very productive; great work!  I'm glad you liked the hub, and I look forward to reading your work here! Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on February 20, 2013: Hi, Anthony!  Good luck with your writing goals here - and I hope this information gives you some ideas!  Thank you for dropping by and commenting! MissJamieD from Minnes-O-ta on February 20, 2013: This is wonderful information to have, thank you so much!! C from Denmark on February 20, 2013: Fun and helpful hub! Thanks for the information, and it was very well written. JUDITH OKECH from NAIROBI - KENYA on February 20, 2013: Thank you for this information. Am just over two weeks old here with only 10 published hubs which i wrote just from the blues. At least i have learnt something new. Anthony Binks from Northern Ireland on February 20, 2013: Great useful information, thanks very much for the hub. I am a bit stuck on what to right and need a bit of direction, this information will help me push on with something new. Thanks again. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on February 19, 2013: Welcome to the site, Heidi!  So glad to see you here, and I look forward to reading your work. We have a great community on the site - I hope you enjoy it! Heidi Boles on February 19, 2013: This helps me know which directions to go in as a newbie on HubPages. Thanks for the insight! Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on February 18, 2013: Hi, Sheri Faye - welcome to HubPages!  In addition to any help you might get from this hub (and thanks for that comment), check out the Learning Center on the site. You should see it on the drop-down menu when you click on your name. There's a ton of excellent information there about making your hubs searchable and other tips to help you succeed.  Best of luck!  I look forward to reading your work! Sheri Dusseault from Chemainus. BC, Canada on February 18, 2013: Hi Marcy, I am a newbie and have tons to learn here...(almost overwhelming!) and this is very useful advice.  Thank you! Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on February 18, 2013: Thanks, Radmasters!  There's even more data if you drill down into the subsets of each category. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on February 18, 2013: Hi, James - so glad you found this interesting.  I'd love to hear how the data compares with your own experience, once you check that out.  Thanks for your comments! Brad Masters from Southern California on February 18, 2013: Interesting information in this hub. JamesPoppell on February 18, 2013: Hi, Marcy - Thank you for sharing this information. I find it very interesting to compare the number of followers with actual hubs written on any given topic. I will be checking these numbers often. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on February 17, 2013: Thanks, Cyndi - I hope the information here helps our colleagues on the site. It's interesting to see what people have 'signed up' to read!  Thanks for reading and sharing. Cynthia B Turner from Georgia on February 17, 2013: Thanks for sharing your solid research. Well presented in a way that makes the information useful to all of us. I certainly never thought of assessing the topics to hub ratio. Voted up and useful. Sharing especially for anyone new to Hubpages. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on February 17, 2013: Hi, Maria - that's a very interesting observation!  I wonder if HP should consider tweaking the categories here?  I sometimes find there's not a good fit for every topic I write about.  Thanks for dropping by! Maria Cecilia from Philippines on February 17, 2013: I like this hub, it reminds me so much of myself when I was just thinking whether I will join hubpages or not thinking that writing here is not my type or style of writing....I decided to join thinking of writing about things that interest me, and now after 2 years, writing for HP became a habit...I am glad that most of my favorite topics are almost one of the leads example pets and animals, entertainment and media, foods, travel and places, but I have a question how about restaurants ?  I have observed my ""dining-in hubs are my most trending hubs, one even reached 100 hub score?    again thanks this hub will serve a lead to all of us... Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on February 17, 2013: Hi, Jainismus - Those are kind words, but I also give HubPages a lot of credit for having a robust system here that helps us learn and manage our own content production!  Thanks so much for reading and commenting! Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on February 17, 2013: Thanks, Thelma!  The data does give us a picture of what readers want here - hope it's helpful to you! Mahaveer Sanglikar from Pune, India on February 17, 2013: You wrote: It's easy to find the number of followers and hubs on each topic. ..... But the credit goes to you because you discovered it. Thank you for sharing all this. Thelma Alberts from Germany on February 17, 2013: Wow! Awesome! Thanks for sharing this information. I have to check my hubs right away. Well done. Voted up and shared;-) Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on December 02, 2012: Hi, Bodylevive - I hope you find some interesting facts when you check your titles and categories!  It is important to have hubs categorized properly, and you can indeed change that information while in the edit mode.  Best of luck, and thanks for commenting here! BODYLEVIVE from Alabama, USA on December 02, 2012: Excellent! I will take a look at mine. I like to write about sports but I only write about the Tide because that's my team. My two dogs mean everything to me and I write about them also. Other things I write about if something has happened or the such. I love music from back in the day and I write about those artists also. I could go on but I'll give your eyes a rest. Many thanks to you on this hub. I truly enjoyed reading it and I do have a wake up call to check my own. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on November 29, 2012: Thanks, Ninasvoice!  So glad you found the hub helpful - I hope it gives you ideas for some great hubs! Ninasvoice from England on November 29, 2012: Very useful and interesting hub! Thank for sharing. I loved the inspirational quotes video clip too. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on October 26, 2012: You, too! Pat Materna from Memphis, Tennessee, USA on October 26, 2012: Daahh  .. didn't think about saving the link... that's just too easy ... It must be true that thing are bigger in Texas .. and that includes folks brains !!! :) Accessing my comments through my acct pg I did not know about either. Thanks so much for all your help!! Hava great weekend! Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on October 26, 2012: There used to be a bookmark feature, but they discontinued it earlier this year. I think the usage may not have been as high as needed to keep maintaining it, and also, they have made numerous changes to the site & added new features, so I'm sure they had to make room for new things. Your comments are available through your account page, though, and you can find hubs you liked that way. Also, some people have created a document in their computers to save links to hubs they like. Pat Materna from Memphis, Tennessee, USA on October 26, 2012: Thanks, I will try that .. .. Do you know if there's a way to save certain Hubs to a file on the site?? Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on October 26, 2012: Glad to help!  There are two versions of it (once you click on it) - the default version has sliders where you can rate hubs on various things, and the 'classic' version (which was the one used up until a few months ago), has buttons for 'up,' 'down' and things like 'useful,' 'funny,' etc.  You can experiment to see which you prefer.  The classic version is accessed through a small link at the top of the shaded box on the left side of the Hopper screen. Pat Materna from Memphis, Tennessee, USA on October 26, 2012: Marcy.. thanks for the tips.. Did not know exactly what the Hub Hopper was .. I'll check it out. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on October 26, 2012: It does take a while to get followers, and to form your own 'community' here - just keep reading and commenting on hubs, and be sure to go on the Hub Hopper and review other hubs. It's a great way to meet people.  The forum and the Q&A section are also great places.  Good luck! Pat Materna from Memphis, Tennessee, USA on October 25, 2012: I've done a 13 hubs so far.  I usually write about my life. I didn't join to make a lot of money, rather than as an incentive to do something I've always wanted to do. People that have been on the receiving end of some of letters and stories in the past have always said I should persue writing. So, I thought, hey I'm not getting any younger. The whole Hubpage community is good to be a part of.  I do need to find out how to improved my readership though. I'll be glad to hear from you when you  get a chance to read some of stories. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on October 25, 2012: Hi, PaisleyGal - welcome to HubPages - you will enjoy this great community!  I look forward to reading your hubs, and my thanks for reading and commenting here! Pat Materna from Memphis, Tennessee, USA on October 25, 2012: Good hub with good info. Very useful stuff. I relatively new all this, about 2 months and always learning new things. Thanks much! Voted up1 Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on July 28, 2012: Hi, Littlemarkiesmom - thanks for your comments; I'm glad you enjoyed the hub!  I found that entire section on the site to be very informative.  You can also drill down to more granular information within each topic - it's a great little peek at what people are interested in reading!  Best of luck in your writing! littlemarkiesmom from The hot, humid South on July 28, 2012: Great hub with really useful information! I'm trying to decide which websites I should use for my different niches and this was a huge help. Thanks! :) Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 26, 2012: Hi, Sharyn - I'm so glad you like the hub! Thanks for reading, and thank you for your comments; I hope these ideas are helpful! Sharon Smith from Northeast Ohio USA on April 26, 2012: Wow, thank you for pulling all of this together.  Absolute food for thought as I am contemplating which direction I am heading with my writing.  Thank you so much! Sharyn Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 19, 2012: Hi, alloporus - thanks so much for reading and commenting; I'm glad you like the hub!  You're right; we may be preaching to the choir in a few cases!  I hope the information here is helpful to your writing goals - welcome to the site! alloporus on April 19, 2012: Thanks Marcy, I think it is really hard to pick the best category for each Hub idea. For example, when I write on environmental issues it may not be the environmental people that would get the most out of reading the Hub - they probably already know what I'm going to say! Your tips were really helpful and I'll certainly use them to try to find new readers. Marcy Goodfleisch (author) from Planet Earth on April 15, 2012: Hi, Lisa - I'm so glad you found the hub helpful!  There are so many things to learn here; this was one I stumbled on just by exploring the site a bit.  Many thanks for reading and commenting!"
14,Who is this DJ Funktual anyway? ,community," I don't know why I'm writing this but I am and here goes... Stardate ??????????? Birth of Funktual - Intergalactic Funk Monkey Earth Name: Freund, James James (2 of Christ's apostles were also named James, and are strangely referred to as James the Greater and James the Lesser) I would spend every day of my childhood wondering which of the two I would one day become. NOT REALLY. Freund (which means ""Friend"" in German) although I am not German at all. Long Story.. Call me Jamie. My mother got married to greatest guy in the world, Jim Freund when I was three so having a Dad was really never an issue. Grew up on Long Island in the towns of Farmingdale and Levittown. I first discovered the power of music through my Aunt Carol... When I was about 7 or 8 my Aunt Carol started working for Home Run which was the publishing company for Billy Joel's lyrics and music. In fact her name Carol Freund is listed in the liner notes of his album Glass Houses. She used to bring me into Manhattan all the time to play with ""Uncle Billy"", who would chase me around the desks of the office til he got tired and I would have to 'let him work'. (He was writing his Vietnam song ""Goodnight Saigon"" I would find out later.) It was run by Billy's first wife Elizabeth, who's personality was captured in Billy's pointed personal ode to her, ""Big Shot"". Grew up with two awesome brothers, Keith and Denis who were five and seven years younger than me. Are you hearing the theme music to My Three Sons right now? Me too. They're both married now and still living on Long Island. (It should be noted that the ONLY PEOPLE who ever say the annoying phrase ""Long-Gyland"" are outsiders. We are to this day baffled by this pronunciation critique since we have no idea who actually talks like that. You've seen my vids, do I sound like that? No.) Back to childhood..I was an altar boy at St. Kilian's parish in Farmingdale until I was ""let go over Christmas"" for lighting the chapel rug on fire before a mass. The wick broke off my lantern! What? In 8th Grade, I got kicked out of St. Kilian's Catholic grammar school, so I finished at Wisdom Lane public school. In 10th Grade, I got kicked out of Holy Trinity High School too! I am proud of both of these facts to this day. Reason: each time I was kicked out it was over petty crap. I never smoked in school or cut class or cursed at teachers. I was the entertaining guy competing with the boring teacher which made me popular with all the kids. Teachers? Not so much. Every principle at every school I ever went to said the same thing to me. ""You are such a nice kid, why are you always in my office?"" *SHRUG* I learned soooo much more about real life and growing up in public school so fuck'em. The work was more challenging at public school anyway. Division Avenue High School had a pretty tough reputation too but I survived. I should mention that my first few DJ gigs were in 7th grade, including several youth group functions and even the 7th & 8th graders school dance at St. Kilian's. I still have the photos of it. I'll never forget DJing my first dance at age 14 and making out with some girl who was 17 and thinking ""oh yeah, this DJin' is for me."" But back to High School... My High School Yearbook Photo They did not know what to make of me there. I was friends with the brains because I was in all Honors classes, made friends with the burnouts because I smoked cigarettes and managed the local Diamond 'T' Records on Hempstead Turnpike. Knew all the football jocks and cheerleaders because I was the starting Tight End on Varsity football for 2 years. I also made friends with all the band and theater people because I was the lead in the play every year too. In 10th grade, I played Hero in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum and in 11th I played Albert Peterson in Bye Bye Birdie. Senior year, my town voted down the budget and we went on AUSTERITY. Austerity on Long Island sounds like an oxymoron doesn't it? Thank God for austerity too. because I started getting parts in regional theater productions all over L.I. under the stage name Jamie Daniels. I played Soccer then Baseball and by High School, just Football. I suck at basketball and always will. I love watching The Mets, Giants and Islanders, all of which won a title during my youth. The Giants twice and the Islanders won 4 straight Stanley Cups. My aunt and grandfather had season tickets for the islanders too. Dumbest Childhood Decision: to play street hockey with Bobby Nystrom's stick that was signed by the entire 1979 Islander team, the year before they won 4 straight and a year before Nystrom himself won the very first cup for us with an overtime goal against the hated Philadelphia Flyers. Started performing in plays and DJing full time by now and looking forward to finishing HS and starting real life... My college experience was just like any other young artists', I did a little LSD and some Magic Mushrooms, saw God, etc. Ecstasy was making it's debut around this time. Never did cocaine at all though. No Speed or Heroin either. That was where I knew to cut myself off. During this period, I lived mostly just on Marijuana and 10 cent Buffalo Wings. Ramen Noodles and Fruity Pebbles too. Then I did the classic musical HAIR at S.U.N.Y. Farmingdale which only added to the debauchery. Then I did Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and Godspell and dozens of other plays, musicals, playhouse summer stock, etc. I didn't want to do anything but perform after HS ended so I started doing children's birthday parties dressed up as Batman and The Joker or the Easter Bunny. Started working as a dancer for several DJ Entertainment companies. Singing telegrams too. What I really wanted though was to get away from my parents not that they did anything wrong but I was 19 years old and guess what?....ya gotta go sometime. After I met her theater friends, I moved to freakin' Albany where my friend Rosie was going to school. There I learned all about the clitoris and what women really want. Was never racist but my homophobia was pointed out and corrected. Learned that my parents and most baby boomers had better taste in music than I did when I discovered Creedence and Al Green. But the biggest musical discovery of college was Parliament / Funkadelic. P-Funk, uncut funk. the bomb, you dig? Read philosophy and psych books but became more and more interested in playwrighting, particularly, David Mamet, Eric Bogosian and John Patrick Shanley. I wrote a few short film scripts and revelled in the independent film movement of the 1990s was starting thanks to Quentin Tarantino and many others. Meanwhile in music Kurt Cobain had come and gone too soon. Ditto Bradley Nowell of sublime. Went to Woodstock '94 with my friend Heidi and had a blast! Note: This slide is where all the Mud People were born! By 1995 most of my friends had left Albany for Manhattan and it was not long before I too arrived. Lived on 6th St. between Avenues B & C, which is of course downtown in the East Village area called Alphabet City. Started working at Jekyll & Hyde Club on 55th & 6th Avenue in 1996 where I proceded to have the best time of my life. I love those people who worked there forever. All of 'em. Actresses Missi Pyle and Mandy Siegfried came from that place too. Ditto Lucas Rooney. Jekyll Fun: Waited on, met or actually had a conversation with the following celebrities during this period: Lauren Hutton, Marisa Tomei, Director Wes Anderson, Ace of Base, Mike Doughty then, of Soul Coughing, walked illegally onto the set of The First Wives Club and met Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler & Diane Keaton. Waited on Bob Costas, all three members of TLC at different times. Eddie Vedder, Ice-T, Stephen Spielberg, Kate Capshaw & Rita Wilson while her husband Tom Hanks was rehearsing for SNL, Then one night I literally bumped into Billy Idol at P.J. Carney's- which was the bar that the Jekyll staff always went to. It was across from The Russain Tea Room & Carnegie Hall. I actually asked Billy Idol if he wanted to smoke a blunt with me and my buds but his manager/handler pulled him away from us. I also attended the following concerts in 1996: Saw P-Funk live in central Park, The H.O.R.D.E. Festival on Randall's Island with Lenny Kravitz, Rusted Root & Blues Traveler, Saw Maceo Parker & The JB All-Stars, Pearl Jam up in Augusta-Maine, Rage Against The Machine, Red Hot Chili Peppers with Silverchair, Dave Matthews Band at the Garden with Soul Coughing, Stone Temple Pilots, Rusted Root w/ G. Love & Special Sauce at The Beacon, and many more smaller shows. I was dating a pretty famous actress and were together almost two years around her shooting schedule. Time of my life.............until. hobsonmm on March 31, 2012: Jamie...  great Bio.  You forgot the most important part...  Wasting your time with us fools in Ft. Lauderdale and Boca!  In the immortal words of Ashraf B ""what is the loan amount""... TeeFive on March 24, 2012: And by the way...I moved on and found the real girl of my dreams...lol.  So its all good. TeeFive on March 24, 2012: You know what...I appreciate what you just wrote.  Reading your page brought back a lot of crappy memories and I think you have a pretty good story without adding that stuff.  So, once again, I will extend the hand I never was able to do, man to man, and say well done and good luck. DJ Funktual (author) from One Nation Under a Groove on March 24, 2012: Hmm.  1st of all, I was just trying to paint a picture of how reckless college was and the free love theme behind ""Hair"" didn't help.  If this opened old scars, I really do apologize.  Last thing I expected to hear, to be honest.  However, I NEVER treated girls like shit EVER. I am friends with all my ex's.  If it destroyed your relationship, I am sorry but there was no intent or knowledge of you on my part. I never have given this hub much thought.  Hubpages just asked me to do it because I won a contest.  Your comments however about name-dropping were on point. Never thought about it before. TeeFive on March 23, 2012: Mr. Jamie Daniels...No need to be frightened.  You should just be ashamed.  What disgusts me the most about you and your life story is your section on ""Hair"" and the reference to the 1/4 of the cast you slept with.  You see, while you are referencing it like you were putting points on the scoreboard, one of those 1/4 just happened to be my girlfriend at the time, who I was madly in love with.  You treated her like a piece of trash and caused a tremendous amount of pain and sorrow in people's lives...It takes a real man to be secure in his past and not gloat about something as stupid and reckless as that ""debauchery.""  So the next time you want to write your autobiography, realize you can still hurt people without naming names...and that behavior like that, ""back in the day,"" was not cute, funny, or something to be proud of. DJ Funktual (author) from One Nation Under a Groove on March 07, 2012: If I took French after HS, I do not remember it, much less people in the class. I also broke some kids nose from my French class in Holy Trinity so I just figured it was him.  Ya stumped me. (Cue Music) Who is our Mystery Guest? An axe to grind from 25 years ago? I have no clue but I hope for your sake you don't think about it too much otherwise maybe I should be frightened. TeeFive on March 06, 2012: Don't worry cool guy, we'll meet up soon enough and you'll recognize me.  For someone who had to use a stage name, its pretty interesting that you bust my balls for not leaving my real name.  heheheheheh And it wasn't High School.  C'mon! Your smarter than that!  Read it!  Think! DJ Funktual (author) from One Nation Under a Groove on March 04, 2012: Forgive me for feeling cooler than some guy who's had unresolved issues from high school and chooses to work them out thru blog comments without having the balls to leave his own name.  heheheheheheheh TeeFive on March 03, 2012: I was shocked to read such a classy, secure guy such as yourself name drop like a common wannabe and wax poetic about all the girls you ""had sex with."" (1/4 of the cast of a junior college play?  You STUD!)  I guess growing up on the mean streets of Levittown will do that to a young fella.  While you do provide an interesting glimpse into the life of a tight end/actor/smart ass, I was disturbed to read that you treated your temple to a straight diet of fruity pebbles, wings and weed.  Seriously....when you are in training to discover the clitoris, you need a healthier diet. So as I close this message to you, my former aquaintance (yes, I wll admit it and disclose that, yes, I DO have an axe to grind... and should have dropped you like 3rd period French back in the day) let me just say that in the 5 minutes that it took to read your story (which I will, regrettably, never get back), I am glad I found this opportunity to finally say, Not everybody thought you were the coolest of the cool Mr. Daniels...as you so clearly did (do?).  Stay Funky! jackie kiesling lorenz on April 06, 2009: Hey Jamie,Actually, I'm in New Mexico.  I've lived here most of the last 37 years.I am the mayor of my town in Cochiti Lake.  I also own a restaurant in Albuquerque.Are you still in New York?  How is your mom?  I've thought of all of you many, many times through the years.  Please send me an update.Seeing your photo causes me to tell you that I'm very proud of how you turned out.  Love the peace sign.Did you ever get my letter when you turned 18?You and I just had our Pisces birthdays.  Your brother Seth Ryan Kiesling turns 32 this month.Leaving for work, now.Talk to you soon, love,Kenneth Jerrico Usher from Bend, Oregon on September 17, 2008: I scanned it, been up 28 hours but want to revisit it tonight or tomorrow morning... ok friends shouldn't let friends read hubs on no sleep.. my appologies :) DJ Funktual (author) from One Nation Under a Groove on September 17, 2008: I have already posted something in the forums about your reinstatement! The link is right there at the bottom pal. AND Billy Joel was the fake uncle.  Did you read it? Jerrico Usher from Bend, Oregon on September 17, 2008: DJ I had no idea you were this cool! I'm stoked that they picked you from my 3 choices, of the three I wanted you to hit it, you've definitely earned it (I had a first choice before you but now that I think about it you were better)... I'm glad too because this glimpse into your life is awe inspiring bro, don't forget your promise to lead the people into a revolt to get my forum privileges reinstated, to expunge my record? lol, I'm holding you to your word buddy... hehehe.. You also set a new precedence (wow 2 people in a row, were going to stir up this site and flavor it up right!?)I like how you showed me up by making not one great hub but two.. Makes me wonder if the featured Huber’s keep this trend where the HubPages community will be in say 2010 a HubPage odyssey! Why didn't you tell me Mr. idol was your uncle? Humbled huh.. Nice. may all your dreams come true.. your an interesting character.. Entertaining is putting it mildly :) Jerrico p.s. you should put a link in here to part two and set it up in it's own ""group"" so one could just click the arrow and move to hub part 2 just a suggestion DJ Funktual (author) from One Nation Under a Groove on September 16, 2008: ROFL.  That was classic 80s movie commentary right there. talented_ink from USA on September 16, 2008: Wow...You definitely give a closer look into your life and it seems you've led a pretty charmed one.  Maybe it's just me, but in your high school yearbook picture, you look like the typical 80's movie guy.  The one that was the smartass who was lovable but goofed off, and at the end, you studied hard enough to ace the test, beat the bully, and still get the good looking girl that was your best friend that you never looked at that way. lol Good hub man. Shirley Anderson from Ontario, Canada on September 16, 2008: Love this glimpse into your life, Jamie!  You came into the world with a whole bunch of talent just waiting to be enjoyed.  Nice thing is, other people get to enjoy it right along with you. Thx for sharing yourself with us. Barbara from Stepping past clutter on September 16, 2008: SO she broke your heart???  Is there a sequel? I worked at a rock station-KAZY- in Denver about the time of that lovely family portrait above.  I was the Traffic Director and input the schedule manually- ha.  Like a giant puzzle every day.  We played The Clash, Springsteen, Blondie, Bowie, Kool and the Gang, REO, Pat Benatar... my favorite song was &quot;I don't like Mondays.&quot;  I remember seeing Bob Dylan at The Rainbow.  I was so bummed- he was in his Gospel stage and didn't play the classic &quot;Lay Lady Lay.&quot;  Guess he was in confession mode. Great Hub, DJ.  Love your rhythm. DJ Funktual (author) from One Nation Under a Groove on September 16, 2008: Volume 2 is under construction. summer10 from my happy place :) on September 15, 2008: Very Cool look at the life of an oldschool DJ.  It must be amazing to wake up living and breathing music. Every decade and every genre.  I love that you love what you do.  You've got an awesome voice and I'm looking forward to part 2 :) DJ Funktual (author) from One Nation Under a Groove on September 15, 2008: This is just the beginning to.  I traveled across the country and started DJing full-time waaay after this. Dottie1 from MA, USA on September 15, 2008: Amazing biography Jamie.  I'm glad I stopped by to read. kerryg from USA on September 15, 2008: Wow, you have had quite the life! Erinn Soule from Los Angeles on March 29, 2008: Haha! FUNNY! My son goes to Mary Star HS and he got in trouble for &quot;hiding&quot; the communion crackers before Mass...and i thought THAT was bad! Great writing!"
15,How I Earn a Passive Income on Hubpages,community," Each Hub you write might only earn you pennies a day...but if you write 100 Hubs that make $0.05 a day, you'd make $150 a month! By Elembis (Own work) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons I am one of the HubPages writers who has successfully reached the payout threshold and maintained enough traffic to continue to receive income from HubPages and Google Adsense each month. This Hub is in response to a question asked by Building an Architect. She asked ""Do you think what you earn on HP is worth the effort?"" Short answer: Yes, it is worth the effort. At the end of each month, I get paid for work that I did months and even years previous. It just keeps rolling in, even if I don't add any new Hubs or do any marketing. Outside of the money, I enjoy checking my Google Adsense account on my phone to see my traffic and click through rates. It is extremely satisfying to see that on a daily basis, people are finding my Hubs and reading them. I also enjoy coming up with possible new directions that I could go on HubPages to increase my monthly revenue. Keep reading for the long (and hopefully more anecdotally interesting) answer. I started with the idea of blogging for money. There were/are a ton of articles online about how to make money with a blog...and they all basically say the same thing. Write something relevant that people want to read and learn how to get it ranked up in Google. After reading that about 100 times, I tried my hand a few blogs that failed miserably (mostly because I had nothing to say and didn't keep up with them). It was fun to try new things and I was writing, so I was having fun but the money wasn't exactly rolling in. When I found HubPages, I was excited at the prospect of creating articles that didn't require the upkeep and maintenance of a regular blog. I read everything I could possibly find on how to write on this website and actually make money by posting articles. I've spent hours upon hours reading articles about SEO, keywords, ad placement, and niche writing. I've even stalked some of the Hubbers who seem to actually be making money through their writing and read nearly all of their Hubs. I spent hours thinking about what I would write and how I would market it and how much money each of my brilliant Hubs would make me... I spent so much time counting the money that I hadn't made that I forgot to actually write anything. I wrote a Hub that was basically just a list of 99 Awesome Fantasy Football Team Names. I created that Hub in October of 2010, which was smack in the middle of football season. Basically, everyone had already named their team for the year, so no one was searching for the keywords ""Fantasy Football team names."" I didn't think much of it and tried my hand at writing a couple other Hubs about different topics.  Some months went by and when my buddies and I started talking about Fantasy Football again, I went back and did some Google searches to see where my Hub ranked.  I was surprised to see that it had actually ranked up well and was showing up on the first page of quite a few different keyword searches. Once football season started up, I saw a huge increase in traffic to that single Hub.  To this day, it is my most successful Hub on HubPages. Around the same time that I started on HubPages, I created a blog about the Facebook game, Dragons of Atlantis. My first post was on October 7, 2010. I posted about the game for a while and built up a decent amount of content. I was conscious of using keywords that I thought players might be searching for like terms used in the game, names of items in the game, and words like ""guide"" and ""tips"" and ""hints."" After a while I got bored with the game and stopped blogging about it. I had set up some Google Adsense ads on the blog in the hopes that I would actually earn a little money from the blog. After a few months of nearly no traffic, I almost gave up on the blog. Then slowly, I started seeing a click every few days and a few cents were showing up in my Adsense account. I checked a few keywords and my blog was slowly ranking up and showing up on the first few pages of Google searches about the game. When I realized that I was getting traffic to the blog, I decided to start writing guides on HubPages.  Now I have around 15 guides on HubPages that get traffic from Google, my blog, and from links that I included in each guide that link all of my Dragons of Atlantis Hubs together.  I never duplicate content between my blog and HubPages, but I will make a post on my blog when I write a new guide. One of the coolest things about HubPages is that I am making money all the time.  Even when I'm sampling a new brew! What I enjoy most about writing on HubPages is that if I put together a quality group of Hubs, they continue to make money while I am not even thinking about them.  I currently work two jobs, work out, spend time going to baseball and football games, and spend a lot of time with friends.  Because I've done my research and/or gotten lucky with some of the topics that I have chose to write about, I can not write a single Hub for a few months and still get a payout at the end of the month.  I am honestly going to put forth an effort to continue to increase my earnings here at HubPages, but if I decided to never write again, the Hubs that I have already published would continue to earn me passive income.  There is just something awesome about that. Basically, I followed all of the advice that I received from fellow Hubbers and slowly built a steady stream of passive income for myself. Granted, I am not quitting my day job to live off of money I'm earning from a video game guide blog and a few guides on HubPages, but I am reaching payout each month and enjoying a little extra cash to pay bills, do something extra, or just put some money in the bank. Here are a few of the main points that I have learned during my time here at HubPages. If you have any questions about HubPages or writing online, feel free to contact me through HubPages. I check the site nearly every day, so please do not hesitate to get in touch! Sylvia Gadea de Beer from Shoal Bay, NSW, Australia on January 15, 2016: It was sure a helpful and enthusiastic hub and I have passed the link to my sister who would like to start her own business at home too. Shaloo Walia from India on January 13, 2016: A very helpful hub! It's encouraging to know that you are earning passive income from HP. Sylvia Gadea de Beer from Shoal Bay, NSW, Australia on July 30, 2015: I think I will just have to do like the Prodigal Daughter in my story and just swallow my pride and copy Nikki D. Felder when she said, ""I'm back now and aim to attain ""new"" heights"" here in HP. I couldn't believe it, but I found 7 of my signed comments were still here for people to read! Nikki D. Felder from Castle Hayne, N.C. on July 26, 2015: Very insightful... Was loyal once upon a time here, fell away. I'm back now and aim to attain heights as you. Great read! Rumana from Sharjah, UAE on May 06, 2015: Great journey... Vince from New Jersey on May 05, 2015: Thank you for the information, I need to build a passive income for myself.  I can use nay help you can offer and I am open to talking. Alex Gadd from Great Missenden on April 22, 2015: Brilliant and awesome post. I found it most useful and can only hope my hubs will one day be able to do what your hubs do. Many thanks for sharing. Sunil Kumar Kunnoth from Calicut (Kozhikode, South India) on April 19, 2015: Excellent article and motivating too. It has to be shared. So it is done!  Keep on writing more such stuff. All the best. allamazingstuff on December 28, 2014: Great article! I am committed to make this happen for me in 2015 :D thanks for sharing your experience! Sylvia Gadea de Beer from Shoal Bay, NSW, Australia on November 23, 2014: I was in HP for many years, but I was disappointed with them, as they accused me of  having copied sites, which I had not done. That let me to Bubblews and things went well at first, but then I realised that 400 characters was not much to write something worthwhile, added to the fact that one got peanuts and it took forever to get paid. I kind of miss HP now, so I think I will swallow my pride and return to HP and I'm happy of that! Heather Walton from Charlotte, NC on November 23, 2014: You make a great point about writing several hubs related to one topic.  I tend to skip around, writing one jewelry design hub then going to my other great love, Ebay sales.  I will definitely take your advice and create several inter-related articles.  Thanks! Tracie Bruno from Delaware on March 16, 2014: Thanks for the ideas. I am certainly a newbie, but just the few hubs I have started with have been fun. While I would love to be a Hub millionaire, I am also happy to have found a forum where I can write about topics that enjoy. Sylvia Gadea de Beer from Shoal Bay, NSW, Australia on February 16, 2014: Yes, one has to be hopeful, but above all, persistent. Keep on trying and don't give up! Good luck! gypsumgirl from Vail Valley, Colorado on February 16, 2014: Thank you for sharing your story!  It certainly gives the rest of us hope as we continue to write for Hubpages. JR Krishna from India on July 28, 2013: Excellent ideas. Thanks for sharing these Christy G from TX on April 03, 2013: The more you blog on hubpages the more likely you are to make money.  I think the goal is to get other people signed up under you, not positive since I haven't recruited people under me. Sylvia Gadea de Beer from Shoal Bay, NSW, Australia on March 31, 2013: I'm glad my hubs motivated you! I think one gets disappointed sometimes, but just keep reading and learning and you will slowly but surely get there! HP allows me to keep on writing about Peru, a place I love! I see you come from the UAE and I will be flying Emirates to go to Europe soon! Rumana from Sharjah, UAE on March 31, 2013: Your journey will motivated many Hubers  like me! I have joined HP         3 months before, but sometime due to low earning I get disappointed. But your hub was quite motivating for me. Voted up useful and Shared! Julie on March 30, 2013: I'm really starting to become addicted to HubPages. While I'm not exactly new to writing content online, I am fairly new to HubPages. I have been writing here for almost a month and 1/2 now. I know there are a lot of factors at play in how much content earns, but, it has been nice to see fairly steady increases in traffic and earnings over time. In a month and 1/2 now, I've just crossed 10,000 views yesterday, and I'm just about to pass the $50 mark. Seeing stats update each day is really very exciting! I'm hooked! Sylvia Gadea de Beer from Shoal Bay, NSW, Australia on December 07, 2012: I like to travel and if I like the place, then sharing it is the only thing I can do really! I am planning to write a few more hubs, as I have just moved to a place that is like a paradise and we are even planning to retire here too! ignugent17 on December 02, 2012: It is always nice to read about writers who shares their journey in writing. This is very inspiring. :-) Megan Garcia from Florida on November 12, 2012: Great hub! You definitely give me hope! Lauryallan on September 19, 2012: Hey that's great to hear. I am glad that's what you are experiencing, because a lot of people (including the success stories) seem to be experiencing the opposite. I wonder what the difference is... PBody5205 (author) on September 19, 2012: Hi  Laurayallan - I have actually seen an increase in my earnings over the last few months.  Part of that is that some of my more profitable hubs are about fantasy football, so August is my biggest month of the year, but in general I've seen my earnings increase consistently since the writing of this Hub. livingsta from United Kingdom on September 19, 2012: Thank you for sharing your ideas and experience! Lauryallan on September 19, 2012: Hey PBody, how is the passive income working out for you now with all the HP changes such as the layout and the Idle Hubs thing? Has you traffic increased, stayed constant or decreased? And how this affected your passive income? I am asking as I am seeing a big difference in my traffic and earnings since the changes. I wanted to know if others were too and to what extent. Sylvia Gadea de Beer from Shoal Bay, NSW, Australia on August 27, 2012: I would like to have a niche market, but I am too busy writing what I hope will be my autobiography in Kindle, + a few more ideas I have! If you do have a Kindle then look out for my Auto, which will be called Footprints in the sand of time: a life in Peru, Australia, Dominican Rep and Austria, which is under my real name and not sylvia13! Mary Wickison from Brazil on August 26, 2012: It is refreshing to see an honest answer. I don't want to read about someone who spends all their waking hours writing on Hubpages. Like yourself, I am working as well and at times it isn't always easy to publish another hub. You have discovered a few niche markets and they are working well for you. Glad I found this hub. Voted up and interesting. Sylvia Gadea de Beer from Shoal Bay, NSW, Australia on July 16, 2012: rerenaissancemom - Don't worry, that is exactly how all of us started here! I also started the same way, quite insecure about what I was to write about and whether I would like it or not. Now, more than 4 years here, I am still here writing and enjoying myself too! Willette from Michigan on July 15, 2012: Thanks for the motivational hub. It is comforting to read about others success and know that it is possible for you too. Keep up the good work! iwriteforyou from United Kingdom on May 02, 2012: Thank you for your advice. As a newbie it is great to get some tips for improving my hubs and their results. Much appreciated :-) amvabecreations from Netherlands on April 24, 2012: Thanks for the tips! Just starting out myself, but I love this site already. Good luck!! renaissancemom from United States on March 14, 2012: thank you so much for the encouraging words! I am on day 2 with only one hub, but I have so many ideas... PBody5205 (author) on March 14, 2012: Basically I write about topics that I have something to offer.  When I decide on a topic, I will use Google's keyword tool to see what keywords people are searching for and try to incorporate them, but I have yet to write a Hub based on a keyword. toyexcavatorcrew from London on March 14, 2012: I think main job is keyword research in this business. How do you research your keywords? prosols on March 13, 2012: very helpful hub .. nice piece of information for the new commers.. seo4site on March 13, 2012: Hm, very interesting and smth new for me. Thanks a lot dayakthinker on March 12, 2012: Thanks for tips. May god bless you with more blessings through sharing. Mary Hyatt from Florida on March 12, 2012: When I first started writing on HubPages, I wrote poems.  It didn't take me long to realize I was never going to make money on poems.  I have since tried to write ""evergreen"" articles.  I seem to do better with those.  I'm still learning each day.  Thanks for all this invaluable advice.  Goodnight. Lisa Dewey from Far left of The South & Extreme west in my best imagination! on March 12, 2012: Thanks for the boost! From a one-Hubber (so far!). Good stuff. Keep it coming! adriatk from USA on March 12, 2012: This is SO helpful. Thank you for the tips! carbon12 on March 11, 2012: Does that mean there is hope for me? :) I have found Hub Pages to be a lot better for my writing style. The people here are so nice. I am making a little bit of money. I am sure if I keep writing hubs they will come, lol. Thanks for a great hub. Have a great day my friend. Melanie Chisnall from Cape Town, South Africa on March 11, 2012: Great hub, very motivational - thanks! :) Roxanne Lewis from Washington on March 10, 2012: Your story is inspirational, thanks! ;) LauraGT from MA on March 09, 2012: Thanks for sharing your experience.  It's so interesting to see the many ways people succeed on hubpages! danger01 from Atlanta GA on March 09, 2012: Thanks, Very helpful and encouraging. Danger01 OCDKids from North Carolina on March 09, 2012: As I am new to HubPages, your advice has been very helpful.You have, certainly, encouraged me to write more. I look forward to following your lead, learning additional tips from you and increasing traffic to my hubs. Thanks for the excellent article. DREAM ON on March 09, 2012: I love the simple, straight forward easy to read and understand approach.I am slowly learning my way around the computer.Two steps forward one step back.Spending more time reading informative hubs how to use key words and backlinks but my adsense acount is frozen.I try to get it unfrozen and I still am lost.Wonder if you have any suggestions?Great hub and nice to see the wonderful success. Kireina Jewellery from UK on March 09, 2012: Very good! l will be taking this all on board! teutophile on March 08, 2012: This is a very informative hub, full of a lot of good advice.  I'll take some of your suggestions to heart. PBody5205 (author) on March 08, 2012: @waqasthefirst I would do a search on ""Backlinking"" and read some of the articles that other Hubbers have written about how to get traffic to your Hubs.  Using sites like RedGage, Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, and many others all help create backlinks to your Hubs which will help with Google traffic as well as getting some referral traffic.  I am by no means an expert on this, but there are some great articles on HubPages that will help you understand how and why backlinking works. waqasthefirst from Pakistant on March 08, 2012: nice I have a question Can I submit my hubs on an article dictionary  for traffic or not Michelle Orelup from Las Vegas, NV on March 07, 2012: I am new to HP and have written six hubs. This is still new to me and I am  excited to read your thoughts on passive income. Thanks for the tips! emilybee on March 06, 2012: Thanks for the motivating hub! In your words there is proof that it can be done and success can be found here. Thanks for that! Sylvia Gadea de Beer from Shoal Bay, NSW, Australia on March 05, 2012: Reading your hub was like reading the hub I should have written a long while ago! I get so much pleasure writing for HP! It is very inspiring and unconsciously perhaps, I am always thinking of the topic for the next hub! Congratulations and thanks for your hub, as it was very useful!! sparklingcrystal from Manila on March 05, 2012: This hub just inspired me to do more hubs! Thanks for this encouraging article! eye say from Canada on March 04, 2012: hope I can follow in your successful footsteps,thanks for posting! waqasthefirst from Pakistant on March 04, 2012: very nice I am a new on hubpages. It is help full for me thanks georgescifo from India on March 04, 2012: This is really an inspirational Hub @PBody5205. Keep coming up with such hubs in the future also.. Slaven Cvijetic from Switzerland, Zurich on March 04, 2012: As a new hubber this is very encouraging! Thank you! Voted Up and SHARED! L.L. Woodard from Oklahoma City on March 04, 2012: It's reassuring to hear that a writer with a modest amount of hubs has not only earned initial payout, but continues to earn passively each month. Congratulations on your success and thank you for sharing it with others. It is motivational. Voted up and SHARED. Bldg an Architect on March 04, 2012: Thanks for the response and the awesome hub!  It's quite flattering that you took up my question.  As a newcomer, I've been wondering what to reasonably expect from my hubs.  A lot of people talk about needing hundreds of hubs to make any money.  Its good to know that a reasonable amount of effort combined with some patience can pay off.  Thanks again! Natasha from Hawaii on March 04, 2012: Thanks for the frank hub. It's always nice, as a new hubber, to come across honest and open information about what to expect! Up and useful. mcadloni on March 04, 2012: Excellent ideas thank you. I will use your ideas."
16,26 Hubbers Who Have Inspired Me,community," Sharilee has been writing online for four years, starting with Hubpages. She now has several blogs and websites. Thank you for the inspiration! kahanaboy via Morguefile I have been on Hubpages for eighteen months now, and have just gone over the 100 hubs mark. In order to commemorate this special milestone, I recently wrote a hub called My Hubpages Mentors. On this hub, I wrote about those writers that I have learned the most from during the last year and a half on this site. My Hub #99 was also a type of tribute, to Hubpages itself: 99 Reasons I Like Hubpages. I have one more Hub Love type of hub up my sleeve. This is a hub that talks about the Hubbers on Hubpages that have inspired me. There are many, but these are 26 that have especially inspired me in different ways. So, this is the second part of my tribute to the hubbers I appreciate on Hubpages, in honour of my 100th hub. I appreciate them all. And I couldn't mention everyone. It makes me nervous that I might forget someone that inspired me but please understand that this list is not exhaustive but just a sample. I am glad to show my appreciation to some of those hubbers that have truly touched my heart. Thank you so much. And the ones that have touched my heart the most are those that have given me comments and just kept reading my hubs. That has meant the world to me. When I signed up a year and a half ago, I had no idea what to expect and I have been blown away the community and the supporters. Thank you to all of you. Some writing soothes the soul. Image by Porbital via Free Digital Photos One of the things I really enjoy about Hubpages is the inspiration I have received here. These next hubbers are ones whose writing is beautiful and inspirational. I love their writing and every time I read something from one of these writers, I am prepared to be moved. Some writers help my faith. jdurham via Morgufile One thing I enjoy about Hubpages is that there are some great Christian writers who have helped me grow in my faith. Sometimes I was amazed to hear just the right word when I opened up my Hubpages ""new hubs."" I love reading about people's pets. My Collection I am the designated human of three cats and a great animal lover. I have met many fellow pet lovers here, and here are some that have inspired me the most with their stories:  I travel vicariously through Hubpages! © Copyright Ross via Geograph It has always been my dream to travel the world but I've never quite been able to do it, so I love reading the fascinating travel hubs of these following hubbers: These artists display great artistry. Albert Bridge via Geographe These are people whose artwork is inspiring. While some of us ""look"" for photos, these writers ""make"" artwork and their dedication to truly original work is incredible. There are many talented photographers and artists at Hubpages, as evidenced by last summer's creative contest. These are some of my favourites:  Beautiful poetry enraptures. Painting, Beata Beatrix, by Dante Gabriel Rossetti I love reading poetry and was amazed by the number of very talented poets here at Hubpages. These are three whose poems I find particularly alluring. Read them and you will see. Office Clipart There are some writers on Hubpages that are just so darn smart you can't believe it. When I read their stuff, I am bedazzled by their minds and their class. It's like going to a sophisticated dinner party and meeting some of the brightest and the best. Here are a couple of these, although there are many more:   Some hubbers make me laugh out loud! Stefanomas via Morguefile These hubbers are the funniest ones that I found on Hubpages: These writers have all made me ""laugh out loud,"" more than one time, for sure. There are many more other hilarious writers here, too, but these are a sample: Hella's Multimedia The first thing I loved about Hubpages was not the well optimized layout or the Google ranking. No, I loved it because it was a chance to write about real, important things and to read about life, love and ideas. I thank every reader that bothers to stay on my pages. I have valued every comment and vote up. I have met so many amazing people here and I couldn't mention them all. It has been much more an intellectual experience; it's also been a heart experience, both as a writer and a reader. I thank all the good writers on here who share of themselves, through the written word, for the benefit of us all. For me, Hubpages is just as much a place to read, as it is a place to write. © 2012 Sharilee Swaity Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on March 04, 2017: Thanks, @peachpurple! I did vote but I can't remember if they were the ones in this hub or not. I am glad you enjoy some of the same hubs as I do. I apologize for not getting back to you sooner. Take care! peachy from Home Sweet Home on August 22, 2016: I am a follower for some of those hubbers that you had mentioned, they had produced interesting hubs never bored me. Did you join the hub voting already? You could put their name into the votes Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on January 16, 2015: @Phyliss Doyle, thank you so much for letting me know that you enjoyed the article, and your kind comment. There are so many great writers here on Hubpages, and I am glad to have ""met"" them. Take care! @suzettenaples, thank you so much for coming by to read the article, and such a lovely comment. Have a wonderful day! @The Examiner-1, thank you so much for reading, and appreciating these hubbers along with me. I wish you a great day, and thanks so much for the comments and the votes. Take care! Suzette Walker from Taos, NM on July 20, 2014: Wonderful article and a great tribute to so many wonderful and talented writers here on HP.  They truly are inspirational. The Examiner-1 on July 19, 2014: You are a few months ahead of me but I have learned a lot since I have been here too. Your Hub was beautifully written and made me thankful for the ones who follow me. I enjoyed reading it Sharilee. I voted it up. Kevin Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on July 19, 2014: Prairieprincess, you chose some very good writers to pay tribute to. This is a lovely thing to do.  I enjoyed reading your hub. It is good to know you have stayed with and doing well. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on June 14, 2014: Peg, I am so glad that the article on inspiring hubbers gave you a few new ideas. And it's not surprising that you were already familiar with many of them, who have touched so many of our hearts. Thank you so much for the kind comment, and I do apologize for not getting back to you sooner. Take care! Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on June 14, 2014: @izetti ... thank you so much for the comment! I am glad that I was able to remind you of the great community we have. I don't come on here very often, either, but there I have also met such awesome individuals here.  That is so neat that you were able to make such a close friend from someone who made a comment on your hubs. I do apologize for not responding more quickly to your comment. I have been so busy at work, that HP has been neglected. Have a wonderful day! Peg Cole from North Dallas, Texas on January 22, 2014: I chose your inspirational hub about other hubbers to find some new writers to follow. You've chosen some of the same ones that I like along with some new and interesting people to check out. Thank you. L Izett from The Great Northwest on September 24, 2013: I had to see if some of my faves, are your faves. And yes you have a few I love on here...AEvans, Prasetio30, Docmo, Sharyn's Slant...and some I never heard of even though I've been on here for years so I'm going to go check out some. I loved how you categorized them too. I had one person/hubber in particular who helped me out in my faith and a commenter (not writer) on one of my hubs who I've had email contact with nearly every day. I've made some great friends. Your hub reminds me how this is a great community. I don't get on here as often as I used to but I still appreciate it and all the great hubbers like  yourself. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on March 17, 2013: Epigramman, you are so right! Hubpages really is about getting inspired. Thank you for your kind words, my friend. And greetings back from Canada, as well. Take care! epigramman on March 12, 2013: Yes it's true isn't it - Hubpages is all about inspiring each other - and it truly makes the world a much smaller and better place.    You have a lot of inspirational hub presentations yourself my friend - so it's true about that old adage - it takes one to know one. Sending you warm wishes and good energy , my fellow Canadian from Colin and his cats at lake erie time ontario canada 6:34pm to a most esteemed colleague as well Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on November 15, 2012: Denise, I am not surprised that you love many of these hubbers, as well, because I have often seen you around their pages, too. Have a wonderful night and thanks so much for the comment. Denise Handlon from North Carolina on November 06, 2012: Beautiful tribute here and a list of some of my favorite hubbers as well.  Rated up and A  :) Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on July 30, 2012: Stan, thank you! I appreciate such kind and eloquent words. It was an act of love, but it was not hard to do, because I truly have been blessed by so many here. And it is nice to ""meet"" you on Hubpages. Thank you so very much for coming by! stanwshura on July 29, 2012: What a gem of an idea for a hub!  Numbers are one thing, monetary reward (as fleeting as it is) is also motivating.  But for a fellow hubber to deliberately and craftfully pay tribute to those who have sparked your muse, informed you, their poetry sung to you - that's a labor of love.  And to labor so in writing - well, not only is it deliciously meta, it is a flatteringly perfect homage to use your space on this cite to pay tribute to them and theirs.  VERY classy.  :) Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on July 28, 2012: @AE, I am so glad that you had a chance to read it. Since coming on Hubpages,  I have always been moved by your graceful writing, and looked to your portfolio as something to aspire to.  I am so very glad for the success you have enjoyed  with your writing. Your writing about your Mom was so touching to me, and I related to your loss. I am not surprised that the two of you looked alike because it sounds like you were close in so many ways. Thank you so much for your kind words and encouragement. Have an amazing weekend! Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on July 28, 2012: @Kelley, thanks for coming by. I would highly recommend all of them. It's funny how there are so many people here at Hubpages and there are always new people to learn about. Have a wonderful weekend! Julianna from SomeWhere Out There on July 27, 2012: I don't know if I missed this or not; but what amazing compilation of hubbers. You are such a joy to have on HP and FB I count you as an online friend. Thank you for a tribute and people at church tell me that I remind them of Audrey too. I believe I am like my late mother and have now realized what a blessing that is. Beautiful hub and this one will surely be visited over and over again. You put your heart and soul into this list, I commend you. :) Thumbs up and shared! :) kelleyward on July 27, 2012: I know some of these great hubbers but there are also a few new to me. Thanks for writing this I'll check the others out soon! Kelley Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on July 27, 2012: @Jainismus, I am so glad you enjoyed the hub. Have a wonderful evening and thanks for the comment! Mahaveer Sanglikar from Pune, India on July 27, 2012: Interesting and inspiring Hub, thank you for sharing the information. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on May 22, 2012: Phdast, I am so glad that you know many of these people, too, and it'd be great if you were to ""meet"" a few more. Thanks again for reading, and have a wonderful week! Theresa Ast from Atlanta, Georgia on May 20, 2012: What a warm and lovely hub.  Some of these hubbers, I know...others I will have to get to know.    Have a great week.   :) Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on May 19, 2012: Audra, thank you so much for your kind comment! I was glad to be able to give back some appreciation to this group. Have a wonderful day and sorry for the delay in commenting back. I have been away from HP for a couple days. Take care! iamaudraleigh on May 17, 2012: I love reading tributes!  They are a great way to show how much they care about the work of others!  I like how you catagorized them too!  Well done!  Voted up indeed! Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on May 14, 2012: SS, thank you so much! I finally made it to 100! And that's okay, no pressure. You don't have to be funny all of the time, ha ha! Thanks for the Mother's Day wishes. Yes, I went to my husband's mother's and we went bearing gifts. It was very nice. I hope yours was good, as well. Take care, Sharyn. Sharilee Sharon Smith from Northeast Ohio USA on May 13, 2012: What a great tribute PP.  Thank you for including me among other inspiring writers.  Congrats on 100, make that 112 hubs :)  Ummm, I don't have anything funny to say right now?  Next time!  I hope you enjoyed Mother's Day. Sharyn Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on May 10, 2012: @Vinaya, you have impeccable taste in hubbers! Thanks for reading and taking the time to comment. @Whidbeywriter, thanks for your very edifying hubs! Have a wonderful day. @Cardelean, that's really makes HP special, isn't it? Above everything! Thank you so much for taking the time to comment. Take care! Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on May 10, 2012: @Poetic Fool, I was so glad to show honour to your wonderful poetry. And your hard work definitely shows in the finished product. Have a wonderful day! @Ruchira, thank you so much. That's great that you are familiar with all of these writers, too. They are a good bunch. Have an amazing day! Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on May 10, 2012: @Sunshine, thank you so very much! I had a wonderful birthday and I appreciate so much. Take care! @Hey Suburban Poet, I am so glad you found this. Yes, I absolutely adore your poetry and you definitely deserve any notice you get. Have a wonderful day! cardelean from Michigan on May 09, 2012: Another great list of hubbers!  I agree, it wasn't the google ranking or page layout for me either, it was the people. Mary Gaines from Oak Harbor on Whidbey Island, Washington on May 09, 2012: So beautiful of a hub and thank you for including me, this humbles me so much.  I am so glad that my hubs are an inspiration to you.  Blessings and much success here on hubpages!!! Vinaya Ghimire from Nepal on May 09, 2012: Interestingly, most of the hubbers on your list are also my favorites. Ruchira from United States on May 09, 2012: beautiful tribute. i agree most of them I follow and read and they sure are gifted writers. Poetic Fool on May 09, 2012: Prairieprincess, I am humbled to be included in your wonderful hub.  It is very gratifying to be even mentioned with all these fine writers and to learn my words have touched you.  It makes the labor of writing so very worth it.  Thank you for making my day! Mark Lecuona from Austin, Texas on May 09, 2012: Hey Hey Hey! Thank you for this hub and for mentioning me. It's an honor. I truly appreciate being noticed on a website with so many talented writers. Great hub. Linda Bilyeu from Orlando, FL on May 09, 2012: Well done tribute to fellow hubbers. You are very thoughtful. ~~~~~~ Happy Birthday ~~~~~~ Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on May 07, 2012: Docmo, very funny about not belonging!  Thanks so much for reading. You are definitely in the smart category and I do find your hubs very inspiring. Thank you so much for your kind words and take care! Mohan Kumar from UK on May 07, 2012: I am really touched by your wonderful tribute. There are so many great hubbers here and I am honored to be  included ( especially in the smart category - I can say you don't know me yet ;-) I think it has to be said that it takes such a generous and gracious spirit to do this and I have no hesitation in saying you belong here with the best, Prairie Princess. God bless you ! Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on May 01, 2012: Victoria, I am glad to recognize you. Your writing has moved me many times. And I'm glad I could introduce you to a few more. There are some great people on here! Thank you so much for your kind comments. Take care! Victoria Lynn from Arkansas, USA on April 29, 2012: PP--You touched my heart. Like billybuc, I didn't expect this today, and it has blessed me and lifted me. You are a lovely person and quality writer who is real, is a good writer, and writes a variety of interesting things. I am saving this hub to read about the other writers that I don't know, too. Thanks, sweet friend. I am so humbled. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on April 27, 2012: Robert, thank you so much for the read and the comment. Yes, it is nice to show my appreciation, and point other people in their direction. Hub love is a good thing! Have a wonderful night and take care. Robert Erich from California on April 27, 2012: Prairieprincess, you write incredibly well and I can tell that I will enjoy reading more of your articles. I think this is an awesome idea to point out great people for others to enjoy. This article is voted up and shared! Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on April 26, 2012: @Cindy, I have learned so much here, from these HP pros and it's been so educational. I'm glad I could give back in this hub. Take care and thanks so much! @MM, thank you so much for the votes and comment. Have a wonderful evening!

I like it that you don't just read on one or two topics. You have well rounded tastes. I have learned to stretch my wings in the last six months, expanding the subject matter I read. Thank you for including me on your list, what an honor. Blessings Prairie. The feeling is mutual. Deborah Neyens from Iowa on April 25, 2012: This is a great list and includes many of my favorites!

Have a wonderful day!! Bill Holland from Olympia, WA on April 25, 2012: What a beautiful tribute to some extraordinary writers...and I am humbled and grateful that you included me in this. Thank you so much my friend! This is kindness I did not expect today and you have brought a smile to my face."
17,Knoji (the rip-off site formerly known as Factoidz),community," Things have changed at Factoidz. And it's now known as Knoji. The comments on this hub are most enlightening, I suggest you only skim through the information on this page (which reflect how Factoidz USED to work) and read the first hand experiences in the comments before you make any decisions on whether or not to sign up for the site. Factoids are factual and informational articles, much like a hub, though not usually as long, and heavy on useful knowledge. Factoids are How-To's, DIY's, information and advice on subjects that others can learn from. The typical Factoid is concise and specific. Tightly focused on one aspect of a topic. At least 400 words in length, they're bite-sized pieces of knowledge. Topics are split into channels and relate to the following subjects: Addictions, astrology, beauty, business, cars, college, crystals, dieting, diy, dog training, dogs, etiquette, exercise, fitness, frugal living, gardening, gift ideas, green living, health, home business, home improvement, how to, internet, jobs, natural remedies, nutrition, parenting, personal finance, pets, photography, pregnancy, psychology, real estate, recipes, relationships, science, self help, self improvement, seo, spirituality, sports, stock market, travel, weddings, weight loss, wellness, wine and writing. All articles published on the site go through an editorial approval process so the level of quality appears to be much higher than the usual publishing website. What Factoidz IS is a site for readers to learn. And for writers it's a place to earn. Just like HubPages, Factoidz is a tool to publish your unique knowledge as articles and earn revenue.They want high-quality, original and unique factual articles.The factoids should describe a topic, present information, give advice or explain how to do something.Revenue is based on the the traffic they generate.Articles can be voted up by the community, adding points and prestige to your ranking. The forum also has voting enabled, and even as the person responding you can be voted up (or down, depending on how bad your advice or behaviour is).Duplicate content is not allowed. Much like HubPages stance on duplicate content, but the difference is while HubPages will give a HubScore penalty and also not allow outbound links on a hub containing duplicate content, Factoidz won't approve it at all.Factoids, as the name suggests, shoud be be information based on fact rather than something that is purely based on opinion.Here are some other points I have gleaned from the sites official FAQ and from the forum: 0 1 Member 3 2 Contributor 10 3 Author 25 4 Expert 50 5 Maven 75 6 Guide 100 7 Pro 150 8 Authority 200 9 Master 300 10 Guru Factoidz pays between $1.00 and $5.00 per 1,000 impressions. These rates of pay is not determined by your User Level, but by the profitability of the topic and the quality of your content.Each Factoid is ""graded"" by the editorial staff and it has been noted that if a regular topic article has writing that is exceptional, it can receive a higher payout rate.By the same token, there can be a submission to a High Yield Topic (when you're logged in and you're on your 'dashboard' there is a section which is a list of High Payout Topics) and editorial standards for those are also higher than normal, if they're below par they'll be quickly rejected so be sure to bring your A game.Factoidz used to be a site that shared Adsense ad impressions, much like HubPages, but a few months ago they changed it to paying per impression. By all accounts and from what I've seen in the forums, most prefer the change and it means more frequent payouts as there is no $100 threshold that Adsense has, you only have to earn at least $1 for the whole month to get paid. High+ $3.00 - $5.00 High $2.00 - $3.00 Med $1.00 - $2.00 Low $0.50 - $1.00 Payments are made via PayPal, so you'll need to setup a PayPal account if you haven't got one already. And it's a lot easier to get a PayPal account than an Adsense account.The minimum payment threshold is just $1. So anything over that amount by the end of the month, gets paid out early in the next month. 10 100 $1.00 $3.00 $5.00 50 100 $5.00 $15.00 $25.00 100 100 $10.00 $30.00 $50.00 500 100 $50.00 $150.00 $250.00 1,000 100 $100.00 $300.00 $500.00 I'll be posting some tips here as I experiment with topics and utilize different methods of traffic generation. In the meantime though I will mention that when you reach Level 5 (Maven... 50 articles published) you can apply to become a moderator of a channel. Moderators earn higher Payout Rates of $4 to $8 per 1,000 impressions on all their writing. 8 bucks per 1k impressions!But don't try to rush to get there. Quality is high on the Factoidz agenda. Now that you've read all this, guess what, they've changed the rules. There have been a lot of changes at Factoidz in recent months, none of which has been improvements. Sadly, they have taken a good and beautiful thing, and ruined it. So I've removed my referral links to the site. I highly caution anyone who wishes to sign up to the service.. I will publish more information soon on what changes have been made. If you're new to online publishing, beware of the swindlers and the sharks. I highly recommend signing up to HubPages if you haven't done so already. qeyler on May 16, 2013: Check to see if your stuff hasn't already been removed.  Quac has deleted a lot of stuff...Secondly...if your stuff is still there, contact the Attorney General of California.  Quac lives in California. Glen (author) from Australia on May 15, 2013: Shannon... you can't. Quoc won't remove your content. Effectively meaning he owns it. And he doesn't care what you want. ShannonR. on May 09, 2013: I'm an American...what can I do to get my work removed and my Factoidz account closed? qeyler on January 24, 2013: I love to re-read the comments ... one can see the Shills who poured in to 'defend' their Master, and how they fall silent.    Everyone now knows that Factoidz was a Ponzi, that Knoji is a rip off..even old pig Walch got ripped... ivanmarginal from Jakarta on January 14, 2013: Very useful, thanks! qeyler on November 01, 2012: There's a new site...and if you can tell your sites by the users, that old pig Walch is Shilling for it; it's called expertspages...and I think we know, anything Jerry Walch involved with has to be crooked. Glen (author) from Australia on November 01, 2012: HiHopes... I only just saw your message. I almost did publish the first one! But then I started reading your second one. I haven't been on here much because of offline work, study and opportunities. I would love to hear more! qeyler on July 14, 2012: The fact that all the Shills, even Jerry Walsh has fallen silent is all the proof one needs that everything written about Knoji is true. qeyler on July 13, 2012: Of course Quac lies; many people on Factoidz would see they had 1k views at 10am then 500 at 1 pm.  They'd see $13.43 then see $9.12.  This is STANDARD QUAC.   He used to work at Yahoo...emphasis on Used To and can never work for anyone again. Knoji is an unapologetic rip off.  No redeeming factors. Smartypants on July 05, 2012: Basically most Knoji writers are now writing ""reviews"" for companies. The articles are really nothing but cheap p.r. for the paying companies. Everybody knows copy writers are highly paid in the ad industry - but not at Knoji. Problem is, once you write for them, you can't get your article back or deleted. You are stuck to them like super glue. I think they fudge on page views also - inflate numbers to get more corporate customers; deflate page views to pay writers less. Advertised as high paying for reviews. Whatever. Sucks. qeyler on July 04, 2012: people were warned as early as March; before the site of Knoji was actually launched as to what it was...they might have listened is so many of the old Factoidz shills hadn't been running around attacking those who tried to send up the flare. They are silent now because they are getting 8c an article. the owner, Mike Quac, has never failed to exploit the gullibility of people. athena09 from Philippines on July 01, 2012: It's getting crazier and crazier there. Browse through the Help Forum to see how they treat their writers http://help.knoji.com/questions/ qeyler on June 21, 2012: What you do is look at the top of this page.  Click on Start a New Hub.  It will guide you through the steps. It is very easy Norma Lawrence from California on June 18, 2012: I have been a member of HubPages for 2 years but have not published any thing.  Could someone tell be where I can find some ideas on what I should do to submit an article.  I would really appreciate it.  I am leaving Knoji and I need a place to submit articles. Thank you qeyler on June 17, 2012: To Lydia...... Quac has speeded up the rip off on Knoji.  In 4 months he's roped a lot of idiots onto his site, gotten their work for a few pennies, and is now, doing his usual Factoidz thing...that is syndicating what is good to sites all over the world and getting cash and locking out the writer. What happened to you is going to happen to every single person who joins Knoji, save the Shills.  The Shills, so hungry for that 50c will continue to support him.   They will flock onto sites like this and as guests post crap and lies about people they don't know, trying to make it seem that they were locked off for ' breaking the rules.' Most people are too stuped think; 'how would this Asole know that this other guy broke the rules?  What, is there a public announcement forum thee?  Are banners put on the site?'  And know, that the guest user is a shill who gets 50c every time he she or it attacks another writer. Lydia on June 17, 2012: Hi I do not know what is going on at Knoji.  I tried to access the web site this morining and access was denied.  I got a 403 error.  I was able to start publishing again and I sent in 5 articles over 2 days and 3 were rejected and I was suspended from publishing again.  I thought they had locked out my account but I tried to access articles written by 2 other writers and the articles show up but when I try to access them I am denied access.  Maybe they have denied me access to anything that pertains to Knoji.  On writer complained yesterday on the forum that they were shorted 130.00.  Does anyone know why I keep getting a ""access denied 403 error?"" By the way there was nothing wrong with my articles.  They said 2 did not meet their standards and 1 had grammar and spelling errors which it did not. Thanks qeyler on June 14, 2012: Factoidz was a Ponzi scheme.  Simple as that. Just as in a Ponzi the first investors get paid, then reinvest and their money is used to pay the next set of investors, Quac uses the revenue from 'members' to pay his Shills and New blood. Knoji is a dumbed down ugly Factoidz full of crap which pays less than any other site on the 'Net.  And I'm talking Less than Hubpages, Less than Triond, Less than Wikinut. LESS. It is pure rip off after your first 20 articles.  During the 1 - 19 it is a 75% rip off; and fools think that the next article will net more. Having been on numberous sites the basic point is that he fools other sites, i.e. Hubpages with threats of Law suits which are crap because he can't sue.  It isn't libel when it is TRUE.   And how many hundreds, thousands of people can post the exact same thing that is posted here? Knoji is a dead loss. Lydia on June 13, 2012: Mike has a new venture at Knoji.  He wants everyone that have a lot of followers on Facebook, Tweeter and other sites to sign up and promote Knoji.  He is taking applications now.  He has one writer that is ""Autority"" and a Moderator that has over 5,000 views on an article and has made 0 cents for view pay.  He says it is because the article is not ranking high enough on Google.  I has been over 40 days now and have not heard from anyone at Knoji. Lydia Moitoza on June 11, 2012: Knoji is no better than Factoidz.  I have been suspended for over a month for grammer errors.  I had published over 200 articles they were happy with and all of a sudden they decided they did not like my grammer.  According to there rules I should have been back publishing in 10 days.  Knoji has no rules and they still do not answer questions or address writer concerns.  Many writers have quiet and gone else where.  Mike is now concentrating on company reviews, coupon promotion and company snapshots.  This was going good but now writers are complaining about pay.  Some of the writers have received over 4500 views in a very short time on one article and have not received 1 cent in pay.  Mike is blaming google and the change over from Factoidz.  He says there are glitches and they are fixing them.  This has been going on for weeks and the pay just gets worse.  You can not run an article site without answering your writers questions and addressing their concerns.  According to one of the moderators the articles submitted are Knoji's forever.  I had never heard of that.  There are sites that keep you articles for 1 year then you can do what ever you want.  I read Knoji's terms and they said the writer keeps the copyright to their articles.  You can request to have your articles deleted from their site but if they take care of that as well as they do answering question you will be dead first. qeyler on May 15, 2012: The Shills have fallen a bit quieter since Factoidz became Knoji.  Firstly, the Cockup at Factoidz had the advisory going out to Members not to Staff WRiters.  Secondly, Knoji is joke.  It gives an activity 'bonus' of 30c and the articles are of very very low quality. Glen (author) from Australia on May 14, 2012: Lydia, it won't get fixed. It is run and always has been run by a very corrupt individual. 300 articles and a poor excuse that you did not meet up to their editorial standards. If you didn't, then there shouldn't be a problem with those articles being deleted from Knoji. But no, Mike Quoc will continue to benefit and earn from them, while you do not. Even if you did get a dribble of money thrown your way, you'd still not be earning what those articles are worth. He'll always be the one making the most money, and unfortunately due to his greed, he wants 100% rather than the 99% he was making off it when you were able to contribute. May I suggest you check out this hub: https://hubpages.com/literature/zujava for a site that won't rip you off. Or even get started here at hubpages: https://discover.hubpages.com/community/howhubwork Lydia on May 11, 2012: I started with Factoidz and then it went to Knoji for less than 5 months  I have published over 300 articles  and all of a sudden I got suspended because my articles did not meet their editorial standards.  I have over 85,000 views and I have made less than a dollar on my views.  I also write articles for 2 newspapers and 3 magazines so I know I can write.  I also have a degree in journalism.  They do not know this.  I love to write so am looking for a site I can publish animal and travel articles on.  I also like to submit recipes. I agree with you the site is getting bad and there is no support for the writers.  It was a good site so I really hope they get thing fixed.  They have tightened up their requirements on publishing that you will have to be a professional. qeyler on March 25, 2012: https://hubpages.com/literature/Modern-Fairy-Tale-... I cracked up qeyler on March 25, 2012: BTW...The Factoidz/Knoji Shills are out!  One has used the nick Hellen and another Martin and left an email address..Ride@ymail.com. Can you believe these jerks? Marie - former Factoidz writer on March 25, 2012: Re: Factoidz, now doing business as Knoji.com has transferred my articles to their new site after I repeatedly ask them to be deleted from Factoidz. I own these aticles, not Factoidz nor Knoji; they are copyrighted and used on my own website. People write me that Factoidz-Knoji is plagiarizing my articles. I do not get attribution, payment, or a profile on Factoidz or Knoji - it says the author - who is me and un-named,  has 0 articles 0 votes 0 followers when in fact I have and had over 100 articles, over 200,000 views and 257 followers. If Factoidz a/k/a Knoji does not remove ALL my artiicles I will continue to write on Facebook these injustices by singling me out and not others on their site(s).  I will continue to give attention to this matter until it is taken care of until Mike Quoc deletes my articles and anything that has to do with me on this this site. That includes putting them under another name like you've done to others in the past and still do.  That is major corruption.  I never signed anything or agreed to the terms that this site continually changed. I stand by the original terms which they have breached. My titled articles are googled right to Factoidz/Knoji(F-K) and still have advertisers on them which means F-K are receiving income on them, income I never received as stated in original TOS. I will be the first negative on Knoji's Better Business site and issue a statement on Google that I am the owner of these articles and not you. I trust you will do the right thing and delete all mention of my name and all of my articles as you have done for past Factoidz/Knoji  writers and I expect the same consideration for me. There is a spreadsheet circulating of all the many, writers who have been wronged by this website.  They were never told why they are 'cut' off and their articles are still being published by them.   Many of them have the original TOS which states they will receive future remuneration for their articles.   The TOS have been changed many times without notice and/or these writers agreeing to them.   Once you write for them, they will demote you, never contact you personally to tell you why, will ban you from the site and your statistics, not allow you to update, delete or change your articles and use your breached copyrighted articles for their monetary purposes. qeyler on March 24, 2012: Many of those who posted 18 months ago gushing about Factoidz are now complaining because the same knife stick sheep, stick goat. The policy at Factoidz has been, for the past two years, to get about 100 good articles from a user, paying a bit more than other sites, then drop them to member, confiscate their articles, use the revenue those articles generate to play the shills and to top up new writers accounts. Due to the various LAW SUITS Quoc has changed the name of Factoidz to Knoji.  He hopes to fool the public into joining what is Factoidz; a copyright eating ponzi scheme. Glen (author) from Australia on March 24, 2012: Beware of Knoji. Different name, same sinister owner. knoji.com is a wolf dressed up in sheeps clothing. Chen Lee on January 23, 2012: I am on the fence about Factoidz, I have several good writing friends who are long time writers with the site, and they have said great things about it and recommended it to me. Now that I read this discussion I'm a little confused and concerned. Another point of confusion: when researching Factoidz I investigated their history with the Better Business Bureau they have an A- rating, and when I looked there were no reports of anyone having issues with the site. Why haven't people here taken steps to protect other writers and report your problems to the BBB? If you just report it, it would show up at least, and be a signal to other writers (many look up the BBB record before signing up). I'm going to ask some more people and see what they say... Glen (author) from Australia on January 19, 2012: So I'm not credible because you are unable to understand the message ""Your comment has been submitted. However, it may not appear until it has been approved by the author."" after you've made your post? liane on January 18, 2012: Censor much? I am convinced now that Darkside is not credible. My comment about Factoidz was deleted. Darkside.. please do not stop us from simply telling the truth about our experience at Factoidz.. it is better than any other site and I stand by it! liane on January 18, 2012: Any website that is large enough will have a few disgruntled people.. I am a proud writer on the Factoidz website and personally prefer it to any other out there! qeyler on January 18, 2012: Ruby, what you have written is NOT TRUE.  Factoidz is a Ponzi.  You may, unwittingly, have been made one of Quac's shills, to run around and claim how wonderful the site is. The vast MAJORITY of writers WILL  be ripped off.  They will have their earnings plummet, or they will be locked out of the site. If you read all the posts, esp. Darkside, you will have a very accurate portrait; first elation and lots of $$, then rejection, drop in earnings, then...lock out. Ruby Samy on January 18, 2012: I have a positive experience with Factoidz and have been writing for the site since Jan 2010. Factoidz is indeed the best paying website on the internet. I get my highest earnings from factoidz. And with the new activity bonus the earnings have increased a lot. I have come across many people complaining but in reality if you stick to factoidz and write regularly you can indeed make a decent amount monthly. I have expereince with helium, triond, bukisa and many other writing websites but to me Factoidz is the top writing website. qeyler on December 05, 2011: Duchess, and others, Factoidz is a Ponzi.  Quac bathes in the money he rips off.  His Shills, poor sick animals, aren't as vociferious as before. Duchess OBlunt on December 02, 2011: Wow, I am so happy I searched this subject on HubPages before I tried out this particular site.  Your article and the comments have really given me pause.  And for that I am grateful.  Thanks to everyone who shared your experiences! Viewpoint59 on August 05, 2011: I am a Factoidz victim. There are hundreds like me. It is definitely a ponzi scheme. It is the game of a single swindler. I was lured into the trap about a year ago. The trap is set like this. There are a few writers of the site who are with the fraudster and they are given a share of the loot. The would tom tom their gain and new writers sign up. They would be paid higher than other sites and they would work more. When it reaches above 100 articles, the grab starts. First you may be demoted from a staff writer’s status to a writer’s. For this some fake violation may be alleged. Then you may be made just a member without any pay. First the income will go up. Then it will stay for a month. Then it will begin to decline. Finally it will reach a few dollars or cents, virtually your content is stolen. You cannot delete your content. If you delete it from each page. The thief will reload it. Even if you ask for an answer a hundred times, you will not get a reply. When I reached 50 articles, I got nearly $50. So I worked hard and reached 80 and I got nearly $100. I was excited and in a few days I reached 100 and next pay was around $100. I was still excited and reached 250 within a month working most of my time. Then my payment came down to $60 dollars. I asked for an explanation. I was demoted to “writer”. I again wrote; a few of my articles were deleted and I was banned alleging a fake violation. I had raised the issue at the forum. Similar many other issues were alive at the forum and the stink was spreading. So the writers’ forum was shut down without any explanation. No I am placed as a writer with a monthly payout of around $4. I have repeatedly requested to delete my account and content. But no avail. The thief has stolen my 265 articles. All unique content. The initial payment lasted only for 2 to 3 months. A ponzi scheme. A lot of victims have written about the story of the thief at several online forums. Now to escape it he is writing on his own site in others’ names defending the site. Also he writes at many places on the Internet in others’ names to defend the site.

It stayed up for about 2 days before being hidden from public viewing. Clicking it now will only take you to the front page of the Factoidz scam... Sara Valor from Southern, USA on July 11, 2011: Great new article concerning the factoidz scam, but you need to check it out before it is deleted. Read, share and let others know before this info is gone... http://factoidz.com/the-death-of-content-farms-nav... Linda Smith on July 08, 2011: I am not seeing dollars per 1000 views. Views earn a penny maybe a few pennies. Bonuses for product comparisons etc, that are up to $10, or $20, etc end up being less than one-half of those amounts.  If a comparison bonus is $10 max, expect to get paid $4-5 at best.  The earnings continue to drop. Glen (author) from Australia on May 04, 2011: Thanks for the update! Sara Valor from Southern, USA on May 03, 2011: Hi Darkside, I just want to make a note of the latest update on my blog. http://seekyt.com/website-review-factoidz-the-expe... As of now, it seems that all my work has been removed for the second time from the offending site. I'm thankful! Sara Valor from Southern, USA on April 18, 2011: ...and the story deepens as Factoidz cohort tampers with my Yahoo Buzz Up account. You can read the message sent to various Yahoo twitter accounts in hopes of there actually being an honest person behind those twitter user names. http://www.twitlonger.com/show/9tudrq ...and here is an edit reply, because I wanted the message to Yahoo! to be crystal clear that they have a corporate employee that holds more loyalty to the owner of this business scam than he or she may hold for their position at Yahoo! http://www.twitlonger.com/show/9u0jpk After finding my Yahoo account tampered with by a yahoo employee, unless of course someone hacked Yahoo to get to my account, I decided that using http://twitter.com/ to send the message with better odds of the owners being alerted that their site has a trusty cohort of Mike Quoc's in their mists. I Did Not want to take the chance of this important message to Yahoo! to be intercepted by a shady character. So, here it is for all the world to see!

Glen (author) from Australia on April 17, 2011: You're spot on the money there BeatsMe. Obviously not a long term strategy. And strengthens my theory that some people are just predisposed to being scammers. The types of people if they did actually make an effort to go legit would be very successful, but they can't keep from screwing people over. It's hardwired into their nature. BeatsMe on April 17, 2011: Sounds like a scam. I wonder why they'd ruin their own business. If they don't scam people, they can continue doing business with many serious online writers. With what they did, many will just stay away from their site. Sara Valor from Southern, USA on April 10, 2011: And now Factoidz stoops to Slander! Anyone else being slandered by Factoidz? Or am I just the biggest loud mouth right now and they are picking on me because of the attention? Updated: http://seekyt.com/website-review-factoidz-the-expe... I am curious though, why would Mike Quoc of the Factiodz scam make me an offer to come back if I ever did those things they are saying I did? Good website owners will not offer to have a scammer come back to his site and never have to write another word for his site, so what is up with that? Do you think an honest webmaster would ask a scammer to come back to his site? gerald on April 03, 2011: of course i read some articles and i wonder some have more than 100 articles then demoted to become members.that truly unfair. some writer need to come out in the open for a writer the right to freedom of expression must come to tell the truth not conceit a site which steal writer articles..and the moderation process is turtle now days.. Glen (author) from Australia on April 01, 2011: More voices crying out to be heard. Sara Valor from Southern, USA on March 31, 2011: Yet another link for researching the Factoidz scam - http://www.infobarrel.com/Factoidz_Review Sara Valor from Southern, USA on March 26, 2011: Hi Darkside, just leaving a link for anyone trying to do more research on this situation http://seekyt.com/website-review-factoidz-the-expe... Beenthere on February 12, 2011: This is the fishiest writing site outside the ocean - Been ripped off and feel stupid for writing as many articles as I did before I saw the dupe- now I only hope nobody reads what I wrote. Buyer (writer) beware of Factoidz Glen (author) from Australia on January 28, 2011: Natasha, if I were you I'd be thankful. Because as soon as you have a problem or a question, that's when you find out that the one man band isn't all that keen on communication. And the changes have been ridiculous. Why? Because it's akin to moving the goalposts. A change is made to the Terms, though Mike Quoc didn't update the Terms that everyone could see (the original Terms of Service having been stolen from this very site, the dufus forgot to change the office address) and then somehow we're supposed to know this? And the forum has not been moved, it's a different forum. This one http://factoidz.com/user-forum/ was where contributors could discuss things. Where posts and whole threads would go missing, because people asked questions he didn't like or disagreed with changes (and quite civilly I might add). He shut down the forum and for a long time it said that it was ""temporarily"" offline. Now it just redirects to the front page. NatashaP on January 25, 2011: Hey all, I've written with Factoidz since Dec 2008 and haven't had any issues. They did change their system a lot, they used to use Adsense now they pay by Paypal, and I think that caused some issues for some. They moved their forum to http://factoidz.com/forum/. sligobay from east of the equator on December 20, 2010: Just the facts, sir. Thanks for the review. Glen (author) from Australia on November 30, 2010: And if you do have a problem, be sure to stop by the Forum: http://factoidz.com/user-forum/ Oh no, wait, it says ""Oops! The Help Forum is temporarily down for maintenance."" And temporary seems to be a looooong time at Factoidz world. Glen (author) from Australia on November 30, 2010: Anish, let us know how you go in 12 months time if you've had a problem and try and get answers. anish92 on November 30, 2010: Haven't received payment from Factoidz yet, as I have only been there for 3 weeks. But it is the only site I know where you can make $40 in the first three weeks (take me for example). One more thing, you get around $.70 per 1000pvs but also receive perks called Activity Bonus for publishing and marketing your articles and that way should make around $7 per 1000PVs (as in my case) Ne1 who has written for Suite101 should not have an issue with the Factoidz editorial system. Nonnie on November 08, 2010: Took a peek at the BBB information for Factoidz.  Not content to lie elsewhere,even this information isn't accurate:  first of all, how can your title be ""CEO"" when the business is a ""sole proprietorship""--then, I note that although a California address is shown, the company is a NEVADA LLC.  The TOS specifies San Francisco as the venue for legal issues, but the Attorney General of CA isn't going to have much to say about how a Nevada LLC is run. Sara Valor from Southern, USA on November 07, 2010: I just found this in Google search, it is something brand new, just a few weeks old, a covering of butt no doubt. http://www.bbb.org/greater-san-francisco/business-... However, with the increase of the amount of voices of objection to the BBB site will make a significant mark against whatever is on there now. Also, you can contact not only the BBB, but the American Civil Liberties Union http://www.aclu.org/ California Attorney General Website http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/guide/comptable... Here is a Sample of Compliaint Letter for the site above http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/guide/complain.... I'd recommend all the Factoidz writers who find themselves in this situation to contact every resource available to them. Anon... on November 06, 2010: Why are we all letting this snake Mick Quac screw us over?  Lets grow a goddamn backbone and pay him a visit at his house.  He will not get away with this, at least not as long as my articles are up.  He must leave his house sometimes, and I imagine one of those times he does, he will be met by people he has screwed over.  Man he has got some balls, but people like this always get theirs.  It's just a matter of time. Glen (author) from Australia on October 12, 2010: Loxxy, publishing at Factoidz is the worst thing you could possibly do. Unfortunately it's not the kind of site where you can read the ToS and skim through the forum and have a good idea of how well (or how badly) its being run. As the ToS is often out of date because the rules get changed, and the forums... well Mike Quoc deletes every thread that has the slightest hint of questioning and as that little adventure in censorship must have been too effort for him to keep up, he just deleted the whole members forum anyway. I know of quite a few who still have articles up but he downgraded the accounts from Writer to Member so they no longer get any revenue. But they'd still be earning, just that he gets to keep the money for himself. Loxxy on October 12, 2010: Very helpful info on Factoidz!  I just became a writer but have not submitted any articles and am now inclined to simply forget it!  Please post any new information, folks! Sara Valor from Southern, USA on October 03, 2010: Hi Dustin, you can add these numbers to mine if you like, I created all this traffic to the Factoidz site, since you ask for some numbers, these are what I will offer you.

It would seem that Factoidz would reward Dustin with more cash for all the traffic and views he brings to the site.  Others have had over 100,000 views and they, too, brought in from 34 cents to 50 cents for 1,000 views. In Factoidz' original TOS, it was quoted as payment of $4.00 to 10.00 for 1,000 views.   Then it went to 'up to $10.00 for 1,000 views' based on new TOS terms of SEO words, high quality content and search ranking. Someone {(?) it is never revealed or answered} ranks them and you can go from V. High to Med in a short period of time - sometimes immediately. And your pay is decreased.  Someone {?} judges 'high-quality' content and that, too, is never explained or answered. And your pay is cents. No one ever answers emails or comments - so it is wondered who does this. Factoidz claims it has 'experts' - their writers - who answer questions -in a Q&A Forum - but they are not credited experts, but writers who have submitted 20 articles and in some cases Factoidz new members answer questions who have written no articles and no one knows anything about them, but their names and they are obvious fabricated names.  They are experts? Since Factoidz' communication is none-existent, they don't answer any emails and they do not respond to writers' pleas to explain the earnings. Factoidz instead chose to 'censor' the writers by either demoting them or deleting their messages in the now defunct forum.   The new TOS says the writers should read the TOS and it is their responsibility to abide by them.  If they don't, and abide by the ever-changing TOS, they are demoted to Factoidz Writer and if they ask why or want an explanation, they are demoted further to Member whereby members status writers no longer receive $$ on residuals - which was Factoidz' original draw to the writing community.  Now Factoidz must keep the residual pay?  Who else would get the money?   Factoidz doesn't tell writers that in their TOS.  It is unethical for a writing site to make rules, and say you have to abide by them and by doing so, you are approving them.  Wrong.   If writers have saved their receipts of unopened emails to Factoidz where the writers say they don't want to abide by those rules, then Factoidz has put themselves in a shaken corner where they don't communicate, don't listen, can't be reached, change their rules for their benefit, intimidate the writers to not 'make waves', delete their comments, demote them and then reap the benefits when they collect all the member's residual monies.  This site needs to be investigated for exploiting writers with unfair business practices. Samuel Johnson on September 29, 2010: I received the following information from Dustin LaBarge, the writer who has attracted more page views than any other on the site at about 822,371 (pulled off of his profile page at http://factoidz.com/profile/dlabarge/ at approximately 11:34 AM 29SEP2010). I am presenting facts and hard numbers here, not impressions. The following is NOT intended to be a defense of or an assault against Factoidz, but merely to relate the earning statistics that writer Dustin LaBarge gave to me. If you desire to confirm any of this information, you can send an e-mail to him at xcdustin@gmail.com. The following is a direct quote from an e-mail sent to me by Dustin yesterday, 28SEP10: ""I will be passing over the 820,000 page view mark sometime tomorrow. I joined this site at the end of February of this year. As of today, I have earned (and received in my PayPal account) a total of $236.33 from Factoidz. The simple answer is that Factoidz has paid me a grand total of 34.7 cents per 1000 views since I joined them (you can achieve the same answer by dividing 820,000 by 23,633). As of today, I have 233 articles published, with 105 achieving a Medium, 6 getting a High rating, and the remaining 122 achieving a low rating. By comparing these numbers and my earnings to the TOS, one can see that the result is only marginally consistent. Factoidz has paid the money that it has claimed to owe me each and every month I have been a member, with the exception of last month. Recently, Factoidz introduced an ""Activity Bonus,"" and this feature did not perform as advertised last month. I will be happy to tell you if it does this month."" Those were the contents of Mr. LaBarge's e-mail. I took the liberty of copying the following text from the terms of service at http://factoidz.com/help/seo-rank-faq.php. ""While the specific payout rates will fluctuate, in general, a High SEO Rank article will earn approximately $2.00 to $4.00 per 1,000 views and a Very High SEO Rank article will earn between $4.00 to $10.00 per 1,000 views. Med ranking articles generally earn $0.50 to $2.00 per 1,000 views, and Low ranking articles earn less than $0.50 per 1,000 views. Our system is designed to give outsized rewards to high-ranking articles and to authors who consistently produce pieces that rank well. In other words, a few hits can carry your earnings each month - so your time is best spent focusing on a few great pieces rather than publishing a high quantity of work."" It would perhaps be more helpful in the future to publish specific numbers. I hope Mr. LaBarge will not mind my volunteering his information, but others might find their comments more credible if they are accompanied by hard data. Any questions and responses to my post are welcome. Using the previous information, I invite you to judge for yourself the validity of the Factoidz site. Glen (author) from Australia on September 28, 2010: Sara, I've enabled the contact link in my profile now. Email me. We need to talk. Sara Valor from Southern, USA on September 28, 2010: You are most welcome darkside. Freelance writers need to know that Factoidz is cheating people while constantly changing their TOS to suit their mood or financial needs. Right now, I'm ready to start talking to anyone who will listen, Google, Yahoo, Bing, NBC, CBS, Fox, Oprah, Ellen DeGeneres, and any interested Writer Advocate or anyone else for that matter and I will use SEO to do so. I'm not sure what Fz is thinking, but I do not think the world wants to know that he is cheating not only hard working freelance writers, but small Hurricane Katrina Victims as well. If there is some type of investigation, I have screen shots of my dashboard showing the inconsistency of view counts. And I'd be happy to offer any information I know or have to help make this right! Again, thank you darkside for exposing this to the online world, you have done a good thing to protect others! Glen (author) from Australia on September 28, 2010: Valory, I am so glad you shared your story. My own personal experience is of the same result. My account has been downgraded to that of a member (instead of a writer) and I no longer earn a single cent from my published articles. But of course someone is. And the members forum has been closed down. So now he doesn't have to be annoyed by people asking uncomfortable questions. You and I aren't only persons saying it. There are others who have experienced or witnessed what has happened. It's one big online con job. Juan Gomez  on September 28, 2010: It's like a Ponzi scheme.  It worked in the beginning I'm told - $4.00 to $10.00 for 1000 views - then it changed and changed to ""up to $10.00 for 1000 views but it depends on content, SEO, and other BS that no one knows. It appears they have 'favorites'.   Most writers say they get between $.50 to $1.00 for 1000 views.  No one answers questions, they took out the community forum and squelch communication; if you ask questions they censor you by taking away your messaging and comments. If you ask why, they demote you to Member - and guess what?  They keep ALL your residuals.  It said in a webpage on writing sites that 'if no one talks to you in an email or person in a couple of months' it is a red flag to not write there.  The turnover is fast and new unsuspecting writers come in thinking it will be good and it is bad - very, very bad.  They are supposed to be investigated - maybe things will improve.  Where is the ACLU? Sara Valor from Southern, USA on September 28, 2010: Hi, this is Sara Valor My profile at Factoidz: http://factoidz.com/profile/Sara_Valor/ I have 221 articles published on that site. I entered with 80 articles when I first walked in the site. I reached Maven status in just a couple of days. Within just a few more days, I had over 100 articles published on Factoidz. I have driven so much traffic to Factoidz, thinking it was a good site for freelance writers, I was wrong. To Date and Just My Own: Factoid views Today: 2,106 Yesterday: 876 < This is a lie, since I know that the views were up to 1,807 (Also noted by another Factoidz writer) All time: 390,330 Factoidz sounded like a great place for new writers and I had noticed from some of their older articles that they really needed some good reading over there, since much of what I did find while researching for other things were lacking in any good or beneficial information. If you go back to some of the older articles on the site, you may find some of this yourself. However, I would not recommend that you click and read anything on that site any more, not even my own articles, since I feel that before it is all over with, Mike will figure out how to cheat any of the writers on Factoidz out of all their hard work. I was wrong about it being a great place for freelance writers who want to make income with a revenue sharing site that made TOS statements like: ""Regardless of how little content you add, you could publish nothing; you will continue to receive passive income from the articles you have previously published"" To be quite honest and frank, I began writing online so I can work at home and still be with my children. We are living in a trailer that is falling down around us after Hurricane Katrina came through here. I am an older single mother, trying to raise two children by myself. I found Factoidz, it seemed like a good thing for freelance writers, and I began to build something that according to their TOS (especially that noted above) would still keep working for me and my kids. In anything I do, this is what I am working for, to be able to buy a home that is safe and healthy again for my children. Factoidz is cheating me and my kids… As far as Mike Quoc, he is nice and friendly when you are doing something he wants or likes. When you begin asking questions, you are threatened with being banned. The person (I‘ll not say man, since I think that men should conduct themselves much better than the owner of Factoidz, a good man is an honest man), meaning M.Q. is rude, apparently greedy for money or the joy of cheating others out of their own rights. He is terse, short and more than disrespectful if he decides he will grace you with a reply if it‘s not something he is into or agrees with. (At least this is how he acts towards me. However, habits love reoccurrence and there may be others that are treated this very as well. ) Mike Quoc of Factoidz is not straightforward when talking with you via email. It is like trying to figure out which side of the mulberry bush, you should run around to figure out what the heck he means. He leaves the door wide open to confusion for the person he's conversing with or at least that is how he comes off to me. Granted, I was new to article submissions and such when I got on the site, I still have a lot to learn about many online things. However, after reading the TOS, and reading other articles I saw that some of them were adding affiliate links to their articles; one of the other writers even published an article there encouraging us to add our affiliate links to our Factoidz articles. That was a Published article on the Factoidz site, Published by Factoidz. I figured ok, if this helps add funding to my personal mission of buying a safe and healthy home for my kids it‘s a good thing, so I joined Amazon and then added some of my own links in the next few articles. Well, then the TOS was changed and that was against Factoidz rules, even though that particular article may still be there... (I did explain all this to Mike Quoc the owner of Factoidz, as far as I know the article is still there, it was the last time I looked. I imagine Factoidz is probably still making money on that one too even though it is not within the TOS rules of Factoidz) Google Adsense is what Factoidz were using when I first started on the site I joined in there too. Then just a little while afterwards, some of the other freelance writers were talking about making money and they changed us from Google Adsense to Factoidz paying us monthly. That worked out nicely to begin with; however, in hindsight, we all should have realized that eventually with all the confusing protocol of Factoidz and their constantly changing TOS to suit the owners of Factoidz personal needs, with no true regard for the writers, would eventually take away some of our rights as writers of original content. It may be Mike Quoc’s ideal change of TOS, since we are still padding his own pocket. In the world I live in, this is called THIEVERY. According to the dictionary, Thievery means Steal: to Steal something, or Steal things. This, just about everyone with good sense knows is Bad Business protocol. Also, Factiodz did insist on giving due credit where credit is due, while using photos for the site. I had won a years supply of handmade soaps by DeShawn Marie. Great handmade soaps btw, give them a try. Well, I decided since I had won this free year of monthly handmade soaps and they are good, that I would write product reviews on them. I asked DeShawn Marie if I could use the photos of her handmade soaps along with my product reviews, she said yes. So, while submitting three different articles concerning the subject, I added the photo per each and then gave due credit and a link back. I had seen that other writers had added links back to a site they were giving due credit too. I thought I was doing the right thing, since at the time the TOS did not say anything about using the photos of others and not giving credit or a link back. I thought I was doing the proper thing by adding the credit and link for the photo use on the Factoidz site. Also, there are or were articles by other freelance writers on Factoidz that would discuss a subject and then provide links to some of their other articles on the Factoidz site that were relevant to the subject. Apparently, when I did this, Mike didn’t want me too; however, while conversing with me about this, he did not say to me, “Do not place links for photo credit and do not place links to your other articles“. Although, there are many others who were adding the same types of links to their articles. While trying to talk with Mike Quoc, I find him to be shady in his way of wording his communications; he causes confusion while conversing. And then will not answer after confusing you, which unfortunately leads to negative feelings or thoughts on the matter. Perhaps, this is just his way of being able to slip around and turn things around on you while trying to talk or work something out. I do not know, I have tried figuring this out on my own but am still confused. I would be interested in knowing his birthday, that might help me figure out why he acts like this… Now, he will tell you, or he told me that I had received four warnings. I will tell you this is a lie. Not once, did I receive any type of official warning and if I did, I never realized it, since there is not means of official warning that I am aware of and with his words, he is confusing. There was never, ever an email with a Warning message of subject title, which is how I would imagine that other reputable websites might use. So, if he did warn me 4 times, I never knew that is what they were. So, I still stand on the comment that it is not true and this is a lie. I am a good team player when everyone is playing by the rules. Most of the time I am quite charming and flexible. Changing the rules to cover your own self and interests without regard to those who are working by writing and then driving traffic to a site is a bad game play. I am not someone who goes around making trouble or doing my best not to follow the rules. I think cashmere from India on September 13, 2010: I just started out on Factoidz about 2-3 months back, have not earned more than a few cents in each month. Have about 15 articles there. Glen (author) from Australia on August 30, 2010: I'm hearing ya Fred! Michael Quoc has proven to be a greedy little bastard. I see the members forum has been shut down. Were the natives restless? I hadn't been there for a while. Though I did log in to my account at least once a week. I no longer earn from the 17 articles I published. Michael Quoc is keeping all the earnings. Michael Quoc stole his ToS from HubPages and now he's stealing the earnings of his authors. Fred Flintstone on August 30, 2010: Factoidz use to be a better site - now it's going to hell in a handbasket.  All rules are changed.  Check out the Terms of Service - you sign over everything in return for a few dollars each month. Even your rights to your articles.  If you complain, they demote you and if you complain again, they take away your rights to articles.  They use to have a good community of writers who wrote in a community forum, but they took that away so members cannot communicate with each other. All writers have complained they don't answer questions even for months and months.   Don't go here if you are interested in having a fair and balanced site - they are secretive, misleading and pay writers according to their own schedule and not the rules. Up to $10 for 1,000 views - Ha - it's more like 50 cents and even less for 1,000 views.   The SEO ratings change if your views get too high. And articles are rated by editors who are rating them on their opinion and not content.  If there are editors - it's a hush-hush operation.  0 contacts.   A rip-off deal. Don't waste your words. Glen (author) from Australia on July 30, 2010: I am unable to reveal secrets because I myself don't know them. What I'm saying is the site admin is secretive. My tip is, don't sign up to Factoidz. I no longer publish articles there. If I felt the same way about HubPages I'd be able to remove my published articles but over there you can't do it, you have to request to have them removed. And when I did that the site admin told me he could delete my account, but he'd keep my articles. Dawn Michael from THOUSAND OAKS on July 30, 2010: really would love to learn more, if you have any reveling secrets? Glen (author) from Australia on July 30, 2010: Dawn, you should realize that none of these rules and guidelines still apply. They've been changed. A few times in fact since I've first published this hub. Changes get made all the time, without warning, and without it being beneficial to the author. There are details that also remain secret. They won't tell you now what your article is worth as they did before. Dawn Michael from THOUSAND OAKS on July 29, 2010: very interesting thak-you for sharing never knew that it existed!! Glen (author) from Australia on July 24, 2010: I'd never trust them, and by them I mean Mike Quoc, to do the right thing. He changes the rules far too often, and doesn't let anyone know until after he has done it, and he certainly doesn't update the sites Terms of Service. A Terms of Service that was originally ripped off from HubPages. He even forgot to remove their office details until it was pointed out to him! SteveoMc from Pacific NorthWest on July 24, 2010: That was both exciting and depressing!   LOL  thanks for updating at the end.   I was all gung ho 80% thru the article and then, I read your last entry and got deflated.  The original format sounded right up my alley.  Hope they get it together and return to some sanity. Glen (author) from Australia on July 15, 2010: Jude, you'll be a lot happier here at HubPages. And if for any reason you aren't, it's easy to delete your hubs and walk away. Not so with Factoidz. We had to request to have our articles deleted. And when there were a few of us unhappy with the way the site was being run and we asked for our articles to be deleted, we were told no. That our profiles could be removed, but the owner would keep our articles for himself. JudeBarton on July 15, 2010: Hi Darkside - just clicked above and joined Hubpages. Factoidz is crashed right now or off-line for some reason. While I was trying to find out why I couldn't get on Factoidz I came upon your post here and decided to ck out another site. Things over at Factoidz are in a lot of flux right now. I am however making more money with some of the new changes but the site seems to be up and down and things change quickly. There doesn't seem to be much editorial oversight nor communication with the contributors. But at any rate Factoidz being down drove me to HubPages. Glen (author) from Australia on June 25, 2010: All I can say is DON'T JOIN. Here at HubPages if you change your mind, you can remove your articles. At Factoidz, you can't. You had to ask the Admin to delete them for you. And when I did that I was told I could delete my account but he was going to keep my articles. scheng1 on June 25, 2010: What are some of the changes?  I wonder if I should join at all. Glen (author) from Australia on February 07, 2010: Ari, there have been some changes at Factoidz. I'll document them soon. Short story is I'm none too impressed with the new direction of the site. Ari Manes on February 07, 2010: One question: Is this residual income in the sense that as long as people are viewing your article, you can receive money from that article? Thanks Ari Manes on February 07, 2010: Thank Man! I so appreciate the info you took the time to make available to us. Thanks again! Krys W from Abertawe, Cymru on December 12, 2009: This is very interesting. Thank you for sharing. travelespresso from Somewhere in this exciting world. on December 06, 2009: Thanks for this information Darkside, this site sounds great.  As Dohn said, I wouldn't know about this without your informative article.  I'll check out the TOS and come back and join via you if I think its what I want. A question - if I wanted to join just three sites - aside from Hubpages, what would you suggest? Rose West from Michigan on December 06, 2009: Great article here! I didn't know anything about factoidz before I read this ... I'm definitely going to look into it. sunforged from Sunforged.com on December 06, 2009: success..they accepted my first submission in about two hours time and are giving me the ""high"" rate on the article. Thanks for the reminder and the recommendation. sunforged from Sunforged.com on December 06, 2009: Apparently, I had an unused Pre-Existing account, so I cant be Sunforged, but in order to take advantage of the Contributor bump, I jumped on with a brand new account under your link, made my first submission. It looks like a promising site..Maven earnings are sounding good! Glen (author) from Australia on November 28, 2009: Your health related topics would go well there LW. Legacy Wellness from Katy, Texas on November 28, 2009: Thanks for the sharing the info.  I really like the format of only FACTS.  I plan to check it out.  Also thanks for the referral link. Beth100 from Canada on November 27, 2009: Thanks for the info and link.  I am exploring more into this world of writing....  :) dusanotes from Windermere, FL on November 26, 2009: Thanks, Darkside. I won't stop my Hub publishing, but I may try Factoids someday. Thanks for the excellent heads up. Don White shinujohn2008 on November 25, 2009: Interesting , Factoid is a new word for me. Thanks lyricsingray on November 25, 2009: great review girl, thanks.  A lot of work when into this Hub thumbs up from me :o), Kimberly Tammy Lochmann on November 25, 2009: Interesting,  I will am going to bookmark this so I can refer to it later. 2uesday on November 25, 2009: Thank you, I will take a look at this later so I have bookmarked this hub. Don A. Hoglund from Wisconsin Rapids on November 25, 2009: I'm glad to know about this whether I actually use it or not. Andria on November 25, 2009: Darkside - read and digested. I believe I may have found this place then forgotten about it. Anyway, I've clicked your link and have joined proper. Currently mooching on the site and taking on-board what they're wanting. I like the idea of having to submit (like on Ezine) and would hope they're as strict as you say. I don't believe Ezine always edit too well, I've read many an article that could have been a lot better. All the same, I'll think up a couple of topics and give it a shot. Have you tried RedGage? Suforged wrote a hub with some info about the site. More for backlinks but they're paid ones. Have a good one and thanks for this :)"
18,What Is HubPages And How Does It Work?,community," Wonderful 2 In our latest hub we focused on how to make money blogging with HubPages. But HubPages is not just some revenue-sharing website; it is a meeting point of information and a place for the passion to write. The site’s pool of writers and readers consist of professionals, students, mothers, businessman, consumers, and many more. Each HubPages user & writer composes articles about topics of their own preference. Each can earn a decent income or even find HubPages as an opportunity for a lucrative career. Readers, on the other hand, are delighted with the vast information available on the website. HubPages users, (called ""hubbers"" on the site), can ask questions, help one another by providing answers, draw attention to another user for any mistakes made, and make new friends. Currently, HubPages is considered to be one of the most reliable sites in terms of payments, advertising, and of course, useful information. It has a wide viewership with around 40 million visits from the U.S. and other countries. HubPages also accepts contributors from all over the world. HubPages Jay Reitz, Paul Deeds, and Paul Edmonson founded HubPages with an idea of a website where users will be the ones creating the content. Prior to its launch, they worked for Microsoft and contributed to MongoMusic. Hummer Winblad invested US$2 million to fund the site, and it was opened on August 6, 2006. HubPages utilizes basic terms in regard to its writers and other information that has something to do with the user. These terms are: HubPages follows a 60:40 rule when it comes to earnings. Users earn the 60% of their Hubs’ revenue while the 40% belong to the site. There are two ways in which a Hubber can generate income from HubPages - these are online advertisements and affiliate programs. HubPages has its own advertising program named HubPages Ad Program. It acts in a similar way as the Google AdSense Program. Both online advertising programs are available for Hubbers. Affiliate programs, on the other hand, come in the forms of eBay Affiliate Program and Amazon Affiliate Program. Each site has its own set of requirements that a Hubber must fulfill. Under the HubPages Earnings Program, a Hubber must provide his or her tax information as mandated by U.S. laws. Even Hubbers from other countries are required to do so since the company is based in the U.S. Once a prospect Hubber signs up for HubPages, he is already eligible for the site’s ad program. However, if he prefers to add Google, eBay, and Amazon advertisements, he would need to apply on their respective websites. Afterwards, the HubPages Earnings Program must be activated for eBay and Amazon affiliates in a separate step. Hubpages will be the one paying a Hubber who prefers the site’s built-in ad program. Google, on the other hand, will be the one paying a Hubber who joined their ad program. eBay and Amazon will be sending their payment through the earnings program of HubPages. Hubbers may also make money by winning contests. HubPages users are also entitled to a referral program wherein they could generate income by referring other persons to the site. The earnings of Hubbers may vary from one to another. A lot of factors contribute to the variation of income. It could be the preferred income generation program of a Hubber as well as the quality of the Hub presented. USA Dollar Bills One very small drawback though, HubPages offers only a single form of payment method to its users. That is through PayPal; but at least people can still use a personal PayPal account to transact with the site. Depending on the income generation method used, a Hubber may or may not withdraw anytime, any day. Withdrawal is possible if the user earns the minimum amount required to do such transaction. After signing up, a user will be directed to a member dashboard where he has to complete further tasks to be entitled and earn reputation among HubPages users. The first task is to upload one’s own picture. Next, he has to complete his profile by adding personal information. He may opt to provide links to his other accounts on social websites such as Google+, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Pinterest. He may also provide the URL for his own website as well. HubPages is also a hosting site wherein users can create their own domain name added with HubPages.com. This will be a subdomain on the main domain. There are only four basic steps in creating a Hub. These steps are as follows: Before a Hub is officially published, it will be reviewed first by HubPages administrators. The review is done to ensure that the Hub complies with all their requirements (originality, valuable information, etc.). It is also intended to guarantee that it does not commit any of the violations stated by HubPages. Color Pencil Not all topics are allowed on HubPages. Topics pertaining to sex enhancements and toys are strictly forbidden. Fetishism in content is also not allowed. Whether or not there is sexual intent, topics covering such are totally banned. This applies not just to topics but to titles, texts, inclusions, and links as well. Aside from sexual content, extreme use of profane words in texts or shown in images, videos, and other inclusions are not allowed in HubPages. Another HubPages restriction is about violence. Topics about drugs, cigarettes, alcohol, weapons, and gambling may be allowed on HubPages. The administrators set rules that as long as a Hub does not promote such products, they may be published. When it comes to drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol, the information that can be provided is limited. Providing the advantages of the use of the said products is a clear manifestation of promotion and such is not allowed by HubPages administrators. Topics about weapons do not necessarily entail violence. For instance, Hubs about hunting are allowed. Such Hubs entail the presentation of some weapons. Gambling topics may also be allowed in Hubpages as long as a Hub does not promote it, directly or indirectly. Hubs about gambling could be about history of some games, rules, and strategies. While waiting for their Hubs to be reviewed, HubPages users may opt to make use of the other site’s functions. One of which is to read another Hubber’s Hubs. HubPages users may choose to rate a Hub. As much as possible, the rating should be objective. The primary purpose of the rating system is for the writer to assess the Hub concerned and edit as he deems appropriate. However, subjectivity in ratings is still possible. The commenting system of HubPages is another way for its users to interact with each other. They can comment on the Hubs they read. Comments that contain constructive criticisms regarding a Hub are greatly appreciated. Comments also take the form of a reader’s appreciation. HubPages also offer a forum for its users. Herein, users can post questions and fellow users as well as the HubPages administrators can answer. Through the HubPages forum, Hubbers can share tips and tricks they found useful in the site. It is always best for a Hubber to explore HubPages before doing anything. As much as possible, he should gather basic information and tips. Reading Hubpages FAQ is still the best way to get started. Almost all possible questions of users are answered therein. Additional information is also provided in the HubPages Learning Center. Both offer detailed information on how to find success on the site. HubPages is just like any other website that sometimes has flaws. However, everything works usually very smoothly and its administrators try their best to address problems and complaints right away. If you want to learn more about writing and blogging for HubPages, you can learn more reading our blog. Good luck!

19,6 Tips For Using Pictures & Videos on HubPages,community," If you've crafted a Hub, you've used these capsules before. Text forms the backbone of any article, but vivid pictures and engaging videos help entice readers to visit your work in the first place.Using these capsules isn't terribly difficult, but using them effectively takes practice. Save yourself some stress by examining six awesome tips for bolstering your Hubs with a plethora of alluring media! Photo Capsule Tips Full-width Half-width Don't: Use half-width photos unless the image would become fuzzy at full-width. Or at least place them sparingly. Many new Hubbers fall into the trap of copiously planting half-width images, for some reason fearful of their larger counterparts. Ignore this temptation, and utilize full-width unless you have a good reason not to.Do: Insert engaging and relevant picture capsules in full-width throughout your Hub. Another pitfall for new Hubbers to avoid: Don't simply place a photo at the beginning and end of your article. Spread them out; it helps divide the text into manageable portions. Vertical Corn Don't: Place too many vertically-oriented pictures in full-width, as they often lose resolution upon being stretched. For example, the above corn seizes a large area requiring an annoying amount of scrolling to travel through. Either half-width, crop, or rotate such pictures to obtain a superior size.Do: Crop and rotate pictures to fit your Hub. Many can be quickly edited using a program like Photo Viewer, PhotoShop, or Gimp. Some images (like pictures of people) lose value when rotated; crop these to become more horizontal, or search for less-upright selections.The same corn, now below, fills a more reasonable area when pivoted 90 degrees. Not all crops need to be cropped. Horizontal Corn Selecting a Profile Background The image you select for your background will be distorted because its center will be blocked by various information on your profile. Try to find a relevant picture with interesting visuals on its sides rather than in the middle; this will likely develop into a trial and error process. If you really get stumped, HubPages has some decent suggestions to hold the fort until you make your choice. A Shutterstock image De Space Studio, Public Domain, via Shutterstock The official way: Source all photos you insert, as very few fall under a license available to the public. The format goes ""owner, license, website obtained from.""Example: John Doe, Public Domain, via Shutterstock. Check out the above image for another example.The practical way: We're opening Pandora's Box here, people. Yes, you should source wherever possible, but in reality, most Hubbers simply backlink to the site where the photo was discovered, only including its URL for sourcing. Is this technically correct? No. But it's easier and directs people towards the site where the image was obtained, making it a beneficial process for both them and us.Following the official process to the letter would drastically restrict Hubbers' ability to supply interesting and relevant pictures. I can't promise you'll never encounter problems, but the simple truth is most Hubbers source this way. Google Don't: Brandish photo capsules by saving pictures you find and uploading them. Downloading images takes longer, clogs your hard drive, and risks viruses and legal issues. A superior process is to import photos.Do: Click ""Import"" instead of ""Choose photos"" when using a photo capsule. Then, simply copy and paste an image's URL into the space, and voila! Now you can bypass the hassle of downloading pictures, searching through your computer for them, and deleting them once finished.Don't know how to find an image's URL? It's easy, just follow these steps: Video Capsule Tips Don't: Post longer videos without jumping to the meat. You can right-click a YouTube video when it's paused and select ""Copy URL at current time"" to obtain a URL linking to that specific time. However, as of this writing, this link only works for your browser, not for video capsules on HubPages. Review the method below instead.Do: Skip ahead using alternative routes. I recommend the site YouTube Time, which lets you paste a video's URL, select the desired time to cut to, and obtain a new URL which HubPages supports. For example, I've skipped ahead in the below rain video. No one wants ten hours of precipitation, but two... is still probably excessive. Point stands, though. Don't: Rely too heavily on videos you suspect may be taken down. Users uploading another person's content are prone to having their videos removed; those who share original work tend to stick around.That said, it's not the end of the world if someone deletes a video you capsulized. You can always replace it later (assuming there's an acceptable substitute), but this adds to the workload of constructing and maintaining Hubs.Do: Utilize appropriate videos to add spice and variety to your articles. Strive to find long-lasting, user-created recordings to reduce your editing labors. The Broken Link symbol Hopefully these pointers will guide you towards the proper usage of photos and videos! No matter how diligently you select your media, know that occasionally a broken URL or removed video will arise. HubPages notes articles with broken links using a black triangle with a white exclamation mark inside. To check for this, browse your Hubs under the ""My Articles"" tab, and look for any with this adjacent symbol. Corresponding articles should be edited to remove the malfunctioning link(s). Use photos and videos effectively, and keep a keen eye over your portfolio, to ensure your writing stays fresh and functional for years to come.

20,"Nick Vujicic, Living Life With Purpose",community," The students were squirming, chatting, and trying to figure out how to text without being spotted. They were waiting for the little film clip to begin. You could tell by their faces that they thought it was going to be one more run of the mill boring clip. The lights went down and the clip began. Sudden there was not a sound to be heard. Every eye was plastered to the screen. Every ear was attuned to what was being said. All during this clip not a child moved a muscle, took their eyes off the screen or spoke one word. When the lights came back on, still they sat there silently. As we looked around we noticed a couple of the students wiping what looked like tears from their face. What had caused this phenomenon? None of us had ever seen these kids react in quite this way. Who was this man who could move teens this way? This was the amazing inspirational speaker Nick Vujicic. How did we come to know about him? There was a wonderful young man we had speaking to the students about bullying and doing what's right, the founder and director of Epic, Rashad Jones. You can read all about this wonderful organization at epicbeast.com. If jaded teens could be so moved and inspired by this organization and Nick Vujicic it should really touch those of us who look for inspiration.  KoffeeKlatch Gals On November 4, 1982 a baby with no arms or legs, except for a tiny little foot with two toes, was born to a young couple in Brisbane, Australia. There was no warning, medical or heredity wise of what was to come. Imagine the shock of a new mother and father when their first born is born with no appendages. The parents of this special boy soon put aside their shock and set about doing everything they could to help make Nick Vujicic the independent man that he is today. As Nick passed through school he was bullied and belittled so much that he contemplated suicide at the age of 8. At the grand old age of 10 he attempted to kill himself by drowning. The turning point of his life came a few years later when his mother showed him a newspaper article about a man that was dealing with a severe disability. It was then that he realized that he was not alone. He realized he was not the only person in the world who had to learn to live with a disability. He began to master the daily task of living. He learned how to write with his two toes, brush his teeth, how to swim, shave, throw a ball. and so many other things that we all take for granted. He became a leader at his high school. After graduating from college with two majors, one in accountancy and one in financial planning he became a motivational speaker focusing on teen issues. This incredible man has been taking the world by storm - telling his story and inspiring people of all ages. If he can do all that he can do then certainly those of us with two arms and two legs should be able to move the world.  KoffeeKlatch Gals As writers we sometimes question what we are doing. We may wonder if there is anyone out there who is reading what we write and what they think of it. Here at Hubpages we feel that extending encouragement and inspiration is something that is needed every day. New writers are especially sensitive about their writing. Anytime we can encourage someone to keep going and keep trying we consider it a job well done. Hubnuggets are our way of letting our new writers know that we are behind them, ready to help them, and telling them that they are doing a great job.

21,Who is Peter John Lawrence,community," Meet Peter John Lawrence a business man who has built 10 companies over a 30 year period and who has worked financing projects, deals and business in 22 countries. Now he is helping others in the 'home based' or 'brick and mortar' business models who are interested to learn how to use the Internet and Social Networks for business development by showing how to develop those sought-after skills for success in their present or primary business, or who are wanting to break away from the 'cubicle job' life. This is a wealth creating endeavour with very good prospects for those who wish to focus and succeed at generating income with Internet Marketing. On the other hand if you wish to find out how to create your own Squidoo Lens like this one or even better, here is a site for you: http://www.squidoo.com/lensmaster/referral/Dunmowd... A Hobie CAt 16 tacking. Peter John Lawrence was introduced to sailing while attending an ""Outward Bound"" course during the whole of November 1958 at the Moray Sea School for Sailing and Mountain training. This facility is based at Burghead in the northern part of Scotland north of the Cairngorm Mountains. We had to learn the rudiments of sailing on 20 foot undecked twin mast cutters with 4 to 5 of us as crew. This sailing took place on the Moray Firth and also out on the North Sea but this time it was on a fairly large 130 long-ton three-masted square rigged Schooner with the capacity of 4,000 square feet of sail. It took 13 chaps to man this schooner. The Prince Louis was acquired in about 1955 by the Outward Bound Trust for Â£11,500 from Danish owners. Peter John Lawrence was then hooked on sailing and his first CAT experience was at Disney World in 1973. The Hobie CAT design was created by Alter Hobie and is based upon a Polynesian canoe with outriggers. So very fast and so exciting to sail especially on a broad reach and on the Trapeze. Peter Lawrence learned some more specific and interesting facts such as the following reference: - ""Origin of the Catamaran. A catamaran (from Tamil kattu ""to tie"" and maram ""wood, tree"") is a type of boat or ship consisting of two hulls joined by a frame. Catamarans can be sail or engine powered. The catamaran was the invention of the paravas, a fishing community on the Southern coast of Tamil Nadu, India. Catamarans were used by the ancient Tamil Chola dynasty as early as the 5th century AD for moving their fleets to conquer such Southeast Asian regions as Burma, Indonesia and Malaysia. Catamarans are a relatively recent design of boat for both leisure and sport sailing, although they have been used for millennia in Oceania, where Polynesian catamarans and outrigger canoes allowed seafaring Polynesians to settle the world's most far-flung islands. Catamarans have been met by a degree of skepticism from some sailors accustomed to more traditional designs."" There are courses (one and two weeks) off the Florida Keys that will excite any sailor. Peter Lawrence found that you can sail a 16 ft CAT single handed but it is better with two people since to maximize your speed you need to ""keep the boat as flat as possible"" otherwise if the windward hull rises out of the water (looking speedy and dramatic) but you will be spilling a lot of wind, lose power and then slow down. So two people can leverage against the power of the wind on the sail and they can counter the tendency for the boat to fly a hull by getting out in the trapeze. Here is a great web site to get some more info on Hobie CATS : http://www.hobiecat.com/sail/hobie-16/ The 16ft is a fast machine and a faster Hobie is the 18 footer and there are also 17 ft, 19 ft, 21 ft and even a model that has a sail on each hull. If you wish to experience something akin to flying but a max of 10 ft up then try a CAT. The reason that I have the pleasure of time for sailing is due to running my own business.from my house. This is a product health-based business. The product is all natural and it got rid of my wife's arthritic pains in less then a week and that was 5 years ago. I also have an educational platform to teach people the much sought after skill of how to use the Internet and Social Media networks for their businesses, regardless of what type of business that is. If you wish to know more re becoming time-and-decision free and using the Internet and the Social Media networks or on the other hand if your interest is primarily to learn about how to use the Internet and the Social Media Networks to build your present business just visit this site: -. http://www.your-internet-education.info One of the things that Peter John Lawrence has learned on his journey to comprehension and achievement was that he was the one in charge of his own progress and that he needed to pick/select/choose a goal and focus on it until it became an obsession. Also he realized that his habits controlled what he accepted in life and these acceptances had been established by associations with many people, adopting their advice and examples. These same rules apply to all development whether personal, family, social, business, careers or wealth development. It's called RIGHT THINKING. The first book that I remember which made me actually think about personal responsibility for progress and to remove self-imposed limits was called ""Self Renewal"" by John W. Gardner, who was then head of Department of 'Health Education and Welfare' in the US Government. He wrote this in 1963. The book encourages achievement by and for the individual. However in order to achieve there needs to be acceptance by society. His premise was that in order to be creative in society and to be accepted and recognized then one needed to exhibit some conformity. Here is part of his introduction to that book: - ""Failure to face the realities of change brings heavy penalties. Individuals become imprisoned in their own rigidities. Great institutions deteriorate. Civilizations fall. Yet decay is not inevitable. There is also renewal. I shall discuss, amongst other things, the decay and renewal of organizations and societies. But this is, above all, a book about the individual. Individuals create societies and make them viable; and individuals bring them to moldering ruin. So this is a book about you."" So the point is that renewal is never out of reach for any of us and, in fact, one needs to forget any form of blame on our past experiences including blaming our parents, relatives, limited money access, schooling, peers, etc etc. We, as thinking entities, can come to realize that it is we who control our lives and that if there is something about our quality of life (or lack of it) that we do not like then we have the capability to change it. Therefore we have the choice to pick something that we do like and to then focus on it. Self renewal is never out of reach and our comprehension has to reach that level of realizing it. So therefore we come back to habits and the necessity to adopt the habits that we wish to have. Another important lesson with respect to Habits is that it takes 21 days to establish a new habit. This number is the result of years of work by a famous plastic Surgeon Dr Maxwell Maltz who wrote about his findings in his book called ""Psycho Cybernetics"". So having established the need for habits and the need to accept responsibility for developing them and also that it will take 21 days of repeated affirmation, visualization, as well as it may include an activity, then the next step is to start with giving yourself silence twice a day in order to wrap your mind around your new goal. The whole approach is based upon the ""BE-DO-HAVE"" principal as opposed to the standard and much used ""HAVE-DO-BE"" approach. Many people claim to have discovered or originated this principal but it has been in the public domain for many many years. Wish to learn more? Go to Google and type 'Be Do Have' principal. In any event if you are looking at developing your own habits towards becoming a business person or being more proficient at the business you are presently running then consider a self administered education course that will help you attain the new habits and learn the new knowledge that you require. Here is access to a site http://www.your-internet-education.info Hope this helps. Family, Reading, Traveling and Sailing Have you ever considered getting into business for yourself soon or someday? If the stats are right then about 93% of North Americans say that ""they wish to be in their own business"" however that seems to be as far as it gets.....""Wish to be"". Our life styles are a direct reflection of our philosophy about having a career, profession or a job and that philosophy ultimately controls and affects our cash flow and our attitude. Unless you have rich parents who leave you a pile of cash or some benefactor who gives you a fortune, or you win a lottery or write 'rap' music or write a book with residual income, the likelihood of a fortune falling into your lap is very remote. So therefore in order for you to gain significant leverage re cash flow and financial independence you will need to stop working a job (read ""Just Over Broke"") for someone else. The safety-factor that so many of us hang onto is often referred to as having a ""cubicle mentality"" or being trapped by ""entitlement-benefits"". Both are destructive to the efforts of those people who really want out of the box (see the book or the Power Point presentation called the ""Cash Flow Quadrant"" by Robert Kiyosaki). Over the last 150 years there have been many business structures and opportunities as well as new methods both for new markets and changing demands. One exceptionally clear and clever presentation that is typical of these changing demands for different businesses and different products was put together in the late 1990's by Tim Sales and it is called ""Brilliant Compensation"". He demonstrates the value of being independent and working on one's own business for oneself. Conventional Corporate structures were formed and created hundreds of years ago as a way to remove and diminish the liability aspects of being an owner (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation). Initially it was for Government organizations but in the mid 1800's it moved towards the public sector. Even with this structuring other forms like the sole proprietorship and partnership businesses have continued to thrive alongside, to this day. Today's economic situation is driving the conditions and circumstances of earning income towards more home based businesses and to more financial freedom for the individual. Tenure and security of a job is not there anymore and is a false hood that has been informally exposed during the most recent 30 years. In the 1940's Network Marketing started to appear but one could not tell the difference of whether the promoter was a visionary or a con artist (both being potentially dangerous partners to be in business with). Another breakthrough re business methods and structures was in the late 1950's when franchising was created. What the franchisee could buy was a total business package for usually a very expensive entry cost. These franchise costs can now be very high and some cost over a million dollars and cover a large number of industries (fast food, coffee shops, construction material outlets etc). The value of this system was, and still is, the ready-made package for the new franchisee and, more important, it is a valuable method for the franchisor to be able to expand his business by using other people's capital and having dedicated management in each location who have a lot to gain from the success and a lot to lose from that franchise not working. However, as is often the case the status quo resisted the changes and fought tooth and nail to squash this new and presumably destructive form of business. In fact the US Government was only 11 votes away from making franchising an illegal way of doing business. Now franchising accounts for about for 30 to 40 % of the North American GNP. Conventional incorporated business structures continue to evolve to this day and the capitalization and organization structures continue to vary in relation to new markets and demands for new products and services appear. Due to many factors these changes can be expected to continue. Now consider one of the major changes that affected our economy. That was the industrial revolution and it came from Europe to North America in the mid 1800's. This event saw an economic expansion never seen and it happened due to the low cost of labour and due to the fact that a person had the right to be successful or to be wrong, these rights came with the freedom on this new continent. This was a great time of growth and prosperity for North America and this growth looked endless. Well take another look. That industrial revolution has now left North America during the past 30 years and that is why we see the growth of massive production facilities in China, Mexico, Eastern Europe and India etc. Since the World population has continued to expand (2.56 billion in 1950 and now approx 7 billion people on earth according to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population) we see the demands for products and services increasing and North America, Europe, Australia and NZ etc are each becoming a consumer society with many manufacturing jobs being lost to off shore sources where lower cost labour pools exist. See the movie ""Manufactured Landscapes"" by Edward Burtynsky and then appreciate the importance of the labour content and the reasons that manufacturing has moved off shore. Part of the western marketing distribution system has evolved into Network Marketing (a very low cost entry for people to have a home based income) and, as mentioned, that all started in the 1940's. This business method did not reach a legitimate recognition and definition until a legal trial a 1979 of the Amway Corporation. That trial set the criteria and defined NM as requiring a company to have a product or a service. Otherwise, if there is no product or service, it could be referred to a 'Ponzi Scheme' or a 'pyramid' and even now most people still do not know what those two references mean but continue use them indiscriminately. However that perspective and knowledge is changing as more a more people open their minds to find legitimate alternatives to the job that they have lost. Well the industry of NM, also called MLM (Multi Level Marketing), is growing even more so due to the points made above and also due to the evolution of our information society and the growth of the Internet. In December 2000 there were just over 360 million people worldwide who were using the Internet. By April 2010 there are over 1.8 billion, a 400% growth. (http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm) In summary: 1. World population has grown to approximately 7 billion from about 2.5 billion in 1950. 2. Manufacturing activities are leaving North America and Western Europe. 3. The Internet usage is growing dramatically (now, in April '10, it has at over 1.8 billion users) 4. The western societies (including North America, UK, Europe, Australia and New Zealand) are becoming more consumer-orientated than manufacturing and therefore the distribution systems are growing to accommodate the changes. 5. Home based incomes are becoming more and more attractive to people struggling to learn how to generate and create money online and a home based income with a cash flow from home. 6. Network marketing is part of the expanding distribution systems and will more and more fit the growing trends; however it will not do so as dynamically possible by using the Old School approach. Maybe let me share with you why I feel qualified to give you a third party review and recommendation of the digital media system and for me to be able to talk about my personal evolution from being an employee to becoming a professional (Professional Engineer), to a financier and then to business owner (10 companies) and finally through 10 years of the old school approach to NM and to the new Social Media career. My background was very formal through high school into engineering. I spent 6 years as an apprentice studying and working in mechanical, electrical and electronic engineering as a part of the telecommunication industry. Then I obtained a Masters Degree in Automatic Control Systems, at Imperial College, London University, combing the three technical areas I had worked in. This was prior to immigrating to North America to work in Research and Development in Ottawa Canada. Within 5 years I decided to move out of corporate North America and also out of the purely-technical career/field into the commercial world and subsequently built 10 companies from their creation, through the financing to stage, start up and then to operations. Also I worked financing projects, companies and business in 22 countries. Just over 10 years ago I saw Network Marketing and I attended a meeting to stop a friend of mine from getting into that ""type"" of business. Well I went back three times to that same presentation since I could not find out why it would not work, so I joined. During these past ten years I have worked hard in NM and been able to see and appreciate the challenges and the failures that the large majority of people face in this industry. One consideration is the methods of marketing from Old School to New School. Google: The Metamorphism of the MLM Industry. Its changing. Can You Hear the Thunder of the Coming Storm. With this background I feel more than qualified to comment on the many proliferating NM companies and to look at their approaches and trainings as well as to judge the integrity and quality of the principals/owners/managers and also to judge the value of the various compensation plans.

Even with extensive demands that require our daily concentration, with respect to business and family and maybe more, Peter Lawrence found it to be most vital to take time for yourself and to do it optimally twice per day and preferably in total silence. My first discovery of this need was after being given a book in 1969 called ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill, which, by the way, I thought was the most corny book title that I had even seen. However I was desperate and I am sure that you know what that means when you are struggling (as indeed many people in North America are these days). The point of mentioning this is that when the struggle gets over whelming we all tend to open our minds to more alternatives and what was totally unacceptable may then start to be considered as acceptable. Hence I read the book and it really really helped. I hope this will encourage taking time for yourself. Let me tell you what happened subsequently: - At that point I was broke, was 6 months behind in our rent, and had 4 children and no cash flow. Tough is not the word. However over the next few years I struggled to focus on objectives and would take time continually to concentrate on self renewal. I carried and wore out 10 copies of that book, by Napoleon Hill, as I carried around the world with me through 22 countries while I worked on projects and businesses. As a result of all this habit formimg experience I built 10 companies over the following 15 years. We also bought a cottage on 1/2 an acre on the shore line and expanded that into a 3,600 sq ft house. We have a Hobie CAT sailing boat since the river is 2 miles wide where we live on our 1/2 acre (see the photo). I need to mention that I also kept raising our goals with some extensive risk taking in the building process but my belief went through the roof and my positive approach was not dismayed by the setbacks that always appear. The largest company of the 10 that I built, was a $25 million start up and was an Engineering R&D venture in defense electronics and in that company I had 65 people working for me. The key to look at here is that from that minus position I was able to develop endless possibilities and meet wonderful people who became close friends over the years. So the message is to never never give up and to deal with improving yourself first by learning to control and direct your thoughts. Control your thoughts and you control everything. This life is not a practice run and you are not a worm! The importance of freedom is beyond description. In the Western world we have great freedom but most (95% +) people choose to imprison themselves as in a function such as a job which is selling their hours for money. In other countries many people do not even have basic freedoms. I define total freedom to include freedom to move, freedom to travel, freedom from political persecution, freedom from pestilence, freedom from terrorism, freedom from poverty, and freedom from any restrictions that i will not and need not accept, What is your definition? Can you define it? Can you visualize it in detail? When you do visualize your definition can you be right there in it whatever that is? Everyone is different re their goals and dreams BUT we all need to have time to live those dreams. Time is a major aspect. It is your life that is ticking. My life is ticking and it is doing so at my control You may ask how can a 74 year old find time to swim and a more powerful question how can he do the butterfly and be working on his timing. Well I can do that 'cos I made a decision. I decided to be self employed and not have a job (just on broke) is absolutely the only way to live with freedom. To have the time we need income so that is why opportunities of working on a home based business is so vital. It is not a job, it is not having a cubicle mentality, it is not having to ask permission to go out or to visit family and friends and it is not have a ceiling above you created by others. My freedom allows me to swim any number of times per week that ""I choose"" and also to be with my wife and my children (4) and my grandchildren (8) etc. The challenge is that I cannot swim as fast as Brian Phelps or Marc Spitz, in fact what Brian does in 12 seconds takes me 24 seconds at my best BUT the value to me and my family is I can do it and many many people cannot and will never be able to. I choose to be free and to be creative with my life and I have enormous plans still for constructive work and to travel and to study and I can choose due to cash flow from working as an entrepreneur and the capability and opportunity is open to all. In order to avoid the trap of old school business mentality whether a 'brick and mortar' or 'direct selling' or network marketing' business you need to become system dependent and not, old style, person dependent. How you ask? Here is one way: Get yourself into an educational environment where you can learn about the next major business level of professionals and that is to learn about the Internet and Social Media Networking. Here is one platform that has now reached over 180 countries and in over 50 languages: http://www.your-internet-education.info"
22,How to  Write an Effective SEO Blog Post: Tips for Freelance Content Writers,community," A woman freelancer. Pixabay Browsing through a reference website. Most of them will only provide their own requirements for the article such as the word count and the topic to write about. Don't wait that they'll be the one to ask if you need a link or access to their website or not. Instead, when you receive a proposal for blog post writing, ask the client about it immediately. Why? Getting to know their website can help you create a content that will surely match their business. Also, you'll know about the kind of writing style that is most suitable and the existing articles. This technique will help you avoid issues such as duplicate or anti-client content. Highlighting the importance of SEO  auditing in targeting the best keywords. Pixabay You will encounter clients who are new to online marketing and do not know anything about SEO. So, when they look for writers, they will only advertise the topic and word count. When this happens, be ready to give them an overview of SEO in relation to blogging. This way, they can easily get your point. Oftentimes, they highly appreciate efforts such as this that they are willing to increase the pay per article. This also gives them an impression that you can be trusted, that you are the perfect candidate for the job, and can help them achieve their goal. How do you determine the best keywords for the clients? One effective technique is to combine their products or services with their location. For example, if they are selling roller shutters in Sydney, Australia, you can use that phrase as the main keyword. So, that will be “roller shutters in Sydney”. Another option is to combine their service with the events that they cater for. A client who is a provider of catering services for various events can use keywords such as, catering services for weddings, catering for corporate meetings, catering package for birthdays, and cater for special celebrations. On the other hand, if you wanna search for the top keywords used in Google, you can use the Google Adwords Keyword Planner. An example of catchy, attractive title. See page for author [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons The key here is to ask yourself whether all types of users in the online world will notice the title or not. Using adjectives and the 5 W’s (Who, What, When, Where, and Why) is highly effective. Say for instance you will be talking about website tools. Instead of writing “The Most Trusted Website Tools Today”, you can go for a question such as “What Are the Most Trusted Online Tools Now?” The second will stir more interest or curiosity from the readers compared to the first one. The people of today are smart enough to know the basics of everything so avoid including concepts that are understandable enough. As other writers say, avoid stating the obvious. Oftentimes, users look for meaty content, those they can get a great deal of something after reading. In short, you must write with substance and not just for the sake of creating something. Your goal as a blogger is to entertain your readers by using real situations and introducing lessons, facts or discoveries. Add meat to your content. Say no to Mr. or Ms. Fluffy. Write with substance and meaning. — Miss Eva Gono Make it natural like nature. pixabay So you have the keywords ready for the client. Your next concern is how to insert these into the article. Remember this one essential rule in keyword insertion – make it natural. If there is any hint that it is purposely fitted to advertise a product or service, do not go for it. The key there is to come up with a direct match topic. You just have to determine the category of the website and find a subcategory that relates to the topic. Images can make the blog visually appealing and fun. Suggesting something to readers with a corresponding picture showing how’s it done can be very effective in increasing their attention span. When searching for images, go for those with high resolution and big size in relation to the subject matter at hand. Authoritative sources from famous blogs, websites and books can add credibility to an article. It gives an impression to your readers that you have a sure, clear basis of your claims, findings or recommendations. Some writers are actually in the habit of just listing ideas or points and then leave their readers. This should not be the case. Conclusions can actually be used to convince your readers to browse more on the website. It finalizes whatever ideas you laid down at the beginning. Internal links refer to one of the many previous articles in the blog that can be used to convince the user to stay longer in the site and read more. When writing page titles, these should not be more than 75 characters, while anchor texts should only be 3 to 4 words. Make sure that together with the article’s heading or title, all of these should be written in different styles and words. The page title should summarize the article while the anchor text should provide a brief description of the topic covered. These texts can actually help increase the traffic of a website. When people search for a particular image, this will show up, linking to the article. So, you’ll have a new visitor to the site. Just like this article, subheadings should be used in order to make your article organized and readable. Blogs, in their nature, are not academic. Instead, they are used to expose something in a fun and personal way. Connect to all your audience.

23,Why I Removed My Articles from Hub Pages,community," Andrew Havens is a former life insurance agent turned writer and the author of Life Insurance “Dirty Little Secrets” for Consumers Revealed! This may or may not get past the Hubpages censors but you can’t say I didn’t try. Things started out well, or so I thought. I wrote 6 articles for the Business: Personal Finance: Life Insurance category. (I believe this is accurate.) These articles are as follows: Will Life Insurance Rates Go Through the Roof? Life Insurance Who Needs It Anyway? Understanding Life Insurance Illustrations – A Primer Should I Buy Life Insurance for My Children? Set Your Life Insurance Policy as the Cornerstone of Your Financial Plan What I Learned Selling Final Expense Insurance The first five brought me to my first “milestone”, something or other about bypassing some editorial hump, I guess. After I met that mark, I didn’t see any significant difference. It was more like a “good boy” sticker as far as I could see. No matter. I wrote article number six. But as I was writing I got to thinking. The first five brought me to my first “milestone”, something or other about bypassing some editorial hump, I guess. After I met that mark, I didn’t see any significant difference. It was more like a “good boy” sticker as far as I could see. No matter. I wrote article number six. But as I was writing I got to thinking. Now my articles were seeing some decent views. The traffic was nothing fantastic but in 7 days my articles had a total of 63 views with my oldest one garnering 25 views. Not bad. BUT, unless someone viewed my profile, they weren’t going to find my book. What good would this do me? So in my sixth article I included the following blurb at the end: Granted this was a brazen plug for my book. Well, yeah. I don’t know about you but it seems like everybody is writing books these days and whenever they appear somewhere, they are able to plug their book. Why can’t I? There’s more too it than that. The articles I’m writing directly relate to the topic of the book. Sometimes they touch on some of the same information and other times they expound on certain points a bit. The book is intentionally slim. One of the big issues facing the insurance industry is the plethora of information. While this may be necessary for some situations for the premise in my book, it is not. At the basic level, the purpose of obtaining life insurance should be to cover burial costs in the event of an unexpected death in the family. The nature of an unexpected death is nobody can predict who, if anyone will be the victim. So it makes sense to cover each member of the family. I show how to do this in an affordable, cost-effective way that provides additional benefits – especially if the worst never happens. I accomplish this by winnowing though tons of information to filter out as much noise as possible. Thus the reader can gain a decent overview of the scope of the topic of life insurance without being bogged down with irrelevant junk. In the end, any purchaser of my book can gain a good grasp of how to obtain decent coverage. In any case, I got an email from “Team HubPages” as follows  Dear AndrewHavens, We wanted to let you know that What I Learned Selling Final Expense Insurance has the opportunity to become Featured! Featured articles are showcased on Topic Pages and Related articles listings. They are also made available to search engines. We want your article to succeed and strongly recommend making a few improvements. The perks of a Featured article don’t end at increased visibility online. Featured articles are likely to be more successful over the long run when it comes to traffic, earnings, and augmenting your personal online brand. It’s possible that your article is not Featured because it contains spammy elements. Perhaps it was written for a link, or has excessive product capsules or product capsules that are not directly related to the content. Even articles that appear to be high quality can be spammy. We recommend that you remove any spammy elements from your article. If you don’t see any spammy elements in your article, then it was likely defeatured for failing to meet HubPages’ general quality standards. The article may have been too short or underdeveloped, had formatting issues, broken or unrelated links, and/or significant grammatical errors. For more help on this front, please read the Elements of a Stellar Article Learning Center guide. What else can you do to improve your article? High-quality articles are original, in depth, and media rich. For starters, check out our Learning Center entry on How to Improve the Quality of an Article for detailed tips, helpful links, and before/after example articles. Lastly, if you would like personalized feedback on how to make your article better, we invite you to post in the Improving Your Article Forum. Thank you for taking the time to update and improve your work! Cheers, The HubPages team My Response:  Hello,  Thank you for your heads up. I'm not sure I understand. There were two links at the end of this article to my book, which I strongly advocate because it provides a great deal more information that one can put in a single article. The book only lightly touches on my experience while providing much needed information on the basics of selecting and buying life insurance. Note, I no longer sell life insurance nor do I recommend any specific insurance companies or policies in the book. As for the link itself, it only leads to a page with more information about the book itself. Anyone wishing to purchase the book itself would need to click on the provided link and only then be directed to a page where they can choose what vendor they would like to purchase from. In other words, there is no direct purchase link on this page either.  Of all the things one could purchase in this world, life insurance is one of the most incorrectly sold products out there. Most people won't buy until they are facing a ""good salesman"". The only problem is the ""good salesman"" may or may not sell or even have access to what these individuals really need. Life insurance should be bought, not sold.  Consider this: the cheapest life insurance available will cost more for a single month's premium than my ebook at $4.99, In paperback at $12.99, it might be possible to purchase a month's worth of coverage. My point? The book is an absolute bargain that can save anyone thousands of dollars and quite possibly save their family from financial disaster.  So, please, explain to me what I'm doing wrong. If hubpages objects to my linking to my book (directly or indirectly) then I'm not interested in providing what I feel is valuable content for your readers.  For the sake of argument, I removed one of the two links to my book. Now the entire 1534 word article has exactly one link. Please tell me if this is too much and I will remove it immediately.  Kind regards  Andrew Havens  For the record, I removed one of the links immediately. While I was doing that I got an autoresponse from my email account telling me it was a bad address. It appears “Team HubPages” doesn’t like to be bothered with responses to their dictums. So be it. I blogged both of the above. The next day, I received a second copy of the above email. Okay fine. I found I could contact them through their system and I did. I said about the same thing, though truncated. To their credit, their reply was in my inbox the next day.  Hello,  While we do not allow for self-promotion, you can add a link to your personal blog in your bio which readers can then click on.  You can find more information about adding products and our guidelines here: https://hubpages.com/faq/  Thanks, Team HubPages  After trudging through a ton of irrelevant information, I finally found one section that appears pertinent:  11. My article was moderated for being overly promotional; what does that mean?  Purely promotional offers and articles designed only to promote other sites or businesses are not allowed. In particular, the following actions are likely to get your articles identified as overly promotional: Please note that promotional links are links that you have any interest in promoting (your blog, your Website, affiliate offers, etc.). Links to well-known Web resources which you don't have any personal interest in (like Wikipedia, news sites, encyclopedias, open directories, etc.) are exempt from this limitation. You can find more details in the Learning Center. The article in question violated NONE of this. Not. A. Single. Point. It appears that while they gleefully point to their own bloated requirements, they cannot be bothered to read their own standards. However, rather than argue or whine or point out their heavy handedness, I simply replied: “Your site. Your rules.” Then I removed my content, telling them “My content. My prerogative.” Apparently, I am only allowed a single link, not in any content that I sweat hard to write and make certain it is of acceptable quality, but only in my profile where a reader may or may not decide to look for. Thus this is the final article I expect to write for Hubpages. This is a sad ending to what could have been a mutually beneficial relationship. HubPages would get, by their own admission, good content and I would get eyes on those who need my book, and, of course possible sales. These sales would benefit both HubPages and myself, because the book benefits those who buy it. HubPages would enhance their status as the place to go for good information. I would benefit from building my reputation as an author. My readers would benefit most as they follow through to find the life insurance that will  protect themselves and their loved ones. Trust me on this last point as I have seen firsthand the blessings a life insurance policy brings during a period of grief as well as the added stress to families of those who pass with no coverage.

24,Boost Your HubScore,community," The first thing that any Hub author needs to learn (and accept) is that HubScores go up AND down. Read that first sentence again, or even a few times if you wish. The HubPages website re-calculates statistics throughout the day and many new authors immediately freak out and go running to the forum to post a message with a headline screaming ""help, my HubScore is going down...!"" Just take a few deep breaths and let yourself know that you can stop panicking. There's nothing that's happening to you that doesn't happen to the rest of us. HubScores are based on a variety of factors and, as these fluctuate, so does the score. Over time, you might even notice that your Hub has peak and off-peak times. I've got Hubs that regularly move up and down across a ten or fifteen point range during the course of a single day. And, as a result of these changes, your Author Score will also go up and down. It's all perfectly normal and is precisely how the system here was designed to work. You can't make a HubScore stick at any certain level or score. The HubPages FAQ can tell you how HubScore is computed. No, it won't give you an exact formula. That would make it too easy for spammers and bad players to game the system. However if you're looking to build a strong Hub or want to improve the score of one you've published already, here are some suggestions that can help you based on my own experience here at HubPages.  There is one way to tell that you're not performing very well with HubPages: the no-follow threshold. If a HubScore or HubAuthor Score is too low, HubPages will apply no-follow tags to any links in your Hubs, forum posts or comments The HubScore threshold is 40 for individual Hubs. The HubAuthor score threshold is 85. If you have Hubs that score below 40 or if your personal score is 85 or lower, what you are creating on HubPages is not considered to be quality content and you should review it based on the suggestions made in this Hub. The No-Follow Threshold If a Hub or Author Score is too low, HubPages will apply no-follow tags to any links.  The HubScore threshold is 40 for individual Hubs. The HubAuthor score threshold is 85.  Lower scores are HubPages indicating what you are creating is not considered to be quality content and you should review it. A lot of new and potential Hub author find themselves contemplating just what it is that makes a great Hub When a post in the forums asked about lenses being flagged as spam, it was answered with the following: Are all of your Hubs being flagged as spam? If not, are there differences between those that are being flagged, and those that are not To make a great Hub, write your own original content, make it genuinely useful/helpful/informative and include a variety of resources (video, links, pics, feeds) from a variety of web sites. Paul Deeds, the General Manager and Co-Founder of HubPages, posted some really interesting info about HubScores and traffic in January 2010 when the algorithms got updated: 96-100 - 99.9 percentile (3000 page views a month)91-95 - 99.3 percentile (2200 page views a month)86-90 - 97.7 percentile (1300 page views a month)81-85 - 94th percentile (900 page views a month)76-80 - 88th percentile (90 page views a month)71-75 - 78th percentile (30 page views a month) (Since the HUGE losses traffic due to Google's Panda and Penguin in 2012, undoubtedly how these scores are calculated have changed, but as you might guess, there's been no word from HubPages to offer any clarification or clue.) Many new authors seem to click past this screen without reading but really it tells you exactly what NOT to do when making a Hub.  The number one place new Hub authors blow it is by not paying attention to how HubPages defines spam.  Hot vs Best Hot hub rankings use many of the same factor as HubScore, but are skewed toward newer hubs, hubs that have growing traffic, and hubs that have comment activity. A high traffic hub that has steady traffic for many months will probably have a high HubScore, but it may not be very high on the ""hot"" list. — Paul Deeds   HubPages provides some in-house stats and feedback about Hubs. These are just some quick estimates and possibilities but they offer a quick way to do a check-up on the state of your Hubs. These stats are found via a link that only the author can see at the top of the Hub, right after the edit and delete buttons. Five tabs open when you click to view the stats. Most of it is basic traffic, showing daily, weekly, monthly and total page views for the Hub. These shows the main domains that are referring traffic to your Hub. The last tab reads ""Hub Metrics"" and displays four values. The first is ""word count"" and it refers to how many words are in the Text capsules and Photo capsule captions. Essentially, it's the content that's been originally created by the author. It's suggested that you have 400-500 words to start, but if you really want a better performing Hub, it's best to get that count up to the 800-1,000 word range. The second value shown is ""revenue potential."" This is showing you the potential for Hub earnings using a graphic of dollar signs ranging from one to five signs. The more dollar signs you see here, the better your content is hitting keywords that carry higher-earning ad potential. If you think you'd like your Hub to show more dollar signs than it shows, you'll want to rethink what you are talking about or what words you are using. The third value is ""incoming links"" and shows between one and five asterisks. Less asterisks means your Hub has very few other places on the web that are linking back to it. Lots of asterisks means your Hub is well-linked. It can take several weeks for new links to have an effect on a Hub so if a Hub is new, you'll have to be patient. If a Hub is older and only has one or two asterisks, you'll want to get out there and do some promotion for your Hub. The fourth metric is ""view duration."" This gives you an idea of how long a visitor stays on your Hub. Only one asterisk and it means your visitors are quickly clicking away from your Hub to somewhere else. Five asterisks mean they are hanging around to actually read, and hopefully interact with, your content. If you don't have many asterisks, it means you're not giving your visitors the type of information they are expecting or looking for when they come to the page. If that's the case, you probably want to rethink and rewrite your content, or it means you need to get a different audience for the content that you do have.  Chelsey from Ottawa, Ontario on December 09, 2014: Thanks! Raye (author) from Seattle, WA on December 09, 2014: Good luck, Chelsea! Chelsey from Ottawa, Ontario on December 08, 2014: Thanks for all the useful info. Especially helps people like me who are still learning how things work! Raye (author) from Seattle, WA on October 11, 2014: You look like you are making generalized shopping pages for Hubs.  Expect to see those get slammed by the latest Panda update.a Arco Hess from Kansas City, Kansas on October 11, 2014: The traffic thing seems to be pretty accurate. When I published one of my hubs, it was a 89. It hasn't had much traffic just after one week and it has gone down to a 71. Raye (author) from Seattle, WA on October 09, 2014: Aesta, glad it helped! Mary Norton from Ontario, Canada on October 09, 2014: Coming across your hub is clearly a bonus to my day. I had been liberated from the puzzlement I had for days. I cannot proceed editing my hubs armed with this bit of know how  and the promise of further enlightenment from the links you've included. Pinky de Garcia on September 30, 2014: Hi! I'm new here on Hubpages and I find this article useful. Thanks for the     helpful  information. Susie Lehto from Minnesota on September 03, 2014: Very good of you to write all this information out.  Helpful! Raye (author) from Seattle, WA on August 31, 2014: aka-rms, HubScores are oblique at best.  If you can sort of ignore them for a while, your quality content will take care of everything eventually. Robin S from USA on August 31, 2014: Thanks, this makes me feel a little better about the scores I've received, so far. Raye (author) from Seattle, WA on August 23, 2014: Brian, I'm glad you are finding helpful info. Brian Stephens from France on August 23, 2014: You have certainly learned how to operate on HubPages and I take a lot of notice of what you say as I can see you are offering very good advice. Thanks for another very informative hub. Raye (author) from Seattle, WA on August 22, 2014: Brenda, it does this whenever it's a low-traffic time of year and I'm active on the site.  I don't take scores too seriously, I've just learned how to play the game with them. Treasures By Brenda from Canada on August 22, 2014: Thanks for another helpful Hub, Relache. I'm liking your author hubscore! Raye (author) from Seattle, WA on August 17, 2014: Jan, it's been hard to keep up with the changes of the last few years, but this hub has surely been worth updating. Janis Leslie Evans from Washington, DC on August 17, 2014: Great markers for success, relache. Very informative and timely with all the changes going on with algorithms and hubscore. Thanks for the tutorial, voted up and useful. Raye (author) from Seattle, WA on July 07, 2014: Getting your first dozen Hubs up and running is something that you really need to do before you start to think about HubScores and trying to boost them.  Also make sure you stop by the Learning Center, as that's where you will find all the instructions for how everything works. Sunardi from Indonesia on July 07, 2014: Very useful tutorial. I am on struggle to publish my third hub. It's been three days. Raye (author) from Seattle, WA on July 07, 2014: My best advice is to really study the HubPages rules.  So many authors here never actually read them, and knowing that info right out of my head has helped me so much! Janani Shankar from Tiruchirappalli, India on July 07, 2014: Yeah it helped me so much, I wanna write hubs like you. Raye (author) from Seattle, WA on July 07, 2014: Janai, wow you are a brand-new person to the site.  I hope this helps you! Janani Shankar from Tiruchirappalli, India on July 06, 2014: This is really useful to me, Thank you so much . Raye (author) from Seattle, WA on June 13, 2014: Lisa, my theory is to try and help new members learn how to help themselves, as that makes them stronger and more independent writers over the long-term.  I hope it helps you! Lisa from Virginia on June 13, 2014: Thanks so much. I learned a lot since I am new here. Good to know there are so many people on here willing to help us newbies. William from America on December 28, 2013: Thank you so much for this insight.  You've really helped my hubs. biblicaliving from U.S.A. on November 14, 2013: This Hub is spot on. I have found that traffic seems to be king when it comes to a hub score. I have one hub that has 12,000+ views in the last 2 years and it has remained in the mid-80's despite my neglect. I think that I am going to compose a hub about hubbing, although my experience is much more limited than others. Good Hub! Devika Primić from Dubrovnik, Croatia on August 19, 2013: Great hub, informative, useful, and most helpful to us hubbers Tony Sky from London UK on June 17, 2013: Thanks for this more than clear and informative hub. I have been here for a while (about 7 years) and its never too late to learn. Serenity Queen from Rochester, NY on May 18, 2013: Thank you for this article! I've been a little stressed about mine and I just started yesterday, but I wanted to know ways to increase my score if it didn't go up soon. Thanks again! Noufel Backer from Kochi on April 15, 2013: Thanks for sharing this article.This explains deeply about the factors affecting hub score and how one can improve their hubscore by reviewing their existing hubs. Raye (author) from Seattle, WA on July 28, 2012: Gamerelated, remember that one of the best teachers is your own best-performing Hubs.  Look at the best and see what they do that the lower scoring ones don't do... then adjust from there. Gamerelated from California on July 28, 2012: Your advice is great.  This is one of the most helpful Hubs that I have read so far.  I am still new to writing so I have been both writing and trying to learn at the same time.  I am glad I have read your Hub and I will try to take what I learned here and apply it to my Hubs that I have already written plus my Hubs that I will write in the future. Johnkadu123 from Toronto, Canada on June 13, 2012: Thank god for this hub. I know what needs to be done. My score started on 87 and then went down to 83. I have been in panic mode until I read this article. I think I now know what to do. One thing that worries me is the low traffic figures. Does anyone know how I can improve my traffic figures over the long term. newseotactics from KY on June 06, 2012: Amazing article! Very helpful!! nilknarf_soive from Isabel Town on May 30, 2012: I have been in hubpage, or at least my account have been for 2 years but totally inactive. I had my first post yesterday. I wanted to know about hubscore so I got this article and it is very helpful. Thanks! Jessee R from Gurgaon, India on May 28, 2012: Very useful! RTalloni on May 27, 2012: I've been meaning to come back to this hub so I'm glad to see it tonight.  Thanks for a great resource on boosting hub scores.  It has straightforward info in an easy to read format with beneficial links. Natasha from Hawaii on May 27, 2012: Thanks for all the great information! Voted up and useful. Maree Michael Martin from Northwest Washington on an Island on May 27, 2012: Very helpful, useful tools.  Thank you so much! mygameguides from The Internet... ;) on March 31, 2012: Thanks for the great hub. I'm new here and hence a low author score. Karla Iverson from Oregon on March 19, 2012: Thanks for the great and very informative hub! I saw a hub score go down a point when it hadn't had traffic for a while. I tracked my hub scores for a few days by exporting them and working in Excel to compare all of them. I was a little panicky to see the scores on some go up and some go down without enough visitors to account for the changes - I still get trickles rather than floods. I had assumed that hub scores were purely voting by hubbers who read my hubs. Naïve! As usual, it's a combination of things. Renz Kristofer Cheng from Manila on March 18, 2012: This is really helpful! I'm new to hubpages, and this certainly contains a lot of information! Thanks! Injured lamb on March 08, 2012: Thanks again Rae...this hub helps me to understand much more about how to improve my hubscore, well, clear and concise! voted this up! Cheers! LauraGT from MA on February 26, 2012: This is a great introduction for a new hubber (me!)  I didn't even know there were hub metrics. Thanks for the clear, concise explanation. marinandee from Kuala Lumpur on February 20, 2012: Hi Relache, thanks for this great post. I never thought before our hub score calculate with such algorithm. Michael S from Danville, VA on February 19, 2012: Good stuff here. I'm in a phase now of updating everything and this helps a lot. Cheers! CZCZCZ from Oregon on February 17, 2012: Good read thanks for putting this together.  Off to go work on a few of my under performing hubs and try and get their hub scores to increase. Theresa D from England, UK on February 17, 2012: Great hubs. You have covered all the information to write and publish better hubs. Thanks for this. It's much useful. PennySeeds on February 12, 2012: Thanks for the tips. Trying to learn how scoring works. I thought maybe hubpages didn't like a hub I published recently and that's why my score went down but maybe I didn't wait long enough. Does your author score take into account an average of all your hubs? Ruth R. Martin from Everywhere Online  ~ Fingerlakes ~ Upstate New York on February 09, 2012: Thank you for all the tips - I didn't know about using the 'stats' above each hub to see my Hub Metrics. Thank you for sharing that in detail, it helps me understand what I can do to make my hubs better. MomsTreasureChest on February 04, 2012: Thanks for the information, newbie here and still learning! thebestyou on January 31, 2012: awesome!

When i started there is tremendous low hub score but after reading your reviews it helped me lot. Especially the rules for hubscore. Sondra Rochelle from USA on January 06, 2012: Outstanding, informative and well written hub.  You've cleared up a lot of questions for me.

Brittainia from US on December 21, 2011: Thanks, this really cleared up some confusing points. badger1b from Colorado on December 16, 2011: Thank you so much.  I just signed up with HubPages yesterday so this Hub is a bit too much for me yet, but I promise I will be back to this Hub again and again as I gain experience. katinaferguson on December 09, 2011: Hmmm. I do wonder about the traffic/score correlation though. One of my hubs has a current score of 86 and only has 120 views, total. Another one has a 144 total views and it ranks 65. Another one, a draft with no views except 1 (me) is already rated at 64 and it has not been published. I would venture to say that ""content is King."" The titles and subject matter weigh heavily in this cryptic algorithm...at least, that's my observation. Well written hub though, voted up and useful :) Thanks for taking the time to write this. There is a lot to take away. senderwollas from Earth :) on December 05, 2011: Thank you soooo much for this magnificent hub! Extra informative article, will definitely keep it in mind. dress4less on December 04, 2011: Excellent Hub really helpful it will really help me to improve my own Hub score.

Awesome and thanks again, tim Moon Lightened from Delhi, India on November 29, 2011: Great hub and very helpful.  Thank you! LindaSmith1 from USA on November 29, 2011: Great hub. Learned some things about the metrics which I did not know. Only one issue: There are hubs with scores of 60 that are not only poorly written, but contain a few sentences and then a video slapped in there, title had nothing to do with content other than one sentence, maybe, in the hub while long time hubbers with great hubs start out with scores of 49. Marisa Hammond Olivares from Texas on November 29, 2011: Creme de la Creme! This is a perfect resource and a MUST for me to bookmark. With your 5 successful years on HP I am confident this info is top notch. LOTS of great links as well! Thank you Relache. Voted up and sharing! :) Cindy Murdoch from Texas on September 20, 2011: This is a great hub. I had it bookmarked to read when I had a spare minute. I'm glad I did! I am going to leave it bookmarked as it has lots of good info that I can return to again and again. Thanks for this wealth of information. Xinox Leugim from Philippines on September 02, 2011: Hi, relache. So glad I've came to read this very informative hub of yours. I did have questions on hubscore the first time I've published my first hub and this hub noweliminates my confusion. True to what you say, the first time I published my first hub it did have a low score as you mentioned that new hubs are rated low. I am amazed when I found it today to be at 92 already. Well, that's something that am happy about. But as you said that hubscores go up and down, hope this wouldn't dive to a very low rate. Thanks so much. This hub is such great. Matt Stark from Albany, CA on August 29, 2011: Thanks for the awesome hub.  Very clear and informative and the Hub Metrics info is great! funmontrealgirl from Montreal on August 28, 2011: Now that I understand the way hubscores work, I am off to find out how hubbers scores work. :) I am teetering at 70 to 80....

25,HubPages 3.0: Death of a Community,community," Shauna believes that communication is key to success and happiness. Keeping those channels open is paramount to a writer. This author in 2011 Photo by my son, personal collection When I first joined HubPages in 2011, I was a bit trepidatious of putting my work out there for the world to see. Then I received notification of my first follower. Then the next and the next and my fears began to dissipate. What was so amazing, and comforting, was the communication and support I received through the comments section. Before long I’d gained not only followers, but friends. One by one, we came together as a community who shared stories, offered advice and support. We genuinely care about each other both on and off the screen. This was solely made possible because we were afforded the ability and encouraged to comment on each other’s posts and respond to those comments on our own. Community. That’s why most of us are still here. My 2016 Hubbie Award for Best Article Photo by Shauna L Bowling Niche sites came into play a couple of years ago and they were beautiful. Bolder, larger photos, more tips for success were offered when writing and posting our articles. It seemed HP really did want us to succeed. I remember the thrill of receiving my first (canned) email from the HP editors that one of my articles had been chosen for a niche site. That was a big deal! A major stroke to the ego and a minor stroke to the bank account. And I wasn’t the only one. Many of our efforts were rewarded with our articles making the grade and sliding over to one of many new niche sites. Our ever-growing community came forth as our biggest cheerleaders congratulating us on the move. Way to go! Good for you! You deserve it! Comments increased, new writers joined the gang, and the community continued to grow and thrive. On the downside, Amazon capsules were removed. Sure, we can embed links in the body of our articles, but for the most part, the means to earn through Amazon purchases has fallen to the wayside. Many writers left HP after these changes were made, but many of us are still here. We’re here because of the interaction and friendships we’ve garnered through the common ground of creative souls. Community. That’s why most of us are still here. A community torn apart Photo by Shauna L Bowling Twenty-Twenty marks the year the world was plagued with the COVID-19 pandemic. Twenty-Twenty marks the year of racial and social unrest. Twenty-Twenty marks the year of wildfires and hurricanes destroying land and lives. Twenty-Twenty marks the death of the community. With social distancing a worldwide reality, businesses closing or laying off employees, writers have had more time to write. Writing is therapy. Posting what we write is a way to reach out. To keep lines of communication open. To interact with fellow humans. To not feel so isolated. Then HP adopted Maven’s bland, generic black and white platform for its niche sites. Comments are no longer possible. We have no choice or say in the matter. Communication has been slashed at the throat. HubPages 3.0 marks the death of a community. It seems HP is more concerned with making money than nurturing writers and the community they’ve created on what once was the greatest platform for creative minds to express themselves. I’m sure there are plenty of HP authors who are happy with the changes. I’m referring to those who don’t comment on articles they read or even respond to comments their readers are compelled to leave on their posts. They don’t have to interact, nor do they want to interact. But I’m here for the community. The members inspire me to write. They inspire me to share. And they fill my heart with love. And then… HubPages 3.0 marked the death of a community. Should I pack my bags and leave? Photo by a friend, personal collection So, what do we do besides pray our articles aren’t selected for the niche sites? When we go into “My Account”, we’re given the option to read any niche articles on HubPages. In fact, that’s the only way we can edit them. However, our readers don’t have that option. Our community no longer has the ability to interact with each other. We’re not given the choice. Disabling the Comments section is akin to cutting out our tongues, rendering us speechless. So, what happens now? Does the community disband, go their separate ways? I shudder the thought. But what choice do we have now that HP has severed the lifeline between its creatives? Does HP have enough anti-social authors to keep them afloat if those of us who remain because of the community are forced to leave? Why on Earth would HP cut off our communication? It makes no sense. They grade us on our comment levels. They grade us on our comments leading to great discussions. They grade us on participation. We receive accolades from the HP community. Lack of communication is one huge factor that has led to the current state of the globe. Communication is key to success. It’s the key to friendships. It’s the key to survival. Without it, what’s left? This content reflects the personal opinions of the author.

Dangling in limbo is a very insecure feeling. Marisa Writes on November 08, 2020: Strangely, there is no head honcho listed for HP now - only a couple of managers. I had forgotten about that whole ""applying to write"" thing. You may be right. Worrying. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on November 08, 2020: Marisa, I wouldn't be surprised if Maven is working on a way to do without the HP writers, as I type this. When Maven first came into play, they would only consider the absolute very best authors to post on their sites. If I recall correctly, there was some kind of application process. Only a select few were chosen. And I mean a few. Since Paul is no longer affiliated with HubPages, I wonder just how long Maven is going to patronize us. Who's the head honcho for HP now? Do you know? Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on November 08, 2020: I hear you, Marisa. If that's the only site left where writers and readers can leave comments, that says something about the new age environment. If that's the case, about the only sites left that will allow comments are personal blogs. And unless you have a huge following, post often, and have a professional-looking presence, chances of making any money worth mentioning are slim. Marisa Writes on November 08, 2020: I agree Wizzley isn't pretty and there is a learning curve.  All I'm saying is, if you want to write on a site where you can post and read each other's articles and leave comments, that's the only choice left.  So it's something to park in your mind as a last refuge. Marisa Writes on November 08, 2020: HubPages was never a democracy.  HubPages has always been a business and they never, ever considered us as employees.  Ever.  Because the previous owners were benevolent and communicated with us, we writers often started to believe we DID have a say.  But every time a crisis occurred,we were sharply reminded that we did not.  During crises, we'd be excluded, patted on the head and assured everything would be all right, go away and play until it's over. Then harsh decisions would be announced and our objections counted for nothing. The difference now is that Paul (the previous owner) always had the good of the site at heart, because without it, there was no business. So although we felt hurt by being excluded, the site did recover and kept going, which benefited us in the end.   Maven doesn't care about HubPages as a whole, it just wants the profitable niche sites. If it could work out how to get articles without the HubPages mechanism, it would've done it by now. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on November 08, 2020: Betrayed is an appropriate expression of the changes that are being forced on us, Ann. Apparently, there's no democracy within the confines of HP/Maven. Will our concerns be met with positive change? We can only wait and see. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on November 08, 2020: I agree with you, John. I've decided to continue with HP and aim my subject matter towards topics that will (hopefully) make the niche sites. However, whether or not comments are reinstated will determine how much effort I'll put into posting more frequently. Having non-discover articles sitting idly on HP is quite discouraging. But, like you, I don't have the time to seek other venues. Fortunately, I still hold a full-time job, so I'm not worried about the income. It will be interesting to see, though, how my passive income from writing is affected. With only the niche sites earning come Wednesday, I'll be keeping a closer eye on the pennies I earn. As I've stated to Ann, Wizzley does not impress me at all. I would be ashamed to have my work on that site. Ann Carr from SW England on November 08, 2020: I don't want to move either. I feel rather betrayed at the moment but then business is business.... ! We'll see. Ann John Hansen from Gondwana Land on November 08, 2020: I checked Wizzley, but wasn’t overly Impressed. Let’s hope the comments feature gets reinstated on the niche sites sooner than later. I don’t want to move. It is too much trouble, and will take time I don’t have. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on November 08, 2020: I've heard that, too, Liz. I don't think page views can be considered engagement. But who am I to say? Oh yeah, I'm a concerned writer, that's who! Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on November 08, 2020: Aurelia, HP says they're working on reinstating comments, but I'll believe it when I see. Maven doesn't have comments on their other sites (as far as I know) and it's their front-end software HP is using. It'll take some reprogramming to install a feature that currently doesn't exist. Will Maven allow them to do so? Hmmmm. Liz Elias from Oakley, CA on November 08, 2020: I agree, Aurelio:  I do believe I've heard more than once that Google measures engagement... Aurelio Locsin from Orange County, CA on November 08, 2020: I think many writers agree with you.  Many are here for the community and the money.  I think removing comments will be detrimental to traffic because I believe Google measures engagement to decide if an article is worth ranking high in the search pages. But like you said, what can we do? Ann Carr from SW England on November 08, 2020: Not today, Shauna. It's dull and cold out there so just doing some tidying up. Should be sunny tomorrow! It's Armistice Day here today. Hope you're having a good Sunday too. Ann Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on November 08, 2020: That's good to know, Ann. I didn't like the looks of it. It looks like blogspot, which is very amateurish in my opinion. I wonder how many Internet searches bring up Wizzley article results. I'd never even heard of the site until Marisa brought it to our attention. I've certainly never seen a Wizzley URL in any of my searches, and I search almost on a daily basis. Thanks for the info, Ann. Enjoy your Sunday. A walk along the seaside perhaps? Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on November 08, 2020: I hope so, too, Rosina. The communication between us is what has built the community and friendships. To take that away is akin to putting a muzzle on a dog. Ann Carr from SW England on November 08, 2020: Shauna, I've been back to look at Wizzley and the site is all over the place.  I can't find out how to create an account with them or how to create an article - it's so user unfriendly!  Don't think I'll bother. Anyone know differently? Ann Rosina S Khan on November 08, 2020: I have been here on HP for about two years, Shauna, and one of the great things about it I thought was to receive comments on my article posts and replying to those comments. I also enjoyed commenting on my followers' posts and getting their replies. It was a great way to interact and feel a sense of belonging until HP decided to stop the option of commenting (perhaps temporarily) on niche sites. I do hope with all my heart that HP gives us back the option of commenting on niche sites. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on November 07, 2020: I agree with you 1,000 percent, Ann. HP's niche sites were pretty. Ann Carr from SW England on November 07, 2020: Yes, I agree. It looked similar but not as good.  In fact, I was really impressed with HP until they went and messed it all up with Maven! Ann Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on November 07, 2020: If you're referring to Wizzley, I wasn't impressed with the layout. HubPages.com has a much better look in my opinion. Ann Carr from SW England on November 06, 2020: I've had a cursory look and it has a feel of HP re layout. It's not so easy to navigate but I'll  go back for more detail. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on November 06, 2020: Ann, if you could come back with your findings and share with us, I'd really appreciate it and I'm sure our fellow writers will as well. HP might not like it, but I highly doubt this article will be sent to discover.hubpages, so I think we'll be safe. Gotta do what we can for our community, right? Ann Carr from SW England on November 04, 2020: Ok, will do. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on November 04, 2020: Ann, email me when you've investigated. Since I work full time, I don't really have the time to snoop around. Ann Carr from SW England on November 04, 2020: I like your idea of a 'holiday site'.  I too will look at Wizzley and see what transpires. I delve into this now and then & find out about all sorts of things! Ann Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on November 04, 2020: manatita, the only way to comment on the niche sites is to do so thru your feed. If you see a comment, you can reply to the comment. Right now that's the only way. But a comment needs to have been posted before the article was moved or they won't show in your feed. manatita44 from london on November 04, 2020: I'm seeing comments on my niche sites. Mary Norton and Rinita, but more. Don't know how they did it. I can't respond though. I've asked Mary but no answer as yet. Stay blessed! Marisa Writes on November 01, 2020: Dobar dan, Devika. I hope you know that Adsense doesn't work on HubPages any more - I suggest you check your Earnings page to make sure you have the HP Earnings Program set up correctly. However, it's unlikely you'll make much money unless you can get your Hubs accepted to the niche sites - that's where the income is. Devika Primić from Dubrovnik, Croatia on November 01, 2020: Hi Marissa I have noticed my earnings have dropped and Adsense has not increased on earnings. This is frustrating  and I do not know what to do. Any advice, please.You can email me fancy1606@gmail.com, thank you Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on November 01, 2020: Thanks, Sally. I'm sure I can too. I had Adsense on my website in addition to HP when they had it in place. Sally Gulbrandsen from Norfolk on November 01, 2020: I continue to earn through Adsense and Amazon, not much but about the same as I did when we needed Adsense here.  I just thought it prudent to hang onto it in this insecure times.  I am sure you can use your Adsense on a new site. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on November 01, 2020: Sally, I had a website for a few years but took it down because I didn't keep up with the blog portion. The site was mainly meant to be a presence for the freelance business I had at the time. Traffic was low because I suck at marketing and don't frequent the social media sites despite the fact that I have accounts on several of them. It's much more convenient to have a site like this do the marketing and monetizing for you. Many of my articles are on the new niche sites as well. Earnings had gone down during the migration. Hopefully they'll pick back up once the jostling between sites is complete. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on November 01, 2020: I still have Amazon and Adsense thru HP. From what I understand, we no longer earn thru Adsense, but I've never deleted the account. I'll have to look at it to see if it's directly tied to HP or if I can add a site. It's been forever since I've even looked at my Adsense account. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on November 01, 2020: Marisa, many Florida residents have two homes: one here and one up north. I think I'll do the same, but keep HP and its Maven niche sites as my main home and find another for my vacation home. I will check more closely into Wizzley to see if it's a good fit for my second home. Sally Gulbrandsen from Norfolk on November 01, 2020: I notice that nearly three quarters of my writing has now been moved to the Niche sites.   Earnings, traffic and CPM has improved with these moves.  I have never relied on comments for traffic, but have rather promoted my work via groups which share my interests on facebook.   Pinterest has been especially helpful for traffic.  I seldom receive a comment from this source.  I receive hundreds of comments and shares via groups which share my interest on facebook. I have rather enjoyed the interaction between hubbers who have become my 'friends' over the years and I will miss that connection even though some of those people have become facebook friends.   For me concentrating on a Niche evergreen subject was certainly the best advice I ever received from HubPages.  I have retained my Adsense and Amazon to use on my own Website but as Marisa says it is hard to run your own website.  This platform is so easy to write on and it is definitely not as easy to do what I do on my own site. Marisa Writes on October 31, 2020: I was thinking the other option is to create a new website, as you did for the poets - but as you found, it's hard to run a website by committee!! Marisa Writes on October 31, 2020: You are right, you need to sign up for whatever programs you want to use - Amazon, eBay, Zazzle, Adsense etc.  I assume some HubPages members would still have Amazon and maybe Adsense from the old days? John Hansen from Gondwana Land on October 31, 2020: I checked out Wizzley, and recognise about half a dozen members there in the 12 or so pages of authors I checked. It could be a possible place to move our HubPage content to. It sounds like you have to organise your own advertising/monetizing through Adsense or another provider though. Marisa Writes on October 31, 2020: You are right Shauna.  The thing is, sometimes it's time to move house - but it's best to make a conscious decision to move as a family, not wait until the house is burning down and you each have to make your escape (and perhaps get separated in the process).   However, I understand how hard it is to leave these familiar walls. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 31, 2020: Millicent, you're not alone. This topic came about because with the loss of the ability to comment, we lose touch with our community. It's a very isolating feeling. Let's hope for the best and keep positive thoughts. In the meantime, keep writing! Marisa has given us some options for placing our work that will eventually stagnate on HP elsewhere. Thanks for joining the conversation. That's what community's all about! Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 31, 2020: That's my worry for Bill, too, John. I've only recently seen a couple of his articles go to Letterpile. But he says he's not here for the money. It's up to him to decide whether or not to keep The Mailbag, Walks With Maggie, and his version of The Porch alive. For those of us who have articles on the niche sites, at least we have the potential to earn a passive income. That will keep me here but I will be more selective of the topics I post. Income will be the motivation. The return of comments is far down the road. It seems it's taken a back seat to all other issues. We're left with ""I'll believe it when I see it."" Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 31, 2020: Yes, Marisa, we're comfortable here. We've created an online family and it's never easy leaving home. But you make a very valid point. Gotta keep the momentum going or complacency is liable to set in. Millicent Okello from Nairobi, Kenya on October 31, 2020: Dear Shauna, Thank you for standing with us in this article. As much as I have not been here for long, I felt the need for somebody  to notice how HP community is falling apart.  Whenever I write an article and find it already published with limited comments, I feel bad about it. My writings come from the people who inspire,  appreciate it and encourage me to strive on. Otherwise, what can I  do when the only place that I call my second home with my second family has restrictions? Thank you. John Hansen from Gondwana Land on October 30, 2020: Thank you, Marisa, for the info on Wizzley, and Shauna for continuing this dialogue. There is much to consider. I was wondering about Bill's thousands of articles because most of his are in series form. If they stay on HubPages he will earn virtually nothing. At least I have about half my articles on about six niche sites. Marisa Writes on October 30, 2020: Yes Shauna, that's what worries me too. Even if comments are reinstated, I fear it will be many months away.  My fear, if everyone takes a ""wait and see"" approach, is that people will lose the habit of writing these series and reading them - so that when (if) comments finally come back, it'll be too hard to get them going again. Whereas if you proactively move that activity to another site, there's a chance you can preserve that sense of community. It is difficult, because it would be so much easier to use one site for all our needs, as people have done with HubPages for so long. Robert Sacchi on October 30, 2020: Marisa Wright - Thanks for the tip on Wizzley. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 30, 2020: Oh, okay. I forgot about that old HP layout. I don't like it. If Wizzley has other options, that's encouraging. What really bothers me about the new discover site is my friends such as billybuc (Bill Holland), CarbDiva (Linda Lum), and Jodah (John Hansen) who have series that are quite successful amongst the HP community, will lose the heartbeat that keeps them pumping. I don't know what or if they earn from them, but typically, series don't get moved to niche sites, so the earnings are based on page views alone. As Samantha pointed out, it could take fourteen years to reach payout on the pennies earned from page views, which is why hubpages.com will no longer be an earning vessel. Furthermore, all of the series my friends post are fueled by questions or suggestions posed in the comments. It saddens me to think that these series that have been propelled by readers for years will either come to an end or merely be a sole means of keeping engagement and the community alive. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 30, 2020: Marisa, I'm thinking along the same line. Many of my articles are on niche sites. I have sixteen chapters of a paranormal novel I began years ago (and have yet to finish) that I posted on HP, more for feedback than anything else. I'm sure I've garnered all the comments I'm going to get on those. I also have several poems that I posted way back when I joined in 2011. Poems are not money makers so I'll take those down, except for a couple that I can think of right off the top of my head. I enjoy writing fiction, but Letterpile is low on the totem pole as far as the niche sites go. Having a story go to Letterpile is more a placating pat on the head than an achievement. I'll leave my fiction work on HP. Not sure what I'll do with future endeavors in that genre. I'm a writer who doesn't stick to one niche, yet have something to offer. I think the variety of niche sites where my articles have been sent - mostly by HP - gives me the motivation and confirmation that I'm a writer who can and does provide content that offers something to the searching public. As I said, I'll continue to post here. I'll concentrate on articles that will provide valuable information, both to the reader and me. I really appreciate your thoughts and support. Marisa Writes on October 30, 2020: The Amazon ads are all hers.  Like I said, she's gone overboard, but the point is that she has that choice - Wizzley is less dictatorial than HP! The layout is more like the old Hubpages where you can have photos and text side-by-side as well, so the look of the article is very much up to the author. Marisa Writes on October 30, 2020: I would suggest a split strategy.  If you have an idea for an evergreen article that would fit on a successful niche site, then write it on HubPages and see what happens. If you have an idea for an article that would fit on a poorly-performing niche site (like Letterpile), then write it on Wizzley instead, because the earnings potential there is about the same. If other Hubbers take a similar approach, you would eventually have a lively social atmosphere on Wizzley while your ""serious"" work is on the niche sites Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 30, 2020: Thanks, Marisa. I haven't read the article yet, but I know her from HP. To be honest, I never considered her a good writer. Taking a cursory glance, the site is awkward. It doesn't fill the page and it's full of ads. Or is the bulk of what I'm seeing purposely placed links to products by the author? Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 30, 2020: Marisa, that's a good thought. Perhaps the laws of supply and demand will influence the earning potential at Wizzley. Weekendnotes sounds like a possibility for travel writers. I'm going thru my HP articles this weekend (those that haven't been moved to niche sites). I'll delete those with minimal views and tweak the others in hopes of them at least making it to the discover site. At least there, they have the potential for earnings, meager as that may be. I'll continue to write on this site with the intention of meeting niche site standards, regardless of the fact that I'm not happy with the Maven format. However, that will be a true test as to where my earnings are coming from. I'll also be curious to see if the gap between payout shortens. It's actually widened since HP moved our niche sites to the Maven platform. Despite the fact that I've only recently begun posting again, I've realized a payout every other month. Since Maven came into play hot and heavy, my payouts average about four months in between. This whole debacle is depressing. Marisa Writes on October 30, 2020: Here's a typical article from Wizzley, written by an ex-Hubber (and I see the comments, though few, are all from ex-Hubbers too!) Wizzley.com/doing-your-own-laundry-for-beginners/ (note:  I feel she has overloaded her article with Amazon products, but that is her choice, not Wizzley's). Marisa Writes on October 30, 2020: Sadly, Wizzley is the only site that offers a similar experience to the old HubPages.  All the rest have closed down. Like I said, earnings are not great right now, but maybe an influx of new, active writers from HP might help? For those who like to write about their local area, Weekendnotes.com has good earnings potentia, butl not so good for the social side of things. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 30, 2020: Thanks for the tip, Marisa. Wizzley might be worth looking into. I'll certainly do some research. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 30, 2020: I agree, Marisa. I just wonder how much weight Samantha really has with the rest of the team. She keeps saying the comments are coming back, but you'd think that would happen before the discover.hubpages site comes out. According to her, Wednesday is when the move will happen. Marisa Writes on October 30, 2020: For those looking for a new home, consider Wizzley.com.  Earnings potential is questionable - but then, earnings potential on HubPages.com is now zero!   It's owned by a private individual who is content with modest earnings, and there's an option to add a Comments capsule to your articles.  Last time I looked there were several refugees from Squidoo and HubPages there. Marisa Writes on October 30, 2020: Shauna, you are right. When Maven bought HubPages, I predicted that the main site would become nothing more than a ""holding site"" to allow us to create our articles. It's taken them longer than I expected but here it is. I am beginning to feel pessimistic about comments being reinstated, in spite of being so confident earlier. They may be ""on the list"" but it's clear they're a very low priority. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 30, 2020: Chitrangada, you're welcome. It seems the original HP site will be reduced to a portal where we post only. Unless, of course, they come up with a completely different home page for each of us. Articles that sit on HP will be useless as far as earnings.  I just don't know, but it seems HP as we know and love it is rapidly being phased out. Chitrangada Sharan from New Delhi, India on October 29, 2020: Hi Shauna! It all sounds frustrating and discouraging to me, like many other writers. It seems that the original Hubpages will be completely lost. While I don't understand the consequences to so many frequent changes, one thing is definitely clear-- the lack of motivation to publish new articles. Thank you for the updates. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 29, 2020: Yep. I agree, Robert. Robert Sacchi on October 29, 2020: Terrible news. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 29, 2020: Liz, I fear we're all in the same boat. Unless comments are enabled in the niche sites, we're sunk. Being able to comment on anything left on this site will be nothing more than an exercise in social media. It would be nice if staff would at least let us earn from page views. But Samantha was clear in stating that articles remaining on hubpages.com will NOT be monetized. Period. Liz Elias from Oakley, CA on October 29, 2020: This really chaps my hide!  Just when I'm FINALLY making payout every month, and getting higher daily earnings than ever. They are doing everything possible to discourage writers....and why?  If they expect to make money, they are doing all the wrong things. Unless...Maven bought HP simply to destroy it as a tax write-off.. I have no idea where else I'd go to earn from my writing. I don't have the technical know-how to design my own website (or money to pay for hosting), and I can't re-monetize anything else, because all my Google contact/password info has been lost...and they are 1) not helpful--they ignore questions, and 2) they won't let you have 2 accounts! Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 29, 2020: Samantha is still staying ""yet"" to no comments. We'll see whether or not they get brought back. I'm not too keen on having all new articles going over to the HP niche where no one can comment. Samantha says all articles will be written in the current HP site and will move to discover.hubpages once they've passed QAP. Ann Carr from SW England on October 29, 2020: Time for me to pull out then, I think. No hasty action but I'm leaning that way. Ann Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 29, 2020: Folks, Samantha just answered my question regarding discover.hubpages.com. It will look just like the other Maven niche sites with ads, the annoying video at the top and NO COMMENTS! Ann Carr on October 29, 2020: Yes! You too! Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 29, 2020: Stay safe, my friend! Ann Carr from SW England on October 29, 2020: Yes, I get that impression too. So glad I have back-up of everything! I'm fine, thanks, but increasingly worried about this new Covid wave. More restrictions and people are getting restless, that's the worry. Ah well, c'est la vie! Will watch this space! Ann Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 29, 2020: Ann, I think the intent is to phase out Hubpages. I hope I'm wrong. My payout yesterday came from Maven Coalition, not Hubpages. I'm doing well, Ann. And you? Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 29, 2020: That's what is sounds like to me, Tim. If that's the case, anything left on the original HP site, which will no longer be eligible for earnings, will stagnate. I wonder if eventually this site we're on right now will just fade away. Another question is: where will we do our posting? Right now the original HP site is where we do the creating, then they get moved from here - or not. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 29, 2020: John, don't we get paid a few pennies for page views? Ann Carr from SW England on October 29, 2020: Thanks for that link regarding discover.hubpages.com. It all still sounds rather vague though. I fear our cosy site will never be the same again! However, if we can transfer to that and receive a little more revenue, then it might help. I just feel let down as it seems many do, from reading the comments here. Hope all is well with you, Shauna. Ann Tim Mitchell from Escondido, CA on October 29, 2020: Here is the quote from Samatha's post regarding what determines moving to Discover.Hubpages. ""The new discover.hubpages.com will host all content that meets our established minimum traffic threshold and all newly published content that does not move to a niche site like DenGarden, Bellatory, or PairedLife."" To me the second part saying ""content that does not move to a niche site"" is vague. Does that mean all new content? John Hansen from Gondwana Land on October 29, 2020: How can you tell which articles you earn from? My Poems From the Porch 46 had 349 views in the month and has 60 comments, so maybe most views were from outside HubPages. It depends whether they allow ‘series’ to move to discover.hubpages. They say they aren’t acceptable for niche sites. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 29, 2020: Someone asked Samantha that question on the forum, John. Hopefully, she'll answer it. I, too, would like to know what measures the articles will have to meet to make it to discover.hubpages.com. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 29, 2020: I agree, Marisa. Is Maven trying to completely phase out the original HP site? If no earnings are possible, what's the point? Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 29, 2020: I agree to a point, John. If we still don't have the ability to comment on the new HP site, your Porch series, Linda's Q & A, and Bill's Mailbag will have no fuel. If they remain on the original HP site, there will be no earnings to be made. It will come down to whether or not the writer is posting strictly for pleasure and is willing to give up any earnings made. Do you make anything off your porch series? John Hansen from Gondwana Land on October 29, 2020: That's true. I just wonder what criteria they will use to select hubs to move to discover.hubpages.com. One's that haven't been moved already to niche sites but are deemed better than ones being left on HubPages. Marisa Writes on October 29, 2020: I just wonder what the effect will be, as there will be no opportunity to earn anything from HubPages unless you can get your Hubs transferred out.  That might have a discouraging effect John Hansen from Gondwana Land on October 28, 2020: Yes, read that. New changes happening every day. It actually sounds like a good idea to me. It should make it easier to determine what articles need to be worked on and upgraded. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 28, 2020: I saw it Marisa, and asked a question. For all who haven't seen it, here's the link: https://hubpages.com/community/forum/349902/new-hu... I appreciate your participation in this article's thread, Marisa. You've always been a go-to person when it comes to the forums that matter. Marisa Writes on October 28, 2020: I hope everyone saw the new announcement about HubPages.com.   In future, it will not be monetized at all. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 27, 2020: LIz, to further my response to your comment, my most successful article is ""Green Tip: Maintaining Your Septic Tank Without Chemicals"". It has been on DenGarden since HP first introduced niche sites, but I originally posted it in 2011. I've had over 188,000 reads, 46 of which were today. It's also my leading Amazon earnings article. I doubt people enter ""Green Tip"" when they're searching about septic system maintenance, but environmentally conscious folks will add ""without chemicals"" to their search. These are the keywords that bring them to my article. This is what I mean to convey: Use words in your title and throughout the article (without keyword stuffing) that will bring the readers who would be interested in your topic/advice/experience. This works best with how-to articles, reviews, first-hand knowledge, anything other than fiction. BTW, in checking My Account for the stats on the aforementioned article, I noticed the niche articles no longer say ""view on HubPages"". They say, ""Author's view"". When you click that link, you're then taken to the original post on HP, which is where you'd go to edit it. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 27, 2020: That doesn't surprise me, John. I think that's why more people are getting away from Google and using DuckDuckGo as their preferred search engine. From what I understand, DuckDuckGo doesn't track your history, which in this day of cyberstalking and adware infections, is very attractive to those of us who use the Internet on a daily basis. That said, as I mentioned to Robert, when I Googled ""Philly Cheesesteak recipes"", that's what I got - Philly cheesesteak recipes. However all pages were rife with ads for my most recent searches. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 27, 2020: LIz, I don't use a title tool. I'm simply talking about thinking like your average searcher. What terms would they put into the search bar to find what they're looking for? I know we all do research whether for personal use or information to enhance our articles. We need to step out of writer mode when we're titling our articles and step into average user mode. Usually when I begin an article or story (always in Word first), I'll give it a cursory title until I complete the article, then I finalize it. I then copy/paste into the HP write mode. I've never gotten a message that the title has already been taken. Where are you when you get that message? John Hansen from Gondwana Land on October 27, 2020: I have read that now Google have altered the search result algorithm or whatever they use so that their affiliated articles etc show first in search results no matter what you type in. The first page may show things that are not even directly related to your search, just close. Liz Elias from Oakley, CA on October 27, 2020: The problem with just titling an article with what an average searcher would enter, I've found, is that you can't usually do it. Most of the time, it comes back with ""That title is already taken,"" and you are forced to enter some variant that excludes if from generic search terms. :-( Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 27, 2020: I've Googled it before, Robert. The only time it shows up first and on the first page is when I enter the entire article. The first couple of pages mostly result in videos and posts by know food channels on TV and online. I don't think this article has any bearing on search results for any of my other articles. Searches are driven by keywords. Robert Sacchi on October 27, 2020: Exactly.  Using the full title would probably put an article on the top of the list.  That ""Philly Cheesesteak Recipes"" didn't show your article is telling.  Do you know if that query would have showed your article pre-HubPages 3.0? Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 27, 2020: Right. I understand the specific search words. However, the average Internet surfer isn't going to put in the title of the article. They would query something like ""HubPages Reviews"" or something to that effect. Last night I Googled ""Philly Cheesesteak Recipes"". My article didn't come up on the first six pages. But when I Googled ""The Best Damn Philly Cheesesteak"" my article was number one on page one. Butt who actually would use that phrase when looking for Philly Cheesesteak recipes? You have to think like the average searcher when entitling articles. Think about what you type into the search bar when you're seeking information. Type in any of your titles verbatim and they'll all show up on page one. But that's not the way to test the success of an article. Robert Sacchi on October 26, 2020: For example this article.  Do a Google search on ""HubPages 3.0"" and see if and where the article shows up.  This article doesn't seem to show up on the first page by searching this way.  A search on ""HubPages 3.0: Death of a Community"" puts your article on the top of the list.  The later search is too specific for this purpose.  You may wat to try one of your articles that use to be very popular. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 26, 2020: What do you mean, Robert? See where it comes up in search results? Or do you have a way of actually seeing a number score on an article? Robert Sacchi on October 26, 2020: Another possibility is Goggle lowered the scores of the niche sites because of the ads.  One thing to test is to do a keyword search appropriate for one of your articles and see how it scores. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 26, 2020: Robert, here are my stats for the last seven days: Total Views: 784 Niche Views: 643 HubPages Views: 141 Traffic Sources (it must not be updated because it shows fewer views for the last seven days than does my account): Google: 425 Pinterest: 43 HubPages: 69 Bing: 16 Yahoo: 7 Dengarden: 28 Facebook: 3 DuckDuckGo: 16 Delishably: 2 Most of my hits definitely come from search engines and most articles read are on the niche sites. So why are my earnings down? It would be interesting to know the bounce rate of viewers who land on our niche site articles. Bounce rate indicates how many readers leave the page before reading the entire article. I suspect with the annoying features on the niche sites that the bounce rates are pretty high, which would affect earnings. Robert Sacchi on October 25, 2020: That would be good since I don't get very many hits so numbers for a more successful Hubber would seem more useful. Shauna L Bowling (author) from Central Florida on October 25, 2020: That's usually the case with mine, too, Robert. I need to try to remember to do a new tally."
26,"Oh, No! The Paste Icon Has Frozen My Computer Screen in HubPages!",community," I'm an aspiring writer, but overall, I am an American who seeks a better United States of America.  Come join me in my journey of truth. ""OpenClipart-Vectors"" is the creator of this image. Pixabay I have been a hubber for nearly six years, and there is this one glitch on the HubPages writing platform that greatly baffles me. Whenever I am typing text in an editing dialogue box to insert in a capsule and I wish to copy and paste something, I have to remember to avoid clicking the paste icon during the process or something really annoying happens on my computer screen. In that event, a message will appear at the center of my computer screen that reads: Currently not supported by your browser, use keyboard shortcuts instead. Now, the first time that this ever happened to me, I did not feel alarmed. I thought that all I had to do to return to what I was doing previously was to click the ""cancel"" icon, and all would be well. Unfortunately, this incident did not play out the way I wanted it. I repeatedly clicked the ""cancel"" icon on that same message, and the computer screen remained frozen and the message would not go away. As you probably already realize by now, I was very unhappy about this mishap. In fact, I wanted to scream. It only went from bad to worse when I tried to shut down that same window by clicking the ""x"" on the upper right hand corner of my computer screen, and I got a message at the top of my computer screen warning me that I stood to lose all of the text that I had typed for that same capsule if I exited out of that window. I was completely taken off guard. Nevertheless, I attempted to cut my losses and I took a screenshot of the frozen computer screen so that I could have some kind of photographic record of at least some of the text I had typed in the editing dialogue box of the capsule. I closed down that window, and I had to rethink what I had previously typed in the above-described capsule of my article after finding that all of my work for it had been completely deleted. I went back into that same unfinished article in my HubPagess acount, and I once again typed the information I had done initially in the editing dialogue box for the capsule in question, and I quoted what text I could see on the screenshot I had taken, word for word. I resolved never to click the paste icon ever again in an editing dialogue box until I was to receive some kind of feedback from someone on the HubPages writing platform that this icon had been fixed. The message that I had gotten as a result of previously clicking the paste button made it appear that I was using the wrong browser. Back then I only had Google Chrome and Internet Explorer on my laptop computer. I normally used Google Chrome, and I did not want to take my chances with the Internet Explorer browser. I now have the Mozilla Firefox browser on my laptop computer, but I haven't used it to test out the paste icon in the HubPages writing platform. I never thought that anything of this nature would ever happen again, but, lo and behold, it did. This time I felt as though I could have clonked myself over the head, because then I had remembered promising myself that I would never click the paste icon in a dialogue box of a capsule again. However, here I was in front of my computer, and that dreaded message was in the center of my computer screen once again after all these years. They say that lightning doesn't strike twice in the same place, but this experience caused me to beg to differ. Did you ever wish that time travel existed? Well, this type of situation will definitely make you want to be able to go backwards 10 to 15 minutes in time so that you could avoid it altogether. I was so agitated when it happened that I could not think of what to type in the editing dialogue box of the above-described capsule to word everything the way I wanted to do so. After I had clicked into my HubPages account to bring what I had composed of the article back to my computer screen, only one sentence remained in that capsule that I had been working on. My train of thought felt shattered. Much to my relief, the fickle finger of fate decided to cut me some slack this time around, and I discovered a way to recover the text that I had lost from that one capsule I had been working on previously. This time I wasn't going to allow myself to be a victim of circumstances or to be defeated. I was going to recover all of that lost text by hook or by crook. Whenever I pull up an editing dialogue box to insert text into a particular capsule, I have no problem with all of the different icons that normally allow me to modify the text therein. However, for one reason or another, the paste icon has never worked for me since the time that I first became a hubber. Anyhow, when you are typing text in an editing dialogue box, you're going to notice that the words ""recover draft"" eventually appear at the bottom left-hand corner of it. To the left of it is a green dot. To the right of it, you'll find information that reads ""[d]raft saved at"" a given time on a given date. I never really paid much attention to this information at the bottom of the editing dialogue box. However, in this particular instance, I was willing to try anything to undo the tragedy that had befallen me. I, therefore, hovered my cursor over the words ""recover draft,"" and I noticed that an underline appeared below these two words every time that I did so. A small message then appeared next to my cursor that read: Press this button to recover using an autosaved draft I clicked onto the words ""recover draft,"" and a series of options displayed at the middle of my computer screen that provided recovery points for text that I had previously typed into the editing dialogue box. I clicked each one of them, and I learned that each of these options contained the text that I had lost in the above-described ordeal at different recovery points. Like a miracle sent down from above, I was able to utilize this same feature to recover each and every word of text that I had accidentally lost upon clicking the paste icon. I sensed a sigh of relief overtaking my soul. I was able to undo the entire debacle that had overpowered me from the moment that I had clicked the paste icon. I probably should contact the HubPages Team to find out what needs to be done to keep the paste icon in question from ever placing me in that horrendous situation again. Nonetheless, for now, at least I know how to recover any text that I lose whenever something goes wrong while I am composing an article on the HubPages writing platform. There is a wealth of excellent information here on the HubPages writing platform about how to use the recover-draft feature in ordeals like these. However, the major problem is that most hubbers don't know that such a feature even exists; and when they find themselves in similar circumstances as mine with the paste icon, they probably seldom ever know how to deal with it unless they have already found out about the recover-draft feature beforehand. After reading this article here of mine, you'll now be well-equipped to pull yourself out of this nerve-wracking situation should you ever encounter it. On the HubPages writing platform, you want to spend all your time composing articles and/or partaking in discussion threads. You do not want to be sucked into the trap of trying to figure out how to recover lost text from an editing dialogue box. You work way too hard putting these articles together to let some technical glitch stand in the way of your dreams of becoming a successful writer. Below is a video that describes the HubPages experience from a bird's eye view. At 6:27 of the video above, Mr. Brockbank shows an example of an editing dialogue box for a capsule to which I refer throughout this article here of mine. Keep in mind that the HubPages writing platform has almost completely phased out the use of Google Adsense as a method of paying their writers. ""geralt"" is the author of this photograph. Pixabay Composing articles for the HubPages writing platform can be like an ongoing learning process. Confronting a problem in which your computer screen freezes up and you lose most of the text, if not all of the text, that you typed in the editing dialogue box of a capsule doesn't have to become a tragedy. In my case, I made the careless mistake of clicking on the paste icon in the editing dialogue box of a capsule, and my computer screen froze without giving me any way of getting out of it unscathed. The recover-draft feature on the HubPages writing platform is a way of salvaging any text that you lose as a result of a mishap similar or identical to the one I described herein. Simply go to the bottom left-hand corner of the editing dialogue box where the loss occurred and click onto ""recover draft."" A set of recovery points will appear on your computer screen that will provide you with everything you need in order to restore all the text that you lost in the previous mishap.

27,How to Get Readers for Your Hubs,community," Kate Swanson wrote her first novel at 15, created her first blog in 2006 and has been writing for profit, and creating websites ever since. If you're trying to make money online with your Hubs, one of the first things you'll read about is the importance of backlinks. Backlinks are simply links TO your Hub FROM other places on the internet. Backlinks are essential for two reasons. One is that real people may click on them and arrive at your Hub. Bingo! You've gained a reader. However the more significant reason is that Google judges your Hub's value by the number of backlinks it has. Get enough backlinks and Google will place your Hub on page 1 of the search results - and bingo! you've gained not one, but thousands of readers! So you need backlinks. And it won't take you much Googling to find all kinds of helpful people, eager to offer advice on how to get them, or even to arrange them for you (usually for a price...). But before you plunge in, there's something you need to know: The result is that many of the backlinking advice and services currently available are outdated. They're not only ineffective, they can actually do you harm! The practice of creating your own backlinks is now so widespread, most people think it's normal - but Google has always seen it as ""rigging the election"". Google's attitude is understandable really. The best way to explain it is with a simple analogy. Say you're a candidate in an election. On election day, the people vote for the candidate they think is best for the job. The guy with the most votes wins. Now say you're a crooked candidate. You pay lots of people to vote for you, and you vote several times yourself using fake ID's. The guy with the most votes - you - wins. But this time, it's not because the people thought you were the best. It's because you rigged the election. Google sees backlinks as ""votes"", and the sites with the most votes win the ""election"" - i.e. get to the top of the search results. So naturally, they want the election to be free and fair. But webmasters discovered, long ago, that Google couldn't tell the difference between genuine votes and fake votes. So began a huge industry in ways to ""rig the Google election"" - by creating your own votes (backlinks). The first way to create backlinks was in directories. These were just lists of websites, arranged in categories. Their original purpose was to help readers find blogs on subjects that interested them - but as search engines got better, few people used them. They became link farms - long lists of websites, submitted by webmasters to get a backlink. Eventually, Google realized that fact, and either de-indexed the directories (removed them from search results) or devalued the links. Directories went out of fashion as a backlinking source. The ""next big thing"" was social bookmarking sites. The original purpose of these sites was as a place for readers to save and share links to outstanding web pages. The idea was that members wouldn't have to trawl through the search engines - they could find the cream of the internet on their social bookmarking site. Before long, most of these sites were over-run with webmasters, bookmarking their own sites. The result today is that social bookmarking sites are no longer places to find ""the cream of the internet"" - few people join bookmarking sites today just for fun. And Google is well aware social bookmarking sites are primarily a place to self-promote these days, so they have now devalued the links. They're not totally worthless - but they're probably not worth the time it takes to create them. With social bookmarking losing its value, webmasters searched for another place to backlink. Google now placed more value on ""contextual links"" which are links in the middle of text, using a keyword. So for instance, using a link like Belly Dance Australia  had more value than just using the website URL. So came the rise of the blog networks. You would join the network (usually for a monthly fee) and then you could submit guest posts to all or any of the blogs on the network, and include a backlink to your website. That sounds like a fair and reasonable thing to do - like a press release, right? Not quite. For one thing, most of the blogs weren't real blogs - they were created purely to take promotional articles. As for the members, writing hundreds of articles was hard work - so they would either outsource to cheap writers, use software to create them, or steal them from other sites. Blog networks became stuffed with ""splogs"" (spam blogs). They contained nothing of interest to real readers, existing just to serve backlinks to please Google. Alongside the blog networks came the rise of social networks. Google realized people weren't sharing links on bookmarking sites any more - they were sharing on Facebook and Twitter. So Google started giving more value to links on those sites (and launched their own Google+). In no time, people were offering to sell or trade Facebook Likes or +1's. No, not that kind of Penguin! Ben Fredericson Unfortunately, Google has to rely on robots to check web pages, and they can't read. So even though these 'splogs' were full of garbage, the robots couldn't tell, and the backlinks worked for a long time. Until early 2012. Google finally worked out a way to find the blogs on the big blog networks and de-index them. Overnight, webmasters lost hundreds of backlinks as the blogs disappeared, which meant their websites lost their position on the search engine results. It's a manual process, and Google is still working to identify more blog networks and take them down. Any network that advertises for members is a target - if you can find them, Google can find them. Only the few private networks, which recruit only by networking, run real blogs (not splogs) and set high content standards, are likely to survive. You'll see many paid backlinking services still advertising - but to get value from a backlink, it needs to be there for the long haul. Why would you pay money to get backlinks that may last only a few months, until Google catches up with them? But worse was to come: the Penguin update. Google had also worked out a way to identify if a website was creating ""unnatural"" (self-created) backlinks. The Penguin update removed the value of those links (which naturally reduced the ranking of the website they linked to). On top of that, sites which used such links heavily, were given a penalty. So far, it appears that Facebook, Google+ and Twitter links aren't affected. Presumably Google hasn't yet worked out how to tell the difference between real and manufactured links. However, the practice is so blatantly advertised around the internet that Google must be aware of it - so how long will it be before they do find a way to differentiate? Links created by other people are called ""natural"" or ""organic"" links. Google calls links created by yourself, ""manufactured""  links. To identify and penalize those, Google looks for patterns of linking which could be ""unnatural'. The following have been classified as ""unnatural"" by Google: If a real blogger is going to recommend your Hub, or use it as a reference, it's going to be on a page about the same topic. You wouldn't expect someone writing about dog washing to refer to a Hub about feather dusters, for instance. So if Google finds a link on a page that has no relevance to yours, it suspects the link was arranged artificially. Conventional SEO wisdom says that when you write a Hub, you should work out what keywords you're targeting and make sure you use them in headings, sub-headings etc. Then when you write articles, comments, Tweet etc to promote it, you use the same keywords. Google has realized that if real people are recommending your Hub, there's no way every single person would use exactly the same word or phrase to describe it. In fact, they're more likely to say, ""To read more about this aspect of ballet, click here."" So if Google find lots of links to your Hub, all using nicely chosen ""anchor text"" - and especially if it's the same every time - they'll suspect you made them. So far, it appears that Google won't penalize you for having a few unnatural links. There's an interesting analysis in this article by Microsite Masters, showing that you're only likely to be in trouble if more than half your links fall into these categories. The lesson from the history of backlinking is that an excess of anything never works. Inevitably, someone will spy a loophole in Google's new algorithms and that will become ""the next big thing"". History tells us that ""the next big thing"" is the next thing Google will target, so it won't last long. You could try riding the wave while it lasts - but with Google not just devaluing links but actively penalizing websites which have used them, that may backfire. Unfortunately, if you don't create some backlinks yourself, your Hubs risk sinking into oblivion. And there are still some opportunities, they just take more work. Two simple and effective options are Pinterest, forums and other blogs on your topic. When I talk about Pinterest, I don't mean pinning your own photos on Pinterest. If you have a specialist topic and can create a fascinating Pinterest board full of photos from your own Hub plus heaps of photos from elsewhere, then you can create a following - but it's a lot of effort, and if you don't have a specialist subject, the return is definitely not worth the time. What you can do is create Made for Pinterest images for your Hubs - which will make it more likely that other people will pin your images. Again, this strategy is effective only if you have a specialist subject.  Joining lots of different forums and building enough of a reputation simply takes too long to be worth doing for just a few Hubs. When you join a forum, get to know people and participate helpfully before you start sharing your Hubs. You may be able to add a link to your Hub or website in a forum signature, which is ideal - it means that every time you post, you get an automatic backlink. And there may be times when you can refer to a Hub in a forum post, if it's genuinely relevant (just don't overdo it and certainly don't do it until you're a well-known community member). Forum links may sometimes be ""no follow"", which means they won't count with Google - but you're getting your link in front of readers who are interested in your topic, so they're likely to visit your Hub or blog. And if you've written good quality content, they may Facebook Like it, Tweet it or Pin it - all natural links which Google will like. Search for other blogs on your topic and leave comments. Don't try to leave a link IN your comment - it will just get deleted as spam. Instead, look for blogs where you're asked to fill in your name and website when you comment - your name will become a link to your site when the comment appears. Again, these may be no follow, but you're getting into a discussion with people who are interested in your subject. The most valuable backlinks are links in articles you contribute to other people's blogs (called guest posting). Finding guest posting opportunities can be tough, but the backlinks are so valuable, it's worth the effort. Look for good quality blogs on your topic, write to the blog owner and offer to contribute a post. Suggest one or two intriguing titles to whet their appetite, and give some information on your credentials. Explain that all you want in return is a link to your own Hub or blog, either in the text of the guest post or in an author bio section. Google used to value guest blogging links very highly.  They don't now - but what you are doing is exposing your name to a new group of readers interested in your topic, and that's worthwhile. If you notice someone has linked to your Hub or blog from an article on their website, write and thank them. You never know what other opportunities you may discover by networking with related sites. Sometimes you'll hear from a blogger who'd like to ""swap links"". If you accept, your link will be placed on their sidebar or on a Links page.   Google recognizes these links as webmasters promoting each other, and doesn't give them much value. Any blogger who is link swapping may be following other strategies Google doesn't like - so on balance, I would politely decline. There's absolutely nothing wrong with sharing your Hubs or blogs on social bookmarking or social networking sites. It doesn't really matter which one you choose, so long as you join to genuinely use the service, and not just to self-promote (which might look unnatural). For those who are ready to get a bit more sophisticated, I recommend this article. Janisa from Earth on July 09, 2018: Thanks for the tips Reginald Thomas from Connecticut on May 29, 2018: Great information in your article. Thank you. I will use it help my articles. Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on January 16, 2018: Jean, that's exactly why I don't suggest it in this article. Jean Harris on January 16, 2018: A note about sharing your stuff on other social sites. There may be an immediate benefit as the mentions on other sites are very fresh but as those mentions fade and become unreachable their value diminishes. When you share something on social media you would ideally like what you share to be re-shared as much as possible but the lasting benefit comes when the page being shared is also discussed, linked to or otherwise made important on others site off the social network. You can't make this happen if you automate the sharing process to a social media profile that has no real viewers or has zero chance of being relayed off that social network. Great article Marisa! Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on September 14, 2017: I think that could very well be successful, Ken Kenneth Avery from Hamilton, Alabama on September 10, 2017: Hi, Marisa, (Hope that you are tucked in safely from Irma). I had one question: I am thinking seriously about writing a few ""do it yourself"" things in hub form such as ""Easy Ways to Build Birdhouses,"" etc. I need your honest opinion as to would this type of hub help me generate money and help people with this hobby? Thanks in advance, Marisa. Anita Hasch from Port Elizabeth on September 09, 2017: Thank you for the info. Will try to implement it. Tamara Moore on September 07, 2017: Wow, thank you; I just learned a lot! Noa Keshet from Israel on June 09, 2017: Thank you for a very helpful hub! It finally helped me make sense of the concept of Backlinks. Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on February 15, 2017: I think posting your Hubs on facebook would be a very bad idea, frankly.   You can certainly share links to your Hubs on Facebook. Kenneth Avery from Hamilton, Alabama on February 12, 2017: Marisa, I am here refreshing myself on your great tips on getting readers for hubs and I wondered what you think about my decision to start posting my hubs on Facebook as well as HP. Is this a plus or a negative move? Thanks in advance. Kenneth Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on February 12, 2017: I'm definitely not a self-promoter either, which is the main reason I gave up on the idea of making a living online!   I find that articles on the niche sites get fairly good traffic without much promotion so that's the main thing to aim for. Frances Metcalfe from The Limousin, France on February 12, 2017: Another useful hub Marisa! Looking at forums now to join. I must say I find the marketing rather exhausting, I'm not a natural at self promotion. I'd like to earn a little if I can - we'll see.... Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on September 29, 2016: Thanks Ken, I hope it helped. Kenneth Avery from Hamilton, Alabama on September 28, 2016: Very organized; To-the-point; No wasted phrases and no flowery words which were my editor's touchy points. Great information. Well-written. And the lay-out was superb. Nothing to confuse my viewing of the text. These are honest comments. Anita Hasch from Port Elizabeth on July 26, 2016: Thanks for the info Marisa. Will start some backlinks. Robert Morgan from Hutchinson Island, FL - Myrtle Beach, SC - Gilbert AZ on August 14, 2015: Marisa, thank you, great hub and helpful information. I'm just getting started on Hubpages, and this type of advice is helping me to be a better hubber.  This is one  article I'll be back to and refer to periodically. I will definitely read your related articles on this topic! Thanks a million. Bobby Dianemae on July 11, 2015: Great info now I need to figure out how to use it. Colin Garrow from Inverbervie, Scotland on June 14, 2015: It all sounds like a bit of a backlink minefield to me, so I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens. Great Hub, voted up. Jacobb9205 on April 19, 2015: I try to create as many backlinks as possible whether it be on forums or social networking websites I try to get the most. Catherine Giordano from Orlando Florida on February 02, 2015: Complete and easy to understand even if it is a bit disheartening.  I have a blog and I will write a post on that blog on the same topic as my hub and then link to the hub (or vice versa).  Is that a valid backlink? Does google automatically discount if the owner of the domains is the same? There is so much to learn.  Thank you for helping. peachy from Home Sweet Home on January 28, 2015: great tips, i get my readers from tsu, and other social medias that i shared with. In addition, I leave comments in other articles which get back more viewers Elaine Davenport from USA on December 14, 2014: Marisa, thank-you for this helpful information. I'm just getting started on Hubpages, and this type of advice will certainly come in handy. A good article to go back and refer to periodically. I will definitely read your related articles on this topic! peachy from Home Sweet Home on December 07, 2014: great hub. I never expect that backlinks were essential until i started to use them. Yeah, it did bring traffic, just a handful but better than never toknowinfo on October 16, 2014: Thanks for a well done hub and for validating some of the things I am doing. This was well put together and is full of  great info. Anne Harrison from Australia on October 15, 2014: Thank you - I am slowly getting my head around this, but know I will refer back to this and other of your hubs as I try to establish myself. Thank you for the much needed help! Mary Norton from Ontario, Canada on October 15, 2014: Another excellent hub. Backlinks have always been a puzzle to me but you've made it very clear now. What Google wants is what will satisfy its customers, the ones who searches. I want to see articles that are worth reading and not those that just went up because they got a game going. I noticed before that my pages in my site got better ranked when I removed all the links to Squidoo so now I am cleaning up affiliate links as well to limit the number in each page. Is 2 to a page fine? Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on September 25, 2014: I can see why they don't.   As I point out in the article, creating your own links is artificial - Google really wants genuine backlinks. DREAM ON on September 25, 2014: Your hub cleared up some confusion  about back linking.I don't understand why Hubpages and other places don't make it easier. Just a click of  button and it's done. It's almost like they don't want you to succeed.Have a great day. Mona Sabalones Gonzalez from Philippines on September 08, 2014: Very interesting information about backlinks and its history, what not to do and what you can do. Thank you very much! This is the clearest information about backlinks that I have ever read so far. Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on September 01, 2014: Bubblews is not a scam - there have been payment difficulties but not everyone has had trouble.  I wouldn't recommend it as a long term strategy, but what it IS good for as a way to earn money from articles which won't get Google traffic (such as your opinion pieces), because it doesn't rely on Google.  I'll PM you with an explanation of how you could make it work for you. Liz Elias from Oakley, CA on September 01, 2014: Hmmmm..interesting.  Although, most of my miscellaneous blog is more opinion essays, not snippets--like 'how to fix the government,' and are too long for what I understand about Bubblews... about which, by the way, I've heard very mixed reviews, and a charge by one author here on HP that it's an outright scam, accusing that you only get paid the first time, and that they then find a myriad of excuses to deny/delay further payments.  **shrug** Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on September 01, 2014: Sorry MsLizzy, I thought you were using the HubPages widget.  Yes, if it's showing only animals it should be OK.   As for your miscellaneous blog - your ""neglect"" has NOTHING to do with its lack of traffic! A miscellaneous blog will never do well and isn't even worth the effort to write.  If you have small snippets which you feel driven to share, put them on Bubblews - it won't earn much but it will do better than on your blog. Liz Elias from Oakley, CA on September 01, 2014: The utility on Blogspot that allows the sidebar also lets you select the type/category of post, so on my Cat's blog, I've selected for any of my articles about animals to be shown, and not others. That should be okay, right? (And you're right--my miscellaneous blog attracts very little attention, partly because it's been rather neglected in favor of putting my efforts here.  Everyone says ""diversify,"" but I can't spread myself that thin.  I have too much else on my plate with hubby's health issues.) Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on September 01, 2014: MsLizzy, it's not a good idea on your Cats blog because you're showing links to unrelated Hubs, which Google won't like.  On your miscellaneous blog, it won't hurt - but I'm guessing your miscellaneous blog doesn't get many visitors anyway, because they generally do very badly, so it hardly matters.   Your Tweetburner is fine, you're definitely not being spamacious (I like it!) Liz Elias from Oakley, CA on August 31, 2014: Interesting--and a bit convoluted and perplexing of a process, I must say! So, is this to say that on my miscellaneous blog and on my ""cat's"" blog, I should NOT have  a sidebar promoting my latest HP articles  (It's auto-feed, and the blogs are on Google's Blogspot...) I also use the automatic ""Tweetburner"" which auto-posts all my new articles to both FB and Twitter, searching, I believe, at 1-hour intervals...But since I don't write new articles daily, there's unlikely to be a ""spamacious""  amount...  (how do you like my new word??)  LOL Diana Grant from London on August 24, 2014: This is the first time I've read an article about backlinks which I have actually understood - you have written a very clear explanation, thanks. Kamal Mohta from Guangzhou on August 22, 2014: Great article on backlinks. Your hub is still relevant even after 2 years, which is like a lifetime in the internet world. So much has changed as google diminished the value of anchor text, guest posts, blog post, forum comments and other methods for gaining backlinks.  In my opinion, SEO has reduced to producing useful content and making website that is easy for robots to crawl and index. Once again, thanks for compiling, writing and sharing this hub which would serve as a guide for those who seek to learn about promoting their articles. John from New Brunswick, Canada on August 12, 2014: Helpful information. I've bookmarked this temporarily so I can make use of your advice. Jasmeet Kaur from India on August 01, 2014: Voted up!! Really very interesting and helpful as I am still looking for how to get real backlinks... Vivian Sudhir from Madurai, India on June 22, 2014: Great work Marisa, this article really tells a lot about backlinking. I am now clearer about this subject. Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on May 10, 2014: Yes I know!   If you want to make a living by writing online, it's about 10% writing and 90% ""other stuff"", unfortunately. Lisa René LeClair from the ATL on May 10, 2014: I have so much to learn... *Sigh*  I wish it could be as simple as writing & running! Between HubPages, Bubblews, my website and social media, it just seems like there's not enough time in the day ––probably because there isn't! ;-) Kevin W from Texas on April 29, 2014: Marisa this was a very helpful & informative hub. There was a lot I was still unaware of. I was using stumble upon but stopped. Voted up on your hub. Sharon from Perth on April 13, 2014: Thanks for a great helpful hub, They sure have made it harder now without the old backlinks Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on February 20, 2014: Yes, Stumbleupon is basically an artificial link site.  It can generate traffic spikes but those visitors rarely click on ads and don't stay long, which can make your bounce rate look bad. Chris Mills from Traverse City, MI on February 19, 2014: Marisa, thanks for this helpful information.  I'd be interested to know how StumbleUpon fits into this picture.  It's beginning to sound like one of the artificial back link sites.  Great hub.  Thanks for the help. Dan Reed on February 16, 2014: Thank you for sharing this and helping me down the path I'm on. Martin VK from Copenhagen, Denmark on January 09, 2014: Thanks for this great advice. You're explaining some complicated stuff in a simple way. Keep it up! Earl Noah Bernsby on December 09, 2013: This certainly clarifies a lot, Marisa Wright!  It's interesting to read up on  the eternal struggle between webmasters and Google programmers! Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on November 16, 2013: Yes you did, Jess, and I'm sure that Hubber will be most grateful! Jess Brazeau from Canada on November 14, 2013: Holy Moly! This was so informational and helpful! Well done! I honestly had no idea there was sooo much to how Google chooses to place people I their search engine results.. It's kind of mind boggling when you really stop and think about it. It's funny because I actually 'back linked' another hubber just today, without even realizing that's what I was doing. lol. Someone made a comment on one of my hubs, which naturally lead me to check out their profile and found that they had posted a few really great hubs on a subject relevant to a hub I just posted.. I left him a comment and asked if he wouldn't mind if I referenced his profile/hubs.. I thought it would be a great way to give my readers a chance to get more information about a particular topic (first aid)... I guess that means I provided a back link for another Hubber? ... A natural back link? lol... I'm still trying to grasp the Google lingo. Very very helpful hub! Fantastic job! Cheers. Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on November 05, 2013: @Suzanne, I don't write much these days so I don't backlink much either.  However, people who do this for a living tell me that backlinks can still make a huge difference (unfortunately), so if you have an article that's doing well without links, it would be doing even better with them! Most of my backlinks are the type which attract real readers - e.g. I'm active on some forums where I'm known as someone who offers good advice, and those people come and read my Hubs and blog posts and recommend them to others.  Which I think is what you're talking about, basically. Suzanne Day from Melbourne, Victoria, Australia on November 05, 2013: Hi Marisa, great article and I liked the history of the backlinking issues. I liked someone's idea about writing groups of hubs in a niche area, and to some degree, have been following that and it does seem to help. I have given up on backlinking myself due to too much work for too little return, preferring instead just to write more articles and have fun! I do think that choosing a useful topic for readers is the right way to go, and I believe that whatever is trendy for backlinks will be outdated soon enough, so why bother working for nothing? Conversely, some of my ""random"" articles where I just put some stuff out there without any thought to keywords or backlinks in the past has done pretty well for itself. The key was obviously quality and reader engagement. I know if I read an outstanding hub, I'd want to comment and link with it, even if it was the 10th one on Google's search results. But I will never engage with articles that look terrible or are hard to read. Therefore going forward I suggest that it might be wise to rewrite or check anything which doesn't engage readers if you want to improve traffic (over time). It's better to have one convinced and outspoken reader who'll want to make it viral than 10 people who land on the page and leave without looking at it at all. Google will eliminate all these eventually anyway. PS - can't wait for the day when Google will fix the copying of hubs by identifying the original owner with either a date stamp or patent gateway for online scribblings... Gail Sobotkin from South Carolina on October 08, 2013: Congratulations on winning ""Most Helpful Hubber Award."" I believe it's hubs like this one that inspired so many to vote for you. Michelle Orelup from Las Vegas, NV on September 10, 2013: I wish there was a way to 'Favorite' hubs. This would definitely be included! Well done, and thank you for breaking this information into a non-technical format. Voted up! Kerry43 on July 25, 2013: Hi Marisa, just cruising a few more of your hubs. I have been away for several months, and it doesn't take long to miss out on valuable information, or simply forget how things need to be done. I do need to get that domain name too, now that I am back on blogger -in reference to a response you made to my earlier comment on your other hub. Thanks for the prompt. Say g'day to good old Sydney for me, I spent so much time there as a child and have fond memories. Take care, Kerry Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on July 24, 2013: Good to hear from someone who finds interlinking works.   I think it's a great opportunity for Hubbers who have unFeatured Hubs to move them to other rev-sharing sites and interlink them. Bobby from U.K on July 23, 2013: This is a really useful article and I learned some new aspects of backlinking that I hadn't even thought about before. I love linking my articles together across the different platforms that I use and I have found that it's a great way to get my readers to my other articles where they can get related information. Voted up and thanks again :-) Sukhdev Shukla from Dehra Dun, India on July 07, 2013: marisawright, thanks for posting such a valuable information specially for newbies. I agree with you that back linking done in a natural way will be more paying rather than using unfair/outdated means. Voted up. Barbara Badder from USA on July 07, 2013: You've got a lot of good advice here. To be honest, I am ready to forget about Google. It brings a lot of traffic, but you can't totally rely on it. I'm going to start working on other avenues, which may help my Google traffic too. Thanks for all of your advice. Sheila Brown from Southern Oklahoma on July 07, 2013: Great explanation on back links.  Your analogy of ""votes"" in your explanation is the best I have ever heard!  It's nice to know ""the rules of the game"" that we have to play with Google.  I know Google is doing things for the benefit of their readers, but it is confusing to know how to promote our  hubs with things changing all the time.  I really found this very useful.  Voted up, useful, interesting and sharing.  Thank you! Nathan Bernardo from California, United States of America on June 30, 2013: This was good clarification on backlinks, how Google treats them, and why Google de-values some. Also, good information on how to get valuable backlinks. Jennifer Suchey on May 31, 2013: Great article with in depth insight and advice. I wouldn't expect anything less from you. In regard to back links with ""real articles"", I actually like that a writer has to ""write quality content"" to back link and promote their sites. After all, we are ""writers"" right?! ;) Beth37 on April 16, 2013: Good info, thanks Marissa. :) Kenneth Claude from Ohio on April 13, 2013: Thanks for the awesome hub. I learned a lot more about backlinks. I actually was tempted to look into the people advertising to give me ""likes"". I'll do the work myself and natural. Ceres Schwarz on April 13, 2013: Thanks for such an informative hub on backlinking that's easy to understand. You've really explained things well. Backlinking can be such a confusing topic. But you've managed to explain a lot of things about it, including its history and what not to do regarding backlinks. Joseph Muendo from Nairobi, Kenya on April 04, 2013: Thanks for the informative hub. voted up. ceejay1980 on March 11, 2013: Very informative. I think the best way to get traffic is to write 'naturally', without stuffing keywords left, right, and center! I initially fell for the trap of 'automatic back-linking' through software programs, but I now know better! Thanks for this well-researched article. travelingmum on March 08, 2013: Great backlink tips! Thanks! Thelma Alberts from Germany on February 10, 2013: Great hub with a lot of informations. Thanks for sharing them to us. It´s a great help for me. Voted up and more. Felipe717 from Philadelphia, PA on February 05, 2013: Great Hub Marisa! I love how you put examples of backlinks directly in your Hub. Missy Mac from Illinois on January 31, 2013: Wonderful!  I was wondering about back links and social network connections.  Thanks for the great tips!  I have learned much about Google changes.  I started writing as the changes started. Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on January 31, 2013: @Chris, I don't think authority is worth worrying about.  You can waste a lot of time trying to get high-ranking sites to accept your post.    They don't need your help so they're less likely to be responsive. It can be easier to get guest posts accepted by sites that are new and not ranking so well.  While your posts may not get in front of as many real readers, they still count as backlinks - and as those sites rise in the rankings, their value will improve. Anna Sternfeldt from Svenljunga, Sweden on January 31, 2013: Marisa and Everyday Miracles - you are just great!! Thank you so much for sharing all this experienced knowledge. It is so helpful. chrisinhawaii on January 30, 2013: Great article Marisa.  Relevance is the key to creating effective backlinks. But I was expecting you to mention not only the relevance, but also the authority of those link sources as well.  Do you find that if makes much difference -- whether the links you get are from established sites on page 1 of Google search -- as compared to newer sites that don't rank as well? I apologize if you've already addressed that in the comments above.  I didn't read them all yet. Thanks =) Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on January 30, 2013: Hi, EverydayMiracles, long time no see!  Great comment, can't add a thing to it. greencha from UK on January 30, 2013: That's very interesting .thankyou. Becki Rizzuti from Indiana, USA on January 30, 2013: Anna, one thing to think about is the fact that when you're writing, you should be working on building a niche (or niches -- plural) about which you write multiple articles. Obviously there are some people who follow trends, but this is easy enough to do when you're working on creating ""evergreen"" content. As an example, I have multiple articles about the topics The Hunger Games and The Sims 3, plus I write book reviews and write about reviewing books. These are all topics about which it is very easy for me to build an overall niche, writing on Hubpages, Squidoo, Zujava, Wizzley and my own personal blogs (of which there are several). Careful linking from one page to another (on a different platform) guides users through the different pages, where they can buy a product that they're interested in or learn more about the thing I'm writing about. As far as I've discovered, this is the single easiest way to create back links. There are other methods, but they are trickier, considering how easy it is for bloggers to delete inappropriate comments (link-dropping) or for forums to delete users who use the forums as a means to spam their links. In this way, you're totally in control of your own link content, and it works not only for the search engines, but also for guiding readers through your content. Hubpages is good, and I make more money here than I do on any other site, but by itself it's not enough to do everything that I want to accomplish as a writer (author, and book reviewer). Plus I've noticed that some topics do better on one platform than on another. I sell more books through Hubpages than through Squidoo (which is a platform people go to specifically to purchase things!), but find that longer, more interactive pieces do better on Squidoo or Wizzley than on Hubpages and Zujava. If I want feedback and to be conversational with readers, I go to my blog. The important thing is to know your audience, know what does well on what platform(s) and then write, cross linking from one page to another without link-loading. For example, Hubpages allows two links per domain. I tend to only use one of them, then spread things out from there. Link a hub to a lens and both back to my blog, which links out to everything, since the blog is my own personal Internet real-estate. Not sure if that made any sense, but that's how I do it. Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on January 30, 2013: Anna, most people don't spread their articles - but they should, for several reasons. One is for backlinking - you need backlinks, and although links between articles on the same site is good, they're not backlinks.  You will get more Google traffic with articles interlinked on different sites, than from articles interlinked on the same site. Two - It's dangerous to put all your eggs in one basket, unless you own the basket.  I've seen several writing sites fold, or change for the worst. Today.com was sold to people who didn't want the content, only the name, so they closed it down and all members lost their work overnight without notification.  Excerptz was a victim of spammers.  Factoidz defrauded its writers. There have been others. There's no advantage to putting all your work on one revenue-sharing site, because readers visiting sites like HubPages rarely notice who wrote the article.  They're far, far more likely to read articles by other members on the same topic, than to visit your profile and read your other work.   If you want to build your image as a writer, you need a blog - but remember a generalist blog doesn't work. https://discover.hubpages.com/literature/From-HubP... Anna Sternfeldt from Svenljunga, Sweden on January 30, 2013: I have been pondering on the content here for a while and I have a question that may not be completely relevant for the ""link"" subject discussed here, but I ask and see what you say. Marisa, you write that we could refer to articles we have on other writing sites, like Zuvaja, Wissley and Infobarre, but as a newbie on Hubpages I wonder if people usually ""spread"" their articles and why? Well, I can I understand the purpose getting a wider audience, but couldn't it also be a point with having your work in one place, and instead trying to spread your hubs and your profile link to forums and others in the way you describe here? But maybe that depends on how much you write and how many different subjects you cover. Would be glad to hear some short feedback on my wonders on this... You need to ask stupid questions to learn :-) greencha from UK on January 30, 2013: Marisa,, Thankyou,......x Anna Sternfeldt from Svenljunga, Sweden on January 30, 2013: Great stuff! I have learned a lot by reading this hub and I am sure it will be of huge help for a lot of people, including me :-) Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on January 30, 2013: Glad to help Greencha.  Not that genius - remember I've been doing this for over 5 years, and there used to be a heap of real geniuses here on HubPages, who taught me everything I know! By ""mixing up keywords"", I mean thinking of all the different words or phrases people might use to find your article, and using them all rather than repeating the same keyword all the time. greencha from UK on January 29, 2013: Marisa, Your a genious ,(non-patronising here). Gosh sound like Google could do with you on their board!  Very helpful-- but will have to re-read. Could you kindly clarify what you mean when you mix up the key words? Thanks Ms genious. David from Birmingham, UK on January 07, 2013: This is the clearest, most useful article on backlinking I have ever read. Thanks for clarifying this whole thing so well. Also good to know I don't need to worry about social bookmarking sites too. Rebecca E. from Canada on January 07, 2013: marisa-- sorry I didn't get around to reading this earlier- but it has helped me understand a lot more about what works, and what doesn't work these days when it comes to backlinks-- and you are correct getting a reader (a real reader) is hard work! Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on December 31, 2012: Glad my Hubbing Hubs were helpful - it is a big learning curve when you first start online! Agnes on December 31, 2012: I can honestly say this is by far THE BEST article I could find on backlinks! Finally somebody explained it the right way - simple and easy to understand. Thanks a lot!! Sophia Angelique on December 27, 2012: Excellent article. Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on December 27, 2012: Shai, unfortunately you're part right and part wrong.   Some kinds of ""cheating"" are still very effective, which is why you see spammy sites at the top of search engine results!  However, Google does eventually catch up to the latest scam and close down the loophole, and those site owners have to start all over again. So in the long run, it's a whole lot easier to do the right thing! H Lax on December 27, 2012: Marisa, Thank you for clarifying backlinks for me. It seems that all my hubs automatically get one backlink but I have no clue how to figure out who is linking to them. Other than that I don't get any other backlinks and it's probably because I need to do many of the things you suggested. I will definitely look into what you have said and hopefully I can figure it out. Thanks for sharing. Voted +++ Chen on December 26, 2012: That is complex but it makes sense. Seems it just doesn't pay to find a loophole or ""cheat"" because it's just going to keep bringing changes. Good advice, thanks! VU & Useful toknowinfo on December 26, 2012: Thank you for this excellent and clear cut explanation about back links. I learned a lot and appreciate your knowledge on this subject. Gina145 from South Africa on November 17, 2012: Thanks.  This has cleared up some things I'd heard of but never really understood. Annette R. Smith from Ocala, Florida on September 20, 2012: Thank you for this useful hub, Marisa. I'm trying to develop an effective backlinking strategy, and your advice gives me a lot to think about regarding safe and effective backlinks after the Google changes. Carolee Samuda from Jamaica on August 22, 2012: I stop trying to do the back link thing. After Penguin I had to remove all my outgoing links even the amazon capsules and redo them. I just post to FB, Twitter and Google+ nothing more. I don't even trust Redgage and certainly not SocialMonkee anymore. This is very informative, really appreciate the info. ken blair on August 04, 2012: This is hub really very timely as a lot of us have been affected with Google updates. Thanks for explaining things well here. Girish puri from NCR , INDIA on July 23, 2012: useful hub, thanks Kate Swanson (author) from Sydney on July 19, 2012: Sounds like a good book, Rock!  Until very recently, the advice was to pick one or two keywords and use them as anchor text all the time - and you will still see that advice on many sites and in many older books.  Google is now on the lookout for that pattern, so mixing it up is the new way to go."
28,30 Articles in 30 Days Challenge and Results,community," Amelia has been writing online articles for over 10 years and has self-published over a dozen books including fiction and nonfiction. Today Is The First Day of The Rest of My Life istockphoto.com Why are goals important? Are setting goals enough?  I have learned a lot from writing! I also learned a lot from writing articles 30 days in a row as part of my 30 day challenge. I owe it to you, aspiring writers, to tell you what I have learned, and I hope you find my results helpful and interesting. In summary, by completing this 30 day writing challenge, I have learned: This was the first time I embarked on a 30 day writing challenge. I think challenges like these on HubPages and other platforms were more popular in the past, but I decided to try one myself. Overall, it was a good experience and there are some traffic perks as well. If you are thinking on creating a writing challenge, do it! A writing challenge or any type of writing habit disciplines you to write more consistently. In the long run, you will have written more content and potentially published more articles. Consistency is the key. If you make a habit of writing fresh, new and interesting content on a frequent basis, your readers will be more interested in reading your content, thereby increasing your traffic. For the past 30 days, here is a summary of my overall HubPage profile score: Microsoft Excel Line Graph Easylearningweb The hub articles with the highest scores are not necessarily the ones with the most traffic, as shown in these screen prints below. The top 3 hub articles with highest scores are highlighted in yellow below. The top 3 hub articles with highest traffic are highlighted in green below. HubPage Statistics Easylearningweb HubPage Statistics Easylearningweb Top 3 hubs with highest scores (at the completion of my 20 day challenge): Top 3 hubs with highest traffic (at the completion of my 20 day challenge): As compared to the previous 3 months, my earnings have increased 53%. That is good news for some extra revenue each month. Now that I have completed by 30 Articless in 30 Days Challenge, my next challenge will be to go back to my old articles which aren’t featured and optimize them in an effort to increase traffic and earn more revenue. Another challenge that interests me is a 30 day challenge proposed in “The Strangest Secret” video. Earl Nightingale flickr.com Discover the secret to how to be successful: The Strangest Secret by Earl Nightingale. Listen to this very powerful video by Earl Nightingale. It’s referred to as The Strangest Secret. It’s similar to what you might hear in the video The Secret or read in the book The Secret. It’s presented a little differently here. I have listened to it twice already and I plan on listening to it again. Towards the end of the video, there is a 30 day challenge. Is it a coincidence that I stumbled upon this video on day 30 of my 30 Hubs in 30 Days Challenge? It’s almost like the universe was calling me to take on another challenge. The challenge in this video isn't necessarily a writing challenge, it's a goal that you set for yourself and then are committed to. So it can be any goal you want. I highly recommend this video! I rate it 5 out of 5 stars. * * * * * As you go about, pursuing your writing dreams, remember to reach for the stars. Earl Nightingale puts it best when he says: ""Life should be an exciting adventure."" ""See yourself reaching your goal."" ""You are guided by your mind."" ""Every person should be glad to get out of bed in the morning and do a job because you like to do it."" ""To be successful, you must work hard."" ""In order to control your life, control your mind."" ""The architect of the universe did not build a stairway leading to nowhere."" ""Refuse to belief that there are any circumstances that will prevent you from reaching your goal.""  As stated in The Strangest Secret video, according to Dr. David Harold Fink, the 6 steps to being successful are: Success istockphoto.com Along the same lines as the ""Strangest Secret"", another highly recommended book and DVD is ""The Secret"" by Rhona Byrne. The DVD is something I have watched many times. It is uplifting and fascinating to watch. It has brought me much joy and happiness. It it narrated by an excellent cast including Philosopher Bill Proctor, Rev. Dr. Michael Beckwith D.D., author Jack Canfield, and many other super amazing people. Watch the trailer below. There are plenty of times that I have felt discouraged. When the little voice inside my head would say something negative, I stamped it out with something positive. Life is full of ups and downs, but the important thing is that you pick yourself up higher each time. Attention all readers: I have an important update and some good news to share! It has been quite some time since this article has been written. Now, years later, I have written and self-published over a dozen books in multiple genres including an author journey book series to help others authors as well. I'm also creating online courses as well! PLEASE LEAVE ME A COMMENT AND LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE EMBARKED ON A WRITING CHALLENGE. Dream big and reach for the stars!

I would be thrilled to know if have inspired others to write. Since I completed my 30 day challenge, I have been able to accomplish more including self-publishing my first book on Amazon. It's all very exciting! All the best to you! Mary Wickison from Brazil on August 22, 2017: Congratulations on completing your 30-day challenge, that is an accomplishment. It makes you and your readers realize how much more we are capable when we set our minds to action. I feel motivational articles, such as this one help those who are new to the world of online writing and also those of us, who from time to time run out of steam. Once again, congratulations. Amelia Griggs (author) from U.S. on June 03, 2017: Thank you Bradrick, I appreciate your feedback and reviewing my hub about my 30 day challenge. I am happy to inspire you and others with my writing. Good luck to you and your writing as well! Bradrick H. from Texas on June 03, 2017: Congratulations on your accomplishment. I figured I'd stop by to read some of your work since you did the same for me, and I found it very inspirational to read your journey on the 30 hubs in 30 days challenge. I like how you posted statistics of your progress, and the positive messages you added in my opinion would encourage newer members to want to take on this challenge. It's definitely one that isn't for the faint of heart. Congrats again, and all the best to you! Amelia Griggs (author) from U.S. on December 06, 2016: That's great to hear Deborah! Go for the challenge. I am happy to cheer you on...keep on writing! Deborah Nessmith from Florida on November 29, 2016: Thank's for the suggestion. I'm think I'm going to challenge myself to do 30 hubs in 30 day. Amelia Griggs (author) from U.S. on November 28, 2016: Hi Deborah, Welcome to HubPages! I joined about 6 years ago. I love to write and Hubpages is a great community of writers. In recent past, I read about the 30 day challenge but it wasn't being held anymore, so I decided to try it on my own. It was the best thing I ever did. After that, I started writing short stories, joined writers groups online and I'm writing even more now, and taking a self publishing course. I plan to write about my experiences. Look luck to you! Keep writing! Regards, Amelia/Easylearningweb.com Deborah Nessmith from Florida on November 28, 2016: First and foremost, congratulations! I'm new to hubpages and was wandering if this challenge was still going. I would love to join in on the 30 hub challenge, as it would challenge me as a writer. If you have any information on this challenge, please let me know. Your input is greatly appreciated. Amelia Griggs (author) from U.S. on April 29, 2015: Thanks for the congrats, susi10. I really appreciate it, as well as your comments. I did take a break after my challenge, and now I write when time permits, including hubs, short stories, and more. Glad you like Earl Nightingale as well as The Secret. I also love Bob Proctor. You are right, some do not believe. Remember that one quote by Dr. Michael Beckwith, ""Mediocracy always attacks excellence."" It's true. He is also a great speaker and teacher. Glad I have inspired you. I'm very happy to hear that. :-) Susan W from The British Isles, Europe on April 29, 2015: Congrats on completing your challenge, Amelia! 30 hubs in 30 day challenges are awesome because they really increase your earnings, traffic and most of all, improve your writing skills. I've embarked on a challenge like that myself and found it a whole lot easier to write under deadlines after doing it. I love those Earl Nightingale quotes and also I'm a HUGE fan of The Secret. The law of attraction is definitely the most powerful law of the universe. I'm always using the Secret to attract whatever I want into my life, but it seems that others just don't believe in it. Thanks for the motivational and inspiring hub. You just might have inspired me to embark on another Hub Challenge! Amelia Griggs (author) from U.S. on January 13, 2015: Thanks, Writer Fox, I feel like I do anything, thanks for the cheer! Writer Fox from the wadi near the little river on January 13, 2015: Congratulations on achieving your goal!  You've made a great start for 2015. Amelia Griggs (author) from U.S. on January 08, 2015: Hi Availiavision, That saying on your tee-shirt is so true. Preparation is truly the key! That is why the last 10 or so hubs were the most challenging, because for those, I didn't have as many notes and research done as the earlier ones. It has really taught me a lot and helped me be better prepared for the future. Thanks for your  comment, much appreciated. Jennifer Arnett from California on January 08, 2015: That is quite an accomplishment.  I think the key to your success was in the planning.  On the back of my cross country tee-shirt is the quote, ""The will to win means nothing without the will to prepare."" Amelia Griggs (author) from U.S. on January 08, 2015: Thanks Catherine, I really appreciate comment. It did take a lot of determination, motivation and hard work, but it was well worth it. I met new friends on  HubPages, completed my goal, got more practice writing (and practice makes perfect), and feel better than ever about pursuing bigger writing projects! Happy New Year to you! 2015 is going to be a wonderful, prosperous year for all! Catherine Giordano from Orlando Florida on January 08, 2015: Congrats on completely your challenge.  It was a major task that you set for yourself and it took determination and hard work. Amelia Griggs (author) from U.S. on January 07, 2015: Thanks, Bill. That means a lot to me, so I appreciate your comments and wishes. I think once you cross one finish line, you are ready to cross more. I'm ready. :-) Happy 2015 to you, and may this be a prosperous year to all! Bill Holland from Olympia, WA on January 06, 2015: Congratulations on the 30/30, Amelia.  Well done!  Now, best wishes on your new challenge....you sound determined so I don't doubt you'll do well.  May 2015 be your best year of writing to date. Amelia Griggs (author) from U.S. on January 05, 2015: Thank you so much Elsie. Every cheerleader that stopped by and commented was much appreciated, and motivated me to continue. I searched a lot before I started to see if there were other challenges in progress, but there were very few if any. I think the ""challenges"" queue was popular about 2 years ago, but who knows, now maybe there will be more. Thanks again and Happy New Year to you too! Elsie Hagley from New Zealand on January 05, 2015: Congratulations for completing your 30 day challenge. I did one when I was writing for Squidoo, but there were quite a few of us and we supported each other, so you did really well doing it on your own. Happy new year, hope you have a wonderful 2015."
29,Is Hubpages Ad Program killing Adsense Earnings?,community," - Is Hubpages Ad Program killing Adsense Earnings? - Most of you must have heard of the new Hubpages Ad Program by now. The Hubpages Ad Program was created by Hubpages to give us hubbers an opportunity to earn more money, on top of Adsense, Amazon and eBay. It had been tested since January 2011 and is now open for everyone to join. The main difference between Google Adsense and Hubpages Ad Program, is this: Many hubbers who have signed up with the Hubpages Ad Program have reported that their combined Adsense and Hubpages Ads earnings have doubled their earnings on Adsense alone. Some have reported their Hubpages Ad Program earnings have been higher than their Adsense earnings. However, there are some who had reported that Hubpages Ad Program is killing Adsense earnings. You will find some threads in the forums where some hubbers are saying they had turned off the Hubpages Ads in their hubs as their Adsense earnings had been spiraling down, mainly because of the Google Panda, but they believe the Hubpages Ad Program was contributing to the demise of their Adsense earnings. However, a few had reported back saying that even after they had turned off the Hubpages Ads, their Adsense earnings remained in coma, if not dead. Maybe April was just a slow month.. we hope so. Maybe May would be better.. we all wish. Let's put the Hubpages Ad Program to the test As the Hubpages Ad Program is new, and I am fairly new here on Hubpages (six months), I might be a good guinea pig to put the Hubpages Ads Program to the test. My experience might be of no consequence for the established hubbers who have been here in Hubpages for years and have been earning hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars monthly on Adsense. Yes, there are very successful hubbers earning a good living writing here on Hubpages. However, my experience might benefit new hubbers like myself, who are just starting to earn a few dollars on Adsense. Will the Hubpages Ad Program kill your Adsense earnings? I was one of the second wave of hubbers who got picked in late March 2011 to sign up with the Hubpages Ad Program. I had been hearing from the first wave of hubbers and from those who had had the Hubpages Ads since January 2011, reporting faster and better earnings on the Hubpages Ad Program than Adsense. However, they were also reporting that their Adsense earnings were down, but the combined earnings from both Hubpages Ads and Adsense, were still higher compared to their earnings before Hubpages Ads. March Earnings I joined Hubpages in November 2010, and didn't have Adsense account until late that month. When most hubbers were seeing their Adsense earnings soared in November and December, I had zero earnings in November, but was ecstatic to see $3.99 earnings for December. My Adsense earnings had been on an upward trend since then, and I was having a good March Adsense earnings when I signed up for the Hubpages Ad program on March 23, 2011. So, did the Hubpages Ad program kill my Adsense earnings from March 23 to March 31st? The answer is No. My Adsense earnings in March were even higher than my Adsense earnings in February, although not that much higher. (Please click on image to see the original size.) From March 23rd to March 31st, my Adsense earnings were even a little higher than my Hubpages Ads earnings, just a few cents higher but still higher. (Please click on image to see the original size.) Adsense earnings - March 23, 2011 to March 31, 2011 Hubpages Ads earnings - March 23, 2011 to March 31, 2011 It could be argued that I could have earned more on Adsense in March had it not been for the Hubpages Ads. Maybe, maybe not. But I was thrilled to see my Adsense earnings reached $20 in March, even with Hubpages Ads on the last nine days of the month. And with the extra earnings from Hubpages Ads ($6.50), my combined earnings for March was $26.86 ($20.36 + $6.50). This might seem minuscule for some, but for me, it was awesome. Ok, maybe March is not a good example to show any adverse effect of Hubpages Ads on Adsense earnings. So, let's see how April looks. April Earnings April turned out to be a slow month for everyone because the new Google algorithm rolled out internationally in April. Traffic almost died for a few days. April started slow for both my Adsense and Hubpages Ads earnings. No traffic means no impressions and no clicks. But by the middle of April, things started to pick up, and by the end of the month, my combined earnings on Adsense and Hubpages Ads almost doubled my earnings in March ($20.36). (Please click on image to see the original size.) So, did Hubpages Ad program kill my Adsense earnings in April? Again, the answer is No. My Adsense earnings held it's own against the Hubpages Ad program. After having Adsense for almost six months, my Adsense earnings to date is $86.47. It might take me another month or two to reach the $100 Adsense payout threshold. It seems that the average time to reach Adsense payout is 6 to 9 months. There are exceptions to the rule, of course. I have heard of a few people who had reached Adsense threshold payout after a month or two. It could happen. It didn't happen to me, but it could happen to you. But likewise, there are some who had taken longer than a year to get their first Adsense paycheck. On the other hand, I would like to show you my Hubpages Ads earnings from March 23, 2011 to May 8, 2011. In 47 days, I have earned $36.03, which gives me an average earnings of 76 cents a day. This might not be much, but it is consistent. With Adsense, it's drastic ups and downs. Some days are euphoric, but some days might give you a heart attack when you see $0.00 earnings. It happens. Plus Hubpages Ad Program payment threshold is only $50. So you will see your first paycheck on Hubpages Ad Program much faster. The Hubpages Ad program might not be for everyone. But Hubpages is giving us an opportunity to earn more money in addition to that of Adsense, Amazon and eBay. You can sign up with the Hubpages Ad program, and if you don't like it, you have the option of turning it off. But, what's not to like? To learn more about the Hubpages Ad Program and how to sign up, go here. So, is Hubpages Ad program killing Adsense earnings? So far, the answer is No. Rosie Rose (author) from Toronto, Canada on August 15, 2013: Hi Dataload, sorry for the late reply.  Thank you for reading my hub about Hubpages Ad Program.  That hub needs to be updated as Hubpages changed the ads layout and only allowed one Google ad and placed it at the bottom of the hub, and that, my dear, killed Adsense earnings for me and most hubbers. Have a wonderful day, Rosie DATALOAD from Michigan on July 09, 2013: This hub has been really helpful. Thank you for the information. Ttocs L on February 28, 2013: My Adsense revenue goes way up if i disable Hubpages Ads.  I think it just depends on if your audience clicks on the ads a lot or not. Rosie Rose (author) from Toronto, Canada on February 18, 2013: @moizk - I'm glad you found my hub on Adsense and Ad Program informative. But please note, that the latest changes in the Hubpages layout, putting the one-and-only Google ad at the bottom of the hub, really killed Adsense earnings for most of us.   From reaching Adsense payout ($100) every two months, now it takes more than six months (if we're lucky!) to get a paycheck from Adsense. Check out The Hubpages Ad Program here - https://hubpages.com/faq/ Welcome to Hubpages, and I wish you all the best.  Cheers! @newcalendar @fcmosher @rajan jolly @Gracia Baliw-an @coffeegginmyrice @dhannyya @2besure I sincerely apologize for not replying to your kind comments sooner.  Thank all so much for reading my hub and leaving me a comment.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. Have a nice day y'all, Rosie Moiz Khan from Pakistan on February 17, 2013: I'm new to hubpages and this helped me a lot to understand the hubpages ad program and how it affects (or doesnt) google adsense. Thanks a lot! newcalendar on July 13, 2012: Thanks very much for this hub, searched for it after reading several anti hubpages ad articles. I now have no fear of using them. Well done! Fred's Bughouse from near the Equator on June 25, 2012: Really great hub -- full of great stuff. I'm pretty new to HubPages too and this stuff really helps me. Rajan Singh Jolly from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on May 23, 2012: Great analysis again, Rosie. Thanks for sharing such useful info. Gracia Baliw-an from Tabangaoen,La Trinidad Benguet, Philippines on May 16, 2012: This is useful to me. I love writing to make people happy but I also want to write because I need money.I haven't apply for the adsense yet. I don't know how. Marites Mabugat-Simbajon from Toronto, Ontario on April 26, 2012: It's is great to see your profit chart. This is encouraging me more to keep going to hit marks and numbers like yours one day. Slowly but surely. Thank you Rosie! dhannyya on April 12, 2012: loved this hub...also benefitted from the valuable comments Pamela Lipscomb from Charlotte, North Carolina on March 28, 2012: I use one or the other.  When I am being hit hard with some kind of Google change, I will use Hub ads. I don't use them together. Rosie Rose (author) from Toronto, Canada on March 28, 2012: Hiya AuniceReed, thanks for dropping by.  I'm glad you found my hub informative and you're seeing consistent earnings from HPAds.  It's more difficult to earn from Adsense, but don't worry, it will come.  Cheers! Have a nice day, Rosie Aunice Yvonne Reed from Southern California on February 15, 2012: Very informative hub Rosie2010, I started with Hubpages 2 years ago, but didn't write many hubs until a couple of months ago. I am seeing consistent earnings with the Hubpages ad program, but not so much Adsense yet. Social networking and article marketing helps a lot. Rosie Rose (author) from Toronto, Canada on February 12, 2012: Hiya snigdha.s, thanks for dropping by.  I'm so glad you found my hub informative.  Oh no, sorry to hear that you didn't know about the Hubpages ad program until recently, and had lost some earnings because of that.  I'm glad my Adsense and Hubpages Ad program analysis had helped you in any way.  Cheers! Have a nice day, Rosie Snigdha Shahi from India,mumbai on February 04, 2012: Very informative Hub,I switched to Hub ad program yesterday. Had been away for a while from Hubpages and realised my mistake after reading this Hub. Lost a decent amount of my earning by neglecting Hubpages ad program.Good analysis Rosie Rose (author) from Toronto, Canada on January 27, 2012: Hiya eddiecarrara, thanks for dropping by.  Congratulations for your earnings on Hubpages and Amazon.  I received my first cheque from Amazon last week.  I'm so thrilled.. I haven't deposited it yet. lol  I'm glad you enjoyed reading my hub and found it useful.  Thanks for the votes.  Cheers! Have a nice day, Rosie Eddie Carrara from New Hampshire on January 18, 2012: Your right Rosie, Adsense is up and down whereas the Hubpages Ad Program is very consistent. I have received payments from Hubpages and Amazon, but haven't reaches the threshold with Adsense yet. Good hub, voted up and useful :) Rosie Rose (author) from Toronto, Canada on January 11, 2012: Thank you all for your comments. I'm glad you found my early analysis of the effect of HP Ads Program on Adsense earnings, informative. Updates: 1) I had reached HP Ads payout threshold in May 2011, then every two months after until October 2011, when my HP Ads earnings had surpassed the payout threshold monthly from then on. 2) Even with HP Ads Program layout change, I continue to reach Adsense payout every two months. A Happy, Healthy and Prosperous New Year to All, Rosie cr00059n on January 11, 2012: What a wonderful article. Nice analysis and coverage on earnings reports. I definitely think Adsense is secondary in earnings to HubPage's Ad. Earnings program. SilkThimble from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on December 14, 2011: Thanks for the detailed information and analysis. Good to see a before/after comparison. lejonkung on November 30, 2011: This was an excellent article. I learned a few things from it, voted up and useful and interesting. Charlotte Gerber from upstate New York on November 27, 2011: At first I was earning about the same with AdSense and HubPages - now I'm earning much more with HubPages, and Adsense has dipped slightly. If you want to increase your HubPages revenue since it is pageview related, do some social networking and promote your hubs - you'll see a difference in your earnings in short order. It is also important to fill out a hub ""summary"" - write 2-3 descriptive sentences about your hubs, and it will help to drive traffic for you. Search engines often use this summary. Pamela Lipscomb from Charlotte, North Carolina on November 26, 2011: Well, now it seem that is you are not participating in the Hubpages ad program, you will be losing money to Hubpages. Nolen Hart from Southwest on November 04, 2011: I've disabled the Hubpages ad program and my revenue is way up. mynameisnotpaul from Kentuckeh' on October 28, 2011: I've found that I am earning a TON more with the HubPages ad program than AdSense. Although I wasn't earning much with AdSense in the beginning, it was still moving slightly every so often. Now that I am using the HubPages ad program, AdSense has completely dried up. I'm not complaining though- I'd rather go with the HubPages ad program than anything because of how much more quickly I earn with it. Jennifer McLeod from Detroit, Michigan on October 19, 2011: This was an excellent article.  I learned a few things from it, voted up and useful and interesting. Aceblogs from India on October 18, 2011: This hub has helped me a lot , i am a newbie in here and not started earning yet , but i am glad to read this hub . Thanks Robert P from Canada on October 08, 2011: Interestingly I have hardly ever made any money from the adsense ads on hubpages. On my own sites, I earn good adsense revenues. When I signed on for the hubpage programs my hubs started earning money right away. I don't think that the hubpages program killed adsense, at least in my case, as much as adsense was not a good money maker based on my content and or the site's layout. Had I not switched to hubpages program I would have continued to earn almost nothing here. I am  very happy with hubpages's program. James A Watkins from Chicago on October 08, 2011: Thank you for this interesting Hub. My earnings from the two programs run neck and neck. Combined, they equal about what I used to make from Adsense alone before the Panda slapdown. So, it helps. Bryce from Northern California Coast on October 01, 2011: Thanks for being so specific and helpful. Eric Hartman from Greensburg, Pennsylvania on October 01, 2011: Hello. I just joined the Hubpages Ad program last night and have already seen a few pennies comming in. While my Adsense has been doing 'ok', it is always nice to see a little more coming in. I don't write for the money, but it definitely does not hurt to have money every once in a while for a night out or something. This is a great Hub and I have voted it up and useful! MarloByDesign from United States on September 24, 2011: Great Hub, and thank you for your clear examples. As a person who writes on saving money and financial topics, I appreciate your level of detail! Rated USEFUL. shafmasta on September 09, 2011: To be honest, the adsense earnings depends on clicks and I must say that its harder to get those clicks than getting pageviews. Why hate Hubpages and Adsense together. I think thats an extra way of rewarding yourself! If you don't get a click, at least your getting page view earnings. This is exactly the same for me. This month so far in September, I haven't had any clicks as of yet. However, last month I received my 1st ad click on hubpages which gave me a whopping £1-seventy-seven. Sorry my seven doesn't work on my laptop lol! :D In dollars this would probably have been $3-$4 just for that 1 click. However, since writing my FIRST hub here on Hubpages, I had the ad program active and have earned $2-seventy-seven as of this writing. If the ad program was not used, I wouldn;t have had this income would I. Just imagine if I would have been $20 like your earnings Rosie. Thats quite a loss isnt it and many here are losing out as well :(. Great article by the way. Very informative and I LOVEEEE article earning stats on hubs! Was good to take the time to read. By the way again, how on earth do you manage earning $0.50 and over $1 in a day. How much traffic do you recieve...:D I was hoping to reach those figures soon. I am only acheiving a few cents a day with just 43 hubs. You have only 115!! :O Sunnyglitter from Cyberspace on August 30, 2011: Thanks for sharing your earnings.  I've been wondering how others were doing. Kidgas from Indianapolis on August 13, 2011: I saw my AdSense collapse, but it happened all at the same time in March.  I have only recently started to see a return of traffic.  I made the $50 Ad Program level and turned off the Program to see if my CTR on AdSense will improve again.  If not, I will start the Ad Program again.  So far, AdSense is not returning but I will give it a few more weeks. Teresa Schultz from East London, in South Africa on July 27, 2011: I love stats and you have a whole bunch here. I think it's still a bit early for me to decide if the HubPages Ad Program is killing my HubPages Adsense earnings.  I will just wait and see, I guess :) timonweller on July 09, 2011: I have not done the comparison as yet for myself, but was going to do shortly, i guess giving it a few weeks then compare, however like your hub says it may drop earnings heaps.. suvitharoja from India on July 07, 2011: Nice Hub. I recently got into Hub pages program. Few days only and trying it now. Emma from UK on July 02, 2011: This is the only article I have read up to yet on the Hub ads revenue. I just added it and hoped for the best really. I am not yet earning much anywhere with anything to do with my hubpages account. I have $1 thanks to hubpages revenue. But I was told you need $100 to be paid. It should help with my pension funds in 3 decades then. SoMany Blessings from USA on June 27, 2011: Question is how many hubs have you published to earn the current earnings from Hubpages and Adsense. I am just starting to publish on hubpages and I want to know what a good target goal is. How many hubs will earn you approximately how much? belief713 from Earth on June 20, 2011: I'm not 100% sure it's from the Ad Program, but I'd have to guess that's a large chunk of why my earnings have dropped with both Amazon and AdSense... unless it doesn't apply until you join. Every once in a while I analyze my earnings and since I've noticed both payments getting smaller for the past few months I started looking into what may be the cause. Silly me, I got the invite for the Hub Ad Program back in March, but never acted on it! I just thought my earnings had dropped because of the Google slap or Panda...today while analyzing I was going through some old emails and then logged in here (I honestly haven't been on HubPages for the past few months but every once in a while) and saw info about the Ad Program. Needless to say, I signed up a few hours ago, now I'll be tracking my results as well. Moon Daisy from London on June 08, 2011: Hi Rosie, Thanks for sharing your experience of the Hubpages ad program with us.  I only signed up to it less than a week ago, and initial signs are looking good, although it's really too early to tell. Since I joined though, I have had zero Adsense earnings.  I normally get something even if it's just pence, so I was quite surprised by this, but I will watch and wait and see what happens.  I'm hoping that overall it will be a good thing for us all! scoop on June 07, 2011: I love the Hubpages AD program. I was doing alright before they introduced the program, but now I am doing much better thanks to the Hubpages AD program. My Adsense earnings seem to be doing the same as they always have been doing, which isn't too bad :-) Aurelio Locsin from Orange County, CA on June 05, 2011: Excellent article.  I have only about ten hubs so far and really never earned anything on Adsense. I am, however, making a few cents a day from Hubpages. Charlotte Gerber from upstate New York on June 04, 2011: My experience so far with the Hub Pages Ad Program is that it has doubled my income per month. I write on a variety of topics, so perhaps that is why my earnings haven't suffered the way other Hubbers have, especially in regards to Adsense earnings. My Google Adsense earnings are just about equal to my Hub Pages Ad Program earnings.  Currently I have 100 hubs, and I've been writing on HubPages for a little over 2 years. Great Hub with lots of info for the newbie! jumalina12345 from Malaysia on May 27, 2011: Great review and analysis that both programme. thanks. good job. dablufox from Australia on May 26, 2011: I really don't think the new ad program is going to make that much difference. The Panda update along with Hubpages misguided and doomed to fail affiliate link blanket topic ban is slowly demonstrating the downward spiral of the sharecropping model. The affiliate link topic blanket ban will is just the beginning. Hubpages has reserved the option to introduce new banned topics for affiliate links. Thereby choking off any revenue stream which Hubpages can't claim there cut on. This new ignorant rule was designed to try and make up for lost revenue due to panda although it has nothing to do with discouraging hubbers publishing low quality hubs. Spam hubbers will just move to other topics, then predictably Hubpages will in turn ban affiliate links for those topics. Hubpages will quickly only be useful as a second rate backlink resource at best! As other top hubbers like Sunforged and Ryankett I am looking to other platforms like blogger and wordpress to protect myself from the next round of Hubpage Nazi-ism. Diversification as well as quality is the key, its too easy to become complacent and too comfortable on a single publishing platform. Rosie Rose (author) from Toronto, Canada on May 21, 2011: Hiya Sinea, yes we are, isn't that great?  Cheers! Have a nice day, Rosie Sinea on May 12, 2011: That is such good news!  What a plan that we are helping each other as we appreciate hubs! Rosie Rose (author) from Toronto, Canada on May 11, 2011: Hiya Sinea, thanks for dropping by.  Yes, you are correct. Views from our fellow hubbers count as impressions, but our own views are not counted tho'.  Yes, I believe it is definitely a good blend.  Cheers! Have a nice day, Rosie Rosie Rose (author) from Toronto, Canada on May 11, 2011: Hiya Angelique, thanks for dropping by.  Thanks so much.. my pleasure.  Yes, it looks like the Hubpages Ad Program is beneficial.  Cheers! Have a nice day, Rosie Rosie Rose (author) from Toronto, Canada on May 11, 2011: Hiya fetty, thanks for dropping by.  I'm glad you found my Adsense/Hubpages Ad Program hub informative and useful.  My computer knowledge is bare minimum, but I just keep on going.  So just keep on writing.  Cheers! Have a nice day, Rosie Sinea Pies from Northeastern United States on May 11, 2011: Thanks for the encouragement, Rosie. If Hubpages pays per impression, do you know if that includes views from other hubbers?  Adsense is per click, Hubpages is per view, correct?  Seems like a good blend. Angelique Newman from Canada on May 11, 2011: This is a great hub--Hubpages Ad Program definitely looks beneficial.  Thanks for sharing :) fetty from South Jersey on May 10, 2011: Thank you for a very well written hub with substantial information for any 'green' writer. I have been here a year but have not written enough hubs and I am lacking computer knowledge sometimes. I found this article to be very helpful. Thanks! Rosie Rose (author) from Toronto, Canada on May 10, 2011: Hiya tnvrstar, thanks for dropping by.  I'm glad you found my Adsense and Hubpages ads hub helpful.  I'm glad you are earning from the Hubpages Ad program.  You should write more hubs and maybe Adsense would kick in.  Thanks for the vote up.  Cheers! Have a nice day, Rosie tnvrstar from doha, qatar on May 10, 2011: Hey thanx for your beautiful hub. You have provided enough information which i was looking for. I stopped writing on hubpages because i was not earning from adsense so i started writing in triond which also pays for per page impression beside adsnese. But when Hubpages introduced this new program i am loving Hubpages again. I am earning 15 to 20 cents on an average which is not bad for a amateur writers like me. In my opinion Hubpages ad program should be there always. Voted up :) Cheers Rosie Rose (author) from Toronto, Canada on May 09, 2011: Hiya Barbara, thanks for dropping by.  You're welcome.. my pleasure. Cheers! Have a nice day, Rosie Barbara Badder from USA on May 09, 2011: Thanks for sharing all the info. Rosie Rose (author) from Toronto, Canada on May 09, 2011: Hiya Jeannie, thanks for dropping by.  I'm glad you found this hub useful.  I also find the Hubpages Ad Program good in that way.. it is consistent.  We get paid by views not by clicks.  Sorry to hear you also got affected by the Google Panda.  As I am new, it didn't affect me that much, although a couple of my hubs that were on page 1 before disappeared and never to be found. (sigh) Have a nice day, Rosie Jeannie Marie from Baltimore, MD on May 09, 2011: This is a really useful hub.  I switched to the new Ad Program last week, and I am really happy with the results.  I just was not doing well at all with Adsense on this site, although I was doing well with it on other sites.  However, with the new Hubpages Ad Program, I make a profit everyday.  I like how it is more consistent.  I am also a little angry at Google for the Panda update, so if I lose some revenue with Google, but gain it using the Hubpages program, I am fine with that."
30,My HubPages 7 Deadly Sins,community," Lana is a published writer and editor who helps aspiring authors take their writing to the next level. This is not your typical HubPages tutorial. In fact, this is an anti-tutorial. It will not be sweet, inspirational or reassuring. It will not make you want to ride a magical rainbow. But it will be honest. In this article I will describe my HubPages ""deadly sins"" for which I'm banished to writers' hell where the traffic is abysmal, the earnings are non-existent, and the links are always broken. This article is my version of the seven deadly sins. Taolenn de François-Marie Balanant. Public domain. 1. Not writing more. Six years ago, when I first started on HubPages, I've had wildly unrealistic expectations about creating passive income with this site, so fairly soon I became discouraged and only posted new articles sporadically. In all of year 2010, I only published three hubs. In 2011 I published one! In 2012 – three again. I now have about 80 articles but the writers who are successful here have hundreds, even thousands of hubs. This isn't so much about the quantity as it is about the consistency. Theoretically, posting 1-2 hubs weekly keeps you in good graces with flaky Google, and your readers - engaged. 2. Not interacting more. As an introvert, I'm generally antisocial, and as a writer, I'm pretty self-centered. In fact, that was one of the things that initially attracted me to HP - that the site isn't interaction-based like some other writing platforms where your income is directly correlated with how much interaction you can take. HubPages is different, I thought. Technically, all you have to do is write, and if you're good, the traffic will come, and eventually, the money will follow. This is how naïve I was 6 years ago. It's still true that on HubPages interaction with other members is optional and, strictly speaking, not linked to your earnings, but it's a lot more important than I assumed in the beginning. In fact, it's pretty damn essential. Not so much in terms of traffic, but in terms of feeling connected and appreciated for the hard work that you put into your articles. Without it you're just a soon-to-be burnout who writes in a vacuum. 3. Not writing better articles. In all honesty, most of my early work is either generic, pretentious, or only relevant to a small number of people. When I started writing online, my goal was to make my articles look and sound like other people's articles, as if I could imitate my way into writing. Bad idea. Devoid of original thought, these ""masterpieces"" were destined to fall flat on their comically serious faces. I've eventually deleted all of them out of sheer embarrassment. Learning to write quality blog posts early on could have made all the difference. There are rules to writing for an online audience, and they are fairly simple and logical. 4. Not finding a niche. As my friend Mel Carriere noted reflecting on his experience writing on HubPages and blogging, finding your writing niche can make all the difference. Part of it has to do with search engines favoring specific keywords, but it's also the fact that there's so much content out there...Almost any topic I come up with yields about 200,000 search results, and even if I do write a unique article with my own take on it, it won't be anywhere near the first couple of pages of Google search. The closest I got to my ""niche"" was writing spiritual personal experience pieces, like ""Inside the Inipi: Sweat Lodge of the Lakota People."" Then there are unexpected successes, like ""How to Write an Engaging First Sentence"" that inspired an immediate surge of traffic and praise (including Editor's Choice and Hub Of The Day) that soon died down never to be resurrected. And then there's my ""golden child"" - ""14 Signs You Have a Toxic Mother-in-Law"". For some reason, that one struck a cord with so many women! No other article made that kind of impact. I’ve tried to understand why…what was different about it? How did I write it? Well…it all came from experience. I did almost zero research on it. It was something I went through myself and was still going through. It’s concise and biting. It makes an effort to connect with the reader. It covers a universal theme – bad mothers-in-law. So maybe that's a secret to writing a good (popular) article - make it personal to you, write about what disturbs you, hurts you, inspires you. I still write about whatever I find interesting or personal at the moment, completely irreverent to the SEO gods. For the sins committed against the SEO gods, I banish you...to obscurity! Public Domain 5. Not promoting my articles more. Like many writers, I suck at marketing and promoting my own work. That's because I still live in the past when writing was all that was required of writers. Now it seems like if you're not promoting your articles (books, blogs, reviews, what have you) you might as well be writing and throwing it directly into a cosmic wastebasket. Sad as it is, in some ways writing skills are becoming secondary to marketing skills. So get yourself an Article Wizard that will take care of that tedious writing business, and get straight to the marketing phase! Sooner or later, if you're aggressive enough or annoying enough, you'll get the exposure you need. If only I followed my own advice! The most I did was post a link on Facebook, watch it get a few likes, and move on to the next thing. 6. Not setting specific goals. It's important to set goals for yourself, not just in writing but in life. I've never done that. I've had hopes and dreams, but never goals. I can come up with ideas - easily - but meticulously executing them, having a structure, a schedule, a routine - that's the hard part. Now I understand that you need goals to keep you motivated when you're ready to throw in a towel, to keep yourself disciplined, and to track your progress. Because another big problem with not having goals is: you can't tell if you're moving up, or moving at all. 7. Not branching out beyond HubPages. This is perhaps my biggest and most regrettable deadly sin. As frustrating and unrewarding as it was, HubPages still managed to become my writing ""comfort zone"". No pitching ideas and getting rejected, no responsibility of having your own website, no waiting, no drama, minimal maintenance, and usually only positive reinforcement from the HP community. Also - no money, no readership, no growth (other than the natural writing skill development that comes from keeping at it), and no pride after publishing something new. It was easy. I just pushed a button. I guess the deeper reason behind this ""failure to launch"" was the fear of failure. What I've realized is that I've had a lot of mental blocks or limiting beliefs about blogging that were holding me back from starting my own blog. Take it from me - success begins in your mind. If you feel stuck, start addressing what you truly believe deep inside: your fears, assumptions, and mental blocks. 2021 Update: In 2017 I finally took a leap of faith and started my own website. Yes, there was a learning curve, but it is the most rewarding experience of my life. I only wish I've done it sooner! I still giggle when I think about my career dreams 6 years ago - lounging on the beaches of Southern Europe while writing and earning passive income from HP. the author I'm stubborn. Once I start something, I need to see it to some kind of conclusion, so I'm still here. Don't get me wrong - my time on HP wasn't entirely bleak and unproductive. I've met some talented people who inspire me and remind me to keep going. I enjoy the freedom to write about anything I want. And I did learn a lot as far as writing online goes. I've also managed to land a few writing projects outside my HubPages ""efforts,"" in some small part due to the fact that I continued writing through my frustration and disillusionment. Even though I published sporadically and impractically, I never really got out of habit of writing. In part, I have to thank HP for that. But for god's sake, pay your writers more! I don't care what Google comes up with next to weed out weak content - Panda, Giraffe or some other innocent animal stick figure, but there's got to be a better reward system in place. As of now, there's barely any incentives for me to keep writing and publishing on HubPages. And I wonder sometimes: What could have been if I wasn't pouring all my writing juices into HubPages? If once in a while I took a leap and tried a different route? If I wasn't scared of being rejected or criticized or worse...ignored? What if...I worked harder, risked more, expected less? Someone once said: ""Life begins at the end of your comfort zone."" It's time for me to spread my wings and stop being so damn comfortable. I'm a published author, for god's sake. What's next - books, magazines, journals, blogosphere, travel writing? I don't know yet. But it's time to leave my writing ""nest."" I'll still be around - and I'll still publish hubs once in a while. I just won't be comfortable. © 2015 Lana Adler Lana Adler (author) from California on December 16, 2017: Thank you Verlie. Although HubPages turned out to be more lucrative :o Verlie Burroughs from Canada on December 15, 2017: Lana, nice that you co-authored a book in your down time. Congratulations, looks interesting. Lana Adler (author) from California on November 15, 2017: Thanks Stephen! I wanted to be maximum honest. And to that end, once I started taking my own advice (goal setting, for example), my results improved dramatically. Not enough to make a living, but considerably more than it used to be (which was nothing :0) Good luck! Stephen Barnes from St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador on November 12, 2017: Great read Lana, and a real eye opener, thanks. Lana Adler (author) from California on January 20, 2016: Lol this is comforting to me :) Jennifer Mugrage from Columbus, Ohio on January 20, 2016: Ah ... we have a lot in common. Lana Adler (author) from California on January 08, 2016: Thank you Aesta! Since writing this article, I've had some progress, too. Traffic seems to be better (as are earnings, although still abysmal) but I'm still not even close to where I want to be vis-a-vis HubPages. But numbers-wise, everything almost doubled, so that's an improvement. My goal now is 100 hubs, which should take me about 10 months if I write 3 hubs a month. We'll see how I stick to that plan. Thanks for stopping by, and I'm glad you're starting to see your efforts finally paying off! Mary Norton from Ontario, Canada on January 08, 2016: Well said and well written. I can relate to everything you said here. I am not consistent at all and I never promoted before. I am starting now and getting encourage with the results. Lana Adler (author) from California on November 27, 2015: livingelysian, I'm so glad you found this information useful. When I was writing it, it's almost as if I was addressing myself 6 years ago. As you can see, sure, I could have done some things differently. As for the niche, it definitely helps to have one. Then people associate you with a particular topic, and the more you write about it, the more you are seen as an expert. I know some successful writers here who only write about one thing: travel, recipes, wicca or DIY stuff...But one of the things I like about HP is that you can write about whatever you want. And I enjoy that freedom. As a result, I'm very ""all over the place,"" but I think it helps me as a writer. Thanks for stopping by, and good luck to you! Lana Adler (author) from California on November 27, 2015: Jean, I agree, the community on HP is very supportive in general. I do run into an occasional troll, but only when I dare to write about politics or religion. Figures! Lana Adler (author) from California on November 27, 2015: cheaptrick, such kind words...English is indeed my second language, and I moved here at a rather mature age of 20. It's very flattering for me to hear that ESL-ness is not obvious from my writing, but I must confess I'm always learning and never quite comfortable enough to feel like my English is as good as my Russian. Although my Russian deteriorated quite a bit in the last 15 years... Thank you so much for your comment, I'm glad that this hub was of interest to you. Elysia Valdivia from Loveland, Colorado on November 25, 2015: Thank you for passing this invaluable information on to us new hubbers! I am still trying to find my niche! Jean Bakula from New Jersey on November 24, 2015: This site is somewhat addicting. I've tried others, but the people here really are nicer. I hope the money gets better too. Lately, I find changing titles helps a bit. cheaptrick from the bridge of sighs on November 24, 2015: Nicely written piece of work.Never would have guessed English was your second language.Many Americans have not developed the flow of written English as well as you have.You're an inspiration to struggling writers in more ways than you might think.Best wishes Lana Adler (author) from California on November 24, 2015: Jean, my first hubs were pretty bad, too. I eventually deleted most of them. And unlike you, I haven't branched out much beyond HP. All my 70 eggs are here so lets hope this basket stays put, not that I'm making any money here LOL. I just got used to it, maybe even addicted. But I'm trying to branch out, and it's exciting. Thanks for dropping by! Jean Bakula from New Jersey on November 24, 2015: I couldn't pass up this title! My niche of Astrology is completely saturated, but I take a lot of metaphysical courses, and do readings out of a business, so it keeps me in material. My worst mistake was just posting my first hub without reading the rules. I was barely computer literate, and just happy to see something I wrote up there. Oh, and I used to write all my hubs in one text capsule. That took ages to fix. I don't think it hurts if you don't socialize much, but it brings newer readers to your articles, and in turn, they pass them on to others, so don't forget to get on the forum now and them. (Pass on religion or politics). You want new hubbers to notice you. At one time we were told ""not to put our eggs in one basket""so I wrote the obligatory amount of articles everywhere. But I never had enough in any one place except HP to make money. So now I am moving everything here, and deciding what to do with my blog. I had a metaphysical blog, and it was somewhat popular, but I never made money. I made a new one but I don't like it, and am figuring out where to go with that. It's never too late to find  a niche. I have been contacted by people about writing for some of their sites, but usually it was an article a week and at the times I was always busy. Now I'm sorry I didn't take them up on it, next time I will. It's bad to have too many hubs, because of the frequency they make changes here. I have carpal tunnel syndrome to prove it. Now as I move articles here, I am deleting one for each new one I post. Eventually I have to delete more, but I get sentimental about them. Take care. Lana Adler (author) from California on October 13, 2015: Oh yeah...I still resent the idea of a niche, even though I've been able to narrow it down to 3-4 topics I write about somewhat consistently. I also haven't gotten around to building my own website/blog. That would mean choosing a niche so...I'm also glad to have discovered you. Can't believe it took me so long! John Hansen from Gondwana Land on October 12, 2015: This is a very honest appraisal of Hub Pages Svetlana, and I thank you for that. I can relate to everything you say. My major problem is I can't..and don't want to.. corner myself into a niche. I do love it here despite the very meagre payout system. I have set myself a goal of making a certain amount each month (sometimes I hit the mark, sometimes not). Maybe it pays for my coffee consumption. I too am hopeless at marketing my work. When I do share my hubs and my eBook on Facebook etc I always feel guilty. You do have some interesting hubs and now I just have to go read more of them. Glad you decided to stick around. Lana Adler (author) from California on August 28, 2015: Thank you Niecey! I think you've got the right attitude. If you keep your expectations in check and just look at it as a writing practice, you'll be just fine. And who knows, you might even make some money here. It's not impossible! Niecey Docherty from Firth, Nebraska on August 28, 2015: This is very helpful, thank you. I'm just getting started and there are plenty hubs about how to hub, but this one was actually helpful. I'm definitely looking at this as more of a portfolio building experience, practice writing and then hopefully can step out to other things. I like your suggestion of setting goals too. Lana Adler (author) from California on August 24, 2015: Thank you Bill. I love your travel articles, I think it's a great niche to have. Although I have a few topics that I write on consistently, I think it would be very hard for me to narrow it down to one. And I am still hopeful too, against all reason :) And I'm working on publishing my pieces elsewhere. Though it's always so tempting to just press that ""Publish"" button! Instant gratification. Bill De Giulio from Massachusetts on August 24, 2015: Very interesting Svetlana.  I discovered HP about three and a half years ago and also had grand visions.  Google managed to take care of that.  But like you and so many others I am still here.  You mentioned finding a niche and while initially I would write about a variety of topics now I concentrate on travel.  I will never be able to quit my day job but I do hope that some day the passive income from HP amounts to something.  I also need to venture out beyond my comfort zone.  Time to make a plan! Lana Adler (author) from California on August 12, 2015: Thank you Molly! Speaking of random...one of my most-read hubs is a collection of quotes, which hurts my writer's ego a bit lol, but in general I have NO CLUE which hubs will get popular, and which ones will be living out their days in obscurity...Thanks for stopping by! Molly Layton from Alberta on August 08, 2015: This was a cool read. I have found that some of my articles are getting traffic from the web at random, but consistency is the best way to keep up your numbers. Lana Adler (author) from California on August 03, 2015: Thank you. I do like HP as a writing platform. I just think there are limitations to it, like to any content mill, and sometimes it pays (literally and figuratively) to take your writing somewhere else. Thanks for stopping by Nadine! Nadine May from Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa on July 31, 2015: That was a nice read. When someone suggested Hub pages to me almost two years ago as a marketing tool for my novels I went for it. At first I never realized that it could earn me money! I discovered that weeks later and it took me 4 months to get Google to agree linking me to its earning program. Yesterday for the first time I received an email that Hubpages would pay me by the end of this month! That is real bonus for me because I still feel that it is the best writing platform out there. Lana Adler (author) from California on July 30, 2015: Thank you JM. I suppose it applies to any kind of writing online.  The marketing for me is the hardest part for some reason. Thanks for stopping by! Jon Mark on July 29, 2015: Good read because each of these observations is exactly what I've experienced over the time I've been writing online. It took me about three years to realize what I needed to do to market myself. Now I'm a little more than pumped to see what I can do with this platform. Lana Adler (author) from California on July 15, 2015: Thank you Bill! That's sweet :) I will not only quote you on that, I will live by it, chipping away at the walls of my comfort and security day by day. Woo-hoo!! Bill Holland from Olympia, WA on July 15, 2015: And I do love your last paragraph.  Comfort is for sissies, and you can quote me on that. I love the fact that you recognize there are greater things just beyond the HP wall.  Best wishes as you spread your talented wings and fly. Lana Adler (author) from California on July 14, 2015: Thank you. Well, after 6 years I can't  really claim to be a beginner :) I've learnt what I could here, it's time to look for greener pastures. Thank you for stopping by! Rebecca Mealey from Northeastern Georgia, USA on July 13, 2015: Honest! And helpful. I think HubPages is a great way to begin, so don't beat yourself up too much! Lana Adler (author) from California on July 09, 2015: Thank you David! The brutal honesty was intentional :) I've got nothing more to hide. I'm basically admitting my defeat - you won, HubPages! It's my own fault for not promoting and engaging more, so be it. But damn it, you let me down too! The passive income for me here is so miniscule, I can't even call it income without laughing (and crying at the same time). But yes, you do keep the rights to your stuff :) Thanks for commenting and voting! Lana Adler (author) from California on July 09, 2015: I'm with you, Don - I don't like the word ""hub,"" I prefer ""article"". Sounds more respectable. But for the purposes of this...um...article I use ""hubs"" to refer to what I'm doing here on HP. I've been plodding along too. For a while. A looooooong while. And I'm still here, aren't I? I agree that it takes time to establish your audience on other sites, and there's nothing wrong with staying with HP but...sometimes you gotta try new things...scary things. It may lead you somewhere you could have never imagined :) Thanks for stopping by! David Hunt from Cedar Rapids, Iowa on July 09, 2015: You have a lot of interesting points and you aren't afraid to be honest. A few years ago I spent a lot of time writing for content mills (MTurk, etc). One thing I really like about HubPages is that the articles are mine and, even though my traffic has slowly dropped, I still earn passive income on what I wrote 2-3 years ago. Voted up and interesting. Don Bobbitt from Ruskin Florida on July 09, 2015: kalinin1148- Good article. (Notice I didn't use the word HUB?) I call waht I write on HP articles, myself. This helps me keep my perspective on just exactly :\""who and what"" I am. You see, I AM A WRITER! And damn those who say otherwise. AS you mentioned, this constantly changing field of requirements by HP (mostly for their own survival, sic) is a nuisance, and a time consuming one, for me. But. having been here, plodding along on HP, for almost 6 years, I can say that it is the best of the sites that provide this service for writers, especially struggling ones. Oh, there are a lot of writers sites out there, but they are there for a subtly different audience, in my opinion, and that's for the already applauded authors and the readers. So, think of me when you see another one of the HP gang's criticisms or changes to your established articles status, or whatever. I'll be plodding along, cursing HP but begrudgingly continuing to write here for the foreseeable future. LOL! DON Lana Adler (author) from California on July 08, 2015: Goddamn it I miss those days!! I am so dumbfounded by all this marketing business. I don't want to be like those annoying people always shoving their product down people's throats. And I hate social media with its popularity contests. But I'm too poor to hire an agent...Lol. Thanks for stopping by Larry! Lana Adler (author) from California on July 08, 2015: Thank you Mel! I will always be a bit of a foreigner so the language is a continuous learning effort, you're right. Although I will probably never have the same vocabulary as I do in Russian. Btw, if you notice any mistakes I might have missed, feel free to tell me, I would appreciate it. Thank you for the encouragement. And I know you're working on a novel, right? I'm sure it won't be long before you have a book with your name on it :-) Lana Adler (author) from California on July 08, 2015: Of course you love it here Bill! You're one of the HP success stories with a huge following and a thousand articles to your name. Whatever it is you are making here, I'm sure it can't be compared to what I'm making. But this isn't even about the money. I appreciate the community here too, I just don't think it's enough anymore...Thanks for stopping by! Larry Rankin from Oklahoma on July 08, 2015: Interesting hub. Wouldn't it be nice if we lived in olden times of a decade ago and writers could focus mainly on writing and not all this other junk:-) Mel Carriere from Snowbound and down in Northern Colorado on July 08, 2015: You write wonderfully, and I admire your efforts to master this language, not just learn it but to make it your voice.  And I envy you for being published.  You will always have that book with your name on it you can point to on the shelf.  Please persevere.  Thanks for the nice mention.  Great heartfelt hub. Bill Holland from Olympia, WA on July 08, 2015: It's always interesting to read other perspectives.  I love it here despite the fact that the money is ridiculous. I love the community, and I love this honest appraisal of your time here."
31,"10,000 Views, 100 Followers and 50 Hubs",community," This is my 50th hub! Congratulations to me! Coincidentally, I have published my 50th hub around the same time that I have received my 10,000 view and my 100th follower. So, I am celebrating three achievements and what great achievements they are. I am proud of my hubs and ecstatic for having my followers and my viewers. Without them there would be no purpose or reason to write hubs. Thanks to all. Unlike some Hubpages' members, I am slow to write and slow to publish. I write in spurts non-stop for days at at time and then stop writing for months only to come back to the computer and write as if there were no tomorrow. So, it has taken me two years to accomplish what some hubbers accomplish in months. I am not complaining. I have learned a few things by taking my sweet time. I have learned to be an expert on capsules, I have learned to use keyword research to my advantage, I write niche articles and I promote them through social networks and by building backlinks. By taking my time writing hubs, I have absorbed what works well for others and incorporated it into my own writing. The end result is a high quality hub that is well researched and executed. I become an expert on a particular subject in a short time and relay what I learn to the reader. Basically, I learn something new everyday. This, for me, is the best part of being a writer for Hubpages. I learn something new, become an expert on a topic, write a hub and share what I have learned with an audience that spans the globe. Besides the monetary perks that Hubpages offers to a writer, this is my favorite part of writing. I meet new people and share information with them. It is very rewarding. There is a lot of advice out there about using Google Keywords to research a topic and develop a niche. I have been writing and researching online for years. I have been a writer for Associated Content now Yahoo Voices for three times longer than my stint here at Hubpages. I have read a lot of articles about developing a niche. I have studied online and attended seminars about SEO, niche marketing, article marketing, and making an online income. I have spent years weeding through those only out to scam or make a fast buck. Niche marketing is not confusing and does not have to be difficult. Here are a few tips I have learned over the years that will help you to use niche marketing quickly and effectively when writing an article. That is how I develop a niche for writing online. I do not try to analyze it any further than that. If I write a quality hub using my keywords, strive for 800 to 1,500 words, and incorporate quality photos and/or videos or an interactive vote or chart capsule, then I have optimized my hub for Google's search engines and the hub will get readers without any other help on my part. A hub written this way will eventually get indexed into the search engines and will take on a decent rank in the search engines to boot. I do not stop there, however, and use social bookmarks and back links to promote my hubs. This is probably why I do not write as fast as some other Hubpages writers do because I actively promote a new hub as soon as it is written and I continue to promote hubs well after they are written in order to keep the traffic steady. Corey (author) from Northfield, MA on June 26, 2012: Thank you Kimberly! Corey (author) from Northfield, MA on June 26, 2012: Thank you unknown spy! Corey (author) from Northfield, MA on June 26, 2012: Thank you dwachira! Kimberly Vaughn from Midwest on June 25, 2012: I appreciate the detail! Very helpful!

JT Corey (author) from Northfield, MA on June 21, 2012: Thanks Julie, I hope this helps people use the Keyword tool more readily. It is by wrote for me at this point. Thanks for the vote up! Blurter of Indiscretions from Clinton CT on June 21, 2012: I really liked the way you broke down how to use the google keywords tool. Thanks for sharing. I voted it up! Corey (author) from Northfield, MA on June 21, 2012: Thanks again Vespawoolf, This is how I use Adwords and there are others who really analyze it but I do not have time for that and this works for me! Vespa Woolf from Peru, South America on June 21, 2012: Wow, I've learned so much from this hub! I wasn't using Adwords to it's full potential so I really appreciate the pointers. I've never taken any classes and am struggling along as everything is new to me. Congratulations on 50 hubs, 100 followers and 10,000 views! You're doing great!"
32,Google's Author Rank Rewards High Quality Websites - Why Low Quality Content Hurts Your Site,community," Marlene is a published author who enjoys sharing tips that have helped her succeed in writing fiction, non fiction, and screenplays. Author Rank is Google's method of ranking authors who contribute content to the internet. Author Google is big on presenting high quality content to its customers, who content writers refer to as visitors. Google wants readers to have a positive experience when doing searches on the internet, so the quality of the content returned from search queries must measure up to Google’s standards for top quality content. Google wants sites that have original content, original research, authoritative information, or other value-added content for their readers. If the quality of content on some of your pages does not measure up to Google’s standards, it can seriously alter Google’s perception of the overall quality of your site. To battle any penalties, what you want to do is either improve the quality of your content or delete it. If you have a web page dedicated to “Blue Suede Shoes” and someone does a search for “Blue Shoes”, then your site may not be ranked as high. However, if someone types in “Blue Suede Shoes”, and your site has been rated as one with good and relevant content (as related to the search), then your site would probably rank higher, even if it has little traffic. That’s because Google looks at qualify and relevance more than it looks at the number of visitors. There is no exact point of low traffic or inactivity that negatively affects your Google rankings. That’s because negative ranking is not so much based upon traffic or activity. More important than traffic is relevancy. Google ranks your site by relevance. If your page is expertly optimized with titles, headings, and quality content, your site could possibly be ranked higher than a site that receives more traffic. There are many items that qualify your site as low quality; however some prevailing reasons for downgrading and punishing your website are the following: Special Note About Holiday Content: With regard to holiday content, remember that if you have a website or blog that is solely related to holiday content, then placing holiday content on that page would be relevant. It makes pure sense to place holiday content on a page related to holidays. But, if you have a website or blog where the focus is something other than holiday content, then placing holiday content on that website or blog jeopardizes the overall validity of the page. You can safely add holiday content to a page so long as the overall focus remains on topic. Holiday content should be related to the overall content. Author Let's say you have a web site about ""coffee"". On your website you have information about the history of coffee, how to grow coffee, how to harvest coffee, and so on. You might even have recipes for coffee drinks on your coffee related website. If you place content about how to buy Christmas wreaths on your coffee page, you would ruin the overall integrity of the page. On the other hand, if you place content about how to give coffee as a gift, or sell coffee gift packages from your page, then you would be keeping the integrity of your page in line with its overall focus, which is coffee. Google considers your site high quality if it contains the following elements: Be willing to throw low quality content into the trash. Royalty Free Image By Pixabay Analyze your website. Look at every page on your site. Look at your traffic to see how many people visit your web page and in what time frame. For instance, if you only received one viewer over a six-week period, consider it alarming. Look at the links on each page to see who and how many people link to your page. Are people commenting or sharing your page with others? If not, then consider the fact that your content may not be engaging enough to invite people to respond to it. Also, people tend to share your content with others if they find it interesting and worthy to be shared with others. If people are not sharing your content with others, then it may be time to give your content a boost or give your content the boot. After analyzing the numbers, when you find a page that is performing poorly you can decide to fix that page or delete that page. One way to fix the page is to rewrite it. Turn the page into content that people find useful and valuable. You may simply need to rewrite the page with a different spin on the subject. Alternately, if it doesn’t make sense to rewrite the page, then the best thing to do is delete the page. Don't be afraid to delete non-performing pages. In the long run, deletion can help your overall ranking. Google has an excellent video tutorial that shows how websites are ranked. The video is only 5:24 in length and clarifies the primary criteria for ranking. One criteria is relevance and the other is importance. Although there are over 200 components that are involved with ranking, relevance and importance are by far the most critical. As a content writer you are fortunate that Google re-analyzes your site on a regular basis. Soon after making changes to your site, as Google re-crawls your site, your changes are reflected in the rankings. Inactivity is only part of the equation, and Google does not provide a definitive answer regarding time lapse between visitors. While it is important to have people visit your web site and interact with information on your web site by linking and sharing your site with others, the number of times people have visited your site is not as important as the quality and relevance of information found in relation to search queries of readers. A higher score will mean a higher page rank. Author Google is making a convertive effort to ensure that search results provide readers with high quality content.To that end, Google is fine-tuning a rating system referred to as Author Rank. Author Rank is a rating system which ranks an author's content for relevance. Authors will be given a grade as to whether or not the content they provide meets Google's standards of being high quality and useful in relation to the search query. In the past, through Search Engine Optimization (SEO), excessive backlinks could help poorly written content reach the top of the page simply because of the number of links. With Author Rank, authors are given a grade for the content they provide. This would mean that an author could be given a high grade for well written content and a low grade for poorly written content. Google's intent with Author Rank is to make sure that only the best, authoritative content on a particular subject makes it to the top of the Google search results page. As an author, your primary concern is to make sure you create authoritative, valuable content that others will want to share. Be the author Google and readers can rely on for content that is rich and provides the answer people are searching for. If you are an author who provides valuable, authoritative, and trustworthy content, then the Author Rank grading system will be a benefit to you. Your work will be recognized as high quality and your content is more likely to be ranked higher in search engine results. Setting up a Google+ profile will be beneficial to your Author Rank. By Google [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons The word on the street is that Author Rank will be closely tied to Google+. Google uses your ""in circles"" count to determine your Author Rank. So the first suggestion is to get yourself set up on Google+. Create a Google+ profile and author identity. Start engaging with Google+ by posting and commenting, and replying to comments. Develop presence with a following of readers. Basically, you just want to be involved with Google+ as much as possible. In getting prepared for Author Rank, keep the following two things in mind: If you commit to the above two things, you are setting yourself up to be a well-respected internet content writer with a higher than average Author Rank. With Google, it's all about relevance. So, before you publish content, you always want to ask yourself two very important questions: This content is accurate and true to the best of the author’s knowledge and is not meant to substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional. © 2012 Marlene Bertrand Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on March 31, 2017: Hello Gilbert Arevalo. Thank you for your positive feedback. It can be difficult to master the task of pleasing Google, but it can be done. I am glad you found these tips helpful. Gilbert Arevalo from Hacienda Heights, California on March 28, 2017: I learned some interesting pointers reading your hub, Marlene. Thank you. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on January 05, 2017: Hello tarhe. Thank you for your comment. I hear you about the concept of good intentions. My goal for 2017 is to spend more time at HubPages, writing and refining more hubs. Imonikhe Ahimie from Lagos, Nigeria on January 04, 2017: Informative and to the point. I'm always intending to get back to some old hubs and reworking/fine tuning them. Too often though, the road I walk is paved with good intentions and we all know where that road leads too. Maybe, just maybe, 2017 will be different. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on July 11, 2015: Hi Dianemae. You are wise. Fine-tuning and bringing hubs up to date keeps them ""current"" in the eyes of Google. Dianemae on July 11, 2015: Great hub. I have been looking to go back and redo some original hubs and gave some great advice. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on June 22, 2015: Hi skperdon. Thank you very much for your feedback. It took me a while to get it all straight in my mind at first. But, like you plan to do, I kept reading and re-reading publications about author rank until it finally sunk in. skperdon from Canada on June 20, 2015: I find the information in your hub very useful. I'll come back and read it again  until I'm sure that I understand everything. Thanks for sharing the your informative hub MarleneB. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on June 15, 2015: Hello justmesuzanne. Thank you so much for the compliment. With all the changes that are constant in the online writing world, I hope these tips will help writers stay on top of it all. justmesuzanne from Texas on June 12, 2015: Very valuable information! Thanks! Voted up, useful and interesting! :) Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on April 29, 2015: Yes, Jacobb9205. Staying current is what will keep your content active and viewed by many. Jacobb9205 on April 20, 2015: MarleneB, Yes, it's not easy for sure! Yeah that's true, keeping up to date is essential! Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on April 20, 2015: Hello Jacobb9205. I am glad that the information is helpful. Writing content for the internet is not always easy because things change on a daily basis. The only thing we can do is keep up-to-date on what the criteria is for staying ""in the game."" Jacobb9205 on April 19, 2015: Thank you for this it gave me a better description about why low quality content is harming my writing. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on October 01, 2013: Thank you, Benjamin Chege! Your positive feedback is encouraging. The thing I hope readers take away from this hub is exactly the points you mentioned - that content needs to be helpful, relevant, and interesting enough that readers take time to engage by leaving comments and sharing with others. Benjamin Chege on October 01, 2013: Hi Marlene B. I wish every hubber read this hub over and over in their career. All of us would live happily ever after in the industry. High-quality content and interaction with readers prove that the article is not only relevant, but also personally helpful to the readers. Anyone who asks the search engine something has a right to the most relevant and important content. Great article you have here. Voted up, useful, awesome and beautiful. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on April 08, 2013: Thank you for your compliment, Joseph Muendo. I am humbled to read such positive feedback. Joseph Muendo from Nairobi, Kenya on April 07, 2013: Quality , very informative hub. voted up and shared Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on April 03, 2013: Paul Kuehn - Hi Paul, thank you for your comment as it goes to confirm how important it is to visit our web pages every now and then to update and refine it for better ranking. Yes. Google+ is going to be a critical component in Google ranking in the near future, so it is important to get started in that arena, as well. suzettenaples - Thank you for your comment. Like you, in some cases, when I have left certain content alone, it has come back to being active. I wish there was a magic formula I could follow to know for sure. But, it looks like you are taking good care of your content because it is working out well for you. Suzette Walker from Taos, NM on April 03, 2013: Excellent hub full of interesting and relevant information.  You are correct in your suggestions and analysis.  Thanks for sharing this.  I update and revive certain hubs, but if a hub is inactive I don't remove it.  I leave it and I have found it eventually becomes active again when traffic picks up on it.  There are different strategies for optimal hub traffic.  Thanks so much for your information and suggestions. Paul Richard Kuehn from Udorn City, Thailand on April 03, 2013: MarleneB, I found this article to be especially interesting and useful.  My scores and views has steadily increased as I have written better content and interacted more with the Hubpage community.  I didn't realize that Google Plus was that important in getting a higher Google ranking.  Thanks for all of the useful tips.  Voted up and sharing with followers. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on April 02, 2013: Thank you, beingwell. Your feedback is truly valuable to me. I am glad it is helpful to you and all who read it. beingwell from Bangkok on April 02, 2013: This is really helpful, marlene. Voting up and shared. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on March 04, 2013: Hi Indian Chef . I don't think Google has come out with Author Rank yet. If they have, I haven't heard about it. I have a Google news feed set so that when the buzz starts about Author Rank, I'll come back here to update the hub. And, no I don't think it has anything to do with HubPages. This is a total Google thing. Indian Chef from New Delhi India on March 03, 2013: Very useful info marlene B. Have google already came with author rank or is it still working on it. Does the low rank of hubpages has something to do with it? Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on March 02, 2013: wqaindia, lex123, and shampa sadhya - Thank you very much for your positive comments. As we all know, Google is large and in charge, and if we want to be successful as online writers, we would serve ourselves well to adhere to their processes and standards. Ashok Goyal from 448 Dalima Vihar Rajpura 140401 Punjab India on March 02, 2013: I think the content adjudged best remains best in the future too. Google needs to find ways and means to allow future generations to dig in the past to keep ""Active the Past into the Future so as to make it History"" and everyone has the right to now History of inactive Google Ranked Authors. lex123 on March 02, 2013: very useful and well explained hub. Thanks  for writing this. Shampa Sadhya from NEW DELHI, INDIA on March 02, 2013: Voted up and useful! A very informative article and you have written it very clearly. Sharing and pinning! Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on February 13, 2013: Hi rajan jolly. Thank you for reading again. This hub went dormant for a while. I updated it with the information I know about Author Rank, then re-published. Currently, all anyone knows is that Google is releasing Author Rank ""soon"". But, no one knows exactly when. I plan on coming back to this hub and updating it as soon as I know more. Rajan Singh Jolly from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on February 12, 2013: Glad to be reading it again, Marlene. Any idea when Google is coming out with Author rank? This info will be pretty useful to the readers as well I guess. Voted up. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on February 05, 2013: Hi ChitrangadaSharan! Google is working hard to reward writers of good content. Remember, holiday content is OK, so long as it is relevant to the page you are publishing it to. Thanks so much for your visit. Chitrangada Sharan from New Delhi, India on February 05, 2013: Very informative hub....learnt  a lot about how google views the content part, with special reference to  seasonal hubs. Thanks for sharing the knowledge. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on February 04, 2013: Hi alocsin. I'm with you regarding rewriting hubs. If I can add something to a hub to make it better, then I'll do it. Spending a lot of time on an old hub sometimes takes longer than starting a new hub from scratch. And, you are right about how new hubs are viewed in Google. A brand new hub is more likely to be crawled sooner than an old, rewritten hub. Thank you for your feedback. Aurelio Locsin from Orange County, CA on February 03, 2013: If it takes too long for me to rewrite an old Hub, I'd just as soon delete it and start over.  Google will see it as a fresh attempt as well and crawl it, which I think is better than trying to figure out when it will take a look at an old site, if ever.  Voting this Up and Useful. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on December 21, 2012: Hi CyclingFitness! Google doesn't consider festive and holiday content as low quality. The issue of festive and holiday content is in regard to page ranking. If you have a high quality holiday article, you won't be knocked down for quality. On the other hand, your article may not be ranked high enough for anyone to find if the article is not placed correctly. Good high quality holiday articles get ranked down when they are not placed correctly. It's about placement. For example, if you write about bikes and are recognized for your expertise in this subject and then place an article titled ""How to Make a Christmas Wreath"" on your page, then that page is down graded because now you have placed on that page, an article that is not related to bikes. On the other hand, if you write an article titled ""What to Look for When Buying a Bike as a Christmas Gift"", that would be a great article to put on your page because it is perfectly related to the overall content of your page. Does that make sense? Let me know. It is a concept that is truly important for internet success. Liam Hallam from Nottingham UK on December 21, 2012: Why would seasonal such as Christmas content be considered to be of poor quality for google? Christmas certainly is a very profitable time for google where companies pay out large amounts of money for adwords and adsense campaigns. There are also a large number of situations where seasonal content is very relevant to a site. Speaking as someone who writes primarily on sports and sports training- Winter and Summer provide completely different sporting focuses that an authoritative site will need to address. By added that authority aspect you've generated your information above would mean that by adding articles on Christmas would mean you're taking away your authority. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on December 13, 2012: Hello rajan jolly, the answer I give here is based on my opinion only and is based on how I interpret the information I have read in Google's webmaster guide. Pretty much, it is like this - Good content is the most important factor. Second to good content is relevance. If you have, let's say, a gift ideas website and this website is entirely devoted to holiday or festive content, then that is the absolute perfect scenario. Any holiday or festive content that you write for that website is relevant and is likely to receive readership throughout the year. It will (most likely) be ranked high because the content is highly relevant to the website. On the other hand, let's say you have a general based website and place holiday or festive content on that website, then that page would be ranked lower because the content is not necessarily relevant to the website. Google is really keen on the concept of niche-based domains. As HubPages writers, we have a sub-domain (our profile page). While HubPages allows us to write about whatever we want, overall, it is in our best interest to focus on a niche and write about that in order to keep the content on our sub-domain relevant. Right now, my own sub-domain consists of various topics. In the eyes of Google, any content that I post on my sub-domain could be considered not relevant. My focus going into the next year is to find a niche and write about that one and only niche. That way, when I post content, it will be considered relevant and it will have a better chance of being seen on the internet. I hope this helps. Please feel free to share your own thoughts and ideas. I must say, I enjoy reading your hubs and it seems like you have a really good niche that is working. If I were to write a holiday or festive article right now, I would post it to a blog or website that I have devoted entirely to holiday or festive content. Rajan Singh Jolly from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on December 12, 2012: Interesting information Marlene. Am just wondering if holiday or festival  hubs are not getting views the year round what is the best way to handle them so that they do not affect one's website negatively? Any suggestions? Voted up and interesting. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on November 27, 2012: Hi rajan jolly, in the internet writer's world, we know that content is king! Great content is the name of the game in such a way that in order to be successful, we must get a handle on writing content that readers want to read. I must take a moment to compliment you, because you always write well and you write about things I truly enjoy reading. Thank you for your positive feedback. Rajan Singh Jolly from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on November 26, 2012: Very interesting and useful pointers but content ranks at the top and glad you underline this point and the rest follow. Great job. voted up, useful. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on November 26, 2012: Thanks, Missy Mac. I have discovered that if I want to be an internet writer, then it would suit me to discover what Google expects of writers. Thank you for your wonderful words of encouragement. Missy Mac from Illinois on November 24, 2012: Thanks for this great article.  I have been writing for three months and endeavor to find the right writing strategies.  This article provides clearer Google expectations.  Thanks again! Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on October 18, 2012: You are very inspirational, GoldenThreadPress. Like you, I do hope that what I do is helpful. Thank you for your positive feedback. GoldenThreadPress on October 18, 2012: Great Hub! I appreciate the time you put into providing the details on just what makes a good Hub so that Google will read it properly and rank it high. I believe that Hubs are works in progress, much like my garden. I tweak it hear and there. Nice to know that what I am doing will hopefully keep my Hubs up on the World Wide Web. Best Regards--Deb Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on October 14, 2012: Hi Peggy W. It's kind of difficult thing to do - find that one and only niche and write on that alone. I write about a number of different topics here at HubPages, but I have learned that I receive more solid results from my niche websites and blogs. Plain and simply, that is what Google likes. You ask a difficult question to answer, nevertheless I will answer to the best of my ability and based upon my own personal experience which may be different than others. Here goes - If I only have one or two holiday pages among other general topic pages, then I would take the holiday pages down. If I could re-write the holiday pages so that they are generic content, then I would re-write them. I took one of my hubs which was a holiday hub, getting little traffic, and re-wrote it to make it a general topic hub and all of a sudden it is seeing much more traffic. In my opinion, one or two comments in the off-season is not enough to justify keeping holiday content up.  Taking the holiday page down and bringing it back up is no guarantee that the search engines are going to find it in time for the holidays, so, that is a risky strategy. That's just my personal experience speaking here. I hope this helps. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on October 14, 2012: Hello L.L. Woodard. Thank you for your vote of cofidence. You are absolutely right - content is king! Good content will satisfy your readers and take you to the top. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on October 14, 2012: Hi Gypsy Rose Lee, thank you for your positive comment and for sharing. I truly do appreciate your support. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on October 14, 2012: Hi Brett - good question. While there are are several automated sources on the internet that will rank your pages, I venture out to say that they may not be reliable enough to be helpful. Unless these programs are running neck and neck with Google and changing their algorithms right alongside with Google, then I would not rely on them. Unfortunately, when Google changes the game, then we have to manually adjust our websites accordingly in order to stay in the game. It's tedious work and if you are like me, you don't have a team of people to comb through each page and fix them. You have to manually go through and do it one page at a time. Here is what I would suggest and what I have done with my own websites. Take a look at each page and make sure it has a title with a keyword search term. And, when I say keyword search term, I mean - a word that people are likely to type when searching for that page. After you determine the keyword search term, make sure that keyword search term is used in the description of that page. Also, make sure the keyword search term is used in the first paragraph of that page and the last paragraph of that page. Throughout the page, use the keyword in a way that makes sense to the reader, but use the keyword at least once in each paragraph (so long as it makes sense). Personally, I try to use the keyword at least three times on a page that contains 1200 words. Oh, speaking of words, Google likes to see at least 500 words on a page. If I have only 500 words on a page, then (in addition to the description) I use the keyword once in the first paragraph, once in the last paragraph, and at least once in the body of the content. The reason it is important to use the keyword is because the keyword is what tells the search engines how relevant the content is to the title. The search engines can't read, so the only way the search engines determine relevance is in seeing how often the keyword is used throughout the page. Finally, each page should have a single focus so as not to confuse the search robots. I know it is a lot of work to go through a website page-by-page, but it is BEST way get things right. I wish there was a magically quick solution, but to me, this is the minimal effort that should go into determining whether or not a page will be ""liked"" by Google. Peggy Woods from Houston, Texas on October 14, 2012: Hi Marlene, I can understand your explanation of keeping writings about all Christmas related things on one website and, for instance, all Easter related topics on another.  But if one writes on a number of subjects on HubPages and some of them are seasonal, are you saying that it drags down our entire site?  Should we inactivate them for say 10 months of the year and then reactivate them closer to the season?  Occasionally I will get a comment on a seasonal hub not in the same season.  Just curious...  Up votes! L.L. Woodard from Oklahoma City on October 14, 2012: In summation of what I learned from the information you've presented here, content is king. I find that reassuring, rather than relying on so many other details. Thanks for the information. Voted up and Shared. Gypsy Rose Lee from Daytona Beach, Florida on October 14, 2012: Thanks you for this very informative and useful hub. Will look over my content to see what needs revamping or dumping. Will bookmark for more reference and passing on. Brett C from Asia on October 14, 2012: I returned to this, because I recently bought the website, which although it ranks well, has got an incredible amount of content that may or may not be high quality. Hence I was wondering if you know where you find out which pages rank and well, or the pages which Google doesn't like. As I would like to remove these from the website and improve the quality of the site. However, with over 1300 posts, it would take a long time to read every page. If you have any suggestions, I would very much like to hear them. Sharing, pinning, tweeting, up and useful. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on October 09, 2012: Thank you very much, GlstngRosePetals. I am glad to have your feedback. GlstngRosePetals from Wouldn't You Like To Know on October 08, 2012: Great info. A nice understanding of the ratings. Voted up!! Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on September 25, 2012: Hi internpete. I enjoy reading hubs, and like you, I have found some hubs to be of less than stellar quality - fewer now that the ""idle"" hub program has been put into place. Nevertheless, some less than par hubs slip through the cracks. As hubbers, we are a unit, so I am grateful for the new program because the sub standard hubs hurt the higher quality hubs as a whole. Thank you for stopping by and for leaving your comment. Peter V from At the Beach in Florida on September 25, 2012: Good hub, I see a lot of low quality stuff even here on hubpages which makes me wonder why the authors are even bothering to write anything. These are good tips for everyone to keep in mind. Thanks for the reminder! Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on September 18, 2012: Hello billybuc, I know exactly what you mean. Every day there is something new to learn about being an online writer. I struggle to keep up and wish I could hire someone to take care of the SEO stuff. But, such is not the case because I can't afford it, so I shall continue to struggle and share what I've learned along the way. Bill Holland from Olympia, WA on September 18, 2012: That was helpful information!  I really am brain-dead when it comes to Google and rankings and whatever else I'm supposed to know but don't.  All I know how to do is write....I think I need a computer techie working alongside of me. Thanks for the info; very helpful. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on September 15, 2012: Brett and Thundermama, thank you very much for commenting. Google is making it known that what they want from content writers is for us to be more aware of the content we provide and Google has set out to let us know what steps we can take to measure and fix low quality content. When I analyze my pages, I first determine who the audience is. If the content is geared for seasonal readers, then Google considers it low quality for my overall site since the information is only pertinent for a small portion of the year and does not contribute to the overall focus of my site. On the other hand, if I have a web site that is dedicated to, say Christmas trees, and all of my content is related to Christmas trees, then anything I write about Christmas trees would be relevant and would not hurt my site. I look at the page and determine what the MAIN focus of that page is. I pick one subject and make sure everything on that page is dedicated to that one subject. If I have a page that addresses more than one subject, I now separate the subjects and write content for each separate page with a single focus. For me, keywords come into play only with regard to determining the subject of the page. Then, once I have identified the keyword/subject, then I make sure the keyword is in the title, description, the first paragraph, then sensibly throughout the page. The search engine robots cannot read, so the use of keywords throughout the content ""teaches"" the search engine robots what that page is all about. I don't have to go overboard with the usage of keywords. I use them where they would naturally appear. At the same time, I know that if I do not use the keyword in the title, the robot is not going to know what the page is about. And, if I don't use the keywords in the content, again the robot won’t know what the page is about. The most important thing I do is - ANSWER a QUESTION! I don't have to write my title in the form of a question, but as I write content, I must always be aware that I should be answering a question in my content. Now that I am going through my websites, blogs, and hubs, I see where there are some pages that just ramble on without answering a question. The pages that I have recently tended to are seeing more traffic than in the past and I think that's because I'm more conscientious now and taking steps to fine tune my content to be more relevant to internet searchers. I always want the reader to walk away with something in their hand (so to speak). So, answering a question is a virtual way to do that. Catherine Taylor from Canada on September 15, 2012: This was extremely helpful and gave me some food for thought when editing my lower ranked hubs. Superb advice. Voted up and sharing. Brett C from Asia on September 15, 2012: Very good advice for Hubbers and bloggers, well anyone with a website really. However, do you know how to easily find which pages need to be edited? Obviously on Hubpages it is marker now, but on your own sites ... Shared, up, useful and pinned. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on September 11, 2012: Hi Steve West, spring cleaning is a good way to think about the process of going through our hubs to spruce them up - polishing them to reintroduce them to the public. I have found that when I tidy up my hubs, they begin to receive more interest, as if they are new again. Thank you for reading and for leaving your comment. Steve West from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina on September 11, 2012: Good advice. I am going to re-edit all of my content starting now. Post-by-post I am going to check for errors and give my hubs a little bit of a spring cleaning. Thanks again. Faith Reaper from southern USA on September 09, 2012: Thanks so much Marlene. I appreciate the information.  Yes, I am trying to learn one thing at a time too, but I believe you are way ahead.  God bless. In His Love, Faith Reaper Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on September 09, 2012: Thank you for your positive feedback. sandrabusby -  Writing online is a profession in which I eventually want to earn a decent income. So, I thought it was time to learn what it takes to satisfy the objectives of Google. BlissfulWriter - I agree with you about the video. Zappos is in the news a lot because of their excellent customer service. I am glad you enjoyed it. BlissfulWriter on September 09, 2012: That is a very informative video. Sandra Busby from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, USA on September 09, 2012: Thanks, MarleneB, for bringing some objetivity to this topic.  Voted up and shared. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on September 08, 2012: LauraGSpeaks - I don't have any current sleepers, but I did have two in the beginning of the installation of HubPages' new program. I decided to fix them and everything is fine now. chrisinhawaii - I know what you mean by boring content. One of the hubs I wrote was put to sleep. I already knew it was boring because of the nature of the subject. Sometimes, you just can't make a subject exciting. But, to bring the hub back to life, I shortened it and changed the focus. Now, it is doing better than it ever did. Arlene - Only one Zzz? I had two of them. One was a holiday hub and the other was just plain boring. Instead of deleting them, I decided to change the titles and on the holiday hub, I took out all references to ""holiday"" and made it a general purpose hub. The boring one didn't have to go through a major overhaul; it just needed to be shortened and angled differently in order to appeal to a wider audience. Currently, I am Zzz free. That is... until something else falls down. I get it, though. Information does need to be kept fresh and alive. The fear of hubs going idle will keep us reviewing our hubs on a regular basis, which will keep readers interested in what we write. Faith Reaper - You are an excellent writer. I have found the Google Webmaster Tutorials to be most helpful in learning all this stuff. I'm still not up to par on all of it, but every week I try to learn a new thing - just one thing at a time, otherwise I would be overwhelmed. Faith Reaper from southern USA on September 08, 2012: I was just talking about this very subject with another hubber friend.  This is a very informative and helpful hub.  I have been attempting to learn about SEO implementation, but I have not been very successful, but that is another subject for another day.  A dear hubber friend has been helping me, so maybe I will get there eventually.  Thanks for sharing this information here, as it is very helpful.  In His Love, Faith Reaper Arlene V. Poma on September 08, 2012: It's tough to find something that hasn't been covered, but you have to give your best effort.  None of my Hubs right now bear the dreaded Zzz, but knowing that Zzz can appear at any time will keep you on your toes.  I'm not going to wait until the next rumble.  It is best to keep tending the flock.  This is what my one Zzz has taught me. chrisinhawaii on September 08, 2012: Like you said, taking those boring, saturated topics and coming up with a unique perspective is so important...thanks for that reminder! I was kind of in a rut, writing ""boring"" little articles for textbroker.  I hate writing articles that are so salesy and irrelevant...just to make a few bucks.  But, that's what the clients want, so...ugh... Thanks for a great little hub.  Voted up! LauraGSpeaks from Raleigh, NC on September 08, 2012: Very informative hub.  Though none of my hubs are current sleepers, I have a couple with low traffic that I need to revamp or possibly delete. Marlene Bertrand (author) from USA on September 08, 2012: Thank you for reading and for your positive feedback. I just clicked on the link and read your hub. It is excellent and reiterates how important we all are to the overall success of HubPages. Routledge on September 08, 2012: https://hubpages.com/community/Hub-Quality-Affects...

33,What Kind of Income Can You Really Expect on HubPages?,community," When I decided that I wanted to earn an income writing online and considered joining HubPages, I had to ask myself the question ""What kind of income can you REALLY expect to earn on HubPages?"" So, what does any good writer do before they ever start to write on a subject?? Why RESEARCH of course!! Thus I began my journey of study to educate myself on this new and confusing realm of potential income. First, I began by studying everything I could get my hands on to learn the best tips and ways to START the money rolling in and then KEEP the money rolling in on a consistent monthly basis, which is what I believe most of us are on here for - along with a love for writing in general. In my research I have learned there are two popular versions of what kind of income a person is told that they can expect to earn on HubPages. I believe there are always three versions of the truth, ""Her version, His version, and then what REALLY happened!"" So applying that same logic to this subject as well would say that there is probably a happy medium between these two levels where the true expectations can be found. Did your head spin with thoughts of retirement, paying for that dream car, or taking your family on that dream vacation just by writing a couple of hubs and then being able to just sit back and watch the money roll in from now till eternity?!?! If that is what you thought earning money online was about then I truly hate to burst your bubble, but it is just not reality. The ""Dream Job"" payouts and ""Success Story"" income levels, I have found, are gained by writers who are willing to sacrifice through ""sweat on their brow and calluses on their typing fingers"" - hard and consistent work! Most post articles on more than one site and typically spend 10 to 20 hours a week writing. Keep in mind that those 10 - 20 hours a week are AFTER they have established a following and gotten all their sites set up and all their affiliates approved and processed. The process of just getting everything set up and running took me over a week by itself. Throw in trying to post a couple of quality articles in that mixture and you will have a pretty busy time of it at first. Now, let me say right here and right now - THERE IS NOTHING WRONG with not getting a paycheck from HubPages!! Some people write strictly for the love of writing and need a forum for their creativity's  where they can socialize with other writers - HubPages is THE place to be for that kind of atmosphere and there is not one thing wrong with it! The important thing to remember is that if you want to earn a living online writing on HubPages, or anywhere else for that matter, is simply this - the money is out there to be made! All you have to do is be willing to work hard at it while being patient for the results, and keep your expectations realistic. Just keep at it and remember the best motto if you want to earn a living writing is: ""Content is KING, but Quantity is QUEEN!!""

It does take a while to build things up, but once you start getting first page rankings on Yahoo and Google you'll be amazed at how fast things start to turn around... Just keep writing good quality hubs and the benefits will come! Michele Kelsey from Edmond, Oklahoma on April 25, 2013: I really enjoyed this hub. I was wondering how much money you could make on hubpages. That's very interesting that people write 10 to 20 hours per week. I feel like I could write a bit faster if the capsules would load a little faster. I usually pre-write in Microsoft Word and copy and paste onto the hubpage. Keep up the excellent advice!

I take such feedback from someone as successful as you in great regards! William Elliott from California USA on March 02, 2012: Hello Laura, Thanks for a very good hub. I think hubs like this one should be a compulsary read for newcomers to HubPages. So often, it seems people have a starry eyed view of writing online. This puts that idea in perfect balance with the reality. For sure you will go far within HubPages with such items as this. Happy Hubbing"
34,Hubpages On-Page Seo Guide 2018,community," Working in the SEO industry, with a focus on On-Site SEO, Brandon is a top-rated Upwork SEO specialist. Learn SEO with him. This HubPages on-page SEO guide is written to help writers on HubPages who are interested in increasing their ""organic traffic"", with a key focus on increasing traffic from Google, the search behemoth. Before you go ahead you should know that on-page SEO and SEO, in general, is not set in stone. Some things that work today, may not in a few months or years from now. Writing online is not a passive source of income, not completely. Also, this hub is not a tutorial, but a guide. It's not steps you should follow, but rather a process that I suggest. I have extensively used my hubs as examples throughout this guide, not to say my hubs are perfect, but to prove that the methods I talk about actually work - today! I've linked to my own hubs to serve as examples when I talk about a certain concept. It's easier shown than explained in many cases. You may find yourself hopping back and forth across 5 - 6 different hubs of mine while you learn from an SEO nerd. You're also going to find links to hubs from other authors here on HP who've already extensively covered certain aspects of On-Page SEO. I don't have any intention to reinvent the wheel. This is a very long read, especially considering the other articles that are linked from this guide. So, I've sorted stuff out a bit, and these are the things you should expect to learn after completely following through with this article: The detailed HubPages On-Page SEO guide If you begin a new hub just because you've got a topic to write about, you're doing things wrong. Most people start new hubs before doing their keyword research and therefore forever lose the opportunity to optimize their URL for their main term(s). Please take some time to answer the poll below before proceeding. If you've done this in the past, there is very little you can do to change this, so do not worry too much about it. But, for all future hubs and for hubs that you're planning on re-writing from scratch, I suggest that you do your keyword research before you click ""Write"" to begin a new hub. After you've completed your keyword research and have a list of keywords sorted by their search volume, pick the main keywords you would want your article to focus on. For example, for my hub on getting rid of termites, I would have had the following main keywords (Note: this is not my actual list, this is an old hub) termite treatment 14800 termite control 9900 how to get rid of termites 8100 how to kill termites 3600 how to treat termites 1300 how to get rid of termites naturally 390 natural way to get rid of termites 140 how to get rid of termites yourself 170 From the above list of keywords, I see that there are two really good keywords that would be perfect for a how-to guide. This is exactly the kind of article I wanted to write! Those are my little golden nuggets. I'm going to pick the keywords: how to get rid of termites naturally and how to get rid of termites yourself as my main keywords. The ideal URL for this hub would be: ../how-to-get-rid-termites-yourself-naturally When writing a URL you should make sure that you remove any words that are not directly adding to the URL, either in terms of SEO value or reader aesthetics. In the URL above I have retained the stop word 'to' but have left out the word 'of'. That's just my personal taste. Do not worry too much about stop words, the goal is to try and get your main keywords in the URL as close to the start as possible, while still retaining its readability. Never have a URL as: ../get-rid-termites-naturally-yourself-how-to This URL has the same keywords, but it does not read well. If search engines are not smart enough to detect this today, they will someday and your page could be hit by a spam penalty. And the URL is not something you can change here on HP, so refrain from doing something like this. Do not repeat the same word in your URL more than once, not even synonyms. For example, this is a bad URL: ../tomato-seedlings-growing-nurturing-and-caring-for-tomato-seedlings (from one of my hubs). Problems with the above URL: The word tomato and seedlings repeat. A better URL would be: ../growing-tomato-seedlings Having a short URL is always beneficial. Try and keep it as short as possible, while putting in your most important keywords. A short URL looks good on the search results page and your keywords are highlighted when someone searches for the term making it stand out. An exact match URL (exactly the same as your main keyword) is always the best way to go. It is also my personal choice to not exceed 6 words in the URL (as far as possible). I had secured the following URL: https://hubpages.com/living/how-to-care-tomato-plant (a better URL than I previously had) and had written a completely new hub here as the old hub (../tomato-seedlings-growing-nurturing-and-caring-for-tomato-seedlings) which was on the same topic was not receiving a lot of traffic. Since the old URL belonged to a hub that was moved to Dengarden and I didn't want to compete with myself for the same keywords, I requested the team to delete the old hub off Dengarden and replace it with the new hub that I had just published. However, Joanna (the editor I contacted) conveyed this message to the team (I'm thankful that she did this). Some time later Robin, being the helpful person she is, suggested that I do not delete the old URL and instead have two articles on Dengarden (not on the same topic) if possible, because the old URL had age on its side (2011) and we all know that Google loves aged URL's. This sounded really good, and I went along with it. I took this sound advice and decided to copy the hub from that new URL onto the hub that was already on Dengarden, thereby replacing it entirely with a brand new hub on an old URL. As you have now learned, this URL is not the best. It's now a few months since this was done (as of June 2018). Am I happy with this decision? Of course, I am. I learned a lot from this move. It was definitely the best way forward. However, the rankings are not what I expected, especially for a detailed hub, one that I am particularly proud of. I am pretty sure that I have determined the reasons this hub is not ranking well: Google is not smart enough, not yet: Google is becoming smarter every day, but it's not yet smart enough to consider an authority ""all-in-one"" article as the go-to article for all the sub-topics it covers. I talk about everything from picking the right kind of seed, to sowing, caring for and transplanting tomatoes in that article. The title ""Tomato Plant Care: Seed to Garden (A Complete Guide)"" does convey the message very well, but I do not have all my main keywords in there. There's no mention about transplanting in the title, there's neither a mention about this in the URL. Google still needs your main term or the direct subject mentioned in the URL and title tag for it to rank really well. Website authority plays a role, but unless the website is super authoritative, don't expect to rank at #1 with a tactic like this, not yet. I rank on page 2 for the term ""transplanting tomato seedlings"". Had this article been on a smaller site with less authority, this extensive article would probably not be in the top 10 pages for this term. The same article on Wikipedia would probably be in the top three spots. Internal links: There are no internal links pointing to this article that lets Google know that this article does in fact truly speak about transplanting tomatoes. I do not link to this hub from any of my other hubs with the term transplanting tomatoes or synonyms of the same. Internal competition: commonly known as keyword cannibalization, this is something you do not want to have to fight, not on HubPages, anyway. Managing this on your own website is a breeze, but on a platform such as HubPages where everyone can write on any topic, these problems are bound to occur. I found myself in this situation with this article. For the main keyword, I was after, which is ""tomato plant care"". If you search for this term, you will see that my article on Dengarden currently shows up on the second page. Just above another article, also on Dengarden by Kryssy Bruckheimer (see the image below). Keyword cannibalization - Oh oh! When two articles from a particular domain try to rank for the same term, Google makes it harder for any of them to rank, this is a logical move from the search engines point of view, because if a website has multiple articles on the same topic, they are probably not stand alone articles that cover the topic entirely. But when it comes to HubPages, this works against us and there's nothing we as authors can do about it, or is there? HubPages on their own does a good job at preventing very similar articles from moving to the niche sites, but the same keywords can be written about from different points of view, and this also (unfortunately) leads to the same issue of keyword cannibalization. There are plenty of free tools out there for keyword research. You just need to know how to use them. I mainly use SEMRush, which is a paid software and the best for keyword research among other things (Ahrefs is another amazing tool). But to cater to the need of most hubbers, I will explain the process using some amazing free tools which provide the same results as the paid tools (with a little bit of work). The only reason I use SEMRush is that I already have an account because I use it to track client keyword rankings and find out the keywords a page is already ranking for. Finding out the terms a page already ranks for is very helpful and was the report I provided a few hubbers through my post on the forums a few months ago. A free tool by Neil Patel, Uber Suggest uses both Google Adwords and the Google Suggest feature to suggest short and long tail keywords. All you need to do is enter your main keyword (the topic you want to write about) and click ""Look Up"". Once the keywords are generated, make sure that you scroll down and see that both the Google Keyword Planner and Google Suggest are ticked on the left sidebar. It is very likely that some terms are not directly related to what you want to write about and the topic you want to write about does not show on the top at all. To fix this problem use the Filter Results and Negative Keywords options on the left sidebar. For example, I typed in watering tomatoes as my main keyword. I see keyword suggestions such as best fertilizer for tomatoes. But I do not want to write about fertilizers at this time, so I add the word fertilizer as a negative keyword. Moreover, I am only interested in the keywords that are directly related to watering tomatoes. So I add the word ""water"" in the filter results option. After I have removed the main keywords I do not want to see, I sort the results by search volume. I now see ""water plants"", ""water machine"", etc. as suggested terms. Those are terms I am not interested in. But if I add plants as a negative keyword I would miss out on the terms such as watering tomato plants. To help me out, I just use the ctrl+F function on a windows computer and type in ""tomato"" to highlight terms that include water + tomato (water is added in through our filter and tomato through the search function). Alternatively, I could add tomato to my filter to include terms with the word tomato in them. This alone gives me more than enough suggestions. Create a spreadsheet or some sort of document to note down the main keywords you want to use. I was re-introduced to Uber Suggest only recently by DrMark on the HubPages forums. Also, the tool is about to get a makeover, I can't wait for that to happen. It is supposedly going to have the main features of SEMRush and Ahrefs too. A new tool that I recently found, Answer The Public (ATP) is one of my favorites, even though I have not had the opportunity to use it a lot. Just go to the website, type in your main keyword (the topic you want to write about) and scroll down to look at the suggestions which are sorted as questions, prepositions, comparisons and as an alphabetical characterization. I am not going to explain what these mean, go check it out yourself. It's really cool. It could probably replace Ubersuggest if it included search volumes, but there's no harm in using both tools. The more the merrier (to some extent). Put in long tail keywords from ATP into Ubersuggest if you need to know the search volume. Alternatively, put in some keywords from Ubersuggeset into ATP to get suggestions on headers you could use for your article. Now that you've got a list of short and long tail keywords, questions (from Answer the Public), and a general overview of the things people are searching for to learn about the topic you wish to write about, it is time to develop the skeleton of your article. Put yourself in the shoes of your readers, do not overwhelm them (read this post for a discussion on this). You want to give them all the information they need, but in a way that is easy to assimilate. As an expert on the topic, it is sometimes hard to do this. The best way to do this is to group similar keywords and questions together. The questions could most likely be your sub-headings. Try and use your main keywords in your headings and also H3 tags within a text capsule on the Hub Pages editor. Do not ever keyword stuff, think of your work as a research paper (or chapter of an academic book) and structure it accordingly. Most people say that an article must be 1500 words up to 3000 words. But don't fall for that. Sometimes the staff have said that the best hubs are around 1500 words. People take this as the holy-grail and try to reach this word count. It is NOT word count, but content that matters. These hubs that are 1500 words most likely cover their topic perfectly and are therefore ranking well and getting the traffic. Sometimes a topic is so well defined that you can not cross 500 words. At other times you may even reach 5 - 6000 words or in this case I'm almost at 9000 words. You could in most cases split the 6000-word article into two hubs, but not always. For instance, I'm going to be splitting my article on growing tomatoes, but this HubPages SEO guide is very long and I cannot split it without making my readers jump through a hoop to completely get what they came here for. Also, my hub on how do magnets work is over 3000 words, but it's not complete, I need to re-write it and add a lot more to it. There is no way I can split this up without the readers having to read two articles to answer their single simple question: how magnets work. On the other hand, when to water tomatoes could be a hub on its own, but I chose to include this topic on my watering tomato hub which originally just covered watering techniques. I did not split this into two hubs because they are so closely related that the search engines would get confused as to which page to rank for the term watering tomatoes since both the pages talk about this (keyword cannibalization). To sum it up: do not aim for a word count, instead aim to cover your topic entirely. The person searching should not have to go back to the search results and click on another web page. When a viewer does this, it is theorized that this acts as a negative signal to search engines. I do believe this is true. From experiments, I have noticed that pages with a relatively high user satisfaction rate do in fact move up the rankings over time, i.e. once they are on the first page. This is probably because the bounce rate (a click back to the search results page) from these high-quality pages is a lot lower than some of the other pages ranking for the particular search term. The experiments were conducted very well, I'm not going to elaborate more on this here. You're going to have to take my word for it, but rest assured that many of the other top SEO professionals have seen similar results. There are two types of people who do well here: Experts on a topic and those that know how to do their research and present the topic well. Imagine the potential traffic you'd have if you fell in both these brackets. Even if you are an expert and have a postdoc in a subject there is no way for search engines to know this. Google did try to do this with their Google author tag. But this is depreciated and not used anymore. You need to, therefore, prove to the search engines that you are in fact an expert on the topic. It's not hard, but it is time-consuming. By now you have a well-defined structure with each heading focusing on a particular keyword or keyphrase. Type in this keyword or keyphrase on Google and take a look at the first 20 results for this term. Read the articles that show up, what are they talking about that you have not planned on putting into your article? For example, when writing about watering tomatoes, I realized that some of the top pages spoke about enlivened water. I do not believe in this technique, but Google seems to rank pages with this information on the top. So I decided to include it along with my own take on it. You don't have to write something you do not believe in, but know that your readers are going to be reading many articles on the internet and as an expert, you need to address all their concerns. It's very likely that someone reading my hub wanted to know about enlivened water, I did have a few comments that discussed it too. Repeat this process for every subheading and of course your main keyword. Most of the pages ranking are going to be the same for the different terms you search for as they are all related to your main topic. Therefore, you're not reading 20 pages for every secondary keyword. But, there will be a few new pages every now and then and you would probably come across some pages that talk about your topic from a completely different perspective. To state another example, check out my hub on whether the tomato is a fruit or a vegetable. I found just one sentence on Wikipedia that spoke about the canning industry and how it defines the tomato. Just one sentence. But I wrote a paragraph or so on this after doing some more research. Therefore, I can definitely say that this hub of mine is for now truly the best on the internet for this topic. This is your goal: Make your article the very best on the internet for the topic you are writing about. This, in most cases, is going to lead to long articles, but not always. Some of you are going to be saying that people have a short attention span these days. That's gibberish from people who don't know how to deliver. If you write well, people are going to be engaged. People do have a short attention span, but that's just for things they do not like. If you're helping them, they're going to stick around. However, when you write detailed articles, it's very likely that someone is not interested in every single point you cover and they may be interested in just one of the ten things you've discussed. Make it easy for them to find this one thing. Structure your content well and include a table of contents when possible. I cannot stress on this topic enough, I have seen the best ROI on time invested by adopting this procedure to make my articles the best on the internet. Most of my articles are not up to date using this method, but the ones that are, are the ones that are doing the best. Thousands of visits a day each in some cases during peak season. I am not saying that every hub of yours will rank #1 if you follow this technique. Instead of the 80-20 rule where just 20% of your hubs do well, you could be tipping the scales in your favor, to say 50 - 50, on a very very conservative scale. As discussed above, keyword cannibalization is not that easy to solve on a website where you do not have a 100% control over all the pages being published. HubPages makes sure that multiple articles on the same topic do not get through to the niche sites. But, it's very possible that two articles written in different ways compete for the same keywords. If two authors are writing on the same topic, how do you make sure that it is you who is getting the traffic? Rather, how do you make sure that either you or your competition here on HubPages gets any traffic at all? As you have seen above on the image where two Dengarden articles rank on the 2nd page both of them have a hard time ranking. When Google sees two pages on a website talk about purple pigeon poop (credits to Wrylilt for this keyword), say page A and page B it doesn't know which page to rank and it is most likely of the assumption that neither A nor B are good enough because there are two pages talking about the same thing (I know I'm repeating my self here, but I cannot stress on this enough). If you cannot get rid of one of the pages the next best thing to do is vote on the page that you want Google to consider. But how do you vote? You use links! Internal links. If you were an authority on poop or on pigeons you'd have many articles on the topic and hence you're more likely to interlink your work. If page A belongs to you and page B to someone who just wrote one article on purple pigeon poop, it is very unlikely that page B would have many internal links. My solution is simple, become an authority in your niche. The more you write, the more you'd interlink your work with relevant anchor text and therefore you would outperform your internal competition. Internal links when done right are a lot more important than backlinks. Think of it like this: Say every article you write is a cup with an infinite capacity to hold water. The more water you have the more authority your article holds. Every website has a certain amount of water that is held by the many cups in its shelf. Backlinks to a website, to any page (cup), are like pipes bringing in water. The better the backlink (authority of the website linking) the more water flows. But, for the water to flow well within the shelf (on the website) the cups need to be connected by pipes (internal links). Now imagine that you add dye to this water. Red dye is for tomatoes and a green dye is for herbs. When I have many pipes flowing into my cup (tomato hub) I have a chance of getting some green dyed water too, I'm happy with all the water I get. But I would prefer more red-dyed water than green-dyed water. I can get more red-dyed water by sharing (sharing does not take away from your cup) the red-dyed water from my other tomato hubs so that I have a greater percentage of red dyed water in my cup [read note below]. This tells Google that my hub is an authority on tomatoes because I have more water than the other page that talks about the same keyword and in particular I have more red-dyed water. Note: My tomato hub (cup) has a source of red dye powder on the pipes leading out, so I convert all of the green-dyed water into red-dyed water if the water ever flows out to other hubs (cups). Don't let the QnA feature take you down. Don't answer questions that are already covered in your article. This can lead to keyword cannibalization too. You can't help lazy people, let them learn to read. — Brandon The question and answer feature is a great new tool added by HubPages, however, the way it's implemented is not the best. The moderation on the answers is not as strong as the moderation on the hubs on the niche site. But, that's a problem for HubPages to deal with. Having many low quality pages is not a good thing, and the team has a lot of experience with this already. However, as a hubber, there are some things you can do to make sure that you use this feature to increase your viewership and income: The only thing you as a hubber need to keep in mind is keyword cannibalization when dealing with this feature. Every other thing is up to the team to deal with. Most of you may not know much about the search snippet. It's not a new feature, but it's not very old either. It's been a few years now, I guess. If you rank on the first page for your search terms you're going to want to steal the snippet as that's the highest spot on the search page you can get to. Ranking #1 is not the best anymore. However, grabbing this position is not easy. You need to study your competition and find out exactly what kind of content Google is ranking in these spots on a hub-hub basis, rather a keyword-keyword basis. For an example of what a snippet looks like, check out the image below: Note: This can be a very volatile place to be, so only ever worry about stealing the snippet if you're really looking for good traffic. You may have to edit your hub multiple times before actually getting it, and once you have it you could lose it and the cycle continues. As you see above, I've taken over a part of the snippet. I already ranked #1 for this term, but it took me a little more time, effort and patience to get the snippet. Notice that there are two websites ranking on that snippet, one for the text and one for the image. You can, of course, grab them both, that's the goal. For an example of where I do not share the snippet with another website see the image below: You'll notice that the two snippets have a totally different format. One is information in the form of a paragraph with a picture, whereas the other is a table comparing stuff. There are a few different kinds of search snippets out there. For reviews and comparisons, you're probably going to need a table to take over this spot. If you're writing informational articles you would need a picture with the right ""alt text"" or on HubPages, the right caption (the alt text is a copy of your caption here on HP). Structured markup is the key to stealing search snippets. But, there are some general guidelines that you are advised to follow based on observations I've made and the research I've done. Note that these are not strict guidelines provided by Google, they'd never give out information like this, not even when filing patents. Yes, I look into their patents to know what they are doing, some nerdy SEO stuff. But getting back on track, below is a list of structured markup Google seems to be using and how you should make the best use of it: Unordered lists are the go-to markup you should use when you are listing things that are not sequentially related to one another, for example, a list of ingredients or when you are answering questions that could have multiple answers, or when you list out the health benefits of something. Ordered lists are used when you are listing something that must be followed in a sequence such as a recipie or the steps to follow when installing a kitchen sink. A table of contents in an ordered list is a very important feature to have on your website. I have discussed this in detail later. As you have already seen in a picture above, my article for the best wall mounted range hood has the search snippet for a few terms. This is a review article and when people search for reviews Google understands that most people are going to be interested in comparisons. Therefore, if you're doing a comparison, a review of any sort, listing the nutrition information of a fruit/vegetable or a recipe use a table to do it. If you notice that Google shows a table as the snippet for one of your search terms and it is not you ranking for it, check out the way the person uses the table. Are they sorting data by rows or columns? Copy their style when possible and do the same. There are certain phrases where Google prefers that the data is sorted by column and in some other cases the data should be sorted by rows. Again, if you look above you can see that I have stolen the snippet for yellow tomato leaves. To do this you're going to have to put your main keyword into the caption of your first image (preferably). Of course, make sure that you write a caption that reads well to your readers, else it's just going to be snipped by HP. Also, once you put in your main keyword into the first image, check out the captions of the other images on your hub. Try to ensure that no other picture mentions the keyword in the same order of words. It's some sort of keyword cannibalization for images because each image tries to rank on its own in Google image search. De-optimize other images by using filler words or synonyms. After around two weeks of making these changes to your images, you should go to Google image search and type in your main keyword. See the images that are ranking, if you notice that an image other than the one you added the relevant caption to is ranking higher than the one the caption is added to, switch your focus and try to get the other image to rank by working on its caption and de-optimizing the originally optimized image. It's my opinion that an image other than the one you've optimized for ranks well when it's got many backlinks pointing at it, mainly from Pinterest. You could also alternatively do an image search before you optimise your images to find out which of your images ranks best and work on that one directly. But all things being equal (no links to any images etc.) the first image should rank the best. So keep this in mind when writing new hubs. It is therefore wise to make your first image a made for Pinterest (MFP) image. An MFP image is a good image to have in a snippet (see my yellow tomato leaves image) and it has the potential to get you shares on Pinterest, thereby helping it rank better and eventually getting you that snippet. Finally, it's been observed that the image in the search snippet is from that image that ranks first on Google images provided the web-page the image belongs to ranks on the first page of the search results for the regular (not image) search of the same phrase. If that website is not on the first page, the second image shows on the snippet and so on. Very often the search snippet has a heading, whether it is a table or just text and an image. This heading is taken from the article and it's usually got the keywords in there. If you look at the screenshots above you can see the following headings show: ""My Best Wall Mount Range Hoods Compared"" and ""Natural Termite Control"". Therefore, when researching your competition to try and out beat them for the search snippet, check out the heading that is ranking and the kind of text under this heading. Does the article directly go into bullet points below the heading, maybe a table or do they have a short paragraph and then a bullet list? Is their keyword in the paragraph that follows this heading that Google is picking up on? With all of these things, you're trying to emulate and not copy your competition. Google treats every phrase differently, that's why it's a smart algorithm. You are not trying to copy your competition when you are studying them, you are just trying to understand the kind of content Google wishes to see for the particular search term. I intend on heavily editing my hub titled: ""How to Get Rid of Termites Naturally"" and before I edit it, I saved a copy of this page on the way back machine so that future readers can also see what the hub looked like, else the following example will make no sense in the future. The following is going to be a series of statements on the changes I intend to make and why I choose to make them. The logic behind every change has already been explained above. This serves as a tutorial based on the lessons learned above. It would be a wise decision to check out this hub and think for yourself on the kind of changes you would have made and then compare it with my decisions. I will not be making any changes to the title of the article at this moment as both of my main keywords appear in the URL and title respectively. My main keywords are: One day after I have re-written the hub and make it the best termite treatment resource on the internet for natural termite extermination, I would add a number to the title to serve as clickbait. People are more likely to notice it when it stands out, and numbers do stand out. I would want to retain my main keyword, so I would probably go with something on these lines: How to Get Rid of Termites Naturally (6 Ways to Kill Them). This is a really good title in my opinion because it's got my main keyword and it also includes the word kill. The word kill is present in a few secondary keywords I am targetting, a small list of some of my chosen keywords are found right at the top of this article. Other than having the right words and being grammatically right, this one uses parenthesis and numbers, both serve well for the title to stand out. For a discussion on when and how to use parenthesis in your titles, check out this forum thread. Lastly, it's 58 characters and would show completely on search without being truncated. You were convinced that it was a really good title, weren't you? Of course, it's a good title. But is it the best I could come up with? Nope! I have an even better title here: How to Get Rid of Termites Naturally (6 Ways to Do It Yourself). Before you see my explanation below, take a minute to think of some reasons on why this could be better. Let me now list out the reasons: For more tips on how you can improve the title of your article, check out this hub. The next thing I would do is include a table of contents. I contacted Robin regarding their acceptance of table of contents after we (a few hubbers) had a discussion on the forums regarding the same. This is what she said: It is absolutely fine to add a linked TOC. Ideally, we would have a feature for this. — Robin Edmondson That's not her entire reply, she went on to say that they are super busy with the Maven acquisition and we all know that there are many other things they plan on working on. So this may not be a feature any time soon. She did add in a word of caution though, she says that if you do this manually for all your hubs you would have to work on all of them again to remove it if they ever add a feature for this. I would, therefore, suggest you create a new text capsule for your TOC so that you can easily delete it if it ever comes to that. You could easily delete 60 TOC from 60 hubs in an hour, conservatively speaking if you can delete an entire text capsule without thinking twice. I personally would, therefore, choose to include a table of contents on all my hubs (when applicable) as there are quite a few benefits to having one in there. Of course, only add one when it adds value to the reader. When you do this to help your reader you can be smart about it and make sure it adds SEO value too. This is what I see for the term ""get rid of termites naturally"" today the 15th of June 2018. Below the top two results (indicated by the leftward pointing red arrows) are sub-links below the meta description. All of these links are extracted from the table of contents. Only the first two results on this page showed these links and just these two pages have a table of contents on their pages - coincidence? I don't think so. Also, you can see that the second article has a jump to ""Natural Termite Control"" link before the meta description. The first article does not have any link in its table of contents that links out to natural termite control or killing termites naturally, because the entire article talks about it as indicated by the title. So there is no jump to option. This is a great way to get highlighted for your secondary keywords. Finally, notice that pesthow.com has the featured snippet. They have a link in their table of contents that takes me to the section Natural Termite Control. Google understands this very well and therefore this page ranks on the snippet and not the website killtermitesguide.com for this search term. So, are table of contents underrated by most writers seeking an audience from search engines? Yes! It's no surprise that Wikipedia one of the most visited websites has a table of contents on every page. They are very helpful in many ways. Just having a table of contents is not going to help you if you don't know how to write one that is SEO friendly. Here's how you do it: Of course, this is just me trying to give you a quick intro into the best TOC. The image below is a TOC on one of my hubs. An example table of contents on HubPages I just noticed that most of the images in this hub do not have image captions and therefore they do not have image alt tags. It is therefore not a surprise that I do not rank on the snippet with an image from my hub. I would therefore, think of good figure captions such that my main keywords are in the caption of the first image. I did a quick search on Google images to see which of my images is doing best, as I would prefer to use that one and add the keyword based caption to that image. Since I couldn't easily find any of my images for the term ""get rid of termites"" I decided to narrow down my search to just the dengarden website on Google images. I did this using the following search string: site:dengarden.com get rid of termites I noticed that the image with Noah and the ark ranks the best. However, I intend to delete that image as I don't see a lot of Pinterest traffic to this hub because of this image (the reason I added it). Also, if this image shows up on the snippet it won't compel people to click, unlike the image on my hub that discusses yellow tomato leaves. Therefore, I would delete this image and replace it with a better image that would make people want to click on it in case it shows up on the snippet. I would definitely do my keyword research again and structure the article based on my keyword research keeping in mind all the points discussed here. Also, I will make sure that I retain an ordered (numbered) list as Google shows an ordered list on the search snippet from pesthow.com even though they have an unordered list on their website. It is not common that Google changes the kind of list. This is a good indication that Google expects to see something on the lines of ""steps to exterminate termites naturally"" I would read through the first 20 results for every keyword I am looking to rank for (as discussed in this article) and include new points when applicable. For instance, I would write about orange peel, I heard that's good. I'm sure some websites talk about it too and I should come across this when I look into the top 20 websites for this term. It's not always your main keyword that ranks well and gets the search snippet. It is therefore wise to check out your secondary keywords too. I have the snippet for ""natural termite control"". My image of Noah ranks #43 on Google images when I looked, but the top 42 images do not come from any website ranking in the top 10 results for this term, whereas Dengarden ranks #3 for this term. Note: This is before I have edited the hub keeping in mind the points I just listed for the edit of this hub. I have the snippet for natural termite control, today the 16th of June 2018. This is before I edit the hub to make it the best. I am browsing privately, for those of you wondering. Now that I have explained the methods I use, I think it is necessary that I prove that they actually work. If you do read the suggestions and techniques, it's pretty obvious that they would help, but for the skeptics out there and for those interested in seeing some numbers, below are a few results that I have obtained. This article on Dengarden was the first article that I worked on with the sole purpose of increasing its traffic. I began making some edits to this hub sometime mid-January if I remember right, and as seen from the date of this post on the forums. You may also be interested in this follow-up thread keeping track of ranking changes to certain keywords I had an eye on. It is clear from these threads that I only worked on increasing the rankings of a few keywords (7 keywords), but thanks to the improvement of the article in general, some other terms also saw an increase in ranking (I kept track of 14 keywords in total). I must admit that this hub is still far from being the best. I got a big checklist of things to do on this hub, right from re-structuring, adding a table of contents and of course adding new information to expand on certain sections. But according to SEMRush, I rank #1 for every term I would want to rank for, there are no ranking improvements I can get for this hub. I just need to steal the snippet now. Rankings take a while to stabilize after on-page changes have been made. From experience, this can take anywhere between 2 weeks to 2 months on average. Therefore, I have waited 2 months before I began writing this guide. Since the results have stabilized over the past month, with no significant changes, I am comparing the organic traffic of March 2018 with that of March 2017. An increase of 388.07% is seen thanks to the addition of a little helpful information to the hub. 388.07% increase in organic traffic, March 1st to 27th 2017 vs March 1st to 27th 2018 Google Analytics Note: These are winter and early spring comparisons. I expect this to increase significantly, maybe around a 500% increases in summer 2018 compared to summer 2017 as that is the peak season for most gardening hubs. P.S: Keep in mind that there was also a very important Google update on March 12th, which has helped most of the niche sites. Using data from SEMRush some niche sites have seen increases of around 20 - 50%. It is safe to assume that the overall increase is around 7 -10% considering this post on TheMaven, that shows the unique visits to the network would grow by a forecasted 10% in March when compared to the time Maven and HubPages merged. This update by Google has also definitely helped my hub, but, when you compare 388% on this hub with the average of 10% across the network it is clear that I've done something right. Clarification: I am comparing my organic traffic with forecasted unique visitors, but this is not a problem as most people come to this hub via search only once and are therefore unique visitors. The methods mentioned here do not just work on HubPages but can be extended to your own websites and blogs. I worked on a single page of my website using the techniques outlined in this guide, and that page saw a 421.48% increase in organic traffic comparing January 1st - March 27th, 2018 vs the same date range in 2017. The website has otherwise been idle and I have not made any other changes to it during the entire year. 421.48% increase in Organic traffic on a single page of my website, after implementing these kind of changes, comparing traffic from January - March 27th 2018 vs January - March 27th 2018. Google Analytics Brandon Lobo (author) on April 18, 2020: They apply across the board. Robert Sacchi on April 18, 2020: Thank you for posting.  There is a lot of information to absorb here.  Would these URL tips apply in general or are they mostly for DIY articles? Peony on May 31, 2019: Hmm.. I didn't, but thanks anyway Brandon! Brandon Lobo (author) on May 30, 2019: You probably added a TOC for every single capsule and not just the ones you really need. Peony on May 30, 2019: Thank you for this very informative and helpful article! I was reformatting some of my hubs - they tend to be quite long - by adding a table of contents (following how you suggested). While the hub score increased after I've added the TOC, the hub editors decided to remove all of the TOCs I added shortly after. Any ideas why? ): Brandon Lobo (author) on April 09, 2019: @Siny, yes, Uber Suggest is a pretty good free tool out there. @Farrah, internal linking is key on any website, the fact that HP does not do it is why you would want to do it yourself. Good luck and thanks for writing in. Farrah Young from Lagos, Nigeria on April 08, 2019: If i didnt learn anything from this hub, I learnt about internal linking to combat keyword cannibalization. Thanks for this very detailed post, Brandon. Enjoyed the read. Jacob from Delhi, India on December 02, 2018: Uber suggest is a good tool.  I like it.  Thanks for sharing it with us. Brandon Lobo (author) on November 12, 2018: Happy to help Khal, good luck with your articles. Khal Rasdam from Penang but occasionally traveling. on November 12, 2018: Thanks Brandon especially on effectively using keyword research, creating an URL, structuring an article, and word count. You can find articles about the four areas mentioned here and there from the web. However, you put it in one article and connected the dots for me. Your article is a BIG HELP for my future articles and updating my older articles. Thanks again! Brandon Lobo (author) on November 04, 2018: Thanks for the feedback Lisa. Lisa from Central USA on November 03, 2018: Amazing article! I have saved this and  going to follow all these ideas when updating and adding another. Very informative and very detailed. Ellison Hartley from Maryland, USA on October 16, 2018: Thank you! Miebakagh Fiberesima from Port Harcourt, Rivers State, NIGERIA. on October 15, 2018: Hi, Ellison, you are welcomed. Have a nice time on HubPages. Ellison Hartley from Maryland, USA on October 15, 2018: Thanks so much for the link, I appreciate it! Miebakagh Fiberesima from Port Harcourt, Rivers State, NIGERIA. on October 14, 2018: Hello, Ellison, I join Brandon in welcoming you to the world of online writing. You'll find it hard but take thing easy. Read and learn. May I introduced you to the HubPages learning center https://hubpageshelp.com/ You will find all that will make your writing a success. Good luck, and thank you. Brandon Lobo (author) on October 14, 2018: Welcome to the world of online writing Ellison. Good luck! Ellison Hartley from Maryland, USA on October 13, 2018: What a great resource! I'm new to the whole online writing thing and I think I produce good content, but I have a ton to learn about how to get more traffic. I will figure it out one of these days, I will definitely use this article as a reference though! Brandon Lobo (author) on September 30, 2018: You're welcome Shannon Shannon Williams from Davisville, WV on September 30, 2018: Thank you so much!  I know this will be very helpful! Brandon Lobo (author) on September 28, 2018: Nice :) You're welcome. Good luck getting that new article moved to a niche site. Miebakagh Fiberesima from Port Harcourt, Rivers State, NIGERIA. on September 28, 2018: @Brando, I've studied the table of content as you depict it in and check the Wikipedia table of content also. Now, I understand the question. I recently finished a new hub, and I am in the process of reviewing it for correcting grammar, spelling, sentence structures, and punctuations. Although I've been studying how to handle the title and keyword, I will now incorporate the table of content in the new hub. Thanks for your tutorial. Victoria Van Ness from Fountain, CO on September 27, 2018: Thank you!! I have been struggling to figure out Google Analytics. I'll go back and check the section you mentioned. I must have missed it. Brandon Lobo (author) on September 21, 2018: @Victoria, I did include a link to another hub that explains how you create a table of contents, it's under the section ""Writing a Good Table of Contents"" I use Google Analytics and SEMRush and a regular incognito search of the terms I want to rank for to check rankings and stats. Brandon Lobo (author) on September 21, 2018: Thanks, RTalloni for taking the time to comment. Feel free to ask questions if you've got any. RTalloni on September 20, 2018: Thanks so much. Will have to reread at least a couple of times to absorb it all but the very first read gave me info to use. Appreciate that you share info and experience. Victoria Van Ness from Fountain, CO on September 19, 2018: Thank you! That was a very thorough article but I didn't see anywhere how to create a linked table of contents. How do you get your toc to jump to different sections of your article? And then also, how are you seeing all of this ranking stuff. I thought I knew SEO, but now I feel like such a beginner. Brandon Lobo (author) on August 20, 2018: Hey Sherry, thanks for writing in. Welcome back. I was away for exactly 2 months too, immediately after writing this hub. Sherry Haynes on August 20, 2018: Brandon, this is a very helpful hub. Being away from HP for two months I missed many updates including this one. Thankfully, I got to read it today. Great work! Brandon Lobo (author) on July 30, 2018: Thanks for the feedback Natalie. I'll keep adding to it and making updates when applicable. I'll post a comment whenever I update it so that people following it know about the update. Natalie Frank from Chicago, IL on July 30, 2018: I keep coming back to this article for help over and over.  It's such a wealth of information! Miebakagh Fiberesima from Port Harcourt, Rivers State, NIGERIA. on July 18, 2018: Hi all, this hub is awesome as it is still trending. Many thanks to brandon. Brandon Lobo (author) on July 14, 2018: Okay perfect :) Dr Mark from The Atlantic Rain Forest, Brazil on July 13, 2018: No, it was very clear. You linked to Glenn´s article so that is what I used to make my TOC. Brandon Lobo (author) on July 12, 2018: Nice. It's good to know that the editors also make this change. Wasn't it made clear in my article that a table of contents must be linked to the relevant section? If not I need to go through it again. Dr Mark from The Atlantic Rain Forest, Brazil on July 12, 2018: It was moved over to Pethelpful today, and the editor agreed with you since she put my FAQ into a numbered list (but still hyperlinked within the article as explained in Glenn´s article). I do not want to change it since her editing has improved so many of my articles. Brandon Lobo (author) on July 11, 2018: Cool, looking forward to knowing how you rank for those. Dr Mark from The Atlantic Rain Forest, Brazil on July 11, 2018: Looking back, as we are always so prone to do, I think I could have used the questions as subtitles and then used a numbered TOC like you suggested. I went ahead and published yesterday anyway with the questions as my TOC. I will let you know how this works out. Miebakagh Fiberesima from Port Harcourt, Rivers State, NIGERIA. on July 11, 2018: Okay, Lobobrandon. Welcome back. Brandon Lobo (author) on July 11, 2018: Thanks for the comments everyone, I couldn't reply to everyone individually while I was on vacation. I did, however, try and reply to anyone who asked specific questions. If I did miss out on a question, feel free to ask again :) Brandon Lobo (author) on July 11, 2018: In your case it won't be right to have a numbered TOC. But, as I mentioned in the article, as of now, Google only seems to be using numbered TOC's as sub-links before the meta description, etc. I would have a regular TOC with a bullet list if I were writing a hub such as the one you mention. Dr Mark from The Atlantic Rain Forest, Brazil on July 08, 2018: Hmmm, I wish I had a special Batphone with a red hotline to Google! I would have so may questions. I was curious about the numbers because I read one of Glen´s articles without a numbered TOS, and the current TOS I am working on is a series of questions (and the answers are in individual capsules deeper down in the article) that may not lend itself to being numbered. A reader could ask their question in search, Google would show them my article, then they could click on the internal hyperlink at the top of my article and jump right to the info they are looking for. What do you think? Geri McClymont on July 05, 2018: This is so helpful and thank you for writing it, Brandon! I have already bookmarked it so I can read it in chunks. I just finished reading the first chunk and am looking forward to reading the rest. Brandon Lobo (author) on July 01, 2018: @Dr Mark. That's a question you need to ask Google :) its just what works best based on statistics. Dr Mark from The Atlantic Rain Forest, Brazil on July 01, 2018: Why does the TOC always have to be a numbered list? Miebakagh Fiberesima from Port Harcourt, Rivers State, NIGERIA. on June 30, 2018: Hi,nomadspirit. no writer on HubPages will like to ignore such excellent practical tutorials. I am still thankful I read the story. It's a great help. Brandon Lobo (author) on June 29, 2018: Hey Jeff I can imagine it was a long read. You're welcome. Brandon Lobo (author) on June 29, 2018: Nice to hear that Eric. Good luck! Eric Farmer from Rockford Illinois on June 29, 2018: Thanks for the guide. Some of the things you mention are concepts I thought of using, but I never could think of a good way to do so. This guide is a neat structure I can follow, and I will use this to try to write better hubs in the future. J Zod from Nairobi on June 29, 2018: Hi Brandon, This is quite a hefty read but worth every minute.I have gained precious insights from the article.Thanks. Brandon Lobo (author) on June 28, 2018: Thanks for the feedback Glenn. I do not disagree with you on what you say regarding the QnA bounce rate etc. I'm just pointing out that keyword cannibalization is a thing when using the QnA feature. If you know how to change the keywords etc. it's no issue and can be a good thing. But most people don't realise this.  Personally I prefer to target synonyms through my hub and not through the QnA feature. Amelia Griggs from U.S. on June 28, 2018: Wow, great job with this guide BrandonI I bookmarked and will be returning to reference it since it’s packed with so much helpful information! Thanks. Rosheda Stephenson on June 28, 2018: Thanks and thanks again. This is just what many writers who wish they knew the technicalities of SEO need. I will be studying this for the next month. Thanks for being your usual helpful self Miebakagh Fiberesima from Port Harcourt, Rivers State, NIGERIA. on June 28, 2018: Hi Kierstin, good to know. I will re-read where a table of content is necessary. That can improve my hub traffic. FlourishAnyway from USA on June 28, 2018: Wow, we should all bow down before your incredible expertise.  I appreciated reading this and learned a lot.  Awesome! Kierstin Gunsberg from Traverse City, Michigan on June 28, 2018: Brandon, you're so smart! Thanks for writing this - I can't wait to read it all of the way through and I'm going to start putting a table of contents into all of my already-published hubs now. Grant Handford from Canada on June 26, 2018: Yeowza now there is some thorough information on SEO for Hubs. I can't wait to read the whole thing more thoroughly. I just said thorough two times oh wait three times. :) Glenn Stok from Long Island, NY on June 20, 2018: Great work Brandon! I see people complain a lot on the forums that they have to always make changes. They think they can write it and forget it. But you made it clear, right up front, that writing online content is not a passive business. I’ve been always working on older hubs to keep up with the latest requirements imposed by Google. Your guide is a great reminder of the things that can help improve SEO of our hubs. It’s a guide to a process that everyone should use and reference more than once. I know I will. You are proof that the process you describe actually works, and works well, because you have over a million views on just a handful of articles. Now, I have a few comments: On the topic of the Q&A, you talked about keyword cannibalization by answering questions already discussed. I have answered such questions, but in order to avoid the cannibalization issue, I have always answered in a different way, and with different keywords, than the way I wrote the content in the original article. I have to disagree with what you said about not helping lazy people. The redundancy can work in our favor if we do it right. We just have to be careful not to use the same keywords in the Q&A. Here’s my experience . . . I get more traffic coming from the Q&A to the main article. I see this in my Google Analytics, which shows me zero bounce rate on many Q&A. I never saw zero bounce rate one any hubs! A zero bounce indicates that people are not returning to the SERPs. They either have been satisfied with the answer, or they have been clicking on the link to the article after reading the Q&A answer. GA Behavior Flow shows me that 75% of the people follow the link from Q&A to the hub. I do agree with you about the problem that some people write Q&A answers in a low quality style, and that they don’t change the question text to avoid keyword duplication with the main article. Those pages can hurt us, especially being that they are on the niche sites. It’s important to improve the text of the question when answering them. I’ve been working my way through your guide the last few days, and made some changes to a few hubs with better main images with improved captions for Pinterest and for Google images. Thanks for bringing that to my attention. Brandon Lobo (author) on June 20, 2018: Hey Liz, all of us have been there as you can see from the really bad URL I have in one of my examples. I'm happy the guide was of use and good luck working on your hubs. Liz Westwood from UK on June 20, 2018: This is an incredibly useful article and one which, as a relatively new hubber, I shall refer back to in the future.  I had written more than one article before I realised that the URL is taken from the initial draft article.  I live and learn! Brandon Lobo (author) on June 19, 2018: Thanks for the feedback and appreciation Krzysztof. I can imagine that it's quite a read. Just reading through it to edit it took like 2 hours or so. Good luck working on the hubs you want to revamp. I hope you can put this guide to good use. Krzysztof Willman from Parlin, New Jersey on June 19, 2018: Wow that was quite a read, so much information to take in with topics I've never even thought about. I'm currently trying to revamp many of my hubs and this is a great tool to look back on. It would be wise for any Hubber to read this guide. Brandon Lobo (author) on June 18, 2018: Hi Arby, glad you found the hub. You do have some really good hub titles, many How - To's they usually do well if you follow the method I outlined. Yes, HP has gone a long way and the niche sites are really good. You should definitely work on getting all your hubs moved to the niche sites as that is where you will do well. Having a hub on HubPages does not really bring in any traffic. If you ever have questions in the future when you re-read the hub, feel free to ask. Good luck and welcome back to HP. Brandon Lobo (author) on June 18, 2018: Hey Leland, luck does play a huge part when you write online because there are always chances of a great article, one that is very well optimised for search engines does not rank, just because the competition gets a lot of backlinks. If you have any specific questions feel free to write a comment again and I'll do my best to clarify it. If you've got hubs that are already doing well, it's best to begin working on those articles as they have the potential to get even more traffic. Good luck. Arby Bourne from USA on June 17, 2018: I came here after peeking in on your thread in the forums. Thank you so much for taking the time to put this together! I used to dabble with hubs many years ago and decided to check back in recently. I like what has happened in my absence, and am working on overhauling all of my old hubs (or at least the ones worth doing that with) before I move on to creating some new ones. I can't understate how helpful this information has been. I've bookmarked this hub as I'm sure I'll be returning for reference many times. Again, thank you! Leland Johnson from Midland MI on June 17, 2018: Brandon- Excellent article, but I'm having trouble wrapping my head around it.  I wish we could sit down and have you explain it to me.  I'll read the article again and visit the sites you recommend.  It seems like my highly trafficked hubs are merely a result of luck. Brandon Lobo (author) on June 17, 2018: Katy, I'm glad you found it useful. Yes, with strong niche sites it is very easy, relatively speaking to rank for medium competition keywords. Many people do not take into account keyword cannibalization, that's a big mistake in my opinion. Yeah, it was an eye opener realizing that lengthy hubs covering many sub-topics does not rank as well as I expected it to. So word count is not as much a positive factor as I had imagined. Katy Medium from Denver, CO on June 17, 2018: Brandon, this is a very useful guide! I learned a lot of new ideas to implement. That's on top of the wisdom I've gleaned from your comments and others' on the forums. Some good cautions on keyword cannibalization. I often overlook that. Also an interesting insight into Google not ranking an all-in-one authority site for its sub-keywords. I agree that eventually it will be smart enough. But it's good to know that it's not worth writing articles structured like that yet. For me personally this guide shows its possible to get hubs ranked well for any niche subject I'm expert enough to write on, I think that's pretty amazing! Rex on June 16, 2018: Great stuff! I'm no beginner writer, having done political advocacy letters, call script writing, and blog posts for various platforms. However, my SEO skills are not where I want them to be.  I'm digging into this heavily now and think this guide will prove useful for many writers like myself. Thanks for the thorough explanation on your thought processes. It takes some of the mystery out of it for me. I'll be referring back to this. Brandon Lobo (author) on June 16, 2018: Thanks for the feedback Robie, glad you found it useful. Brandon Lobo (author) on June 16, 2018: Hey Dr Mark, at those traffic stats I would definitely just begin a new hub on a better URL and work on getting it moved to a niche site and eventually it would get a lot more traffic than 10 a month. Also, when you start with a new URL other than the obvious benefits, it would directly be considered for a niche site. There are no downsides of featured snippets, just that if you don't own it, you are losing out on a lot of potential traffic. Featured snippets do at times answer the users query and therefore they have no need to read your hub, but I would rather have it and lose some traffic than not have it and lose even more. Yup, it's a lot of work no doubt about that :) Dr Mark from The Atlantic Rain Forest, Brazil on June 16, 2018: One of my hubs still on HP main site has a poor URL; the keyword only gets about 10 searches per month. The hub almost always has 0 page views per day. In order to get the article moved to a niche site, I will need to do a lot of editing and add more info. I am wondering if you think it would be better to just delete the article (since it is not even on a niche site yet) and start with a new and more useful/popular URL? I could then add the info from this old hub to the new hub. Interesting article. What do you think of the downside of the featured snippets? It is always best to steal the snippet? Thanks for all of the hard work. As always you have provided us all  a lot to work with. Miebakagh Fiberesima from Port Harcourt, Rivers State, NIGERIA. on June 16, 2018: Hi all, no serious hubber can neglect such a useful guide. Robie Benve from Ohio on June 16, 2018: Thanks a lot for putting in the time to write this guide! Lots of great stuff! Brandon Lobo (author) on June 16, 2018: Hi Venkat, glad you found it useful. You're welcome. Venkatachari M from Hyderabad, India on June 16, 2018: Brandon, this is a wonderful guide. Very useful and informative with deep analysis of the entire process. I need to visit it many times to digest everything. Thanks a lot. Reginald Thomas from Connecticut on June 16, 2018: Thank you! Brandon Lobo (author) on June 16, 2018: Hey Reginald, all you need to do is pick the hub that is doing the best and work on it to make it better. If it's already getting a little traffic from Google you can get a lot more with a little focused hard work. Miebakagh Fiberesima from Port Harcourt, Rivers State, NIGERIA. on June 16, 2018: Hi, Brando Lobo, thanks. Reginald Thomas from Connecticut on June 16, 2018: Hi Brandon What a great article you wrote. Great information that I really appreciate and will use to build on my education of blogging and writing articles. Presently, I can only see between 10 - 20 views daily and need to find ways to increase the traffic to my posts. Brandon Lobo (author) on June 16, 2018: That's cool. Miebakagh Fiberesima from Port Harcourt, Rivers State, NIGERIA. on June 16, 2018: Hi Brandon, I have begun to put your suggestions into action. I am at the moment editing one of my hubs. Thanks for responding this soon. Brandon Lobo (author) on June 16, 2018: Hi Miebakagh, you're welcome and good luck. Miebakagh Fiberesima from Port Harcourt, Rivers State, NIGERIA. on June 16, 2018: Hi Brandon, very interesting and information article. I wil limplement the suggestions."
35,"How To ""Tweak"" An Online Article",community," Sharilee has been writing online for four years, starting with Hubpages. She now has several blogs and websites. Did you know that tweaking your hubs is a great privilege? Many, if not most, writing platforms will not allow you to keep making changes. Think of your morning newspaper. Does the reporter get to fix a spelling mistake once it goes to print? No, and a big apology is usually printed the next day if errors occur! Being able to edit and improve your own work without any hassle or difficulty is one of the most desirable features of Hubpages. A wise hubber will take advantage of it. Tweaking your hubs allows you to make continual improvements and to do endless experimenting. If a hub does not appear to be working, try something else. What exactly does ""tweaking"" mean? The dictionary says that to “tweak” is to: a)to pinch and pull with a sudden jerk and twist b) to make usually small adjustments in c) annoy or bother or to d) injure slightly. So, tweaking implies small improvements and it sometimes involves a bit of annoyance and pain. And yes, tweaking can be a bit annoying because it takes time: time that might seem to be better spent writing something new. And it might hurt a little because it feels like you are never done. But it's worth it in the end.  Writing online is a very complex process. Keywords and SEO concerns are added unto the old concerns of writing: grammar, organization and style. So many factors need to be considered when pursuing success for your online work. Tweaking is a process where you make improvements on your hubs. It is an ongoing process and it is a good idea to review your hubs on a regular basis to assess what is working and might be changed. What follows are ten good ideas for tweaking your hubs. Some of these suggestions are for beginners just new to hubbing and others might be new even to the more experienced writers on Hubpages. These are all techniques that I have used myself and have learned from my time here on this site.  Edit your hub for A+ Results. The first suggestion is obvious but necessary. Of course, we should all edit our work thoroughly before we publish but the casualness of Hubpages means that you can go back and change afterwards. Take advantage of this feature! So read your work over after it is published. Sometimes we just don't catch all the errors. It's easy to do. So keep reading your work after it's published just in case. I know grammar very well but I get in a hurry sometimes and hit publish before it's done. It's so exciting to get my stuff out there that I neglect to go back and do the final edit. If you ever do the same, be sure to go back and check the hubs afterwards.  Reorganizing your content can make it easier to read. Again, it would be good to make all these adjustments before you publish but sometimes we want to get the information out there. Later on, we think of ways that the information could be organized more effectively. What do I mean by reorganize your content? This might be changing the sequence that you present your information or arguments to make a stronger point. Perhaps you notice that your middle point is actually the strongest point: maybe move that point to be the last. I have done this in my own hubs and found that the whole article flows better. As well, you might want to break up some of the text capsules into two or more capsules instead. Use your cut and paste feature to move text from the first text capsule to the new one. The advantage of doing this is that you will be able to break up the text and control your layout more carefully. Remember that readers of online content do not like to read too much at one time. Breaking up the content into different capsules allows you to add white space or dividers (covered next) or images. Just to give an example, I started out this hub with three points per capsule. After looking at it in preview mode, however, I realized that one point per capsule would be more effective and allow me to elaborate on each point I needed to.  Adding new information to a hub, or taking out old information, keeps the freshness of the hub. This is the exciting thing about Hubpages: it allows you to do this and to keep your articles current. This means that articles can have a lot longer shelf life than those that never change. An example of this might be a news story that you wrote about. If there are significant developments in the story, you might want to add an update at the bottom or work the new content into the body of the hub. A recent example of mine was an article I wrote about Give Away Weekend, a recycling event that happens in Winnipeg, Canada. The event happens twice a year. So this year, I had to go back and change the dates of when the next one is taking place. I then placed the hub on Facebook and have received a fair bit of local traffic from the hub. This was a small tweak but very worthwhile. Look at your own hubs with an eye for currency and you might find some small changes that you can make.  Certain hubs are written for one time of year. Christmas gift hubs are the most obvious examples. I have several hubs written for Christmas gifts. Since Christmas comes but once a year, I changed those hubs to read “gifts” instead of “Christmas gifts.” Since Christmas is coming again soon, I will need to go over and switch those hubs back to be exclusively Christmas gifts hubs. Be creative in thinking about how you might make a couple of changes to be able to get some use out of these seasonal hubs.  The capsules are designed to give you the best possible layout. There are many possibilities. Play around with the different capsules by using the up and down arrows to see what is most attractive and flows the best. You can also move capsules using the layout bar on the right side of the hub in editing mode. Pressing the preview button while in editing mode will allow you to see how these different layouts actually look.  Here a few pointers about layout.   If your hub does not a video, consider finding one for it. Adding a video means that you have also created an unseen backlink for your hub, embedded on the video itself. You can find videos on YouTube about almost everything under the sun. The video gives your hub more of a modern edge, too, and appeals to the internet generation. Of course, vidoes are not appropriate for every hub. You must use your discretion with all of these suggestions to see if it works for your particular piece of writing.  One of the wonderful things about Hubpages is the ability to create a visually stunning article, that looks good, as well as sounds good. Adding white space can make your article more attractive. Every hubber has their own style of publishing and so this won't work for everyone but it is something to consider. How to add white space? Press enter several times after a section of writng or at the end of your text capsule. This creates space between your sections and can make the hub easier to read.  Dividers are another way of breaking up a hub. They separate one section from the next and provide some visual interest as well. There are several websites that offer free dividers of various styles and colours. I have a few that I tend to use and try to make the divider fit the style of the hub. You might not want to use dividers if you are just typing up a quick hub but with the longer pieces, they can make it easier to read. It is important to remember that reading on the web is different than reading a book because people have to stare a screen. Dividers help make that process easier.  EDIT: August 21, 2014: Since writing this hub, hubpages has discouraged writers from putting dividers into their hubs. I still do use them, myself, but I can no longer encourage other writers to do so. Thank you to Silus Grok for use of this photo Flickr.com This point will apply to those who are trying to make money from their hubs. If you would like to make some money off this hub, it is good to adjust your Amazon capsule placements from time to time. What do I mean by that? First of all, if a hub is getting a lot of traffic but no Google clicks, consider placing Amazon on there if it is appropriate. Amazon is best placed on hubs that sell or feature some kind of product because Amazon sells products. Amazon does not work that well for strictly idea hubs. Secondly, if you are not getting Amazon love, consider taking it off. You don't have to completely remove it but push the ""Don't display button:"" Sometimes taking Amazon ads off will actually put more focus on the Hubpages and Google advertisements. And finally, if you are not getting any Amazon revenue, consider changing the placement of your Amazon capsules. You can put them at the side of your text, at the bottom of the hub, or between text capsules. Try different layout to see what is most effective.  Just recently, Hubpages added a new feature in which they notify writers when their hubs do not have a summary. Consequently, many hubbers have been frantically going to their hubs and placing them in. For the last couple of weeks, I have been putting in summaries in many of my hubs that did not have them. I am not finished yet but I did notice an improvement in traffic on the hubs where I placed the summaries. Summaries used to be generated automatically from the first few sentences of a hub. Now, they must be done manually. It's inconvenient but the good part is, we can craft summaries that suit our needs. A summary is something to catch people's interest and should tell what you hub is about. It is a good idea to have some keywords in the summary, too, because Google Search does look at these summaries. I hope these tips have been helpful. Happy tweaking, fellow hubbers!  Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on April 11, 2017: @Gyanendra, I see you have a strong desire to write. Keep working on and you will continue to get better at the language. Have a good day -- congratulations on getting your first one published. I enjoyed your story. gyanendra mocktan from Kathmandu,Nepal on April 06, 2017: Thank you again. My problem is critical. I have not been able to post 5 articles as a beginner should.  Because I was not prepared. thank you. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on April 05, 2017: @Gyanendra, I am glad it was helpful for you. Don't give up on your writing. You are learning and you will get better. Have a wonderful day! gyanendra mocktan from Kathmandu,Nepal on March 27, 2017: Thank you for your valuable information. I;m non-native English speaker.  But not a good writer.  My first article is rejected. But I am not frustrated.  I've tweaked my article today and reposted it. Thank you Kristen Howe from Northeast Ohio on June 24, 2015: You're very welcome. I'll bookmark it for future reference. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on June 24, 2015: @Kristen, I am happy you find it helpful. I was helped by so many kind people when I came to Hubpages, too. Take care! Kristen Howe from Northeast Ohio on June 20, 2015: Great tips on how to tweak your hubs. I would keep this in mind every time I edit or update a hub.  Voted up for useful! Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on November 11, 2014: @Misslong123, I know it's been quite a while since you wrote this comment, and sorry for the long delay in responding. But I just wanted to thank you for your kind words. I am so glad that it was helpful to you, in tweaking your own work. So glad I could be useful! Take care and have  a wonderful day. Michele Kelsey from Edmond, Oklahoma on October 10, 2013: Just wanted to let you know that once again I studied this great article and took lots of notes. I've been taking a break from writing for a while to concentrating on studying those who I think are great writers. I took very detailed notes on this one, and I hope you don't mind if I use your suggestions in tweaking my own articles. I found them very useful, and you did a really great job of laying out the information in a fun and informative way that was helpful, but kept my attention. I find so many experts out there who just write long paragraphs after paragraphs, and it is really hard for me to distinguish between what is ""fluff"" and what is the good stuff. Thanks again for sharing your knowledge with those of us who are still learning. You are awesome, and I am happy to keep following you! ~Michele Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on April 21, 2013: Misslong, I would be so happy if my article helped you in improving your work. It is a lot to learn when you first start. Welcome to Hubpages and I wish you all the best! Michele Kelsey from Edmond, Oklahoma on April 20, 2013: Thank you so much for your unique insight. I am very much a newbie, and I'm trying to decide what to learn about first. I have written quite a few hubs now that I think are pretty good, but I didn't proof them well, and I did not tweak them in the ways you mentioned. This article really gave me some great notes on what to do next. Thank you so much! Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on October 23, 2012: SJ, yes, that is right. Simply add in the pictures capsule and it will automatically fill the page. Thanks for the comment and have a wonderful night! Amy from Colorado on October 17, 2012: Thanks for the tips. I like the white space and divider ideas. For dividers, do you just add it as if it were a picture? Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on March 14, 2012: M.T., it's a continuous process, isn't it? I surprise myself sometimes with the new life I can put into a hub that seemed like it had everything it needed. Thanks for the great comment! Shasta Matova from USA on March 12, 2012: These are great tips for tweaking your hubs.  I try to go back to my hubs, and often find new ideas or different ways to say something.  Voted up. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on March 11, 2012: Sandra, I am so glad that you were helped with capsule arrangement. Thanks for coming by and commenting! Sandra Busby from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, USA on March 11, 2012: I fouynd the video on arrange the capsules very helpful.  Thanks.  Sandra Busby Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on December 04, 2011: Deborah, it's a pleasure to ""meet"" you. I am so glad this was helpful. I received so much help when I first started and I'm thrilled to be able to help someone else. Welcome to Hubpages! Deborah Brooks Langford from Brownsville,TX on December 04, 2011: I am new on here.. and I want to thank you for all the great advice.. this really helps me to I just bookmarked this one and voted up up up.. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on November 30, 2011: Rajan, yes, that extra space really adds to the look of the hub! I am so glad this was helpful. I have learned so much from other hubbers and am glad to give back. I am so glad that you decided to follow, and I have also followed you, with the intent of looking at your hubs. I love that you talk about the LORD. Take care and blessings! Rajan Singh Jolly from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on November 30, 2011: prairieprincess, this is a wonderful hub with a lot of sensible and practical information. I just put the one on adding white space in between capsules. Though I used to hit enter once I finished writing text for a capsule, now after the enter, I pressed shift and hit enter. This way I got 11/2 times the white space and the hub layout looks much better. Thanks for these wonderful tips. I am adding this hub to the favorites bar so that I can get to it in a jiify when needed. Voted up and awesome. I need to read more of your hubs and so I'm following you. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on October 30, 2011: Aww, thank you, Arlene. I am honoured. You are what I think of a ""true writer"" and I'm so very glad it was helpful. Take care! Arlene V. Poma on October 29, 2011: prairieprincess, it's a wonderful, wonderful surprise, and I am so honored to be part of your well-written Hub.  Thank you so much!  And I do find this Hub very useful as I write, so I've bookmarked it and also keep a copy by my computie.  Keep on writing!  You are a joy to many people here on HubPages. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on October 28, 2011: Arlene, I hope it's a nice surprise! I loved your hub and it inspired me to write this hub, so thank you so much! Take care. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on October 28, 2011: MzLizzy, thanks for such a great comment! Most of my errors are from ""fumble fingers,"" too! I get so excited about what I'm writing that a couple letters get transposed or I use a small i for I, or something! It's so good we can change it. And I think that's right about Google seeing it ""fresh,"" too. Google likes changes, I guess, but just not too many. It's so hard to please, Google, isn't it? As far as videos go, I've wondered about that, too, but the good thing is, that Hubpages is pretty fast-loading. Again, thanks for an awesome comment. Take care! Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on October 28, 2011: Victoria, I was surprised when I heard about the videos, too, but it something that even Hubpages suggests in their guidelines for a ""flagship hub."" The research explained more about why. That's so great that you are already tweaking: we can always use some improvements here and there! Thanks for the great comment. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on October 27, 2011: @Deborah, I am so glad that this was helpful. I have found this community so helpful in general, and I received so much help when I first started. Take care! @Redelf, thanks for stopping by! The white space and dividers do really seem to help in making the content more palatable, don't they? Nice to see you! @Danielle, so good to see you again! Thanks for the comment. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on October 27, 2011: @Nell, thanks so much for dropping by! I am so glad if this was of some use to you. Have a great night! @Stephanie, I know you were one of the people that I learned so much from when I first started here at Hubpages and I am very grateful! Thanks for the comment! @RH, I think we all have some of those that we wonder, ""what was I thinking?"" but it's great to be able to salvage them! I love the ability to edit so  many times! Thanks for the comment. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on October 27, 2011: @SJ, thank you so much for the comment and the votes! It is such a great feature of Hubpages but sometimes we forget to go back and make a few needed changes. Nice to see you! Arlene V. Poma on October 27, 2011: Sneaky girl!  Thank you so much for giving me a plug.  I never would have found out until DzyMsLizzy left me some comments.  You have many fine points here, so I am bookmarking your Hub.  Voted up all across the board.  Thanks, again! Liz Elias from Oakley, CA on October 27, 2011: Hi, there-- What a great set of points you make!  I do tweak, whether to correct typos, because, as you say, we sometimes just get in such a hurry to just finish & 'get it out there,' that small things can be missed. The spell check feature can help, but since I am a confident speller, I don't normally use it--then find I've made a typo and didn't see it.  Usually, those are along the lines of ""..meant to to...""  instead of ""..meant to do...""  Not something the spell-checker catches anyway.  Fumble-fingers--or fingers faster than brain!  LOL I have gone back and tweaked some summaries, made a few changes to layouts or content, but not a lot...however, it does seem to make a difference in traffic.  I THINK what is going on, is that when you make a change, and hit 'done editing,' it is like a 're-publish,' and Google re-crawls it, perhaps sending it higher up the search. ???  That's just a guess... I don't use many videos, and I don't watch too many, either, primarily because I find them annoying for not streaming smoothly: if I have to wait for the thing to continually stop and re-buffer, I decide I've got better things to do with my time. Voted up, interesting & useful. Victoria Lynn from Arkansas, USA on October 27, 2011: prairieprincess--We are so fortunate to be able to tweak, and I do it quite often. I''m anxious to read your links on the importance of videos; I wonder how that brings traffic. Your tips are right on. This is a very helpful hub. Interesting and awesome and voted up, too! Thank you! Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on October 27, 2011: Missolive, thank you so much! Your feedback means a lot to me and I am happy you found this useful. I have learned so much from your hubs and online work, so I'm glad to give back. Wow, you're bookmarking me? Wow, that's an honour! Have a great day. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on October 27, 2011: Dahoglund, I have the feeling that you are not an easy man to sell to! And I mean that in a good way! :) I'm so glad. The design aspect of Hubpages is pretty fun and I think it does draw the reader in. Thanks for the great comment! Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on October 27, 2011: Sinea, I'm glad you found it helpful. Yes, I really like dividers for breaking it up and adding some colour. They are pretty easy to find: one of the easiest place to get them is to look at Office Clipart. And hey, I've never had anyone say they had e-mailed one of my articles to themselves. What a compliment! Thank you and have a wonderful day! Daniella Lopez on October 27, 2011: Awesome hub! Voted up! RedElf from Canada on October 27, 2011: Solid info - I really like your points about white space and borders! Deborah Neyens from Iowa on October 27, 2011: This is an excellent hub.  I am still getting the whole Hubpages thing figured out, and these tips will be very helpful.  Thanks. Kelly Umphenour from St. Louis, MO on October 27, 2011: Hi princess - I have just recently figured this out;) lol. I have been working on some of my earlier ones but you've given me some really fantastic and helpful ideas. I love it!  I don't want to cringe every time I look back at the old ones:). I just didn't know how it worked or what I could get away with - you know! Lol Thanks so much! This is up and everything Stephanie Henkel from USA on October 27, 2011: Your advice about recycling hubs by tweaking seasonal hubs is great!  I'm a big tweaker, and find that adding a bit of new information or changing some layout elements as I learn more about hub crafting has paid off.  You hub is very informative and useful! Nell Rose from England on October 27, 2011: Hi, really good info, and it doesn't hurt all us seasoned hubbers to come back and re-check everything you have said, we do tend to get into bad habits, so I am going to bookmark this and make sure that my bad habits go away! lol thanks! SJmorningsun25 on October 27, 2011: Voted up, useful, and interesting! Thanks for sharing these great ideas. It is a rare privilege to get to change things even after publication, and it's helpful to be reminded to take advantage of it. Wonderful Hub! Thanks for writing. Marisa Hammond Olivares from Texas on October 27, 2011: praireprincess - you've done a great job with this hub. You have included lots of great tips. Thank you for including the layout pointers and video. Very helpful. I'll be bookmarking this one :) Voted up, useful, awesome and interesting! Don A. Hoglund from Wisconsin Rapids on October 27, 2011: I have made changes in hubs when they appear to need it but have not done anything consistently. This is probably because I hve not really got the feel for online style.But you have sold me on the idea that I should do more. Sinea Pies from Northeastern United States on October 27, 2011: Great hub!  I've emailed myself the link to read it indepth on my lunch break. DIVIDERS! I love it. This is a new discovery for me but sounds like fun.  I do tweek my hubs to make them better. That gives me a good excuse to share a pre-enjoyed hub again. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on October 24, 2011: Searchineer, thanks! I appreciate you passing it along. It is fun to ""prettify"" your hubs and this platform is so good for letting us do that. Take care! searchineer from Melbourne on October 24, 2011: @prairie wonderful information... shared it with my content team... (dividers help make the hub easier to read and add some nice colour) I think I have been missing out on this... will try it in my hubs... Tweeted it as well @seachineers Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on October 17, 2011: Ipan, thanks for stopping by! I am glad this information is of some help. Take care. lpanfil from Cleveland, Ohio on October 16, 2011: I am fairly new to Hubpages. As I figure new things out from great hubs like this one, I go back and tweak my hubs. Thanks for paving the way with such useful information. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on October 14, 2011: Azure, thank you so much for your kind comments. I find dividers help make the hub easier to read and add some nice colour. Like you say, they're not great for every hub but seem to add a bit of zest to some. Take care! Marian L from UK on October 11, 2011: Nice hub pp, with some things to think about - you are right, we should be grateful that we are able to change things, I hadn't thought of it like that! I like the idea of dividers, I haven't used them so far so I might try putting some in my longer hubs, thanks. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on September 27, 2011: RTalloni, I am so glad that you could glean some help from this hub. I find that learning on HP never really stops and I've learned so much during my time here. Have a great day! RTalloni on September 27, 2011: Great tips on tweaking our hubs--thanks so much.  Some of this I knew was true, but didn't know why, and knowing why makes a difference in how.  Very good stuff here! Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on September 26, 2011: Peanutrious, thank you. I am so glad that this information was helpful to you. It takes a while to understand everything here but it does get easier. Thanks again and take care! Tara Carbery from Cheshire, UK on September 26, 2011: I found this hub really useful.  I really struggled to use the capsules etc but this makes it very clear. Thanks.  Voted up! Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on September 21, 2011: Tipoague, nice to see you again! Yes, I was glad to see that ""A"" symbol, too, because I had been lax about adding summaries before. I actually do think tweaking helps quite a bit, at least for traffic, if not for revenue. Take care. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on September 21, 2011: Howard, thank you. Coming from you, I take that as a real compliment! I saw from your profile that you have been at this writing business for quite a while and I look forward to reading more of your writing. That's neat that you noticed the similarities, especially about the linguistics. I am kind of a free spirit that's interested in a lot of different things. Thanks for the great comment and nice to meet you! Tammy on September 21, 2011: Terrific point you have made here. I was glad to see the symbol for summaries. It reminded me that there were a few hubs that needed some serious tweaking. I am glad that HP allows us to do this. Thanks for sharing these fine points. Howard S. from Dallas, Texas, and Asia on September 20, 2011: Excellent points, and very readable as well. I am surprised at the number of our common interests and will be following you: Christian education, linguistics, language puzzles, corporate communications, adult education, graphic layout. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on September 20, 2011: @Cloverleaf, thank you! I'm glad you like the layout of the hub and am so glad that you find this article useful for tweaking your hubs. Take care! @prOphet, I am so glad that it is useful. Take care! pr0phet from South Africa on September 20, 2011: Thanks for posting this Hub! It is very handy and informative. Cloverleaf from Calgary, AB, Canada on September 19, 2011: Hi prairieprincess, Thanks so much for sharing your expertise, I am still learning how to tweak my hubs to get the best out of them!  When I did my 30 hub challenge I was so focused on getting them published that now I am trying to optimize and improve them.  I really enjoyed the layout of your hub and so I think you have it perfected!  I am bookmarking this so that I can keep coming back to refer to it and voting UP! Cloverleaf. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on September 18, 2011: @Rochelle, it's so nice that we can always go back and fix things up! Thanks for the great comment. @Ktrapp, I am glad this was helpful. I have learned so much here at HP and wanted to share some of what I've learned. Take care! Kristin Trapp from Illinois on September 14, 2011: Voted UP and useful! This is article is so well put together and thoughtful. I have written my first 20 hubs and have taken a couple weeks to tweak my hubs to get the most out of each of them. I especially like your white space tip. When there is not enough white space or pictures to break up the text I found myself not reading and leaving a hub, unless of course the content is truly gripping. Thanks for your clarity. Rochelle Frank from California Gold Country on September 14, 2011: Yes, I really appreciate this feature. If my hubs are going to pe posted for a long time-- I want them to be the best they can be. I am very mistake prone. Spelling has never been my strongest talent, though I have learned some. I am very glad HP lets us control our hubs. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on September 12, 2011: @Sally, what are you waiting for? Seriously, though, it's not that hard to do this stuff. At first, I was very intimidated by it all but it gets easier! Thanks for the great comment. @Susie, I am glad it was helpful! I'm glad I could pass on some of what I've learned. Take care. Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on September 12, 2011: @Chinemerez, thanks so much for the kind words. I am so glad it was helpful. I wanted to share some of what I have learned here at Hubpages. @Kashmir, thanks for the vote of confidence and support. I hope it is useful for some people. Take care! @wba, I have finished all of my summaries yet either but I noticed an almost immediate rise in traffic when I did (and not just from me reading the hub, either!) As far as SEO goes, there is a lot to learn but every bit helps. Take care! SusieQ42 on September 12, 2011: Excellent information!  I will more than likely come back and read this again. Thank you! Truckstop Sally on September 11, 2011: Thanks for your pointers.  I do find typos or just awkward phrases in my hubs, and i am grateful for the opportunity to revise them.  I must admit, I don't subscribe to adsense or the other sources you mention. I need to figure that out. wba108@yahoo.com from upstate, NY on September 11, 2011: Hi prairieprincess - Great suggestions! I think I'll take your idea and do those summaries. I have alot to learn about layouts, SEO and keywords. Thanks again for the great information!- WBA Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on September 11, 2011: HBNurse, thank you so much. Yes, that is a good point. It's also a good idea to ping your hub after you update it. Thanks for the wonderful comment! Gail Sobotkin from South Carolina on September 11, 2011: I love the way you layed out this hub and the way you view tweaking as a privilege. Your suggestions were very well organized and useful and I already do many of them on my own hubs. I also think that adding fresh information helps improve Google rankings. Voted up, useful and interesting. Thomas Silvia from Massachusetts on September 11, 2011: Hi my friend thanks for all this great advice and information, I'm sure it will help everyone  to tweak their hubs the right way ! Vote Up !!! Chinemere onuekwusi on September 11, 2011: Tweaking a hub especially after the ""Panda slap"" like you rightly pointed out can be of great help to a hub and hubbing experience. All the points raised here is not just for newbies as stated earlier, but can come in handy for experienced hubbers as well. Great info, bookmarked and voted up! Sharilee Swaity (author) from Canada on September 11, 2011: Wwriter, thanks for the comment. I don't look at the videos much either but a lot of people prefer a video to text. I always try to find something interesting, though, and sometimes I throw in a music video for fun. Apparently, video is very good for SEO, from what I have read. Take care. wwriter from India on September 11, 2011: This is a good set of points. Somehow I don't usually view many of the videos in hubs I read, but I might be in a minority on this one, judging by the hype that use of videos has. I find it easier and faster to read. Of course there are situations where a video adds great value, but not a video of someone just reading out matter just so there can be a video."
36,"Google Attacks Our HubPages (Do the Math, Numbers Don't Lie)",community," The giant Google monster is going head to head with our beloved hub pages. One thing that's for sure in this world is that numbers don't lie. At this moment in time what the numbers are indicating aren't exactly favorable for our hub pages. The hub pages have weathered some bad storms in the past, but they have always prevailed. With the mass exodus of good writers sometime ago, and rogue moderators running wild, the hub pages have always managed to survive. The hub pages have reached another turning point, where they are going to have to make some decisive decisions to simply survive here on the internet. The glory days are quickly fading away more and more as each day passes. If you haven't noticed yet, it's on, and I'm talking about all out warfare right here on the hub pages. Never before in the annuals of the hub pages has anything like this ever happened in the past. It's hard to believe that this is all happening on an American website, in the land of the free, but it is happening all over the hub pages right in front of our eyes. Google seems to be bent on policing up the world wide web, and it's an all out war at this moment with the hub pages. There have been some interesting changes that were made by the hub pages to counter this Google attack. To name two things there's the new profile design which has literally ostracized loyal hubbers with older computer operating systems, and the attack of the hub killing Zzz's which is also known as the idled hub status. Neither of these changes may be helping matters, and both may be responsible for the sudden increase in dwindling numbers here on our hub pages. If you would like to see the numbers which I speak about, then simply scroll down to the bottom of just about any hub page, and click on ""About Us"" which is located at the extreme left hand corner. This will take you to the main home page of the hub pages. Over in the top right hand corner you will find all of the main statistics of the hub pages. At the very top of those statistics you'll notice ""Published Hubs"" and ""Published Users"". These two particular statistics are the key to what I'm talking about here. Back on August 5th 2011, which was the day of the very first Hubbie Awards, there were 1,154,676 published hubs written by 216,777 published users. On September 17th 2012, approximately 13 months later, there are 1,153,947 published hubs written by 144,885 published users. That's a decrease in hubs along with a dramatic loss of 71,892 or 33% of our fellow hubbers. (Over 1/3 of the hubbers that were with us a year ago are no longer here on the hub pages today!) It was also kindly pointed out in this hub's 2nd comment by Georgie Lowery that about 200 hubbers a week are leaving the hub pages as well, which is really eye opening. Unfortunately in reality the hub pages are losing more like 200 hubbers a day. None of this is acceptable. Since I started keeping track of all of the hubber casualties it's become apparent that the hub pages are continuing to go deeper down into the red as each day comes to a close. Numbers don't lie, and this is a steady decline for the hub pages with no recovery in sight. I discovered some startling statistics with the casualties of this war.

(Gained another 4 fellow hubbers on this last entry) Almost 8 years ago way back on May 28th 2012 and September 9th 2012 I started recording the daily statistics of the Hub Pages. There were 1,157,235 published hubs and 146,717 published users way back then. That's 555,301 more published hubs and 100,837 more fellow hubbers then there is today on the Hub Pages. Remember numbers don't lie. Back then the stats were pretty impressive, but today the stats are not, and for the most part are just made up lies. The Hub Pages are now just treading water, and it isn't worth my time to keep track of these false statistics anymore. I'm not even sure if anybody is reading this anymore. My time would be better spent playing Candy Crush, Lol. So this will be my last daily entry. However I may return from time to time again and give an quick update on the statistics. I want to thank all of the Hubbers who have stopped by and visited this site over the past 8 years, and best wishes to you where ever you may be now on the Internet.

Panda's also involved The Hub Pages are in the middle of a war zone now with combat hardened hubbers who are ready for action. Our beloved Hub Pages are fighting back with everything they have, and making both some interesting and controversial changes. However even with all of this effort, it's kind of like bobbing for apples in a barrel. These changes really haven't improved the current situation one little bit, or changed the fact that an average of 100 of our fellow hubbers are still leaving each and every day. A matter of fact some of these changes are the very reason that some of our fellow hubbers are packing their bags and heading elsewhere. On August 29th 2012 the idled hub program was introduced, which has become better know as the sleeping Zzz's. Along with this around September 4th 2012, came the option of ""Show idle hubs on my profile"". On September 26th 2012 the new profile design became mandatory, and was forced on every single hubber. It plays total havoc on operating systems of older PC's, and loads super slow at a snail's pace. On November 7th 2012 the symbols on the idled hub program were quietly changed. The featured hub status went from a green dot to a capital ""H"" inside of a black circle. The pending symbol remained unchanged, however the idled hub symbol switched from the sleeping Zzz's to a blank white space. You really have to look hard now or you won't even notice an idled hub. I'm just curious if this was the hub pages intention all along. Also the option of ""Show idle hubs on my profile"" was removed and taken away from us, and replaced with an option of ""Show only featured hubs on my profile"". On December 3rd 2012 the Hub Pages decided to remove our option of creating our own tags, and they developed an automated system that develops tags for our Hubs automatically. This feature was basically done away with to cut down on the abuse of spammers. On February 4th 2013 the Hub Pages are also going to remove RSS Capsules from our Hubs. We will just have to wait, and see just how all of this plays out. On October 1st 2014 the Hub Pages will be acquiring the key content from Squidoo, thus creating the world’s largest writing site of its kind. This action alone could either turn around all of the negative declining numbers that have been steadily listed on this hub or could be the final nail in the coffin for our beloved Hub Pages. Another possibility is that this action could just temporary slow down the end for the Hub Pages. With the advent of online publishing for E-books made easy by so many other web sites out there on the Internet, this attempt at a revival for the Hub Pages may all be all too late. We will have to wait and see what the future holds for all of us here and time will tell now for the hub pages. On January 15th, 2015 the Squidoo moderation grace period came to an end marking the beginning of a new decline in the numbers of our fellow hubbers here at the hub pages. The wait and see approach to acquiring the key content from Squidoo worked out really good, and we saw a big increase of 26,349 fellow hubbers beginning on August 18th 2014. The numbers steadily increased thanks to the influx of the new Squidoo refugees from an all time low of 58,390 published users on August 17th 2014 to an all time high of 84,739 published users on October 31st 2014. That was really an extra special treat to put into the Hub Pages Halloween bucket. Maybe since the Squidoo acquisition was so successful the Hub Pages needs to start looking around for another writing site to acquire. On March 26th 2015 the Hub pages updated another subsequent policy for hubber scores.This really isn't anything new, and is actually an old practice here on the Hub pages. Those hubbers who have been around for a while have seen this type of mass punishment before with hubber scores going down as low as 1. This time around things don't really add up either with active hubbers ranked sometimes as low as 15. On the flip side of the coin there's inactive hubbers , sometimes without even one single hub, being ranked close to 80. This is possibly another change that will continue to chase away more and more hubbers. On September 17th 2015 the Hub Pages introduced the editbot to all the hubbers. I'm not sure if this is in response to Big Brother's zingbot or not, but I have personally experienced editbot and it really does work. Editbot edits for spelling and grammar, assures that all links and products are relevant and benefits the reader, and provides a consistent style on hubs, free of broken videos, pixelated photos, and excessive bolding and italics. I'm very pleased so far with the results of the editbot. I only wish that they could have introduced editbot a long time ago, which may have prevented many of our fellow hubbers departure from the Hub Pages. Editbot may just be the night in shinning armor that the hub pages was waiting for. On November 18th 2015 the Hub Pages decided wisely to do away with the category of featured hubs. This new hastily created feature quickly disenfranchised many of our fellow hubbers, and made a lot of them very disgruntled. In reality all that this accomplished was to announce to the entire world just how many of your hubs aren't worthy of being listed on Google. This reversal was a very wise move on the part of the Hub Page staff. Hopefully reversing bad decisions like the featured hub category will help stop the Hub Pages from joining in on a similar fate as the failed writing site Bubblews did earlier this month. Bubblews suddenly shut down and disappeared altogether from the Internet after almost three years of existence. On May 2016 the Hub Pages got some brand new Network Sites up and running. They launched a new kind of radical action to help keep the boat a float here at the Hub Pages. it was a multi-domain strategy dealing with specific niche sites. Some of these new sites included clever titles like Diet & Fitness, Video Games, Arts & Crafts, Home & Garden, Alternative & Supernatural Beliefs, TV & Movies, Parenting, Music, Personal Finance, Health, Dating & Relationships, Creative Writing & Quotes, Technology, Holidays, Animals, Education, Sports & Hobbies, and Travel to name some. These new niche sites aren't by any means just limited to these categories, and hopefully this new idea will help those of us left here at the Hub Pages. On January 8th 2017 some genius on the Hub Page staff decided to unleash the Edit-bot on everybody that's still left here at the Hub Pages. That's right everyone. It doesn't matter if you opted out from the service of the Edit-bot or not, because the Hub pages has decided on their own that the Edit-bot is going to defile your hubs if you give it permission to or not. So instead of improving the situation here at the Hub Pages, things have been made even worse. There's some very unhappy hubbers here now, and this hasn't slowed down the exodus of our fellow hubbers, or helped out all of those published hubs that just keep disappearing either. On November 2017 the powers to be at the Hub Pages decided out of the blue that the questions and answers feature is being discontinued. If a writer chooses to do nothing then their Questions will all be converted into forum posts. This is simply just another way that the Hub Pages is being destroyed from within and running our fellow hubbers to other web sites here on the Internet. What's next are these same people going to discontinue hubs themselves??? It's now all just a matter of time before this web site disappears from the face of the planet as well. The whole entire purpose of this hub is to simply open everyone's eyes up to what is happening all around us on the hub pages today, and I encourage everybody to keep an eye on these statistics as well. Watching these numbers is almost like watching the air leak slowly out of an automobile tire. I realize that not everyone may agree with this, but the fact of this matter is that our hub pages may not survive this latest attack by Google.

Goody5 (author) from Bohville, USA, Just below the Mason-Dixon line in the land of the pleasant living on February 05, 2020: Almost 8 years ago way back on May 28th 2012 and September 9th 2012 I started recording the daily statistics of the Hub Pages.

They manipulated the numbers on September 15th with an inflated amount of a gain of 42 fellow hubbers, and on September 16th it was no surprise at all that they said we lost another 12 hubbers. Whats even more interesting is the fact that there are 40 fewer published hubs today then there were just 2 days ago. It's like they are trying to put a used band-aid on a hole on a sinking ship. Get off of this ship now before it's too late! possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on July 17, 2019: The hub pages are doing nothing but simply treading water. There's the exact same amount of hubbers today as there was a week ago on July 11th 2019 at 44,662 hubbers. Stick a fork into the hub pages, they are done! possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on July 14, 2019: Don't worry Alex about gaining 80 a day every day, because we have already lost all 80 of those hubbers today. It looks like one of those idiots from maven hit the wrong button! This web site is the biggest joke on the Internet !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AlexK2009 from Edinburgh, Scotland on July 13, 2019: Even if we got 80 a day every day that would not dent the loss so far. possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on July 13, 2019: You are correct about the Gain of another 80 fellow hubbers being a bunch of crap Holestory. With all of the hubbers that were lost this month alone, there;s no way in hell that we gained another 80 hubbers today. Either these new idiots in charge are totally manipulating the numbers or one of the dummies hit the wrong button on the computer board. The hub pages are nothing but a weak shadow of what it was back in the hay day of 2012, and the hub pages are dead in the water!! Joie Smo on January 11, 2019: That's back to back days of losing 4 of our fellow hubbers here in Hubville. We are getting off to a heck of a start this year at the hub pages. Joie Smo on January 05, 2019: Look as the sun rises today we have lost another 5 of our fellow hubbers who have been taken away from us. Now that's a stabilized circus! Joie Smo on January 04, 2019: Thanks Possum, and look today we have lost another 1 big fellow hubber. Things have really stabilized at this one ring circus! possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on January 03, 2019: It's not your bad Joie, because you hit the target right on the bulls eye. It's the same old circus around here at the hub pages. The only thing that's changed are the clowns. Joie Smo on January 03, 2019: My Bad! Lol Joie Smo on January 02, 2019: John, I'm just going to have agree to disagree with you. Looking at the stats on this hub numbers don't lie. Last month, in December alone, we saw a loss of our fellow hubbers for a combined 12 different days. This site has turned into a laughing stock on the entire Internet. I'll never write again here. John Coviello from New Jersey on January 01, 2019: Given recent trends regarding the number of writers and the number of published articles, I'd say that HubPages has stabilized.  The earnings rate for their ad program has gone up quite a lot since The Maven took over.  Certainly, a better incentive to write for this site.  I have been in publishing mode in recent months on HubPages. TheHoleStory from Parsons, West Virginia on November 07, 2018: Well it looks like the shrinking hub pages is back at it when it comes to losing fellow hubbers. In 3 out of just the 4 past few days we have seen a loss of our fellow hubbers here. In just the past 2 days there was nothing but losses of our fellow hubbers. It looks like the fat lady has walked up onto the stage and picked up Bobby Brown's mic. To repeat the great possum lover's words - Peace out. possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on November 01, 2018: You are correct about all of that Mr. Jones. I'm not going to write another period or comma, much less a another single solitary word on this sinking ship of a site ever again. I've been in search of another good writing site, so I'm definitely going to check out that site you spoke about. I hope you and everybody else had a happy Halloween. Peace out Bubblegum Jones from the house right next door to Honey Boo Boo (AKA: Honey Boo Boo's next door neighbor) on October 31, 2018: Today is Halloween, and of all days we lost yet another hubber on this special day of treats. The numbers on this hub are more scary then the the masked figure of Michael Myers who has haunted Jamie Lee Curtis as she narrowly escaped his killing spree on this day. I've bailed out of this once great sinking ship called the hub pages, and I've moved to writing.com, which is a free site as well. Visit me at my portfolio page - https://www.writing.com/main/portfolio.php/view/bu... and check it out. I'll be waiting for you, and have a Happy Halloween. possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on October 08, 2018: I thought that I would swing on back by and check out the latest hub page stats, and I see that really nothing is happening anymore on this once great site. Both the amount of published hubs and hubbers writing those hubs are doing nothing more but teetering slightly back & forth, and up and down. These numbers are stagnate and cease to flow anymore. Even the number of comments on this once great hub are slowing down to a crawl. I think that I made the correct decision to spend my time writing on another site. Peace out for now. Joie Smo on September 19, 2018: Come on guys lets not fight among ourselves. Remember all of us here at this hub are on the same side. Peace out. The Logician from then to now on on September 18, 2018: If we've lost a lot of good writers here at HubPages but as a result HP is left with higher quality writers then I guess we lost a lot of writers who really weren’t that good. Can’t have it both ways. The only thing you can say for sure is we’ve lost a lot of writers and if they were that good then I guess what we are left with really aren’t higher quality writers. Maybe they are just writers who will march in lock step mit der fuhrer, HubPages. John Coviello from New Jersey on September 18, 2018: The one way this reduction in published articles could be working for HubPages is if the ones that remain are getting more views on average than the many others that they lost.  This whole drop started when HubPages started cracking down and implementing higher standards.  I've often butted heads with the HP staff over their publishing standards, as they have been too restrictive at times.  But, at the end of the day if they are left with higher quality articles, getting more views and earning more money, then their plan may be working.  That said, we've lost a lot of good writers here at HubPages and it's a damn shame! The Logician from then to now on on September 18, 2018: What do I think? I’ll tell you what I think... when they do something that results in liberals and me being in agreement, that it is bad, and this is not the first time they’ve done it, you know that is really bad! TheHoleStory from Parsons, West Virginia on September 18, 2018: It's great to hear from you again T, and I don't spend all that much time anymore on this sinking ship either. I can see from reading your profile page that you are as disgusted about this web site as I am. What do you think about how they have now destroyed our profile pages? The Logician from then to now on on September 18, 2018: Holestory, I can never get used to your profile pic, I keep thinking I’m talking to a cow! But once again Hub Pages demonstrates their commitment to putting the customer first, first out the door that is. TheHoleStory from Parsons, West Virginia on September 18, 2018: Today Christy Kirwan made an announcement about a profile page update, which is another big joke on this site. This means that people visiting your profile page won't be able to see your work. What sense does this make?  I'm going to stop even capitalizing the word hub pages, and of course all of the suck asses commented to this announcement saying how it was such a great idea, blind to the fact of how this site is being systematically destroyed. My hat is off to you Mr. John Coviello, and all of your great gathering of statistics in your latest comments. You ought to put all that information into a hub, however the hub page staff probably wouldn't publish it today. You have made a whooping 31 comments from New Jersey in the past 5 years. You made the 79th comment on this hub saying how you can't believe that the hub pages are still bleeding authors at such a high rate. Then seven comments later you stated ""I wonder how much of these Hubber declines are due to HubPages going through their user directory and deleting old accounts that have been inactive for a long time versus Hubbers quitting and deleting their accounts? I think it could be a combination of the two."" This sparked a comment just 3 comments later from Paul Deeds from Berkeley, California (The General Manager and VP of Engineering of the hub pages) stating how in the last year or so, they have unpublished about 267,000 hubs by 140,000 different users. This was a bad choice Paul, and look where we are now. I always felt that this was a good place for our work to be seen by the world long after we are dead and gone. Boy was I wrong!!! To prove that here are numbers doing the math as this hub has suggested. a little over 6 years ago on September 9th 2012 there were 1,157,235 published hubs and 146,717 published users. Today on September 18th 2018 there are now 672,690 published hubs and just 42,712 published users. We have said good bye to 104,005 fellow hubbers and 484,545 of their hubs. These numbers shouldn't impress anybody!!! Joie Smo on September 14, 2018: Yes John you have been commenting here for years. However I already stated in a previous comment that - ""Even on this once popular site there use to be a lot of people commenting in the past, which just goes to show how few of us are left on this site now"". My point is what happened to all of the other people who helped make those 285 comments here over the years? Oh, I can answer that, they are GONE! John Coviello from New Jersey on September 12, 2018: Just trying to show people the bigger picture.  If you read down through the comments, you'll see I've been quite critical of HubPages' direction over the years. IMO this reorg better work or it could be lights out for HubPages.  However, that doesn't mean someone will not buy HubPages out, if it comes to a fire sale, and try to put their imprint on it. Joie Smo on September 12, 2018: I can see that you really did your research John Coviello, however in just the lat 24 hours another 13 published hubs have vanished from the face of the Internet. Just like it's stated in the title of this great hub - numbers don't lie. My ears are still ringing from hearing that fat lady singing on the hub pages. John Coviello from New Jersey on September 11, 2018: New Maven Leadership Team Moves Quickly to Create Efficiencies Business Wire	Business Wire•August 28, 2018 SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- $5M annualized costs cut across HubPages, Say Media, and Maven; $30 million annualized revenue run rate anticipated starting Q4-18; Mergers to produce scale of 100 million customers Maven Inc. (OTC: MVEN) began streamlining operations to create immediate operating efficiencies across Say Media, HubPages and Maven platforms. Maven also announced the post-merger, unified leadership team. HubPages merger is complete and Say Media is on track to close in September. The three digital media companies, all of which provide proprietary technology, monetization and distribution for third-party, premium content providers, are now operating as a single and united business platform with financials expected to consolidate prior to Q4, as part of Maven’s independent digital media coalition. The new structure and cuts made last week are expected to remove $5 million in annualized overhead by reducing duplicative leadership and executive functions across all three companies and will combine the highest performing sales, product and engineering talent together as a single team. Streamlined operations help secure Maven’s stated goal to reach operating profits and $30 million of annualized run rate revenue during Q4-18, in anticipation of the Say Media acquisition. “The reason these acquisitions make so much sense is because all three companies were essentially doing the same thing,” said Maven CEO James Heckman. “We’re able to harvest efficiencies quickly by simply eliminating duplicative costs. The merger between three companies is time consuming and complicated but the integration is not.” “The enormous benefit, and ultimate result, of merging these three outstanding companies is a single, premium marketplace for advertisers and a world class platform for independent publishers,” added Maven President Josh Jacobs. “We will offer the most comprehensive set of technologies to support independent publishers on the web, with the aggregate scale dramatically strengthening our profile for major advertising brands and marketers.” The leadership team will consist of executives from all three organizations. Maven founder James Heckman remains CEO and a member of the board; Josh Jacobs remains President and Executive Chair of the board; HubPages CEO/founder Paul Edmondson becomes Maven’s COO; Michelle Panzer of Say joins to become Maven’s Chief Marketing Officer; Say’s Ben Trott will become Maven’s Chief Product Officer, managing all three company’s product and technology teams with Maven co-founder Ben Joldersma remaining CTO and Chief Architect. Maven is a coalition of Mavens operating on a shared digital publishing, advertising and distribution platform, under a single media brand. Based in Seattle, Maven is publicly traded under the ticker symbol MVEN. Joie Smo on September 11, 2018: There are a lot of indicators on this site which show that the fat lady has already sung her song. Just since yesterday we have lost another 53 published hubs. The gain and loss of our fellow hubbers has been so little since the beginning of summer that it's hardly even worth mentioning anymore. Of course who knows if the hub pages aren't just making up numbers in this day and time. Even on this once popular site there use to be a lot of people commenting in the past, which just goes to show how few of us are left on this site now. Yes I agree the fat lady has sung, so go ahead and lower the flag!! John Coviello from New Jersey on September 10, 2018: It might not be over for HubPages, if they are doing a better monetizing this site.  One thing I noticed is that TheMaven's stock has tanked since they took over HubPages. The owners of HubPages took stock as a good chunk of their payment for their site.  They can't be happy. TheHoleStory from Parsons, West Virginia on September 10, 2018: Let's do a little review here on the numbers from the past few days. Gain 2 fellow hubbers, lose 1 fellow hubber, and gain 1 fellow hubber. Ever since the hub pages have teamed up with this so called maven coalition they have been doing nothing but treading on water. The saying it ain't over till the fat lady sings is an old saying. It means that one should not presume to know the outcome of an event which is still in progress. Well guess what people the party is over and the fat lady has sung on the hub pages. It's Over! John Coviello from New Jersey on July 18, 2018: It's hard to say if things have actually gotten worse for HubPages lately. For one, they had a long decline in Hubbers and articles that has stabilized in the long-view. Also, it has to be considered that some of the Hubbers that publish the most are being migrated to the TheMaven, as per HubPages original plan when the merger happened.  Not sure if the migration has started yet, but when it does it will hurt these numbers. Joie Smo on July 17, 2018: I hit the nail right on the head when I said in my last comment that the hub pages is now definitely a sinking ship. In 4 out of just the last 5 days there has been a steady loss of hubbers. Not even those hubbers who use to comment on this hub are around anymore these days. Maven has really run a bunch of hubbers off of the hub pages. I guess just like the VHS tape, the paper newspaper, and 8-track & cassette tapes the hub pages is now a thing of yesteryear. Joie Smo on July 10, 2018: Going over and crunching these gloomy numbers and statistics on this hub is totally mind boggling. There is absolutely no rhyme or reason or even a pattern to these dismal numbers. It's very possible that all of these numbers are being completely made up by the powers to be since the so called big Maven acquisition of HubPages. After all there were even gaps where absolutely no statistics were posted by the Hub Pages on 4 different occasions for several weeks. I'm going to just simply digest all of this information with a grain of salt and move on. The HubPages is now definitely a sinking ship. TheHoleStory from Parsons, West Virginia on November 03, 2017: The only word in the English dictionary that I can find to describe today's statistics on this hub is ""Interesting"". The reason that I say this is today's date (November 3rd 2017) is exactly 11 months to the very day on December 3rd 2016 that there were as many as 40,000 published hubbers writing here on the Hub Pages. Is this just a simple coincidence or is one of the powers to be on this web site manipulating the statistics once again like they have done in the past. Also beware of this new Feature called 'Expert Reviews' that the Hub Pages is coming out with. There are many hubbers who aren't very pleased to hear this announcement and I tend to agree with their opinions. AlexK2009 from Edinburgh, Scotland on June 10, 2017: @John Coviello I feel Hub Pages Quality Rules are irrelevant. I do not mean QUALITY is irrelevant, but I scanned the Google quality guidelines a month or two back looking for mentions of the things Hub Pages mentioned when they rejected my Hubs for the niche sites. I could not find anything in HP's comments/rules that matched anything in the Google guidelines. I doubt very much for example that Google would down rate a page because  there is a word in a header that is not capitalised or  a term is defined or a point emphasised by using Bold Type/Italic. The logical thing to do would have been to write the quality guidelines using Google's guidelines. However Google's document is long and perhaps nobody at HP wanted to read them, just define quality for themselves. I suspect someone with a loud mouth in HP was influential in developing quality guidelines. Or HP's guidelines were devised with a view to automating assessment of Hubs I am also sure other search engines have guidelines similar to Google's. I am afraid HP is slowly cutting its own throat. With a blunt saw blade. I am  becoming increasingly reluctant to  write anything on HP. John Coviello from New Jersey on June 09, 2017: I have been surveyed twice about whether I would recommend HubPages to friends.  Both times I gave HubPages low ratings regarding recommending writing at this site, because of their Overburdensome rules.  Hopefully they are acting on these surveys and making adjustments.  I just published a Hub a couple of weeks ago, and it was approved with no problems.  I really put a lot into it and wrote it well.  If it had become another  run around with the HubPages staff to get it featured, I may have just thrown my arms up and said enough.  It's when they became nitpicky about featuring Hubs that I stopped liking publishing here. TheHoleStory from Parsons, West Virginia on June 09, 2017: Hey Alex and Possum, you both have contributed some very good points here to this long running discussion. It also looks as though that over zealous staff member of the hub pages has over shot those manipulated numbers of gained hubbers, and now all of a sudden today out of the blue there a loss of 9 fellow hubbers. I'm starting to believe that who ever this over zealous staff member of the hub pages is, that they are just randomly hitting buttons when it's time to update the figures for the ""about us"" section. possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on June 08, 2017: Good luck Alex with using another type of browser. What's really interesting to me is when there is a lot of chatter on this hub or the forums there's all of a sudden a spike in the gain of hubbers. After yesterday there was all of a sudden a gain of another 40 hubbers. There hasn't been a gain of hubbers this big for over 4 months since way back on February 6th with a gain of 41 hubbers. What else other than manipulation by an over zealous staff member of the hub pages could this sudden gain of hubbers be? AlexK2009 from Edinburgh, Scotland on June 08, 2017: @possum_Lover Even if the community were to grow till it reached peak numbers there is no guarantee that traffic and earnings would grow as long as Google persists with current policies. I am trying to stop using Google. I have put searchlock  as my default browser and use ducduckgo as a backup. So far I have not noticed I am missing anything possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on June 07, 2017: You are 100 percent correct Alex that 30 some years (regardless if it's either 35 or 36 years) is a long time, but at a slow gain of just 3,000 followers a year it's going to take at least that long to get back to those glory days of yesterday. That is if these numbers aren't being manipulated by a staff member. AlexK2009 from Edinburgh, Scotland on June 07, 2017: A gain in hubbers could be good news, since I feel the size of the community does affect the views you get. However it depends on whether they look at existing hubs and use them. But 35 years is along time to wait, though compound growth, if it happens may shorten it. TheHoleStory from Parsons, West Virginia on June 07, 2017: I done a little analyzing of the numbers here on this interesting hub, and I've made some very interesting discoveries. In the last 1/3 of this year or 4 months there has been a surprising gain of around 1,000 hubbers. This gain wasn't by any means steady, with a constant loss of hubbers scattered over 30 days or 25% of the time. If the numbers aren't being manipulated by staff members then this could be considered good news. However at this trickle of a rate of an increase of hubbers, it will take over 36 years to gain back those 108,174 hubbers that we have lost, and had to say goodbye to since the decline of the Hub Pages has begun. So it will be the year 2053 before we may see the return of the hay day of the Hub Pages. If I'm alive I'll be 90 years old if this ever happens, and I wonder just how many of my wonderful 3,500 followers will still be around at that point as well? Dim Flaxenwick from Great Britain on April 09, 2017: So glad to see this. You've  gone to a lot of trouble to print so many facts and figures. I'm  sure l am not the only one  to be grateful for your work here.  I wish l  knew the answer but l have struggled to write for the past 2 years. possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on April 06, 2017: It's been six weeks since I left my last comment on this spectacular hub, and now in the forums there's all of a sudden talk about the hub pages marching to oblivion. You'll have to check it out. Here's the link -       https://hubpages.com/community/forum/140881/is-hub... possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on February 20, 2017: I agree with your comment 100%  MyWebs. That's why I stopped writing hubs here almost two years ago. The staff here at the hub pages has finally realized that the only way to stop the steady decrease of both hubs and hubbers is to manipulate the system. If you pay attention to the statistics and the numbers in this hub since the beginning of this month of February, you will see a very weird pattern of small mysterious gains.  I pointed out 6 weeks ago that darn Edit-bot was making another pass on our hubs without our permission. I think it's going to be fun watching the backlash of the hub pages  latest move.  Does everybody remember  the web site My Space? It won't be long now before the hub pages becomes the next My Space on the Internet!!!! Anthony Goodley from Sheridan, WY on February 19, 2017: What I say is most definitely true. I copied that from the official HubPages weekly newsletter they sent out on Feb 1st. Check your emails! And where i said their attitude is basically love it or leave it was based upon a HubPages blog  posting about this new change where they say as much. See http://blog.hubpages.com/2017/01/26/2016-update-an... by Paul. See this section: ""I still don’t want my content edited or changed whatsoever. What should I do? If you are firmly against having your work professionally edited, HubPages is likely no longer the best home for that content. We recommend removing your articles and republishing on a website or blog you own. "" AlexK2009 from Edinburgh, Scotland on February 15, 2017: Their business model depends on what they call timeless content, rock_nj and there is very little that is truly timeless. If you are lucky something may be popular for a couple of years. However this seems to be true of all writing. Fiction seems to last longer ( Dickens' books are still on sale for example) but longevity is also a matter of luck. HP have decided to concentrate on non fiction as their business model. Perhaps, somewhere, there are sites like ot that concentrate on fiction and poetry, but if you think you can make a living from writing poetry you are an idiot or a genius at writing it and marketing it. And you only know if you are a genius if you are making a living from it. John Coviello from New Jersey on February 14, 2017: Hubpages is not the best place to publish creative writing.  I learned that the hard way years ago.  The HubPages business model is not well suited for it, because they want a certain amount of views to keep a Hub featured.  This site is good for other kinds of writing, but the creative stuff usually doesn't get a enough of a following to keep a Hub in good graces with Hubpages.  I get frustrated when out of the blue they decide to unfeature a Hub for whatever reason they feel like at the moment.  The views thing I can handle, because they want content that gets views.  Perhaps not the best or most creative content, but articles that get views. AlexK2009 from Edinburgh, Scotland on February 14, 2017: writing.com looks like an online writers group. Such groups are valuable in getting criticism but do not help with earning money from writing. This is not the same as HP which is a revenue sharing site. The two serve different purposes Jack Lee from Yorktown NY on February 14, 2017: possum, I certainly hope that is not true. A writing site is not the same as hubPages. Hubpages provide a platform for many types of writing and not only creative writing...or fictional writing or poetry... For me, I write or publish many different topics including politics, religion, technology, food and recipe, how to? and misc. topics total 21 categories. Where else on the web can you do that? possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on February 14, 2017: It's too little too late MyWebs. The hub pages is just simply scratching and clawing their way to try to survive.  It doesn't matter what these fools in charge here at the hub pages do anymore, because it's over.  If what you say is true then this is no longer a writing site, and people are no longer writing stories here, THE STAFF IS! With the exception of asking a few questions I have long ago stopped writing any stories here. There are a lot of much better writing sites out there on the Internet. Take  https://www.writing.com/  for example. I have been a member of this free site now for years. They have been around since the start of this century (2000), and they even give all of their members a free E-Mail address to use however they wish. There is no HubPro rewriting your work, and their membership is massive. As of today there are 1,253,010 members who have created over 2,012,231 stories. Compare those numbers to the 37,508 hubbers who have written just 644,970 hubs, and as you will see there is no comparison. Anthony Goodley from Sheridan, WY on February 14, 2017: Personally I don't give a **** either way since I long ago gave up on HP due to lack of time and losing faith in HP. But for those who think HP in the past has had a heavy hand and not listened to its users this latest announcement might be too much for them possibly. ”Big news this week, friends! Within the next month, we plan to remove the opt-out option for participating in HubPro Premium."" So now they can edit your hub however they like and you no longer have any say in the matter! Love it or leave is their attitude basically. And my last comment I was somewhat joking as i never read that forum thread and have no idea why it was actually removed, but it did seem a bit suspicious. John Coviello from New Jersey on January 30, 2017: It is pretty astounding how many Hubbers have left and how many Hubs have disappeared since this Hub started about 5 years ago.  We are approaching a 75% loss of Hubbers and over a half million Hubs gone.  Lately, I have just been deleting Hubs that are un-featured.  If HubPages doesn't like them, then they can stop making money off of them.  I am finally writing a new Hub.  We'll see how it goes as far as approval from HubPages goes. possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on January 30, 2017: Jacklee lm, you are spot on with your comment. This hub has been supplying the daily statistics since way back in 2012. Anyone can go back and see exactly how many hubs and hubbers there were on any given date. Today January 30th, 2017 there were 647,398 hubs & 37,688 hubbers. The one constant that remains true on this hub is that the hub pages are constantly losing both their writers and their written work. At this rate the end is definitely closing in for the history books. Jack Lee from Yorktown NY on January 30, 2017: There is no censoring on HubPages. There are only a staff of 25 with 800,000 hubs and 37,000 hubbers and 8,000,000 forums... They only ban users that generate SPAM if reported by other users... AlexK2009 from Edinburgh, Scotland on January 30, 2017: @possum_lover If they want to censor unpopular opinions why does this hub still exist? possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on January 30, 2017: You are 100 percent correct MyWebs. I just hit this link, and it's now out of the blue unpublished. It had a lot of comments on it too. If you go back to the comments at the beginning of this hub you will also find an interesting comment left by a Hub Pages staff member. I'm sure those that have been voicing there opinions here for years will continue to do so. Peace out brother! Anthony Goodley from Sheridan, WY on January 30, 2017: @Rock NJ at some point in the 12 days since you posted that link that forum thread has went MIA. Instead it says: ""Sorry, that discussion has been removed or does not exist."" It would seem that voicing your opinion of discontent is no longer allowed either. Be careful my friends,  be very careful as they may be watching! possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on January 18, 2017: Rock nj, we are now officially half way through the very first month of 2017, and absolutely nothing has improved here on this writing site. If anything the staff here at the hub pages have managed to piss off just about every hubber who is still here.  This is a link  - https://hubpages.com/community/forum/139529/done-w...   to a very active thread in the forum where these hubbers are voicing their opinions of discontent. John Coviello from New Jersey on January 16, 2017: Happy New Year possum lover and everyone!  2017 certainly is more of the same for Hub Pages so far. I miss being excited to publish a Hub or two per week.  Hard to get excited anymore when all the work and effort is sometimes rebuffed by the editors, even when it is well written and well documented.  We'll see what 2017 brings.... AlexK2009 from Edinburgh, Scotland on January 08, 2017: It still seems like Hub Pages is still the best revenue sharing site around, but that is not a meaningful statement.  Of course if you want to write what you want for free there are loads of places. If you want your work reviewed  you would do better joining or forming s local writers group. possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on January 08, 2017: I see none of my buddies from this hub have stopped by to comment, and maybe the recent snow storm stopped them, but I have something to say today. And that is I TOLD YOU SO!!!!!! I gave a 100% guarantee yesterday that the numbers in this hubs statistics will go down and even be smaller today. Guess what they are. In just 24 hours another 35 of our fellow hubbers have packed their bags, hit the door, and found another website to write on the Internet. Possibly it's over at http://www.writing.com , which isn't a bad place to start over at. Hint hint.  Since just yesterday another 332 published hubs have gone PUFF and mysteriously disappeared into the abyss of possibly even the Bermuda Triangle. If you can give some other reason what's happening to all of the hub page's published hubs, then let's hear it! Making this prediction was no real big deal, because these same numbers have been dropping for years now. The bottom line here is the the good ole boys on the staff at the hub pages need to wake up, because the only thing they accomplished by forcing that damn Edit-bot on people was to piss them off! possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on January 07, 2017: Has anybody noticed that darn Edit-bot is making another pass on our work here at the hub pages. It doesn't even matter if you have opted out from Edit-bot, because they are going to do what ever they want to do here at the hub pages. The staff isn't the least bit worried that hubbers are sick and tired of this crap and running out the doors. Instead of fixing the problems that are causing disappearing hubs and the continuous loss of our fellow hubbers, these stupid moderators (Human or Robot) are fixing our spelling mistakes regardless if they have our permission or not. I for one have gone back and doubled checked to see if I opted out from Edit-bot, and guess what I did, and they still have the nerve to touch my work without my permission. It's no wonder that as of today, only 7 days into the new year of 2017 , there are only 38,454 fellow hubbers with 654,716 written hubs. This crap that they are doing with the Edit-bot won't change the fact that tomorrow these two numbers will be even smaller. That is a 100% guarantee! possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on December 31, 2016: Both you MyWebs , and Rock nj make some very valid points about the hub pages on this very last day of 2016. I just wish those staff members on the hub pages who can fix and correct these issues would step up to the plate and do so. With today being New Year's Eve I would like to wish both you MyWebs, Rock nj, and all of our fellow hubbers the very best that 2017 has to bring us in this world. Happy New Years! John Coviello from New Jersey on December 31, 2016: The ads that HubPages discourages are Amazon ads.  Apparently, they believe that Google doesn't want to see too many Amazon ads on a given page or ones that are irrelevant.  When that happens, Google supposedly doesn't like it and penalizes a site.  The thing that is annoying is when HubPages just arbitrarily wipes all Amazon ads off of a Hub, especially when they go onto one of their specialty sites. It seems like whether the ads are relevant or not is of no matter to them, they just remove them.  That seems overly zealous. Anthony Goodley from Sheridan, WY on December 31, 2016: Google's main source of income is and has been advertising revenue forever. Why in the world would they penalize a website for having advertising, as long as it's not excessive, when most of these websites are actually using Google's advertising to monetize their site? Talking about shooting their self in the foot..... Jeff Duff from Southwest Wisconsin on December 28, 2016: Somethingblue: a couple of random (but important thoughts ... I don't know the truth of this, but HubPages is operating on the theory that the Google search engine is strongly oriented to websites that have no (or very little) display advertising on their pages.  First, how would the Google Robo-troll even be able to distinguish advertisements from small-sized feature content?  Second, how would the Robo-troll even be able to tell, if a website's written page text was ALL advertising, such as an 'infomercial' as content?  What about advertising buried discretely in the hub's/article's main text? In my opinion, Hub Pages is harming itself by trying desperately to reduce it's per-page advertising to some artificially low level that they believe will bring it favor from Google.  But, the only websites that are currently successful with such low-to-nonexistant advertising are personal and family blogs, corporate and business websites and, finally, governmental and educational websites.  Think about that!  Personal and family blogsites are self-supporting (well, some person pays to keep them up and running); corporate and business websites are essentially just advertising themselves (which Google seems to find acceptable); and governmental and educational websites are - by their nature - non-commercial enterprises (of course, paid for by us lowly taxpayers).  None of these websites need advertising revenue to survive and thrive! Now, look at all of the successful websites that are not personal, family, corporate, single business, educational or governmental in operation.  PRACTICALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING WEBSITES ARE NOW USING ADVERTISING, BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL!  These websites are successful without the benevolent and condign influence of Google.  These sites advertise - often very heavily - knowing that they can bring in more traffic and revenue through advertising than they can by relying upon the approval and beneficence of Google! IN OTHER WORDS, HUB PAGES INC. IS DOING IT WRONG!  THEY'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY! somethgblue from Shelbyville, Tennessee on December 28, 2016: What I don't get is why? Wouldn't HP being shooting themselves in the foot? Two of the last three Hubs I have published haven't been featured and I haven't changed my writing style other than to stop providing links which they seem against nowadays. Their excuse, the Hubs are too ""spammy"", which they fail to define and according to my research isn't even a word. I have no idea what that means but when you read articles on other sites they are so full of ads it is almost impossible to read . . . Anthony Goodley from Sheridan, WY on December 28, 2016: That is sad that a hub that at one time was held in such high esteem to receive an award only later to be deleted as unworthy of even being published. The icing on the cake is that the award was stripped as well. It is actions such as these that are driving away the writers much faster than new ones are registering. Smh. Goes to check now if my award has been stripped yet? Jeff Duff from Southwest Wisconsin on December 24, 2016: Great story about your friend with ""The Small Bang Theory"" hub. The sad part is that even if you could identify and communicate with the rogue moderator who banned ""The Small Bang Theory"" hub - and told him/her what happened after the hub was banned - they would still believe in the righteousness of their action.   The same for the hubber who lost the award due to a silly moderator. There is no worse tyrant than a petty tyrant. possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on December 24, 2016: Jeff Duff ........ I'm sure there are a lot of hubbers out there on the hub pages who are sick and tired of rogue moderators destroying their hard work for their own selfish reasons. I had nearly 500 comments alone on The Wonderful World of Possums hub before one of those rogue moderators unpublished it and made it Irrevocable. Now how do you think all of those wonderful hubbers who left all of those comments felt? I even saw one of these rogue moderators take back a hubbie award from a fellow hubber. That's right a hubbie award. Five One Cows won the very first hubbie award EVER on the hub pages for the funniest hub - The Small Bang Theory. Only to have the little electronic award disappear, and the hub unpublished as well. The joke is on the rogue moderator though, because ""The Small Bang Theory"" and it's sequel ""Echos of a Small Bang"" are both E-Books and available out there for the whole world to see on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Google Books, and just about any E-book seller there is on the Internet that. The joke and loss is on the hub pages. Also Jeff we don't want want the term rogue to be confused with the new Star Wars movie, because these rogue moderators will never be as well know as the movie or a funny E-Book! Jeff Duff from Southwest Wisconsin on December 23, 2016: Once again, all hail mighty Possum Lover:  Aside from your mentioning my Bounce Rate comments, you also spoke of a Rogue Moderator and how he/she raised havoc with one of your best hubs. I believe that we need an Appeal Process for hubs that have been  'banned' or 'sentenced to perpetual editing' by anonymous HP moderators.  I have a few ideas that would probably improve this miserable situation for victimized hubbers - like your bad situation with your interesting-sounding Possum hub/article - but a significant effort would be required by some top hubbers, if we hope to penetrate the over-confidence and indifference of the Hub Pages staff.  (Incidentally, I don't just write on HP to practice my typing skills!) I recently had a Hub considered for promotion to the ""Owlpoop"" Specialty Site, namely, my hub about the hysterical public over-reactions about the endangerment of earth's obscure animal and plant species.  Even after I provided the requested edit and update, the HP staffer then went on to decline my hub for admission to the ""Owlpoop"" Super Site.  Why?  This staffer didn't say.  I've always wondered if my hub was poorly written ... or did that staffer have an ideological disagreement with my hub's premise (that species have died off by the millions in the past and will continue to do so in the future, despite the arrogant hubris of humans).  Are we aiming to avoid controversy on Hub Pages?  Shouldn't intelligent (or semi-intelligent, in my case) and controversial articles be welcome at Hub Pages, to help attract new visitors? So, yes, I can relate (at least a little) to your anger, Possum Lover! Jeff Duff from Southwest Wisconsin on December 23, 2016: Hello Possum Lover, it looks like all of my posts are here on my version of this Hub/comments.  My First posting on this Hub in 2016 started this way: ""Hub Pages are one of the most Command-and-Control websites I have ever ..."".  My next 2016 posting started this way: ""@AlexK2009: You know, I think you're on to something! ..."". My next posting starts: ""If you folks are not aware of Alexa Analytics, you should be ..."".  My next posting starts: ""I have been thinking about the problems at Hub Pages for a long time and I did ..."".  My last 2016 posting starts: ""Since my last posting took a couple days to show up here, I'll just jump ahead to ..."".  Possum, I may have gotten a little sloppy in my ordination of these comments (you know, 'first', 'second', etc.) and I apologize for the confusion I created. Since I have  your attention on the subject of Bounce Rate, let me ask you something that I can't figure out.  Why is it that many - if not most - Hubbers write they are very concerned about getting more visitor traffic and increasing their writing income from Hub Pages, yet ... You are the only Hubber to express an interest in how the Bounce Rate provides one answer for improving our HP traffic and income?  I'm starting to think that hubbers (and HP managers?) like to complain about visitor traffic, but are unwilling to do anything constructive about it.  (To quote Mark Twain, ""Everybody complains about the weather, but nobody does anything about it."") possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on December 23, 2016: Jeff Duff.......I really enjoyed reading both your first and third Posting about Hub Pages and it's Bounce Rate. I feel like I am really missing out by not getting to read your 2nd post. Would you please come back and post your second post about Hub Pages and it's Bounce Rate so that I can get the entire story here. I'm not at all surprised that your first posting took a couple days to show up here. The Hub pages is not what it use to be in it's Hay Day. There are even more staff members here now at the hub pages then there was in the hay day, but that doesn't seem to make anything better. If nothing else the additional staff members have made things a lot worse. I still have a bad taste in my mouth from some rogue moderator unpublishing my best hub ever ""The Wonderful World Of Possums"", which was also the biggest hub and most popular ever at that time on the hub pages. The really bad thing is this rogue moderator not only unpublished my hub, but they also made it Irrevocable, which basically means it's gone forever. I'm looking forward to seeing your second post Jeff soon. Jeff Duff from Southwest Wisconsin on December 21, 2016: Since my last posting took a couple days to show up here, I'll just jump ahead to my Third Posting about Hub Pages and it's Bounce Rate: As you'll recall from my recent posts here, the Hub Pages current Bounce Rate (according to Alexa Analytics on December 20) is a rather dismal 63.7%, where the lower the bounce rate the better.  We need to aim for a bounce rate of no higher than 50% , and preferably even lower - like 30%!  Lowering the HP Bounce Rate is 'do-able' and would pay significant dividends, such as greatly increasing the Visitor Page Views on this site (thereby tending to increase everyone's revenue, for example). The BAD NEWS is that decreasing the HP Bounce Rate below, say, 50%, will not be easy at all.  It will require a concentrated effort by everyone, particularly HP management.  It seems very likely that this will require an HP page redesign, which is far more about the effort (and investment) of HP's managers, but there are still things that hubbers can do to improve the website's bounce rate. The GOOD NEWS is that improving HP's bounce rate shouldn't take more than a few weeks or months, with some real effort by everyone  (especially HP's managers and designers).  A SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER BOUNCE RATE WOULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER REVENUE FOR EVERYONE! Jeff Duff from Southwest Wisconsin on December 19, 2016: I have been thinking about the problems at Hub Pages for a long time and I did have a couple of additional thoughts on this website's SEO and traffic problems. A couple of weeks' ago, I mentioned that HP had a Bounce Rate of 63.1%, a slight improvement over 3 months previous, when HP had a Bounce Rate of 66.1%.  As of 18 December 2016, the HP Bounce Rate has slid slightly downward to 63.7%.  (Remember, the lower the Bounce Rate is, the better - so a slide from 63.1% to 63.7% is actually a slightly bad thing.)   Now when I ended my last post from a couple of weeks ago, which was mostly about the Bounce Rate, I was afraid I was getting too 'wordy' so I figured that Hubbers and Hub Page Managers could 'fill in the blanks' of what I was implying by stating the importance of improving our BR.  I now realize that I was probably too optimistic about everyone understanding the implications of improving our BR, especially when it comes to HP Managers.  (HP Managers have been ignoring internet and website statistics for years, as far as I can tell, and may not be able to analyze Bounce Rates any longer.) First, recall that SEO experts view blog sites' having Bounce Rates above 50% as being ""Poor"" or ""Very Poor"" in converting unique visitors into multipage readers.  (BRs are not graded on a bell curve, so a 50% BR is actually a below average score.)  The current HP Bounce Rate is 63.7% - not good.  So, with all the tens of thousands of hubs still residing on the Hub Pages 'Mother ship', NO MORE THAN ONE OUT OF THREE UNIQUE VISITORS CAN BE ENTICED TO GO TO JUST ONE MORE PAGE ON THE HP WEBSITE!  ALMOST 2 OF 3 HP SITE VISITORS JUST WANDER OFF AFTER VISITING THEIR FIRST PAGE, ON HUB PAGES?!?  Most blog sites have thousands - tens of thousands! - of fewer blog articles, posts and even comments than we do here on Hub Pages, yet they can somehow entice many more of their readers to click over to a SECOND (or more) page/article/post on these other blog sites. If someone is visiting us to read a hub (article or commentary) about motor scooters by hubber X, then why aren't they clicking forward to read a buyers' guide to motor scooters by hubber Y, then an article on touring on motor scooters by hubber Z and finally to one of the silly motor scooter hubs by myself (when they then jump out of Hub Pages in disgust, of course!)  Can't HP Management see that a unique Visitor to hubber X's article, turns into three more page visits (to hubs by hubbers Y, Z and finally jeffduff).  More unique Visitors = more hub page views = more money earned (eventually) by everyone, right? AlexK2009 from Edinburgh, Scotland on December 19, 2016: @Rock_nj I just looked at one set of HP reviews and all bar one were negative. I have so far had little problem with them and as far as I know , not had anything unpublished. I did have a couple unpublished, one on Testosterone and another on the Satanic Ritual Abuse Hoax/Farce of 1987 which was rejected because of  describing some of the alleged ( and probably fictitious) abuse and mentioning the fact that similar accusations were made against early Christians and of course the Jews. I am however looking for alternatives to HP. I have a google blog on Blogspot and, having had a lot of  views for politics articles (my 30 day earning are currently triple the normal $2 or so which may be giving me false hope ) I did an AB test and published one on Blogspot  then did my normal promotion. It got fewer views than similar ones did on HubPages.  Since politics is a transient phenomenon these are definitely not evergreen and I do not care if they get unpublished eventually Still, a few alternatives that people found profitable and pleasant to work with would be welcome. John Coviello from New Jersey on December 19, 2016: Mr. Warwick, Google ""HubPages Reviews"" to see what some who have actually quit writing at HubPages have to say about this site.  I think it explains this Hub and the declining numbers quite well. I just had 7 Hubs unFeatured yesterday due to lack of activity.  One of them was quite active, so it had me scratching my head a bit.  Anyway, out of those 7, I unpublished 5 and kept 2 that were worth keeping for another go around in my opinion.  These unpublished will be showing up on this Hub soon.  More declines in the number of published Hubs.  Happening all over HubPages. Mr. Warwick on December 19, 2016: I have been thinking about joining a writing site such as the hub pages, but after reading this interesting piece I think I will just go ahead and check this site off of my list. There is no reason to join a web site like this, which has been losing it's writing base for several years now. As the title states numbers don't lie, and after doing the math the numbers keep tumbling downwards. It is very well documented here how the staff in charge has done absolutly nothing over the past few years to change this fact. Incredible people like Rock_nj, jeffduff, possum lover, AlexK2009, TheHoleStory, Jackclee lm, cam8510, HSP Connections, MyWebs, somethgblue, Dale Hyde, adrainlawerence, Lady Guinevere, kj force, DREAM ON, Dim Flaxenwork, janshares, Dyle Hyde, aa lite, and Barbara Kay have been trying to explain the on going problem here only to fall on ears that aren't listening to anything. What makes things even worse is these 20 people are not the only people who have been trying to make their words heard here for the past four years. I count at least 50 writers who have been trying to have their voices heard with over 230 comments, with absolutly no response from the staff. It's a shame, and it's almost like the 25 staff members who are suppose to be running this web site would rather be looking for another job, then doing this one. And if they keep up with all of the stupid changes they are making, then they are going to need another job, and real soon too! I've read here that many of the great writers on this writing site are planning on moving their hard work elsewhere, and that seems to be true with the dwindling numbers on published hubs. So with all this I am going elsewhere too. John Coviello from New Jersey on December 04, 2016: I follow over 1,500 Hubbers.  Back in HubPages' heyday, I'd get an email that between 10 and 20 new Hubs were published the day before.  Now, 5 new Hubs is big day.  Usually, I see 2 or 3 new Hubs each day.  Some days a big fat zero  Just some empirical evidence regarding the decline of publishing at this site. I can see why.  I used to try to publish 2 or 3 Hubs per month, sometimes more when I was motivated.  But, since I started hitting  roadblocks most of the time when I publish a new Hub, even ones that I worked on long and hard to make accurate and within their guidelines, I have lost my motivation.  They seem to find nitpicky issues that are frustrating to correct.  It's to the point where I don't even feel like publishing here anymore, and am reluctant to make changes to any Hubs that they randomly flag and unFeature whenever they feel like it.  I just have lost my motivation here.  Perhaps I'll give it another go at some point, but I don't want to hit their publishing roadblocks again.  I can see the appeal of going the blog route. Jeff Duff from Southwest Wisconsin on December 04, 2016: If you folks are not aware of Alexa Analytics, you should be.  Located at Alexa.com , they keep track of the website analytics for all but the world's smallest or least popular websites.  Of course, Hubpages.com is ranked there and shows a steep one-year drop in popularity which should make the site's management nervous.  But, I wanted to address something else measured by Alexa, namely, the 'Bounce Rate' for Hubpages.com . Now, the simple explanation for the Bounce Rate is that it measures the number of unique visitors who jump on to one of your website's pages and then leave the site - WITHOUT CLICKING THROUGH TO ANY OTHER PAGES WITHIN YOUR WEBSITE !  In other words, you have successfully lured a visitor on to your website, but then they choose not go to any OTHER pages on your website.  A website's Bounce Rate is one of the most important metrics used by current and potential website advertisers, as it is a quantitative measurement of a website's quality. The Bounce Rate is measured as a percentage of a website's visitors who leave the website after visiting their first webpage on that site, so a Bounce Rate of 100% means that each and every visitor leaves the website after visiting the first page - so this a disaster for a multi-page blogger or website master/owner.  A Bounce Rate of 0.0% means that every single visitor goes on to other pages within your website - meaning this is a wonderful miracle for the blogger or website owner (it's actually extremely rare to hit the 100% Bounce Rate, as you might imagine). The current Alexa rating for Hub Pages' website Bounce Rate is 63.1%, an improvement over three months over the previous Bounce Rate of 66.1%  That's the (modest) good news.  The bad news is that most experts on SEO (Search Engine Optimization) consider a Bounce Rate over 50 - 60% to be Poor or Very Poor.  Remember, Hub Page's Bounce Rate has improved (slightly) from 66.1% to 63.1%., over the last 3 months.  Even after scraping out many Hubpages for the specialty websites (Tatring, Owlpoop, etc.), shouldn't the wide variety of good Hubs remaining allow for a Bounce Rate significantly better than 63.1%?  Why doesn't it, what's wrong with the current design of Hub Pages to be as good as a 10 - 50% Bounce Rate, like the majority of English-language websites on the worldwide web?!  Don't we have enough good written content on Hub Pages to encourage a better Bounce Rate of (at least) 33 - 50% ?  IF SO, THEN WE REALLY NEED A WEBSITE PAGE REDESIGN, RIGHT?? possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on December 04, 2016: You bring a very interesting point to the table Alex. Where indeed are all of these hubs that the hubbers who remain here are writing. I also agree that it looks like they have decided to leave their hubs and go and write elsewhere. AlexK2009 from Edinburgh, Scotland on December 04, 2016: If there are thirty thousand hubbers and each writes one a month then we should be getting around a thousand new hubs a day. It looks like many have decided to leave their hubs here but go somewhere else or give up writing. possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on December 04, 2016: Not only has the new dawn of today brought the Hub Pages to an all time low with the total amount of people who are writing hubs here, but the week long rise in the total number of published hubs has vanished into abyss of the vast chasm as well. The remarkable amount of 575 brand new spanking published hubs has disappeared as quick as they showed up. Just like TheHoleStory commented above this all remains suspect, and maybe it's possible that somebody at the Hub Pages kept on hitting the wrong key on their computer key board for a whole week. TheHoleStory from Parsons, West Virginia on December 04, 2016: It was bound to happen sooner or later, and now the hub pages has turned back yet another chapter in it's young 9 year existence to the 30,000 hubber range. Just like in the 1930's things weren't great worldwide with widespread unemployment and poverty leading to the Second World War. The 1930's also saw new technologies like in the fields of intercontinental radio, and film, while the Hub Pages with all of their changes is sitting back now and watching it's writers and Internet traffic find other homes and sites around the globe on the World Wide Web. There has been a slight rise with the gain of a few hubs lately in the past week, however with the continuation of departing hubbers that remains suspect. possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on November 29, 2016: Attention, Attention to everyone who reads this hub!! This is great news for America. Today for the first time in a long long long time out of the blue we all gained TWO more hubs on the Hub Pages. That's right 2 more hubs since yesterday. This is extremely rare with all of the daily decline in numbers here at the Hub Pages. This means one of two things as of today, and that is either things are looking up or someone working at the Hub Pages hit the wrong key on their computer keyboard. Everybody stay tuned to this Hub and we will all soon find out the truth. Jeff Duff from Southwest Wisconsin on November 22, 2016: @AlexK2009:  You know, I think you're on to something!  There were successful books written about the business declines of Ford (the Edsel model), ""New Coke"", United Artists Studio (via the movie,'Heaven's Gate') and DeLorean Motor Company - plus a slew of dodgy solar and wind energy companies since 2008 ! I'm guessing that the next big 'business failure' book will be about America's Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. the Obama Health Insurance System), which should have crashed and burned before this time next year. On the other hand, I'm sure all of us Hubbers are hoping and praying that the next notorious business collapse won't involve Hub Pages International, Incorporated ! AlexK2009 from Edinburgh, Scotland on November 22, 2016: Possum Lover:  I am sure the 25 Staffers know what is happening but are being driven by the management above them. They have no power to change policies and are, perhaps, the monkeys rather than the organ grinders. I am ready to be told I am wrong on this of course :) I am beginning to think of my Hubs as online notes and may well be assembling some into an ebook if time and energy allow. possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on November 22, 2016: All 4 of you, AlexK2009, Rock_nj, jackclee lm, and jeffduff did an excellent and outstanding job describing exactly what is really happening to this once powerful writing site. It is truly a shame that the 25 Staff Members who are behind the scenes running the Hub Pages haven't been able to open up their eyes to the reality of what is happening here. Jeff Duff from Southwest Wisconsin on November 21, 2016: Hub Pages are one of the most Command-and-Control websites I have ever dealt with ... even a private in the U.S. Army has more say on his future than we writers have on Hub Pages!  For the last 3-5 years, can you think of one major HubPages decision, affecting it's writers, in which the HP management has actually consulted or discussed the decision with us writers before that decision was actually made? This would be of less concern to me if these arbitrary decisions were uniformly successful.  But history has been less-than-kind to some of the decisions made by HP management. Then, about a year ago, HP management decided to branch out into specialty sites - like TatRing, OwlPoop, etc. - and they took the radical step of seeking outside input for the names for these 20+ specialty sites.  This would really have impressed me ... except they appear to asked everybody back at Hub Pages Headquarters for suggested names for these specialty sites, including the Hub Pages' Mail Room Clerk and their Bathroom Attendants.  BUT, you'll never guess who they did NOT consult with ?  No, don't guess, because it would take you a month to figure it out!  The managers at Hub Pages did NOT consult with their Creative Partners, the HP Hubbers ... HP Writers.  No, I'm not kidding you, they really did not consult with their creative partners ... and we now have 20+ specialty sites, at least a third of which have strange and/or unmemorable names! There are several ways to test the attractiveness of new website and domain names, but these methods do not seem to have been used by the HubPages managers.  The next best way to measure the utility and memorability of website names is to do a survey among a large sample of potential users, but the HP managers seem not to have contacted any of the tens of thousands (or hundreds of thousands?) of Hub Pages Writers for the slightest input or suggestions.  The least - successful specialty sites could still be name-tested in hopes of finding and utilizing better site names, but the HP management will probably not do that, either. Of course, when you have a strong history of success in your business decisions, there is no need to consult with your Creative Partners! Jack Lee from Yorktown NY on November 21, 2016: I agree. The absolute zero link policy of HubPages is not good either. Also, the deleting of amazon links for all the niche sites is not helpful either. Why can't we recommend related books? John Coviello from New Jersey on November 21, 2016: I think that decline in traffic discussed in the forum was due to the election.  I saw it happen too around the election.  People were preoccupied.  Now my traffic is back to normal. I'm still not thrilled with HP's policies.  I just removed a Hub that had been active and doing well for a couple of years, because suddenly out of the blue they decided it was too commercial.  This time, I'm not going to make the effort to conform to what they want, so they can lose some revenue along with me.  This Hub was bringing in ad revenue and Amazon revenue. These kinds of actions don't make me excited to publish here, and obviously I am not the only one who feels this way.  Look at the awful stats in this Hub.  Less Hubbers and less Hubs published every time I check this Hub.  When will it end? AlexK2009 from Edinburgh, Scotland on November 21, 2016: @PossumLover Basically you are saying any change HP makes reduces traffic. It is amazing that, as far as I can tell, NONE of the changes since 2009 have increased traffic. This is an astounding feat of wring guessing and the people who decided on the changes would go far if they entered politics. possum lover from the backwoods just to the North of South Carolina on November 20, 2016: I stumbled across this strange forum on the Hub Pages - https://hubpages.com/community/forum/138824/traffi...  What I found so strange about this is that these hubbers act like the traffic falling here on the hub pages is all of a sudden something new. Most of them are not new hubbers either. As the stats on this hub show the numbers have been falling here for years, and continue to do so as the staff here at the hub pages make more changes. I guess these hubbers have finally smelled the coffee, and woke up to the reality that we all have been aware of for years. TheHoleStory from Parsons, West Virginia on October 26, 2016: I am 100% behind your theory concerning the sudden recent spike of 694 additional hubbers. As you noted there is absolutely no apparent reason for this other then pure manipulation. It's very evident as we witness all of these new hubbers quickly disappearing that they never existed in the first place. Shame on who ever was behind this shrewd and devious act, because it won't be long before we are in the 30,000 hubber range. I'm very interested in hearing what your other readers have to say about this. Jack Lee from Yorktown NY on May 24, 2016: Very interesting stats. I didn't realize there were so many hubbers back then. I was one of the transplants from Squidoo. Overall, I like Hubpages and have continued my publishing here. My experience with google is actually pretty good. If anything, HubPages and Squidoo both benefited from getting high page rankings. I found the other search engines like Bing and yahoo just don't measure up. I'm at a loss to explain the relations between google and HubPages. I'm not complaining just like to understand it. Just hope Hubpages survive for the long haul. Chris Mills from Traverse City, MI on May 23, 2016: My pageviews have consistently gone up over my four years on HP, but my earnings plateaued and have remained the same fora very long time. AlexK2009 from Edinburgh, Scotland on May 23, 2016: My traffic seems to be declining on HP no matter what I do. On Blogspot I am getting more. Soon my traffic here will decline so much I will have to move to blogger or (shudder) ExpertsColumn. It seems HP have lost the plot completely. Pity"
37,Choosing a User Name and Profile on HubPages,community," Welcome to HubPages! If you are new to this wonderful online community of writers, you may want to read these suggestions before you set up your account. When you set up your account, you will need to choose a Hubpages username. Your Hubpages username and Hubpages Profile name are one and the same, and it will be the world's window to your writing on HubPages. So it is important to choose a name that captures the essence of you. Important: You cannot change your HubPages user name after it is created. On HubPages you will have a public profile page. This is kind of like a public home where your friends can find you. The profile page includes: Here is the link to my profile page, as an example: http://hubpages.com/profile/wannabwestern YOUR profile link will appear exactly as mine, but replace ""wannabwestern"" with the name you select when you join Hubpages. Your user name is essentially your byline. What is a byline, you may ask? In the good ol' days of print newspaper publishing, the byline was simply the author's name. Some people on HubPages publish on HubPages as their given, legal name while others choose creative pseudonyms. Many literary and children's authors use pseudonyms too. Dr. Seuss was a pen name for Theodore Geisel, and Samuel Clemens was the real name of Mark Twain. A few authors who sign up on HubPages (or HP for short), do so with the mistaken idea that their user name is like a secret account number, so they choose a name that looks like the password to their bank account. Not so! Your profile is in fact your public statement to the world of who you are. Your name, your biography, and your photo should represent the tone and topics that you will be sharing as an HP member. You want your bio and profile picture to appear on page one of the HubPages Hubbers section, so you want your name to be memorable. Avoid name combinations that include your first name and your birthday, which isn't memorable and it can give away private information which can undermine your password security on other online sites. When choosing your HubPages user name, you may want to consider using word play (not to be confused with WordPlay, that name is already taken), double meanings, your HubPages content, and your interests and philosophy. Since we don't get to select our own names at birth, the feeling of power we get from selecting our own profile name can go to our heads. I know personally as a writer, I sometimes suffer from an acute sense of wry personal irony. Writers after all are a creative and intense lot. But try to keep your HubPages name appropriate to your content. So here is where I get on my soap box. Now for an example: at HubPages, many writers love to actively participate in the forums. Usually, people who have very long profile names or names that end it long number combinations end up having their name shortened. Most people call me wannab or western. That's fine by me. So say, just for the sake of example that you choose a profile name like Schnauzer Lover. Your name will probably be shortened to ""Schnauzer"" but who knows? Likewise, using the names of serial killers, celebrities, or other famous people is discouraged. You can crop your profile photo once you upload it. Most Hubbers (that's the name we HubPages authors like to call ourselves) use a personal photo of themselves. I try to vary my profile picture by changing it from time to time. Currently I'm using a macro-photo of a beautiful fall-blooming Lantana that I took outside of my house on my picture. By the time you read this I may have changed it. Sometimes I use a picture of myself from my toddler years in the early 1970s, because many of my articles are child-friendly book reviews and parenting articles. I try to keep my articles lighthearted and my profile picture reflects this. What you want to avoid is posting a profile picture that makes you look like you are writing from the state penitentiary or like you are a candidate for America's Most Wanted. If the only photo you can rustle up makes you look like you are taking a mug shot at the local police station, think twice about posting it. Pictures that have poor quality lighting or pictures that make you look sullen, angry, or unhappy are probably poor choices for your profile photo. At the other extreme, you may want to be wary of using pictures of beautiful people who simply aren't you. if you are fortunate enough to look like a supermodel or be married to a dentist, then by all means, post your glamorous photos of yourself. However, please avoid using photos of celebrities. This is a misrepresentation of who you are and most Hubbers who have posted on the matter all agree that this route makes you look a little bit egotistical. Also, please remember the HubPages policy of no erotic or sexually explicit photos on your profile picture. I am not the HubPages police but I might as well mention this policy since you are new. Add a personal introduction to your profile page gives you the opportunity to tell something about yourself, your areas of interest, or even your philosophy of life. Do try to capture the essence of your profile information in your first sentence, because this text will be reproduced on the HubPages Hubbers section. This is section is kind of a directory of HubPages writers, and is a useful way to explore the writers you want to read on HubPages. New HubPages Writers like to share information about their personal lives, their professions, or their areas of interest. Once you have published HubPages articles called Hubs here on HP, you can link to them too. I'm not the poster child for writing HubPages profile pages, but I never miss an opportunity at a little shameless self-promotion! Do check out the intros of other HubPages authors. Unlike your HubPages username/profile name, you can change the content of your profile page anytime you want. Many authors who have accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networking sites include links to their accounts on those sites from their profile page. The profile page is also a place where you can promote your online business. Now that you know about profiles and usernames, go ahead and sign up! Axiliea Carter from Malaysia on August 09, 2020: Thanks this is very helpful! Abby Slutsky from America on June 05, 2020: Thanks for sharing. I just signed up and am getting ready to craft a bio. I am looking forward to posting here. Nicu from Oradea, Romania on February 08, 2015: For me is too late to change my profile name, but I think I choose a good one. LisaKeating on March 23, 2014: Agree. Should have read first but very helpful. biblicaliving from U.S.A. on November 11, 2013: It is a bit of a shame that you can't change your username later on, or for that matter establish a number of ""pen names."" Hub pages is a way to make some ""fun"" money, especially if you like to write. Good Hub! Carolyn Augustine (author) from Iowa on July 14, 2013: This is one of those hubs that I wrote before HubPages put together their fantastic introductory materials for new authors. I'm glad the information was helpful to you both. You can always create a new account, but that has its pros and cons. Good luck to both of you! Emberfae on June 12, 2013: Thank you for all this information, I wish I found you before I signed up, I would have done it through you. Right now I cant even figure out how to upload a picture for my profile and change the background.  It keeps saying it doesn't exist when I pick the picture from my gallery on my tablet.  But thanks again for the useful information. teachertalking1 on January 15, 2012: Thanks for the informative post - like the others, I'm sorry that I've read this AFTER I've set up my account!  I will enjoy exploring all that HubPages has to offer and to figure out the ""rules"" - I must admit, I'm a bit nervous about breaking one of the many that exist! Carolyn Augustine (author) from Iowa on October 02, 2011: I've heard that before lyricwriter! I would sure like that too. The HubPages staff has greatly expanded their online help and instructions since I wrote this, so hopefully this type of information is being disseminated to more new Hubbers than in the past. Richard Ricky Hale from West Virginia on October 01, 2011: Sure wish I would have found this page when I first started. Very useful. Carolyn Augustine (author) from Iowa on July 02, 2011: Hi Amber, If I understand your question correctly, then signing up under someone benefits the person you signed up under but it doesn't affect your earnings at all. I think the HP policy is that the person you sign up under gets 10% of your impressions. HubPages gives up 10% from their take, so it doesn't affect you at all. If you sign up under someone who is active and who has a relatively high score, they may leave more comments on your hubs, thus helping your score to increase more quickly. Why? Because 10% of a successful hubber's earnings could be a good payoff for that little bit of effort. Amber Murphy from Orlando, Florida, USA on June 30, 2011: Can you explain to me how to sign up under someone else's name and why that would be of benefit to either of them? TO my knowledge, I am signed up under no one. I am considering starting fresh with a more catchy name. I signed up 2 years ago and am only now getting serious about posting. It's long overdue! Carolyn Augustine (author) from Iowa on February 16, 2011: Ingenira I have enjoyed all of your articles that I have read so far, thanks for the comment! wpexplorer, I understand where you are coming from. You can always create a new account and be sure to sign up under my link! ;D I do wish that it was possible to make changes to a HubPages user name but it makes sense that we can't. Some people could use changing their identities on HP for untoward purposes. However, this information isn't something that someone who has just stumbled upon HubPages and wants to give it a try may know right away. Something tells me that this article is always too late to be of use to most people. wpexplorer from USA on February 16, 2011: Darn, I wanted to change my name as the account was created a while back when I didn't really think I would use Hubpages - now I am really liking it. bummer...Useful hub though, thanks! Ingenira on February 06, 2011: It is easier for me to write about tonnes of other topics than writing about myself. I am still learning... Carolyn Augustine (author) from Iowa on November 14, 2009: Thank you so much for reading! I appreciate you dropping by again. Benny Faye Ashton Douglass from Gold Canyon, Arizona on November 13, 2009: I thank you for hub info on choosing the new user name. thanks for sharing. blessings. creativeone59 Carolyn Augustine (author) from Iowa on November 12, 2009: elayne001 that is a good point. I usually go for months with the same photo, then get into a mood where I change once a week or so until I settle into a photo I really love, then I stick with that for a while. Photos help us identify our Hubber friends and if they're constantly changing it IS hard to keep up. Thanks for your worthy comment. I appreciate you reading. Elayne from Rocky Mountains on November 12, 2009: I appreciate your suggestions. The only thing that is frustrating to me is when the hubbers change their picture so often. I get attached to their old one and when it goes missing, I feel a little lost. Just my opinion. Carolyn Augustine (author) from Iowa on November 12, 2009: Thanks Hello, hello! Hello, hello, from London, UK on November 12, 2009: These are all great information,  thank you. Carolyn Augustine (author) from Iowa on November 11, 2009: Wait, did you do this hub already? I keep thinking my ideas are fresh and finding out they're yesterday's news. If you do start out fresh feel free to sign up under my link. :D dohn121 from Hudson Valley, New York on November 11, 2009: Why didn't anyone think to do this before?  What a wonderful job you did!  I kinda sorta wish I could start fresh just so I can read this hub first ;) Thanks, wannabwestern.  You are such an innovator!"
38,3 Ways to Increase Your Earnings on HubPages,community," Karen Hellier is a freelance writer and eBay entrepreneur. She lives happily in the mountains of North Georgia with her husband and her dog. Photo by Karen Hellier I have been writing on HubPages since January of 2012. I love writing here because HubPages gives me the freedom to write about anything I want. I have started some blogs since 2012, but they are all about specific topics, and I often have the urge to write about things that don't fit into those topics (saving money, coupons, and eBay). So I come to HubPages and let my creative juices flow. Recently I have seen a lot of new HubPages members complaining about how they aren't making much money. It makes me smile and shake my head because I know it takes a lot of time and patience to earn money on HubPages. And every time there is a shakeup on google, it feels like starting from scratch all over again. But over the past year, I have discovered some ways to earn more money on HubPages, and I am sharing these with you now.  The best way to earn money on HubPages is to write a lot of good quality content. And when I say a lot, I mean a lot! The more content you have, the more people will find your work and read it, and the more money you will make. You may have seen the statistics of some HubPages writers that show they make a certain amount of money each month. They specialize in writing articles on the same subject, and that is good because they become experts on that subject. You don't necessarily have to write about the same subject but it does help other HubPages members get to know you and follow you for content on a subject they are interested in, such as Eddie Carrara, a car expert, and Alex Rose, a beauty expert, according to the HubPages front page. Personally, I am all over the place and write about whatever I feel like. My husband and I cruise a lot, so I write about cruising sometimes, and other trips we take. We have both been divorced, and I write about how this time I have found true love, and so I write about relationships a lot. Those hubs seem to get a lot of views. People love a good love story! I also save money with coupons and sell on eBay, so I do write about those topics as well. I would suggest you try to have a major topic and stick to that to gain a reputation, but exercise your writing chops on other topics you also enjoy, to keep your creative juices flowing. Make sure to write hubs that include as many of the following parts as possible:   When I first started writing on HubPages, there were a lot of contests to write so many hubs in so many days. Those were the days when there were no requirements to write a certain amount of words. Today, HubPages likes to see articles of at least 1,000 words, so it takes more time to write good quality articles. But even so, I suggest you challenge yourself to write as many hubs as you can. Set a goal for yourself, especially if you are just starting out on the HubPages website. Try not to worry about the money too much, but instead concentrate on the quality of your articles and the quantity. Maybe challenge yourself to write one good article a week for your first month, and then boost that up to two each week, etc.  Here I am on a cruise writing a travel hub about our cruise ship! Photo by Chuck Hellier There are many tutorials on how to become an Amazon Affiliate with HubPages. If you live in a state that allows you to become an Amazon affiliate, definitely do it and you will see your earnings increase if you use Amazon appropriately. HubPages is all about promoting quality work, and that includes using Amazon links appropriately. That means not just throwing an Amazon link about something you mentioned in an article into the midst of it. It means writing reviews about products you have actually used, and inserting an Amazon link into that hub for the exact article you reviewed. Or, if you are telling the story of your recent safari to Africa to photograph wild life and you specifically talk about the camera you used while on safari, and why it works well under those conditions, then you can insert an Amazon link into that article. But if you are writing an article about wedding planning, throwing an Amazon link for reception decorations into your article is not cool, and looks like spam. Readers won't trust you and HubPages won't like it. This one suggestion has actually doubled my HubPages earnings in the past six months that I have been doing it. I once wrote an article on HubPages about how HubPages is like a garden, and you need to tend to it regularly. This is SO true, and I honestly have doubled my daily earnings since I have been doing the following: Logging into my HubPages account and choosing two hubs each day to update. I log into my account, click on the word ""published"" across the top, and that gives me a chronological order of when my hubs were published.   The first time I did this, I only looked for grammatical errors. After I completed a check on each hub that I have written for those errors, I realized some of my hubs didn't have anything written for the profile area. So I went back and chose two at a time and am still in the process of updating that, and adding the copyright statement. When I am done with all of these corrections on my hubs, I will then start from the beginning again to look for YouTube videos that I can add to each hub that will enhance them. This constant updating works because Google picks up on the fact that the articles are being updated and they get a boost in standings on Google, so more people will see your work as it rises to the top in Google searches.  This was my office for three days in our hotel lobby in Amsterdam where I updated hubs and wrote travel hubs in the morning and explored Amsterdam each afternoon. Photo by Karen Hellier Going back and revising all of your hubs may seem like a lot of work, but in my experience, it has been totally worth it, and I am actually doubling my HubPages earnings every day. We are not supposed to discuss exact earnings here on HubPages so I am not going to do that, but the stats don't lie. Give this a try and then come back and tell me if following these three tips, especially the updating, works for you to increase your HubPages earnings. Or, if you do them now, which one of these tips works best to increase your earnings?  Addendum: The purpose of this hub is to help HubPages members earn more money. Since I have never read any books on that nor seen any Amazon products related to that, I am not including an Amazon product in this hub, even though I do suggest it to other HubPages members! © 2017 Karen Hellier BRENDA ARLEDGE from Washington Court House on April 22, 2021: I've been working on updating some of my Hubs. This is a very helpful article. Karen Hellier (author) from Georgia on April 22, 2021: C E Clark That is true, and I will check out Wrylit. Thanks for the tip. Karen Hellier (author) from Georgia on April 22, 2021: Jeff, You are most welcome. Karen Hellier (author) from Georgia on April 22, 2021: Jeff, I was trying to do that also, but sometimes it seems as though when I start to edit articles, my earnings drop lower for a few days? That doesn't make any sense, but that is what happened. Karen Hellier (author) from Georgia on April 22, 2021: Gupi, You are welcome. I hope you found something helpful from it. Karen Hellier (author) from Georgia on April 22, 2021: SARA, You are welcome. Karen Hellier (author) from Georgia on April 22, 2021: Thank you Oke.

Karen Hellier (author) from Georgia on April 22, 2021: Okay, good. Maybe yu could write a hub about your mission and any improvements you have made? Karen Hellier (author) from Georgia on April 22, 2021: Owante, I hope something in this article helps you. Karen Hellier (author) from Georgia on April 22, 2021: MG Singh emge, That is true...just trying to give a few tips of advice that have helped me. Karen Hellier (author) from Georgia on April 22, 2021: Tammy, I had the same problem previously, but then changed the way I presented them...without an introduction on top of the item, just adding a capsule underneath what I am talking about, and my Amazon sales have increased since then. Karen Hellier (author) from Georgia on April 22, 2021: Dale, Since I orginially started writing on HubPages they have changed the way authors can respond to comments a few times and it sometimes takes me a while to figure out how to do it. Thanks for the nudge though. I will try to do better in the future. Tammy Winters from Oregon on October 14, 2020: Thanks for sharing your tips. I haven't had much luck with Amazon Links and I believe HubPages don't like when I add them without good cause. Dale Anderson from The High Seas on September 21, 2020: Hmm. I want to thank you for sharing your thoughts here but, when I look below, it seems like you never respond to any comments on your articles. I wonder why? MG Singh emge from Singapore on September 19, 2020: Very interesting article but everybody has to follow his genius. Karen Hellier (author) from Georgia on September 19, 2020: I am glad you enjoyed it and I hope it helps you. Owanate Godwins on September 19, 2020: I'm deeply grateful for this informative article, Karen. I'll endeavor to apply the wisdom revealed therein. Jo Miller from Tennessee on July 27, 2020: Good advice.  I'm afraid I don't do most of these regularly enough but on a mission now to do better.  Thanks for the info.

J Zod from Nairobi on October 13, 2018: Thank you so much for the informative article Karen. C E Clark from North Texas on May 30, 2018: Some good advice here.  I would add that posting your articles on FB and Pinterest can get you more traffic, too.  I recommend that you check out Wrylilt on HubPages for even more good pointers. Kenneth Avery from Hamilton, Alabama on March 13, 2018: Thank you for sharing such great advice. I will definitely think about all that is in this hub. Keep up the fine work. Shaloo Walia from India on March 03, 2018: helpful tips! Laura Barbera from Florence, Italy on December 13, 2017: Hi Karen, I just registered in this platform and looking for some article on wedding photography, I read your articles. Thanks for sharing all this info, they make me want to write. I live in Florence, Italy, I am a wedding photographer and a psychotherapist, I have no idea how much this platform is following because here in Italy it is not very well known, but I would like to try to start writing about myself and my passions. Thanks for the stimulus that your article gives me. Larry W Fish from Raleigh on September 30, 2017: A great article, Karen. Thanks for sharing your tips on how to make more money on HubPages.

Heading over there to tend it now. Mary Wickison from Brazil on September 08, 2017: Thanks for the reminder. I needed the virtual kick in the backside about updating my hubs. I like the idea of just doing two a day, it makes the job doable. I'll report back with my findings. Louise Barraco from Ontario on September 08, 2017: Great tips Bill Holland from Olympia, WA on September 08, 2017: That horse already left the barn, my friend.  My earnings are ridiculous after all these years, but the good news is I don't care. I'm only here to interact with people like you.  To all who read this, the lady speaks the truth. Kristen Howe from Northeast Ohio on September 07, 2017: Great tips on how to make the most of your hubs. I never doubled my earnings or made payout since I've been here for four years. But I'm updating my old hubs and trying to get them into niches and hope to write new hubs this fall.  Thanks for the pointers."
39,"Kyler J. Falk: ""2021’s Most Likely to Go Viral""",community," Personal development is a never-ending activity in every aspect of my life. It's better that I change actively, than sit and wait for others A card, keychain, and a mug... cute. Please don't send me anthrax. Kyler J. Falk To my surprise and stoking my suspicion, I won HubPages', ""2021's Most likely to go viral,"" award. I wasn't expecting to win anything in the Hubbie Awards—ever—but it is nice to know that there are some individuals out there letting me live rent-free in their heads. Having accidentally stumbled upon the announcement of my win in an email asking me for my address, I felt the community deserved a bit of recognition for their contributions to my winning this not-so-prestigious award. This entire article is going to be flippant, and I'm going to pour as much satirical angst into it that I can. So, without further ado, let's take a closer look at the drippings HubPages swept my way as a token of their good graces and benevolence. This card is covering everything in glitter. Kyler J. Falk When I first opened the box that my HubPages goodies came in, I could hear a rattling within that I thought was going to be broken glass. Luckily, it was just a keychain jiggling around inside the cup. I want to talk about the envelope containing the cute little card, though, because I'm still trying to get the glitter off of my hands. As much as I love sending a good glitter bomb to former bosses, ex-lovers, and generally irritating people, I have to say that I would never send one to someone I valued. Receiving this card smothered in glitter has taught me once more that glitter is a weapon of mass destruction. This deadly weapon has coated my clothes and hands in glitter, and every time I see a sparkle on my skin it reminds me of the time I got glitter in my eye as a child. If HubPages really knew me, or at least read my bio, they would've chosen sand or that workshop moss you see on wood sculptures. I'm an ocean and forest man, and as flamboyant as I can be sometimes, glitter just doesn't fit my bill. Of course, I'm just being flippant with all of this for the sake of an article, I truly appreciate the gesture deep down. I'm appreciative of the gesture regardless of effort put into it. Kyler J. Falk Kyler Falk- ""Most likely to go viral"" 2021 Thank you for your contributions to HubPages! You are a shining star, and your passion and honesty make you a valued member of the HubPages community! — HubPages After cleaning off all of the glitter this card covered me in, I was finally able to read what HubPages had to say within the card. I was half-hoping for a dollar bill to fall out, but the words within were enough to sate my need for valuable content. ""Valuable,"" within this context is being used as a double entendre, of course. With all of the content I create, the various different topics I write on, ""honesty,"" felt like a weird fallback option for a personal trait to compliment. As authors who focus on evergreen content, are we not expected to write honestly? This seemingly-weak offering of words made me wonder, ""Is there a problem with honesty here at HubPages?"" By all appearances, the only ones who seem to have a problem with honesty and transparency are those who plagiarize, and of course those who dictate the ongoing development of HubPages itself. I'm happy I could be a part of the honest crowd in the community, though, and despite how impersonal the compliment feels I am grateful for the kind words. I'm pretending to sip a beverage from the cup, because I guess this is what normal people do when they receive a mug. Kyler J. Falk When I first took the mug I received into my hands, I wondered how anyone could drink out of such a small cup. My hand size is below average, but still this mug felt absurdly small. In fact, it is smaller than any of the mugs I currently have within my home. It isn't as if the size of the mug even matters, my girlfriend is the only one who actually uses them. I only drink water and protein shakes, and on especially frivolous evenings of self-exploration I'll drink whiskey out of my special whiskey-only glasses. Unfortunately, her hands are bigger than mine, and she goes out of her way to buy XXL mugs for her beverage-holding endeavors. Nonetheless, I felt I needed to keep with the cliché of pretending to sip out of my gift-mug for a selfie. As you can see in the picture above, that's my balcony overlooking our koi pond. It's nice to go out there and listen to the splashing fountains, and to style on the passersby with my unmatched mug collection. Just to add on to the flippancy a little more, I'm not sure which would've been more valuable: This mug that was made in China, or a letter stating that HubPages replaced the mug with a letter to save on the disproportionate pollution that supporting Chinese industry causes. It's lonely at the top, or so I'm told. Kyler J. Falk Last, but most certainly not the least by any measure, I'd like to address those of you within the community who voted for me. You have my undying gratitude for making me feel like there are at least some individuals within the community who regularly keep me on their mind. It's you, and only you that keep me producing personal pieces here at HubPages. I've been banned by HubPages staff for simply asking questions, but the community was there to pick me back up and support me when I was pushed to the ground. Where no one else will listen, I always find a sympathetic ear here in our little slice of author-paradise. When things are getting dark, I know I can turn to our most devout author-friends for a guiding light. As I type this, we are all sitting here uneasy about the future of the HubPages community. Changes that are in the favor of business and profit over the community are being made, and the blatant disregard for our requests makes sentiments for the future uneasy. I find my respite in the staunch fact that even should HubPages fail itself and us, we as a community will continue to thrive elsewhere. I came to HubPages looking for a place to yell into the void, and instead I've found a place full to the brim with love, understanding, and acceptance. There isn't a better set of community members I could ever ask for, even if many of you—including myself— are hard to get along with. Thank you for everything you guys have done and continue to do for me! © 2021 Kyler J Falk"
40,Build a Wordpress Blog to Drive More Traffic to Your Works.,community," Don is a Writer and a Storyteller. He has published over 9 books on varied subjects along with many articles and commentary on his blogs. This simple logo belongs to Wordpress.a top blog development and management resource. Don Bobbitt I have several popular Blogs on the web where I exhibit my writings. It seems that eventually, we all end of with more than one Blog these days. If you have been writing on the web for a while, all of your success' and failures, good ideas and bad, are out there, located in all of those strange places where you originally placed them, as you learned how to use the web. I'm no different than the average writer as I listened to a lot of other people in the web writing world and I later realized that I was often a little too fast in taking their advice. It turned out that some of these ""knowledgeable people"" were actually giving out valuable advice, while others, sad to say, were just manipulating people like me, the novice web writer, for their own gains. I admit it, I was probably duped by some sites that were popular at that time and are now either shut down, or are just ""dead sites"" with no real audience any more. Using the advice of others and often discovering the errors or my decisions were hard learned lessons for me, but, I can say that eventually, I did learn my lesson. Some of the sites and Blogs I once used, I ended up deleting and removing my works. Other of my own Blogs had audiences, for their specialized subjects, and I still write on them regularly, even though they are for, periods of time, not the main focus of my interests. So, as you might imagine, after years of my own evolution of interests and improvements in my writing skills I have an insane menagerie of sites for exhibiting my writings,that, quite honestly, I have been hard pressed to find a way to combine into one central resource. So, the questions I had for myself were; Eventually you, like myself, may end up being a writer who is wondering how to get more traffic to your articles. Of course, we all attempt to write quality and entertaining articles that will, in themselves, draw readers. We all learn, eventually, that we must become conscious of the Technology of Management of our writings on the web. We end up using such things as keywords, diverse writing styles and formatting techniques along with other technical ""devices"" and work them into our writings to make the search engines rank our works as highly as possible. The problem for us, so often, is that even after all of this, we know that we need to get more exposure to more readers. Many of us start looking for other sites that will drive people to find us and our works. I will not even list all of the options that you could and probably have tried in your efforts to get yourself and your writings recognized. These specialty sites are so numerous that just a search for what site might suit a writers needs can take weeks. I am just going to suggest that you consider using Wordpress as it is a free, yet professional tool you can use to improve your article visibility. WordPress is a very popular company that provides some quality tools for people to use and generate their own ""web page or Blog"". It provides the templates and tools for a non-technical person to easily set up their own site, utilizing a set of very easy to use templates and what they call ""widgets"" First of all, I should mention that there are two paths for the new user of WordPress. You can take the Wordpress.com path and they automatically update your template, widgets and other of their tools automatically for you. There are no special skills required of you. But there are certain limitations to what you are allowed to do. For example, you will only get a limited number of HTML commands that you can use in certain places, for one. One warning though, a Wordpress.com site is not allowed to be commercial. I other words, you cannot build a store, with checkout and credit card acceptance or other such tools. But, Wordpress does allow you to add PayPal Buttons in their sites where you can utilize Paypal to collect money from your customer. The other path is to take is the Wordpress.org one where you are allowed a great deal of freedom in how much you can modify the HTML code in their templates and widgets. But, be aware. when they issue changes and updates, they do not accept any responsibility for code changes that you or a sub-contractor might have made to their standard tools and widgets.. So, if you get into the HTML code and make mistakes, or if you make changes that conflict with their requirements, then you had better be a good code trouble-shooter, because you will be on your own. Even so, when it comes to building a commercial site that you can use to build a store and all of the necessary business sales tools, WordPress.org is the site for you. WordPress does provide cheap domains and hundreds of very good templates for use, some of which are free and others that you must pay a relatively small price annually to use. And, at any time, you can consider changing templates by using their tool that allows you to try other templates and see how you site will look, without it changing or deleting any of your data. There are other WordPress restrictions and rules, but you can read about them if you go to their site. Back to me and my personal problem. I thought for a while, and I decided that what I really wanted was a site that allowed me to; So, after some serious study of the barely usable WordPress Help system, I was confident that I could accomplish what I wanted using Wordpress.com. And, after investing less than $20 with WordPress for my own domain and finding a great free template, I went to work. Presently, I have written dozens of unique posts and the same number of what they call ""Pages"" I have pop-down pages at the top of my site that allow me to list links to categories of my writings. I have also written quite a few posts that describe certain of my articles, what they are about and a link for others to follow to my actual article. Has my traffic increased significantly, yet? Well, I am seeing new traffic to my articles that wasn't there before. You see, just like my home hosting site has a large and faithful audience of readers, so does a WordPress managed site. So if I use the appropriate keywords and tags I get some, at times, significant interest in my referenced Hub. I am tapping into this new audience, slowly, with new WordPress Followers and Readers. If you remember, when you started out with your home hosting site this is a long-term process of 50% Action and 50% Learning. I think the greatest thing, to me, about my new WordPress site is that I now have a path for managing my future writings and evolving my older works over to the appropriate site in the future. And, I get to have fun just writing about anything I want at times. I get to write nice, short and (i hope) interesting and creative works, without it having a major effect on my overall Hub score or Googles attitude about my works. And, as I evolve my writings, I have a place that leads to everything of mine, on the web; in fact, check out my main Wordpress site. This content is accurate and true to the best of the author’s knowledge and is not meant to substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional. Vegas Elias from Mumbai on June 25, 2015: Well written and informative hub. However, the Word Press blog will also have to be promoted. Paul Richard Kuehn from Udorn City, Thailand on June 23, 2015: This is a very interesting and useful hub which I am bookmarking for future reference.  What you say makes a lot of sense, and it is about time for me to get my own blog going.  Voting up and sharing with Hubpage Followers. Kelly Kline Burnett from Madison, Wisconsin on March 30, 2015: For years, I have wanted to open a Wordpress site. Recently I just started. From what I am reading the traffic from HP is stellar (no surprise as HP does a fantastic job) but the point of reference for a central reference is the benefit I could foresee. I am in the process of developing affiliate relationship for the site so now I know I really need to kick that plan into place. Very helpful hub, voted up! (BTW I believe the self-hosted website now will accept commercial plug-ins, but that is simply a guess from my memory, so you may wish to research that and update as necessary) Mark Tulin from Palm Springs, California on October 23, 2014: Thanks Don for this information Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on October 23, 2014: Mark Tulin- My Wordpress sites (I have 2) are not commercialized, but I do get a small but nice number of readers who click over to my Hub and read the article. And, I have the freedom of not be required to write some of my ""stuff"" within the constraints of HP. I can write; short articles, short poetry, photo journals, and other just silly things sometimes. Thanks for the read and coment. DON Mark Tulin from Palm Springs, California on October 22, 2014: Don, very helpful to me.  I got my Wordpress started and now I'm going to tinker with it a little more.  Thanks Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on August 03, 2014: nanderson500- I think you will like the site and the high quality templates they have for the user. Good Luck! DON nanderson500 from Seattle, WA on August 03, 2014: I had never hear of Wordpress before reading this, but I will definitely plan on checking it out now! It seems like a useful tool. Thanks for the great info! Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on January 07, 2014: cclitgirl- i understand your results after using Wordpress. It is not as powerful for you as HP as far as views. But, I took a different perspective. Because of the evolution of HP restrictions and rankings for ""personal articles, I have split my works into two categories. I only put what they call ""GREEN""  works on HP.I moved my more ""PERSONAL"" works to a Blogspot Blog where I was able to also include my own selected ADs. Once I had moved my works to this Blog, I set up a Wordpress Blog where I can use the IMPORT TOOL to keep copies of all of my Blogspot blogs as posts on Wordpress. Now my personal stuff, that HP would have ultimately not ""Featured"", are alive on my Google Blog with ADs and on my Wordpress site. I get more than enough views and reads and even comments to justify my decision. Good Luck to you. DON Cynthia Calhoun from Western NC on January 06, 2014: I've had an interesting journey with regard to WordPress.org. I started writing here at HP a couple years ago, and then about a year ago I created a paid WordPress site. The thing is, it was a personal website and yes, it helped point articles back here, but I'm thinking about deleting it. I have over 300 posts, but a fraction of the traffic. :\  Less than a year after joining HP, I had 100,000 views. A year after creating my blog? 20,000 views. HP just works better for me, I guess. Not sure. Granted, I didn't have a ""commercial"" site: it was more personal in nature and didn't have much focus - which is bad when it comes to KW. I think I just do better with the informational articles, haha. I hope you're staying warm on this very cold morning. :) Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on November 04, 2013: Suzanne Day- I understand your decision. Iam also leaving ""certain"" articles on HP. In my opinion, and the opinion of some of our peers, HP is slowly narrowing their focus onto only certain article subjects and presentation methods. Those of mine that fit with HP, I am also leaving and maintaining. But others, the more creative works, I am now placing onto WP because WP allows true freedom to the writer. Ihope we are both right and HP will continue to stick with us. Thanks for the Comment, DON Suzanne Day from Melbourne, Victoria, Australia on November 01, 2013: Wordpress is great to use for building your own blog. I've done it a few times, made some minor revenue etc. But in the end, because it is best to stick to one subject for a blog website, I prefer Hubpages because you can post on anything without having to be stuck with one topic per blog and the costs which also attach to that. You'll see me slowly moving my articles back onto Hubpages, which I originally removed. Also some of my older articles which I left on here are doing really well due to age, I think, so I won't be leaving Hubpages after all! Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on August 10, 2013: DDE- Thanks for the read and your kind words. I hope it is a useful reference for others. DON Devika Primić from Dubrovnik, Croatia on August 09, 2013: Great hub and certainly is most informative on the this topic a useful and worth reading hub Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on August 01, 2013: tillsontitan-I am having a pretty good time workong on my two WP sites. Although the ones I have at the moment are non-commercial, I am working on one  that is commercial. Have a great day! DON Mary Craig from New York on August 01, 2013: Useful and thought provoking.  I am still researching and trying to figure out what to do about WordPress and what cost is involved.  This was definitely helpful. Voted up, useful, and interesting. Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on July 12, 2013: tebo- I still love HP, even of they are going insanely towards forcing we writers to generate their version of ""Quality Hubs"". Other than that, I do have a lot of my more ""commercially popular"" works on HP. But, I desire more exposure for my works so I have started up a couple of sites on WP just to drive their followers to my works on HP. Thanks for the Read and Comment, DON tebo from New Zealand on July 12, 2013: Interesting information Don Bobbitt. I did read about WordPress when I first looked into writing on the web, but then came across Hubpages and thought I would try it out here for a while. Thanks for explaining how it operates. Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on July 09, 2013: Gail Meyers- I guess that is the point for us Hubbers. We need more exposure for our articles and nobody else is going to do it for us. So we need tools like WordPress. DON Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on July 09, 2013: younghopes- Good to hear that you are also using WP to drive traffic to your HubPages. As to going to WP.org and getting a new commercial domain, WP actually has a HELP page where they recommend what they call their top 4 companies for this. Gail Meyers from Johnson County, Kansas on July 08, 2013: I started out with on WordPress, but ended up dropping it after I got involved in other things.  However, I like your idea of pulling it all together in one place.  Maybe I should reconsider WordPress.  Thanks for the info! Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on July 08, 2013: heidithorne- Thanks You for the read and the Comment on my Hub. I see that you have your own custom system to get your Hubs more exposure, and I hope my Hub provides you with a few more good tips. DON Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on July 08, 2013: grayghost- God to hear that you are already on your own path with WoredPress. I hope it works out for you, and I suspect that it will. The more I get into the capabilities of the tools and templates, the more impressed I become. Also, just a tip, WP has a very active and helpful group of fellow users who can be invaluable for making your site a truly unique one. Good Luck, DON Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on July 08, 2013: phdast7- I understand. Often just getting a few minutes to be creative and write something good can be so rewarding while at the same time it can be very hard to get those minutes. I appreciate your read and comment on my Hub and I really appreciate that you shared it. Have a great day, DON Shadaan Alam from India on July 08, 2013: Useful information Don, i have a wordpress.com  blog which i am using to promote my HP and blogger blog on beauty care.I want to start a blog on wordpress.org but i am unsure about hosting and domain, how can i do that, any idea please help POSH by tori boutique from 1545 Union Lake Road, Commerce, MI, 48382 on July 08, 2013: Great article. A tip for everyone; I use ifttt(dot)com - it's a totally free site that lets you link together almost any site (except HubPages), but, for example, when I make a WordPress post I have ifttt set up to repost it onto: Twitter Facebook Instagram (if applicable) Pinterest (if applicable) Blogger My mailing list Immediately index links with bookmarking sites - THEN - I also have it set up to back up all of my images to an online data base So while you cannot use ifttt with HP, you can set up all of the other sites to promote your HP if you wanted to or whatever venture you would like). NOTE: I have no affiliation with ifttt, I just use it.  Hopefully this comment will not be removed. Heidi Thorne from Chicago Area on July 08, 2013: I just call it the great circle of web writing life. :) I use HP to promote my books and blogs. And I use my blogs and e-newsletters to promote my stuff on HP. You are very right in that traffic building is a multifaceted affair. Thanks for sharing your tips! Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on July 08, 2013: janetwrites- Thanks for the read and the comment. You are right about the other ways of driving traffic to your Hubs, but I also find that using WP is working very well for me and at the same time, I have more freedom in the structure of my more specialized articles that HP doen't like anymore. Have a great day, DON Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on July 07, 2013: CyberShelly- With your background using WordPress, you can obviously testify to the ease of building a professional site using their tools. I amglad that you liked the Hub, thanks for the read, DON Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on July 07, 2013: Internpete- I appreciate your read and your Comment. And, I hope others will read my article and find out how to use this simple way to drive more readers to their writings. Have a great day, DON Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on July 07, 2013: kashmir56- Thanks for the Read and the Comment. I am glad that you enjoyed the article. Have a Great Day, DON Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on July 07, 2013: ossmedia- Everything that you say in your comment is true and recognized as good practices for building traffic in Blogs. No question about it. My Hub, on the other hand is intended to show my fellow Hub writers a good too for them to use for broadening their exposure to a new and very large audience, that of the WP world. Thanks for the comment, DON Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on July 07, 2013: wheelinallover- As a business person who desires more profits, you obviously want more exposure for your site and your related Hubs. Good Luck to you. DON Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on July 07, 2013: torrilynn- I apprceiate the read and the comment. I am gald you now see ow to drive more people to your Hubs. Godd Luck. DON grayghost on July 06, 2013: Great information.  I just secured my web domain name and have settled on WordPress to host my site, more from comparing than any technical knowledge.  It was good to get this kind of affirmation from someone who has your level of expertise and experience.  I'm not doing as much general writing and I plan to be using my WP website for some other endeavors I've gotten off to (Genealogy fee Research, Antique and Historic ephemera marketing, Wild West history, and pickin' tales and great finds).  A  lot of that may spin it's way back to more involvement with HP, depending on what they're offering.  You need to write one of your great Hubs on ""how to find time to do all this stuff"", and keep people like me from getting lost in the underbrush! Enjoyed the Hub. Theresa Ast from Atlanta, Georgia on July 06, 2013: Informative and fascinating.   Managing to write a few hubs for HP (in addition to full-time teaching) is all I can manage to do, but I can see where this information could be very helpful to a lot of people on HP.   Good work.   Sharing. Janet Giessl from Georgia country on July 06, 2013: Very interesting and informative hub on how to use Wordpress for driving traffic to HubPages. There are many ways to drive traffic to HubPages. Creating a blog on Wordpress is definite a good way. Thank you for sharing this. Shelley Watson on July 06, 2013: I enjoyed this article Don, I have started a few websites using Wordpress and Genesis platform, with not too much success, however two people have asked me locally to write for them, so thought I'd start another website now re writing and editing services.  Got to keep busy...  Voted up, interesting, useful and shared. Peter V from At the Beach in Florida on July 06, 2013: Great info here. Free blogs are a fantastic way to promote stuff, get links and just have freedom to write whatever you want. I started out here on hubpages, but then moved to blogger where I get significantly more earnings, so I use hubpages more for links back to my blogs now. Either way, it is important to branch out and capitalize on the resources available! Thomas Silvia from Massachusetts on July 06, 2013: Hi Don great useful  information and advice within this well written article, well done ! Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on July 06, 2013: Billybuc- I understand. I just happened to start out on HP and as you know, you end up with a lot of time and sweat invested in a site once you have a high volume of works on there. In fact, I had 30% more Hubs a year ago than I do now, and most of the ones I removed were essentially ""pushed"" off of HP due to their growing restrictions, especially their restrictions on Poetry, word count, and structure. So, who knows, as I learn more and more about WP, I may end up like yourself. Have a great day, my friend, DON Dennis Thorgesen from Beatrice, Nebraska U.S. on July 05, 2013: As a business; just like you we have articles all over the place. We do what cross linking we can. One of the platforms I write on for months I linked to the articles of other hubbers as well as my own. There are two platforms I will never write for again. Hub pages is one of five which let me edit after something has been published. Neither of the two I won't write for again will. At the moment my list of things to accomplish before posting another hub is about a mile long. Although many of my hubs are business related I have only found a way to link one to a website blog. What I find is social media sharing works too. For a while I was seeing over 300 visits a month through my Hub pages link tracker. It is taking time to optimize all revenue sources. This has been constantly updating since April 2011. torrilynn on July 05, 2013: Ive used wordpress before at my old job. I never knew that it could be so essential for blogs as wells. Thanks for the great information. Voted up. Bill Holland from Olympia, WA on July 05, 2013: Naturally I do just the opposite, Don.  LOL....I use HP to promote my blogs on WordPress.  I don't care about the HP platform other than a holding place for my articles that are submitted to magazines....my blog is where I do most of my promotion for things I care about in the writing business. Having said all that, you gave some good, valuable information for those just starting out in this internet business."
41,How to Write a Successful Humorous Article on HubPages,community," Theophanes is a New-England-based blogger, traveler, writer, photographer, sculptor, and lover of cats. I was told once the only reason someone clicked on my article is because this photo showed up and she wanted to know why. Inspire laughter and curiosity with your photos! I hear a lot of people say that some forms of writing are not profitable here on HubPages. These categories might include poetry, fiction, blogging, satire, and humor. Although I cannot speak for poetry or fiction the latter topics I can testify for. I think people lose hope on these pieces so you don't find many good ones written here - which is all the better reason to start writing some! Believe it or not there is an audience aching for a good belly laugh. This is the first thing I learned here on HubPages. Your title is important. Now, I admit, I love dry humor, where you are somewhat uncertain if a person is actually trying to be funny. However it's this type of satire that doesn't do well. People feel duped. They get angry and they leave colorful comments. I have never written an article that was completely made up. I just used facts that I wove in an entertaining way. My first attempts however where not fantastic. When I joined HubPages, five years ago, one of my first articles was called Where Bigots the Driving Force Behind the ""War on Drugs?"" I thought making the title a question would intrigue readers to click it, not really realizing that it made it sound a little too official. People didn't expect to be brought to an article that went through the history of US drug laws and once they were there they expected it to read like a textbook not like a sideways smirk. They took my references to the savaging of ""poor innocent white women"" by minorities seriously, not as a joke about how ridiculous the claims of the day were. OOPS. Today this article remains one of my personal favorites but it has only gathered a little over 1,000 visitors in five years, the same amount of hits some of my very short articles have received. This was a real blow. This year I continued on with the topic writing 15 Really Stupid Things Your Teenagers are Doing to Get High. It has been up less than a year and has gotten over 3,000 visitors and much love on FaceBook. As you can see I learned how to get my reader's attention with the title, making it almost accusatory but at the same time in a fun sort of way. Sadly I had to take this article down... advertisers apparently weren't amused I was pointing out their products were being used against manufacturer's instruction. Can't win them all I guess! Try to make up titles that grab people's attention and might even make them laugh. The more you can surprise a person the better off you'll be. Currently my top ranking humorously titled article is Pop! Goes the Speculum and Other Gynecological Horror Stories. See, that made you go, ""what?!"" I know, I can see you from here. Just kidding of course. This article has had 23,000 hits in two years. Not bad! It is also easily followed up by Killer Tampons - Society's Least Suspected Weapons of Womanly Destruction. This is a genuine dinosaur condom... or a finger puppet for your Little Godzilla. You choose. This is a photo of GT - the inspiration for my Evil Scheming Cockatoo story. It captures the mischievous twinkle in his eye perfectly. Picking a subject is sometimes hard for writers but don't let it be. You want to pick something that will get someone's attention and curiosity. You could pick a hot button issue like I did in Popes Gone Wild: What the Catholic Church Would Rather You Forget. Do note however that if you pick a hot button issue, whether you write it in a funny way or not, you will get negative feed back from time to time, especially if it is about religion or politics. You could shrink back and feel offended or you could be me and just laugh, knowing you've done your job well. History and biology are two very easy subjects to write with a humorous bent. In history pick a common theme and discover where it came from and why. From there write it up in your own style. It's very easy. I saw an article on toilet paper here that had me cracking up so I know it's not just me doing this. I chose to write The Wild and Crazy History of Condoms, The World's Most Disgusting Foods - A Culinary Challenge!, Three Real Cases of Haunted Dolls, Biblical Child Rearing Advice for Heathens,and All the Interesting People are in Hell to name a few. Of course the latter two religious ones were based on the Bible, a whole different can of worms, but one which I do consider history in its own way. Biology is another easy one. Do you love animals? A lot of people do. Use this to your advantage. You can tell personal stories like The Evil Scheming of a Vicious Cockatoo or The Many Animals I've Been Bitten By or you can write about wild animals and what they are up to like Crazy Facts about Fleas You Won't Believe. As you can see by the last example the animal in question doesn't even have to be lovable! You can even retell news stories like You Can't Sue a Gorilla - The Death of Common Sense in the US. You want to pick things that are relateable. My examples involving toilet paper, tampons, and condoms work well because everyone uses at least one of these objects and yet no one talks about it! This hush-hush nature automatically gives these topics the giggle factor. Sometimes your relatable factor will not be an object but an experience, as was the inspiration for Sarcastic Answers for Your Doctor's Stupid Questions, Interesting Ways to Make Telemarketers Cry, and Great Movies to Watch to Scar Your Children for Life. I mean who hasn't been sitting in front of a doctor wondering why he's asking you for the eightieth time today if you're pregnant, can't he read a chart?? And who hasn't wanted to go on a killing spree because tele-marketers are driving you up the wall? And most people have watched at least one children's movie that made the back of their mind go, ""HUH, that scene was kind of creepily adult oriented.""  Imagine my delight when I found this photo for my tampon article. It was PERFECT. We would all like our writing to stand for itself but in reality we live in a culture that praises ADD. Don't believe me? Just visit Twitter. ""I must have 1,000 people give me one sentence, none of which relates to any of the others!!"" At the very least have photos on your Hubs. I know it can be difficult finding photos so you'll just have to be creative. Maybe you know of a comic that relates to your story or have some other stock image that might work. If you can use at least one photo per section of your Hub. Putting videos in Hubs also seems all the rage today so make sure to go to YouTube and dig up some goodies there. There's probably a satirical song on there about anything and everything under the sun. Use them! I have linked a youtube video here of Tom Lehrer singing We Will all Go Together When We Go. Why? Because I felt it was time for a musical intermission and Tom Lehrer has always been a comic inspiration... Linking is a tool for all of us to find what we want and who we'd like to read. Linking your article to other like articles (even if they're not yours) will give you more credibility and sustainability. I know a lot of Hubbers feel like cowing to the search engines is not the most noble of efforts. Again, we'd like to think our articles are worth it to read without the extra fuss of saying, ""Hey! I'm here! And I can be commercial too!!"" But in reality some of these very simple things aren't going to hurt you any. There's a little check box when you are creating a Hub that says when you've achieved certain things in that hub that'll make it more search worthy. I explained above two of those things were photos and videos. Another thing is word count. Yes, the longer articles that keep people's interest do far better than short ones. I can tell you that from experience. One of the things HubPages doesn't mention however is the power of linking. Imagine you've bought a book by an author you've never heard of. You read the book and want to read something else by this author but you're not sure how to go about finding him or her. This is exactly what it is like when you write a hub with no links. When a reader likes you you should give them more of what they want. Link other related articles you've written at the bottom of your Hubs. I did this recently and it absolutely does help traffic. It makes you original article more searchable and gives you more clicks from curious people who want more of you. It is a win win. You can also incorporate links within your article as I have done with this one but be tactful about it or you will lose your readers. This is Priapus - An extremely over endowed and likely frustrated Roman God. Believers used to rub him for luck - seriously. This is a new lesson I keep learning. Apparently you can no longer use accurate medical terminology for any reproductive parts, you cannot say words like slutty, and you can't always get away with curses either. In fact I had an article refused for having the word sex in the title (which was Battle of the Sexes!) Many of the articles are still publishable, some are even able to get the exalted listed status, but they won't allow ads to be put on them - basically you'll have them up for free. I first figured this out after writing Nature's Most Extreme Dads and after spending two days researching until my eyes bled I wasn't about take it down. It is one of my all-time favorite articles and I have decided it is worth being up for free. You might not feel the same way but that's OK there is a solution, I wrote about it here in Colorful Euphemisms for Fellow Hubbers. It is after all much harder for a computer to realize naughty phrases than it is naughty words. I know. It sounds cliché, writers shouldn't write about writing, but the fact is other writers love to hear tips and tricks from people they like reading. Besides this HubPages is a wonderful, bright, and friendly community and it is nice talking to other Hubbers. Besides my euphemism article and the one you're reading I've also written Sometimes Hatemail is Fun which is a great lesson to anyone who dies a little inside whenever they get a negative comment. In the end don't give up. As I write this I have on average 800-1000 visitors a day to my Hubs and I plan to continue improving that. It does take work but we're doing what we love here and whatever we get for it is just an extra bonus so have fun! Go make some silly, funny, fantastic Hubs! We're all waiting! Blogs: Catching Marbles - A New England based travel blog Tales from the Birdello - For all homesteading and farming matters Deranged Thoughts from a Cluttered Mind - For funny personal anecdotes FaceBook: Through the Looking Glass Farm Typhani Brooks - Artist Instagram Twitter Theophanes Avery (author) from New England on November 29, 2019: No problem Luis. Welcome to HubPages! Luis G Asuncion from City of San Jose Del Monte, Bulacan, Philippines on November 23, 2019: Nice one.  I love this article.  This is a big help for new hubbers like me. Theophanes Avery (author) from New England on September 18, 2016: Hi, and thanks for commenting! I find with the humor hubs you have to have the title show it's obviously supposed to be funny. Trump's White  House doesn't do that.... Trump's Whitewashed House might be something you could try.... or something else that just shows it's not a serious political piece. Good luck! Lori Colbo from United States on May 31, 2016: Great hub. I've written politicAl and a few other satires as well as other types of humor pieces. Most have done very poirly, accept for other Hubbers. My last one was titled Trumps White House. Not diner well in view at all so far but been up only a week or two. Any suggestions on a better name? Theophanes Avery (author) from New England on November 10, 2013: Awe thank you Mary McShane. I love to hear I've made someone laugh! The world is always a better place when laughter is involved! Enjoy your reading. :) Mary McShane from Fort Lauderdale, Florida on November 09, 2013: OMG this was one of the funniest hubs I have ever read. Ranks in the top 3. lol The photos you found are so apropro to this hub, it is scary.  I've just started reading your work, I can't wait to read more. Very good advice mixed in with your humor. WTG! Theophanes Avery (author) from New England on April 07, 2013: Thank you Gcrhoads64. You are welcome. Always happy to inspire smiles! Gable Rhoads from North Dakota on April 07, 2013: You are hilarious. Following and +++. Thanks for the smiles. Theophanes Avery (author) from New England on April 06, 2013: You never know about zombies -seem to have quite the cult following these past few years. I know a few people who are really into them. They think B-rated zombie movies are where it's at. I can't blame them Aaah! Zombies! was a TERRIBLE movie - but funny. I look forward to that Alexk2009. I think that's the best kind of article but I may be biased. AlexK2009 from Edinburgh, Scotland on April 06, 2013: Nice one. I have started to write my serious articles with a lot of sarcastic humour, it will be interesting to see how they do, Dr Mark from The Atlantic Rain Forest, Brazil on April 06, 2013: I dont think I want to hang out at zombie forums, though! I think I am strange, but being strange only goes so far. Theophanes Avery (author) from New England on April 06, 2013: DrMark1961: Hmmm, perhaps zombies are not a common enough occurrence to peak people's interest? I think that'd need a special advertising (linking to zombie fans, forums, etc) to get readers. You might be surprised though, these things can hike up all of a sudden for no apparent reason. I don't know why your fierce dog breeds isn't doing better. That actually sounds funny and approachable, I'll have to check it out! :) Awe, why thank you for the comment Cantuhearmescream. Your screen name makes me chuckle every time I read it! You are welcome Mhatter99. May you have the best of luck with your clever little limericks. Martin Kloess from San Francisco on April 06, 2013: Thank you for the tips.  M-the-limericks-hatter. Cat from New York on April 06, 2013: Theophanes, Thanks for letting me in on your secrets! You are perhaps the funniest hubber around and if you say so then I'm there! Of course your hub also warranted some laughter which is always a huge plus! Vote up and awesome! Dr Mark from The Atlantic Rain Forest, Brazil on April 05, 2013: Writing humor seems like a real crap shoot. One of my poorest performing articles is ""How to tell your dog is a zombie"" (do people think this is for real?) and one of the best is a satire about Maltese and tiny dogs called ""Five Fierce Dog Breeds Your Family Must Be Afraid Of"". It seems like you can have 800 or 80 visitors, and there is no rhyme or reason to it. I think I have given up trying."
42,How To Increase Comments On HubPages,community," 56,516 comments received.  56,516 comments answered. 630 articles written in 22 months.  An average of 89.7 comments per article. I write this article because I have had several people of late ask me how in the world I get so many comments on my articles.  It’s a valid question and so I’ll share my own insights into this much-appreciated aspect of my HubPages experience. I am also discussing this because for me…..and this is just my opinion….comments are the most important statistic.  Again, we are only talking about my opinion.  I do not care about total views. I don’t care about those silly accolades that HP gives writers when they hit milestones. I don’t care about Hub of the Day and I certainly don’t care about the meager earnings that many writers chase after.  Oh, let me continue: I don’t care about Hub scores or Hubber scores, and whatever an Editor’s Choice Award is, I don’t care about it either. J For me, HubPages has always been about a sense of community. I joined to become a part of a writing community.  I joined in hopes that by receiving comments from other writers I would become a better writer myself, and I joined in hopes that I could support writers on their own journey. So yes, comments are important. But there is a considerable distance between something being important and actually receiving that something.  Ask any kid at Christmastime what they would like for presents. The list will be a mile long, and every item on that list is vitally important, but good luck scoring every item. So, then, how did I take my Christmas list and make it happen? Read on! Do you want what I have on HubPages? photo by Bill Holland I tossed ego aside a long time ago, so don’t bother thinking this is a statement born from that character defect.  I say this only from observing over the past two years.  If your articles are not interesting, and if they do not give value to your readers, you not only will not receive comments but you will be hard-pressed to receive any views at all. It makes no difference whether you write poetry, how-to articles, craft articles, travel articles, short stories or flash fiction….if your writing is boring then say goodbye to readership and by extension say goodbye to future comments. I had a teacher in the 4th Grade….Sister Mary Joseph….she may have been close to God, but I’ll bet God yawned when she finally paid Him a visit.  The woman was BORING and I avoided her like the plague. In fact, let’s call this the Sister Mary Joseph Syndrome.  Do you suffer from it? If so, kiss those comments goodbye. Don't be a chicken; get involved. photo by Bill Holland I have told this story before but I’ll toss it out again to illustrate this point.  The first article I wrote for HubPages was some nonsense about how to stage your home for selling.  Result? One comment! The second article was something about teaching….see, I barely remember it….Result? Four comments! My third article was a letter to my birth mother who I never knew.  Result? Literally hundreds of comments! What’s the point?  I reached my readers on a personal level with that third article.  They could relate to me as a person.  I opened myself up for inspection and allowed my readers to know a little something about me, and they responded in a huge way and still are today.  Those who follow me do so with great regularity because I have become real to them. I am no longer billybuc; I am a walking, talking, breathing friend who they enjoy visiting with. I don’t know why this is so hard for some writers to comprehend.  You have to give love to receive it.  The Beatles said it quite nicely back in 1969.  “And in the end, the love you take, is equal to the love you make.” I give support to other writers.  Heck, my tagline is “helping writers to spread their wings and fly.”  My followers know it isn’t phony and they respond in kind.  I comment on their articles. I follow their blogs. I am in constant contact with them on Facebook.  They are, in fact, my online friends and I greatly enjoy their company…..and obviously they enjoy mine as well. Becoming a part of a writing community is hard work.  If you think otherwise you are spitting into the wind, and let me tell you, that is not an enjoyable activity….the spitting part of course! The biggest turnoff for me is when a writer does not even bother to respond to my comment. The second biggest turnoff is when their response is “thank you for reading.” I just spent five minutes of my busy day reading their article and then writing a meaningful comment, and I get four words in reply, four words that sound like McDonald’s “have a nice day.” Ya gotta give, folks!  I don’t know how else to say it.  My comments have some meaning and depth. My responses to comments have some meaning and depth.  To me, my comment is an extension of me.  If I met someone on the street and they gave me a gift, I would not blow them off with “thank you for reading.” I would stand there and express my gratitude in a genuine fashion.  Writing online should be no different. And people sense that is true about me and they respond in kind. You have to make the effort if you want results. Online friends are real friends photo by Bill Holland That may sound like a silly statement, but think about it for a second. How many writers on HubPages do you feel you truly know on a personal level? Many of my followers have become my friends.  Real friends and not just virtual friends; they know that if they are ever in Olympia that I will be there to greet them and buy them lunch; and I know that they will do the same for me.  Heck, I could go for a cross-country road trip and I’ll bet I could stay at a writer’s house in every state and fifty countries. Can you say the same? I get comments because I am a friend, and people enjoy conversing with friends.  I have allowed people to know me on a very personal level. I have talked about my past mistakes and my weaknesses. I have talked about my fears and my triumphs.  I am not Billybuc to my online followers; I am Bill Holland, and if you don’t understand the distinction then you ain’t been paying attention. If you think you are going to write an article and then be instantly flooded with comments well, then, think again.  It just doesn’t happen that way.  People are busy.  People are distrustful of strangers online.  People need and want entertainment.  People want quality and people want personal connections.  All of that takes time and all of that takes work. If you want what I have, then let’s sit down and chat.  Let me get to know you.  Let me get a sense of who you are as a person, because that is infinitely more important to me than who you are as a writer. So pull up a chair and get comfortable. I’ve got some donuts here and tea if you like.  Sit back, relax, and let me tell you the parable of the 65 yr old writer who had so many friends he didn’t know what to do. J 2013 William D. Holland (aka billybuc) “Helping writers to spread their wings and fly.” Debra Allen from West By God on January 01, 2015: I am still learning a few things from you.  I do not remember if I had made a comment on this one or not, so here I am again. Have a great New Year! Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on January 01, 2015: Gwenneth, good to hear from you, and welcome to HP! Gwenneth Leane on January 01, 2015: I was very interested in what you wrote because I have jus joined Hub Pages and am still finding my way and wondering what is the best way to go.  Thank you, Gwen Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on December 31, 2014: I'll be interested in the feedback you get....good luck and thanks again. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on December 31, 2014: Catherine, it really is the only way for us to know how we are doing.  We need comments, and I wish more people would do it.  Thanks for your thoughts on this. Catherine Giordano from Orlando Florida on December 31, 2014: I just checked my stats.  I have 9000 views and 1026 comments.  Since about half of the comments are mine, I have about 5-6% comments. I'm going to put this in a forum. Catherine Giordano from Orlando Florida on December 31, 2014: You are so right Billybuc.  Since monetary rewards on non-existent for most hubbers, the only reward we get are comments. The reward is knowing some one read what we wrote and liked it or was touched by it or informed by it or inspired by it.  I have a 98 hubber score, so I must be doing something right, and that motivates me, but comments most of all.  So I will urge everyone to take a moment to comment.  I have to share this.  Also, I do feel that I have come to know a few people here who I consider personal friends even though we have never met. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on February 17, 2014: Jonny, thank you and welcome to HubPages!  Good to have you here. JonnyAddict from Newport Beach, California on February 16, 2014: This is amazing ! I look forward to getting to know the ropes and each of better. Thank you for making this available. www.AddictsToday.com is our site we are very happy to be here. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on December 26, 2013: KDeus, hello my new friend. Thanks for the following and for taking the time to comment. I love HP...I have met some incredible people on this site and I look forward to learning more about you in the months to come. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on December 26, 2013: Susan, there you are! Thanks for commenting. I love the friends I have made on HP, and they really are friends. Hopefully some day I'll be able to meet more of you in person.  Until then, I greatly enjoy getting to know all of you as real people and not just online writers. Keely Deuschle from Florida on December 26, 2013: Excellent advice - not only for writing here on HP, but for life in general. You get out of it what you put into it. In today's world, we're so insistent on getting things done fast; making less effort means less time spent which means on to something else quicker. We've forgotten how to nurture relationships because we don't take time to do so - in the real world and in the written world, like HP. I am guilty of an occasional shorter comment and pledge to make sure I write more meaningful comments. Voted up and shared. Susan W from The British Isles, Europe on December 26, 2013: Hi Bill, I have thoroughly  enjoyed reading this article, it is another inspirational(yet again!) hub written by you. Thanks for sharing your tips. I can see why you have so many followers. When I joined the HubPages community nine months ago, I was a little shy with everyone and with my hubs. However, I discovered how nice the community is and I have made so many friends along the way! HP is more than a writing site, it is a place where we have made friends, even if we never knew them. Thanks again for this hub, voted up, useful and shared. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on December 15, 2013: Fiona, I agree completely....you usually can tell they haven't even read your hub from their generic comment.  Might as well not even bother as far as I'm concerned.  Thank you for your thoughts. Fiona from South Africa on December 15, 2013: Yip - it always amazes me that people want to build ""relationships"" for what they can get out of it not taking into account that a relationship is a two way street with give and take. My pet peeve is people who leave a very  generic comment and you can see that they only left it so you would go to their blog - anyhow, enough ranting and raving - I agree that top of the list is to create something interesting to read. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on December 15, 2013: DrBill, you will do well here if you stay active with comments....it's good to have another active member. Thank you my new friend. William Leverne Smith from Hollister, MO on December 14, 2013: Yes, I agree. On-line friends are real friends, and I really appreciate the rest of you comments on this hub. Great advise. I have pledged to respond to every comment, as well. Thanks for the encouragement! ;-) Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on December 09, 2013: Thank you so much, Nadine!  I hope this is a wonderful week for you. Nadine May from Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa on December 09, 2013: That is a great comment from Robert Billy and he speaks for many of us, including me. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on December 08, 2013: rtburroughs, that is a very kind thing for you to write. Thank you so much. You made my day with that comment. Robert Burroughs on December 08, 2013: Bill, you know that feeling you get when you go to church or a seminar and you feel like the speaker is speaking to you directly? Well that is how I feel when I read your Hubs. I am sure a lot of us feel the same way. Like each hub hits us directly on some level. It is fellow hubbers like you that give me the strength to push through. I know that eventually it will pay off. The more I read, the more I want to know about the ""World according to Bill Holland."" Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on December 01, 2013: Kate, I'm glad to hear that you feel you can become a ""real person"" on HP....I love this community and I hope you find the same joy in it.  Thank you for the visit and best wishes to you. Preston and Kate from the Midwest on December 01, 2013: Bill, thanks for this hub. I recently joined HubPages at the recommendation of a friend. I am not daring enough to start a blog yet and figured HubPages would be a good place to start. As I searched around HubPages and attempted to get a feel for what it was about, I was drawing conclusions that we were to leave the personal side of our lives on the sidelines. Your hub has encouraged me and somewhat relieved me that this is a community with real people. I can include some personality alongside the media rich and long format hubs that are encouraged. Thank you for sharing! -Kate Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 26, 2013: Have a great day Randi, and thanks for stopping by. Randi Benlulu from Mesa, AZ on November 26, 2013: So very true, Bill! Comments are the real barometer! Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 24, 2013: You are very welcome, Dim! Dim Flaxenwick from Great Britain on November 24, 2013: What a wonderful thing to say. I appreciate it very much. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 24, 2013: Dim, never forget that you are a writer and a fine one. No levels can negate that; no number of accolades changes that....in your heart you are a writer....and a damn fine human being. :) Thank you! Dim Flaxenwick from Great Britain on November 24, 2013: Sheesh!!!!  I thought l would never get to the end of all these comments. I almost gave up! Ha Ha!   That what have defeated the purpose of your excelent hub. I found it so encouraging that you take little or no notice of Hubpages  scores, accolades, earnings.......Earnings?  What a joke. I have been guilty of taking HP to heart sometimes. All that happens is l feel  l feel l am a bad person, or a hopeless writer When my level of commentator went down from 7 to 6 l was mortified. l've always been a no.7 commenter. (SAYS WHO?) Now they have moved me down to a level 5 and l am thinking ....""What the heck?""  I used to have more time to write and  after publishing a new hub l would always go through all my followers to comment on their work. Can't manage that   at the moment, but l still know it is the best way to enjoy HP. You have written a wonderful piece of common sense here. Thank you billy... Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 24, 2013: eatpraylove, it must be so hard to become a writer when English is your second language. You have my respect.  Thank you for the following and best wishes to you. eatpraylove from Philippines on November 24, 2013: I really want to be a good writer. English may not be my first language but I really hope I can improve my writing skills. Thank you for the inspiration. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 23, 2013: and thank you once more, John. :) Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 23, 2013: John, thank you so much for this comment.  I would love to follow everyone, but with 1700 followers one has to pick and choose, and the decision-making process is based on who comments.....if there is another way to do it I would love to know.  It is common courtesy my friend, and I was raised to believe in courtesy. Have a wonderful weekend. John Hansen from Gondwana Land on November 23, 2013: Hi Bill,  Thank you for writing this article. Although all your hubs are insightful and extremely informative I can especially relate to this. I turn on my computer in the morning and the first thing I look for is comments from my fellow hubbers. Like you I don't care about the small amount of dollars or cents) my hubs bring in, and awards for certain milestones may act as some incentive that you are getting somewhere, but it is the friends I make here and their constructive comments, whether positive or negative, that I write for, and what truly inspires me. True, the more abrupt or short comment may get a short but polite reply, but I still appreciate people taking the time to actually read what I have written. One of my pet hates also, is hubbers who don't reply or acknowledge comments. There are a couple of people I have been following and regularly leaving comments for who just never reply. I have actually stopped following one of them even though I enjoy their hubs, another I still read but no longer bother to comment. I feel it's just common courtesy, and I know if you have a lot of comments like you receive, it takes time to reply, but it's the least you can do to make people want to come back and read more of your hubs. Anyway, enough venting from me, love this hub. Voted up. John Hansen from Gondwana Land on November 23, 2013: Hi Bill,  Thank you for writing this article.

I hope you enjoyed the donut and thank you for the visit. elemenopy on November 22, 2013: So spot on!  I have been looking for this community for a loooong time.  I got stuck in some digital social universe that sucked all my time, but didn't provide for any real meaningful relationships, insights, or creative outlet.  I'm here (waving, smiling - grabbing a donut)!  Thank you for being so welcoming! Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 22, 2013: Heidi, you are wonderful in the comment department. I have not worked with Twitter. My biggest fear is that I'll get hooked on another social media outlet and then never sleep.  A sleepy Bill is a grumpy Bill. :)  Happy Weekend to you as well and thank you! Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 22, 2013: JPSO138, it takes time and effort but it does pay off.  I am so glad I joined this community of excellent writers and human beings. Thank you! JPSO138 from Cebu, Philippines, International on November 22, 2013: Now I know the secret! Just joking my friend. I can relate to all that you have written and I totally agree. Actually not agree but learned from all you have shared. I will try to apply them and hope that one day I can be like you... Up for this hub and hope everyone will be able to read this. Heidi Thorne from Chicago Area on November 22, 2013: Ah, the comment conundrum. I would say that the commentary here on HP is definitely of the friendly ilk. In about 10 months or so here, I've received very, very few unfriendly comments. Even if someone disagrees, they explain their position. As well, the pace of comments here in HP's friendly confines is fast and furious compared to stand alone blogs. This is due to it being a blog/social network hybrid. I've seen several reports that people don't have time to comment on blogs. So don't take it personally when people don't comment, whether it's here or on your other blogs. And since I'm a Twitter addict (and not recovering anytime soon), I have several tweeters who RT (pass along) my blogs & hubs with a very short comment when they do. That's as good as a comment to me. Online engagement takes many forms. Comments are one of them and a precious one. When readers take the time to read and thoughtfully comment, take the time to thank and reply. I do this here and elsewhere. You're right, it's give to get. Happy Weekend! Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 22, 2013: drbj, I definitely believe it can, and as an added bonus we gain friends like you who constantly entertain us. :)  Have a great weekend my friend. drbj and sherry from south Florida on November 22, 2013: Many writers do not seem to know the value of making comments, Bill, so it was most timely that you reminded all of us. I just updated an older hub with the title of 'Increase Your Traffic with Comments,' because it is true! Making comments CAN improve one's traffic. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 22, 2013: ChitrangadaSharan, I seem to be a person that people relate to, and for that I am grateful.  Thank you very much. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 22, 2013: Thank you vkwok; I appreciate you always being here. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 22, 2013: Same htere VVanNess...thanks again. Chitrangada Sharan from New Delhi, India on November 22, 2013: Another wonderful hub from you, very interesting! I don't think anyone gets as many comments as you at HubPages. Therefore you are the right person to write this article. I do make it a point to leave a comment on each hub I read. Thanks for sharing your experience here in this hub! Victor W. Kwok from Hawaii on November 21, 2013: Great hub, Bill. And really interesting, good advice! Victoria Van Ness from Fountain, CO on November 21, 2013: Thanks Bill! I look forward to speaking with you! :) Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 21, 2013: VVanNess, what do you have to lose? :) Thank you and good luck; if you ever want to chat about it, drop me a note.  My office is always open. :) Victoria Van Ness from Fountain, CO on November 21, 2013: Thank you for your thoughtful article. I may need to sit down and talk like you suggest to truly find out how to get to the core of my writing ability. :) Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 21, 2013: Wow, Sha, there is nothing I can add to that wonderful comment. It is without a doubt the best measuring tool I have.  There are days I'm too hard on myself and there are days I'm not hard enough; comments gives me a barometer to measure by, and it is invaluable to me as a writer.  Turns out I did have something to add. :) Thank you Sha! Shauna L Bowling from Central Florida on November 21, 2013: Bill, readers don't understand just how important comments are.  There wouldn't be a Comments Section if it weren't meant to be used.  Now, I'll be the first to admit, if I click back or close out of a read before finishing (known as bounce) I won't comment.  Also, I refuse to not comment if I'd read something in its entirety.  If I'd read a piece from beginning to end I will leave a comment, whether on HP a blog or an article I happen upon doing research for an article I plan to write.  Comments are how we can measure our success and the impact our words have on those who read them.  It took me a bit to convince my family of that, with reference to my blog.  The only one that will actually leave a comment is my mom (aren't moms great?!), everyone else chooses to comment to me via email. We learn from the comments that are left.  We gain feedback and a feel for the impact our stories or articles have on the readers.  Comments are learning tools, kind of like the quizzes we took in school.  And absolutely respond to every comment you receive, otherwise you come off as a greedy SOB who is only in this gig for selfish reasons. I believe writers write because they have something to say and want to share.  Whether a writer makes you laugh, cry, gives you your aha moment, makes you think or answers questions, the writer becomes a writer because he/she wants to reach out. Do us a favor and reach back. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 21, 2013: Seafarer, how exciting is that residency.  Where is it going to be?  If all works out you can bet I'll be there at the airport. It would be a thrill to meet you.  Keep me posted of developments, and.... thank you! bill Karen A Szklany from New England on November 21, 2013: Hey Bill, thanks for such an uplifting hub about the give-and-take of community, bothy on HP and offline.  I know that there are hubbers who can spend more time online than I can, but when I am here, I am with all my heart. The balance between online and offline life  is so much like a dance...and a beautiful one at that. I applied for a residency at a writer's retreat center in Washington State, and if I am selected as one of the residents (I'll know by the end of the year), I'll need a ride from the airport.  I'd sooooo love to meet you and Bev...and there is place waiting for you to stay here in Massachusetts if you ever travel to New England. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 21, 2013: Thank you Carter. It is interesting for sure; I seem to swim against the current and still do well.  I hope I serve as an inspiration to others who want to write from their heart and passion and not worry about keywords and views. Mary from Cronulla NSW on November 21, 2013: It is interesting Billy to hear that as you evolved from info hubs to more personal hubs you gained more interest..I have wondered about that as the direction HubPages seems to have evolved into seems to be the opposite as is often seen by HOTD/editor's choice rewards..I'm sure both types of hubs work just as well but it is really great that you get both lots of comments and page views from doing what you are doing..keep up the great work and many thanks for contributing to other writers here..cheers Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 21, 2013: Suzanne, I like that...sharing the love is what we do in this community. I hope more writers discover what you and I have discovered. Thank you! Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 21, 2013: cwritersblock, I'm happy that is the reason why you joined. We need more members who are interactive and supportive.  Welcome to HP and best wishes....and thank you! Suzanne Day from Melbourne, Victoria, Australia on November 21, 2013: It's true. I used to wonder why the comments didn't roll in when I started at Hubpages years ago. Then I found Facebook and learned about sharing the love... cwritersblock on November 21, 2013: Thanks for sharing! As a newbie, it's great to hear a veteran re-affirm how Hubpages is all about community. It's part of the reason I joined :) Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 21, 2013: We do indeed, moonlake. Feedback is helpful for any writer.  Thanks for leaving a comment; it is greatly appreciated. moonlake from America on November 21, 2013: You've got a lot of comments on this hub. You are right about comments I think they are important for anyone. We all like to hear from people and what they have to say about our hubs. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 21, 2013: Levertis, what a great, great comment.  Thank you so much for taking the time to share your thoughts. I love your story about your son. I can just see his reaction; maybe because my son most likely would have done the same thing. As for responding on a personal level...it does come easy for me. I truly do like people. I am fascinated by their stories, and I live in La La land where I believe we all have commonalities that we can build upon to form a relationship.  I want to learn about others. I enjoy their stories.  I try to form relationships with as many people as possible. Mind you, it was not always like that.  I spent many years not trusting people and too shy to reach out to others. Today I love the interaction with others. I have found if I reach out and make an attempt that most people will respond in kind, and I love that about HP. I'm rambling....seriously, thank you so very much for your kind words. I refuse to say ""have a nice day"" but I will say I hope you have an extraordinary, ordinary day. :) bill Levertis Steele from Southern Clime on November 21, 2013: Bill, Writers who get comments like yours are ""fishers of men;"" they know how to reach people. That is a talent that is inborn (a gift) in some and learned in others. Many writers are learning and enduring the struggles as they progress. Some persevere, and some throw in the towel. Moving on to greener pastures is fine, but abandoning writing is another story. You wrote, ""I joined to become a part of a writing community. I joined in hopes that by receiving comments from other writers I would become a better writer myself, and I joined in hopes that I could support writers on their own journey."" This is not just hot air. ""The proof is in the pudding."" I have read enough of your writing to know that this appears to be quite true of you. I thought about writers and their many commentators and followers. They were loved by many and disliked by some. I could not help but be awed by some of their ""haters"" who hung in there with them. Why? Your hub here tells it all. There is a kind of human spirit that is almost impossible to ignore. It is as if it has supernatural energy that pulls the reader and demands respect even from those who may not like or see eye-to-eye on all of the writer’s points. The fruits of a God-given gift are always full of seeds. All the possessor needs to do is cast them. He does not give gifts that are designed to return to Him void. You also wrote, ""The first article I wrote for HubPages was some nonsense about how to stage your home for selling. Result? One comment!"" Now, that is hilarious! My jaw is still recovering from the sudden jerk of laughing muscles because I can relate and now laugh about it. BUT, you learned from it! Suppose your reaction had been to feel insulted and ignore the whole thing with sulking. You would have missed out on great learning and sharing/giving opportunities. One of your subtopics reads, ""If You Want Support Then Give Support."" One millionaire said that he once hit rock bottom with less than $50.00 to his name. He was very depressed but decided to give it to someone who needed it. Not long after, he pulled himself together and began to rebuild wealth until he became a millionaire again. There is something wonderful about helping and giving sincerely from the heart to others. I tried to teach the principle of sacrificial giving to my son when he was nine-years-old, but I failed. Maybe he was not yet ready. He responded by putting all of his money ($6.00) into the church’s offering vessel. When he did not immediately get a multiple return from God, he fell on his back, rolled, bucked, and threw the biggest tantrum of his life. To him, he had ""gambled"" and lost. Another one from you reads, ""I just spent five minutes of my busy day reading their article and then writing a meaningful comment, and I get four words in reply, four words that sound like McDonald’s “have a nice day.” :D I asked another successful writer the question, ""How do you respond on a personal level to thousands of commentators?"" Now, I direct that same question to you. ""Pray tell! Personally, I would probably faint if I receive so many comments. I would love the experience, though. You said, ""Heck, I could go for a cross-country road trip and I’ll bet I could stay at a writer’s house in every state and fifty countries.  Can you say the same? ... People are distrustful of strangers online.” Well, I suppose a man is apt to pick up a strange hitchhiker quicker than a woman would; and, yes, some people are a little leery of online contacts for obvious reasons. Maybe you also have the gift to discern human spirits. There were times that I wrote short comments because the writing spirit did not move me, but there were also times when I gabbed too much. Too little or too much can be problematic. I must mention that you use effective pictures and videos to accompany your hubs. This is all great information, enjoyable learning, and very useful for growth in wisdom. I am hitting the positive buttons and sharing. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 21, 2013: Graham, I am the lucky one. I get to meet fascinating people like yourself, and I just think that is remarkable. Thank you my friend and have a great Thursday. Graham Lee from Lancashire. England. on November 21, 2013: Hi Bill. Another opportunity for me and others to sit and see/listen to the pearls of wisdom drop from your lips. You are so right in your approach. Yet another feather in your cap today. Graham. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 21, 2013: one2get2no, I truly do appreciate your kind words. Thank you so much and I hope your Thursday is filled with success. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 21, 2013: Exactly Glimmer!  The encouragement we get through comments is very valuable although no price tag could ever be posted on it.  Thank you for your friendship. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 21, 2013: Mary, it really is remarkable, isn't it? So many online friends who are true friends...we have never met and yet we feel close to each other.  I would have never guessed it possible. Thank you for being you. bill Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 21, 2013: Thelma, I feel the same way about HubPages and I feel the same way about you. Thank you so much. Blessings to you and yours always. bill Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 21, 2013: DDE, thank you!  I am blessed to have so many loyal followers and friends here. Keep working, keep commenting, and you will too. Philip Cooper from Olney on November 21, 2013: Billy you have a real gift and it rubs off on all of us here at hubpages...well I can only speak for myself of course but you are truly inspiring and insightful. Thank you. Claudia Mitchell on November 21, 2013: Well I think commenting is important here.  Not only for interaction, but you never know who is commenting or reading and that person you are interacting with may share your hub on another website where it will get loads of views.  Who knows?  Also, it's nice to get thoughts from other people on my writing.  It encourages me to write more hubs. Mary Craig from New York on November 21, 2013: So now you have really written the basis for HubPages 101.  ANYONE writing here needs to read this Bill and more importantly follow your advice.  I know, its happened to me. By making friends like you, I've learned so much and read so many good hubs.  I look forward to HP every day.  What, I don't have a life?  Not true, I have a life and a very full one with a wonderful husband, four kids, and seven grandchildren BUT my HP friends are my friends and I feel as though I have to check in on them everyday. Thank you dearest friend for yet another fence post on the way to writing success. Voted up, useful, awesome, interesting and shared. Thelma Alberts from Germany on November 21, 2013: Bill, I really like what you are writing and you are always there to help us with your awesome and insightful hubs. You know I have learned a lot from you. Hubpages is a wonderful community and being here is one of the best that ever happened to me. Thank you for sharing your knowledge with us. Enjoy your  day with your family! Devika Primić from Dubrovnik, Croatia on November 21, 2013: Incredible read as usual and I truly appreciate you commenting on my hubs. I too often wondered how is it that you and others too have that many comments, after writing and commenting as much as I do I see the difference in responses to my hubs. You have mentioned helpful tips here and with a positive mind indeed. Thank you for sharing such interesting and informative hubs. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 20, 2013: Faith, you are one of the best at commenting that I have; you always leave meaningful comments that truly reflect how you feel, and your support is outstanding. I, for one, greatly appreciate everything about you. Thank you my dear, and blessings to you always bill Faith Reaper from southern USA on November 20, 2013: You know it Bill!  I remember when I joined HP, just getting out into the community and reading away and commenting on those work I loved reading and hence, much to my delight ... I soon had many wonderful writers commenting on my hubs too.  It is a wonderful community, and the way I look at it, is that if someone takes the time to read my hub, then I surely will take the time to write them a proper comment back to each commenter.  I respect all writers and their valuable time spent in commenting, for I know it does take time. Up and more and sharing Blessings, Faith Reaper Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 20, 2013: Maria, what a lovely comment....like a hug....well good, because that's what they are supposed to be. :)  Thank you my dear and I hope the rest of your week is blessed as I know it will be. love, bill Maria Jordan from Jeffersonville PA on November 20, 2013: Dear Bill, What the heck? I love dreams as well and I could barely see what you flashed at the end of your beautiful and motivating video.  Please don't make us wait too long to share more about this... I always love and appreciate your comments.  They feel like a hug. Have a peaceful night. Love, Maria Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 20, 2013: Bill, I am humbled by your words. Thank you my friend.  Having friends like you is what this site is all about for me. Bill De Giulio from Massachusetts on November 20, 2013: Bill, the single best decision I made here on HubPages was to follow you, read your hubs, and leave you comments.  What I have received in return and learned from you cannot be measured in views or $$.  You have helped me to become a better writer and a better person.  We reap what we give. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 20, 2013: Flourish yes, just a little bit better than that hub.  LOL  I go back and read it every once in awhile just to remind myself who I am and what I really love to do...and it isn't writing about real estate. :)  Thank you for stopping by this evening. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 20, 2013: Wayne, it could have been me writing your comment.  That's what it is all about for me. When I first started they told me not to writer personal essays.....well for God's sake why not?  How else am I going to connect with other writers if I don't show them who I am and give them my best work?  I write because I love to write. Yes, I have dreams and goals, but they are secondary to the love of writing and the community here.  Thank you Sir! Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 20, 2013: Penlady, thank you!  I guess I just love this community and that's why I keep trying to spread some love.  Seems like a worthy activity to me. :) FlourishAnyway from USA on November 20, 2013: Nicely written and authentic.  There are wonderful friendships to be made here in this community.  I like how you put yourself out there.  Bet it feels better than the how to stage a how hub, huh? Wayne Barrett from Clearwater Florida on November 20, 2013: I love this article, Bill. I noticed early on with Hubpages that it was the comments that I most desired whenever I posted a piece. And it's not because I feel like I need a pat on the back (even though I admit that is always nice) it is because after all the years of writing and just throwing my work into a file somewhere to be forgotten, I now have friends just like myself who read my work and communicate with me about it. I have always loved writing, but never had much motivation to do it; Now it seems I don't have enough hours in the day to do all the writing I want to. Meeting people like you and the others here at Hubpages has been an enormous blessing to me...even more so because I believe this is motivation that I can pass on to my daughters. Thanks again, Bill...for your work, and for noticing me! penlady from Sacramento, CA on November 20, 2013: This is a good reminder that writing should be about more than just making money. I think as writers we often forget that, esp. if writing is our full-time careers. It's good to see a writer who has a great perspective on being a writer and the role of supporting other writers. Thanks for this reality check. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 20, 2013: Sheila, I do understand what you are saying. I have struggled over the same issue at times.  There are some comments that really don't give you much to work with. :) Thank God we are writers and creative, huh? LOL  Thank you! Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 20, 2013: Nadine, if you figure out how to increase the hours in a day, please let me know. :) Thank you for your very kind words. I have been given a gift; I don't say that from ego. I know I have a voice that people relate to, and I am very grateful for it.  Now it is my job to use that voice to inspire others to reach for whatever greatness is in them. As for the diorama....my wife made that for me and it is one of my most treasured gifts. :) sheilamyers on November 20, 2013: Thanks for pointing out about simply responding to comments with a ""Thank you. Hope you stop by again"" or something similar. I'm guilty of doing that myself. However, sometimes all I can think to say if the comment is only a few words about them liking my hub.  If they get more detailed about why they liked it or leave comments about the actual content I'll respond with more. But now you got me thinking. I'll try to better with my responses in the future. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 20, 2013: Jackie, I hear what you are saying. I did that once....about a month into my stay here we had a power outage that lasted a week, and I got so far behind in comments that I finally did a group comment. A week later I went back and wrote comments to each person...I felt too bad about it. LOL  So yes, I understand and yes, I appreciate you greatly. Nadine May from Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa on November 20, 2013: Many thanks for you being You Billy!  I feel that you are truly a reflection of most of the writers on this platform, but they might not know it. Whatever your write about, it’s the YOU that comes through. This means that you as the writer has a personal signature style of writing. You write what most readers feel, but do not express it through words the way you do. They do it their own way, but not as direct, not yet anyway, but then reading your hub, I was again inspired to stay true to myself. It’s written that every human being has unlimited potential, but my own excuse is not having enough time to do the things I would love to do. That is why I wrote my next hub. It’s all to do with money! I Love what I do, helping authors marketing their book after its has been published, but I could do with a 48 hour day instead of 24 of which some off it I have to spent sleeping.  Thanks again for your brilliant hub and oh yes, what you showed in your video, was that something your grandchild made? That's just a guess, but it looked to me like a diorama. Jackie Lynnley from the beautiful south on November 20, 2013: Well I am only long winded in my poetry so basically my responses to commenter are short but they do say something from my heart because I do appreciate each and every comment, (except the few weirdos, lol) but I am so turned off by those who make out a list 20 names long or more and say thanks to you all...people really go to trouble to visit you and they deserve some personal response and though I really like some of these that do this, guess who I am going to skip if I am in a hurry? Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 20, 2013: You are very welcome Alise....and I think you have a new hub I need to read. :) Thank you! Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 20, 2013: Oh Sally, that was very sweet of you.  I don't feel I give as much time to comments as I should; they could be longer and have more depth to them....but time really is not my ally right now. :)  Anyway, you are a gem and I hope you had a rewarding day. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 20, 2013: Ruby, give me someone who goes overboard any old day compared to someone who can't be bothered. Keep being you my friend. Alise- Evon on November 20, 2013: Thanks, Bill, for the elegant insights. A really good way to grow is to learn to be able to really share. I have some growing to do:) Thanks for the inspiration. Bill Holland (author) from Olympia, WA on November 20, 2013: Linda, you do so much for the community; I think group comments is totally understandable in your situation. Well done and thank you."
43,Hub score - Hubris?,community," Retired counselor, 341 short stories published by FSU. I have 4 sons, love sharing photography, writing, love travel, sunshine, sea & Grace. I love writing and love to share my experiences with others. When I first found HubPages, I hadn't realized the hubs were scored, so initially I paid no heed to my number. However, when I caught on to the fact that this was a value of my work and hub activity, then I became interested. Each time my score went up or down a little, so did my smile. Lets face it, improving ones score is insidious and infectious. I caught the hub bug about two months ago having come back to Hub Pages after a few months writing elsewhere. I was surprised to find I had a score in the 80's (after months with no added stories or hub activity) and was encouraged by kind comments on my hubs from fellow writers. I was further titillated with the new accolades and so with reawakened interest I decided to find out how to affect my score without writing a new hub. After tweaking a couple of the stories by adding more links (now we also have Hub Karma to worry about) I noticed my score went up 5 points, then dropped 2, up 1 etc. I noted that my hub score (and smiles) climb rapidly with a new hub and then drop after a few days; it obviously pays to keep up productivity, and to keep smiling :-) I wondered how I could more accurately manage these score (mood) swings. I found the technical answers to this question within the many helpful hubs on 'how to improve your hub score.' But in this hub I'm more interested in discussing the hook that these ""quantifiable's"" emote. I mean, why would I be bothered by a number someone ascribes to my hub, when I realize the hub score isn't based just on writing talent and hub content? I think maybe because its a form of judgment and we don't write to be judged...or do we? Being scored reaches the roots of the need for approval, pride in ones work, competitiveness, insecurity, etc. Writers put themselves out there ~ a part of the writer's essence is etched into every hub. So maybe that part feels judged and pride comes into play. On the whole I believe most of us aren't writing on Hub pages to make money or to be judged, but because we love to share through writing. (That in itself is an emotional act ). Having read my share of other hubs, I'm amazed at the large number of excellent and talented writers on Hub Pages, and I feel humbled in this esteemed company. I've also noticed that the hub score doesn't necessarily reflect the talent of the writer, or the content of the hub. So meanwhile, I find myself content when I have fan mail, when my score has gone up and when I have comments to read, but also a little pissed off when my score drops seemingly arbitrarily. It's hard not to get caught up when it's somewhat outside of your control. (what, a control freak, moi? Never!). So, I would really appreciate your feedback on the emotion attached to your 'number.' Thanks for your input in the following poll: Helen Lewis (author) from Florida on February 26, 2012: Yes, ThoughtMonkey, I agree with you!  Thanks for voting and I appreciate your comments :-) ThoughtMonkey from United Kingdon on February 24, 2012: Being new to this and not knowing what I do right when I do it or what I do wrong when I do that I find the scoring very baffling. I enjoyed reading your thoughts, thank you I voted you up! I assume that is the thing to do when you like someone writing. Helen Lewis (author) from Florida on March 15, 2011: Hi tnderhrt23 ~ I love your poetry (your heart and your humor). These HubScores are really governed by productivity and content - for example, I doubt that poetry will ever get as high a score as a hub about how to make money! I would think those who maintain 100 score work very hard to keep it that way ~ personally, I only write when I want to and when I feel inspired in some way.  Thanks for your comments and for allowing me to link onto your fun hub :-) Helen tnderhrt23 on March 15, 2011: brightforyou, thank you for directing me to this...you say it with grace, honesty and class! Yes I think those numbers hook the pride a bit...lol...and control? let's not speak of it! LOLOLOL! Hugs for a job well done here! Helen Lewis (author) from Florida on February 22, 2011: Hi arthurchappell, I agree. I wish we weren't scored. It takes away from the traffic from those who are talented writer, but don't have the time or inclination to write every day or write about certain 'sell-able' topics! I agree the 'yo-yo' effect makes no sense! Thanks for stopping by and adding to the debate! arthurchappell from Manchester, England on February 22, 2011: it's only natural to be affected by your hub score - one of mine dropped to about 42 before going up to the mid-60's. It's very hard to predict a trend when they yo-yo like that Helen Lewis (author) from Florida on January 28, 2011: Hi artlader, welcome to hubpages. Thanks for stopping by and for your kind comments.  I look forward to reading your hubs!  Helen :-) artlader from Aiken, South Carolina, USA on January 28, 2011: Hi, Brightforyou, I clicked on the ""useful"" button and voted you up. As for the feedback you requested, well, I guess I am too new to make an informed statement, but I am a teacher and we usually like rubrics. The bottom line is, I do not like not knowing how to get an ""A,"" I guess. Grrrr... Thank you for an informative, well-written hub. Regards, Art Helen Lewis (author) from Florida on November 11, 2010: Thanks Leni - I think there are a lot of us hubbers who are dubious about the Hub scores! Leni Sands from UK on November 11, 2010: Really useful hub.  Thanks. Helen Lewis (author) from Florida on August 17, 2010: Hi antimatter, thank you for your comments; I'm glad you are enjoying the scoring challenge! antimatter from United States on August 16, 2010: Great article. The hub score seems a little mysterious to me. I let this account sit for two years with no hubs and my score was down to 41, starting improving it about a month ago. It's a fun challenge. Helen Lewis (author) from Florida on August 03, 2010: Thanks Micky Dee - its about time I got on with writing some new hubs! Micky Dee on August 03, 2010: Sometimes I allow a hub to sit unpublished for a couple days and the score rises and my overall score isn't affected. Congrats on being here a year! Duchess OBlunt on July 12, 2010: Why thank you brightforyou!  I will return the compliment Helen Lewis (author) from Florida on July 10, 2010: Hi Duchess - thanks for the comment. From what I have observed, those talented writers who write about popular topics and publish a hub frequently (as well as contributing with comments, fan mail, questions, answers and links within text) are the ones with the highest scores... way too much work for me. I write when I want to and because I want to share something with others.  I love your work Duchess and love the nom de plume! Duchess OBlunt on July 08, 2010: How the scores are tallied still has me baffled, but I have given up trying to understand it.  I like the community here, so I'll stick around, but I wish there was some clear cut way to figure it out. I haven't found it yet. Helen Lewis (author) from Florida on June 22, 2010: Hi 2patricias thanks for your vote and comment!  Glad to hear I'm not the only one... :-) PS I love your hubs! 2patricias from Sussex by the Sea on June 22, 2010: I ticked the 'funny' box, but as in funny-peculiar.  Why should I care about my hub score - but I do!  Not a lot, but I do look at it and when it is high feel happier. Helen Lewis (author) from Florida on June 18, 2010: Hi Alissa, thanks for voting on my hub - I find the scoring a distraction, especially when the scoring doesn't seem to make any sense!  I'm looking forward to reading your hubs! Alissa Margaret on June 18, 2010: Really well written! I just joined HubPages myself and don't particularly enjoy the scoring either. Rated up and voted! Helen Lewis (author) from Florida on June 18, 2010: thanks Rebecca, you've got some great hubs - I look forward to reading more! Rebecca E. from Canada on June 17, 2010: as usual an very informative hub keep up the good work.  Keep on writing.  For my own vote it was score affects me slightly, but I am quite busy with hubpages so there you go.  Rated up and useful Helen Lewis (author) from Florida on June 17, 2010: ADDENDUM ~ JUNE 18TH 2010 - I WAS TRYING TO ADD ANOTHER LINK TO THE POLL AND WIPED THE RESULTS TO DATE RESULTS OUT IN ERROR. SO FAR, 8 PEOPLE HAVE VOTED AND THE RESULTS ARE: Not bothered about my score at all.       0 The score affects me slightly.           63% The score affects me quite a bit.        25% I don't like being scored at all.        13% Helen Lewis (author) from Florida on June 16, 2010: Nice to meet you suny51 thanks for your comments - I look forward to reading your hubs! Helen Lewis (author) from Florida on June 16, 2010: Thanks for your comment green tea-cher I appreciate your continued support! suny51 on June 16, 2010: Please count me in,I am here just for the sake of fun of all the experience and getting to know so many intellectual and interesting people. green tea-cher on June 16, 2010: Great topic, especially for new Hubbers! Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this. Helen Lewis (author) from Florida on June 16, 2010: Hi Lori I remember you well, we talked about how we knew the meaning of words (when we were young) before we were told their meaning. Thanks for your kind comments - I think I know what you mean about becoming the score 'becoming an amusement' but I also think it brings it's fair share of angst. Laurel Rogers from Bishop, Ca on June 16, 2010: brightforyou-what a fabulous hub!  I know I used to feel so distressed at my varying scores, asking the HubGods, ""What's going ON??"" Ah, after time, it does become somewhat of an amusement. Great job. petermdhart from Cornwall, UK on June 16, 2010: Well said! Helen Lewis (author) from Florida on June 16, 2010: Wow, just logged on and found your comments; thanks you guys, its good to feel I'm not the only one ~ Thank you for your support! Petra Vlah from Los Angeles on June 16, 2010: The score is mostly affected by activity - witing - commenting - following others - forum participation (every time you push a button) The activity is being indexed by Google and we know what motivates Google; talent is not one of the factors for sure, content about specific topics, where Google can attache adds and make a Profit, is Belinda Hodge from Brisbane Australia on June 16, 2010: I admit to finding the Hub Score baffling and I've never bothered to find out what I can do to make it go up!  Now you've got me interested.  Great links and references - thank you. words cocktail from Australia on June 16, 2010: :) I fail totally to understand the technicalities of Hubpages. It is easy and many hubbers have made it easier with their experiences but I still can not get the hang of adsense/amazon/ebay-whatever,SEOs etc. etc. So, I come and write to vent and share. I like the community hubpages has and it gave me friends. I also admit that there are times when I want to write for money but I fail. Absolutely FAIL and I do not regret at all.:) M Selvey, MSc from United Kingdom on June 16, 2010: ""On the whole I believe most of us aren't writing on Hubpages to make money or to be judged, but because we love to share through writing. (That in itself is an emotional act )"" You hit it on the head there! I think you have expressed the thoughts of many with this hub - well done! I also think it is possible there may be some petty game-playing that goes on with scores but as long as people remember why they are here, this shouldn't matter. Just keep writing and keep enjoying what you are doing! Voted up and useful! 2uesday on June 16, 2010: I like your style of writing,thought provoking subject, thank you. it is always interesting to read what other Hubbers feel about hubscores etc. so this was well worth the read. Especially as I have seen some excellent writers hurt by scores. Once you know that the hubscore is not based on quality it is easier to 'detach' from being as interested or bothered by it. At one stage I found it annoying that my most popular hub was not one I would have picked. Andrew from Italy on June 16, 2010: Voted up and useful, very useful. I don't like much scores, especially because, as you said, many times they do not at all reflect talent, but other things. And we all are affected when scores go down. :)"

45,How Many Page Views Did it Take to Reach My First Hubpages $50 Payout?,community," I joined Hubpages in November, 2011 after leaving the wonderful world of full time employment. As a new stay at home mom to my daughter, it seemed like a great way to make some extra cash and make new friends while keeping my writing skills current. I have had some failures and successes in my four months of writing for Hubpages. While nothing worthwhile happens overnight, I have finally reached my $50.00 pay out point. So how many hubs, months, and views did it take to reach this milestone? In my first four months, I originally published 65 hubs. My first novice articles were personal poems and short articles which did not succeed on Hubpages or google. I deleted 24 Hubs that were not performing well and had a score lower than 55. (Hubpages also removed one of my hubs that had 300 views due to ""duplicate material""). This helped my overall hub score improve slightly. I currently have 41 published hubs. I reached the $50.03 payout mark March 1st after receiving 25,611 views. Results may vary by user, but this equates to $.002 per view on Hubpages. (These amounts do not include Google Ad Sense Earnings, Amazon Associate Earnings, or EBay Sales).  Hubpages.com (including my own views) 9999 Google.com (all sources) 10,672 Facebook.com 3,203 Reddit.com 331 Pinterest.com 525 Search Yahoo.com 304 Twitter.com 217 Ask.com 92 Bing.com 80 Searchaol.com 75 Digg.com 55 Other sites/ Email/ Individuals 58 Total: 25,611 List your hubs here for more views:  www.StumbleUpon.com www.Pinterest.com www.Digg.com www.Reddit.com www.Facebook.com www.Delicious.com www.Redgage.com When I first joined Hubpages, I had much to learn about back links, SEO, and RSS Feeds. I read hub after hub about these items to learn how to better market my hubs. I learned to get more views, I needed to use popular sites like Reddit to draw in viewers outside of Hubpages. Sites providing back links and extra views have specific audiences. For instance, Reddit is a site popular with 20 somethings. Hubs that appeal to this age group will always get more views and more shares.  As a new hubber who did not understand the benefits of back links, keywords, and RSS feeds I struggled to get more than 100 views per day on my Hubs. I soon realized that making $.20 per week was not going to support my shoe habit. Instead of writing poetry and personal articles, I began using the Google AdWords Keyword Tool to see what sorts of articles people were actually searching for. Not only does this technique help a writer estimate traffic on a given subject, it also provides many hub ideas that may not have been considered otherwise. This tool is available under the google sign in under tools. In addition to using the sites above for back links, I read hubs on how to use RSS Feeds to increase views. Nothing has provided me with more traffic in my four months on Hubpages. The attached hubs explain in expert detail how to add your RSS Feeds to directories. Not only does this trick increase traffic to hubs, it is user friendly. By inserting the RSS Feed URL to popular directories, each directory is automatically updated each time you publish a new hub. By doing these techniques, I gave myself a Hubpages raise. My earnings went from $.50 per month to $12.50 a month. Progress is progress! Abby Slutsky from America on July 25, 2020: This is a very helpful article. I will explore RSS feeds. Thank you. Lisha C on May 19, 2020: Thanks for the tips! Indro Neel from India on May 16, 2020: Thank you! Wonderfully written - very educational! Zanbia  Ali on April 03, 2020: Thank you. :) Anya Ali from Rabwah, Pakistan on February 06, 2020: Very useful! Thank you! Anya Ali from Rabwah, Pakistan on February 06, 2020: Very useful! Thank you! Anita Hasch from Port Elizabeth on July 03, 2019: Thanks again for sharing. Theblogchick from United States on August 06, 2018: I found your article very interesting and helpful. I hope I can earn my first pay out soon. Thanks for sharing. Jo Miller from Tennessee on March 08, 2016: I bookmarked this hub some time back and just getting around to reading it.  Great advice here and I'm off to read more about RSS feeds, though I don't see the link you refer to. DREAM ON on July 24, 2015: Thanks so much. May your day go wonderful. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on July 24, 2015: Thanks DreamOn. Most of my views come from Pinterest where craft hubs are popular. I am currently at 977,500 views overall. The best thing I can suggest is use GoogleAdWords. You can see how many searches are done on any topic on Google in a month. This gives you an idea of what is popular. Hope that helps! DREAM ON on July 24, 2015: What a great hub ! It has been along time since you started. I see you have accomplished many awards and success. How well have you done ? I would love to see a break down  if possible ?Have HubPages changed their rules for payouts ? I haven't learned the rules to attract followers and therefore to make money. Maybe I can follow your guidelines.I thought I would  figure it out by myself. I learned the hard way it doesn't work to well with a wish and a prayer. I would appreciate any insight and tips. Keep up the wonderful work. Have a fantastic night. Sinha from Calcutta on July 03, 2015: Hello @tammyswallow- This is a great article. Learnt some things..:) sabbir from kolkata on November 02, 2013: Thanks again Tammy  :-) Tammy (author) from North Carolina on November 02, 2013: That is great sabbirkhan! You will want to make sure you have your paypal account set up. The payment should be automatic. If you earn $50 on October 30th, you will get paid for this on November 28th. Hubpages pays out once per month on the 28th. Hope this helps! sabbir from kolkata on October 31, 2013: Hi Tammy, I am here again, my hub page views has reached to about 25733 views on 30 th october, that is this month..now i am confused about what should i do now..should i mail to hubpage or they will  mail me or i should wait for sometime..when can i expect hubpages to let me know about my payout.. as i am new to hubpages so i am not sure about what to do.. sabbir from kolkata on October 21, 2013: Thanks Tammy..  :-) Tammy (author) from North Carolina on October 20, 2013: Hi Sabbirkhan175, There is a section under traffic sources that shows you the views from your own clicks for the month. These are counted in the total of views for the month so you do get paid for those. When I reached right about 25000 views, I reached my own payout. Depending on how you set up your account, this should work for you to. sabbir from kolkata on October 17, 2013: Tammy its really a nice hub...But i am still confuse about it that will the hubpage pay me for my own clicks..My page views count is 9054 now..So according to you i have to reach about 25000 views.. am i right?? Fiona from South Africa on June 06, 2013: Thanks Tammy - another great hub. I must say that I am encouraged by my progress so far on Hub Pages. I earned 11c this week with 1 hub by just doing nothing - I know it isn't much but it does bode well if I put some effort into it and follow your example. Elizabeth Parker from Las Vegas, NV on May 23, 2013: Very interesting hub. Thanks for sharing! frozenink on May 02, 2013: Very useful and interesting. Glad you shared. Voted up. =) ignugent17 on May 01, 2013: Thanks for sharing your ideas. It is really encouraging. :-) victor from India on April 27, 2013: informative! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on March 17, 2013: Thanks for reading risalat. I hope these suggestions work and I wish you the best at Hubpages. Risalatul Hoque from Moorhead, MN on March 14, 2013: Thanks a lot for this hub. So far I made 42 cents in last 7 days. I have been with HP for nearly a year and finally decided to use the revenue program. Huh ... homework time for me ... SEO, reddit, RSS ... off to more reading. Keep up the good work :) (y) Willette from Michigan on March 05, 2013: This is encouraging. Trying to read and learn more to get my views up and to write more. thanks for sharing and keep on hubbing. Sharing. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on February 23, 2013: Welcome to Hubpages agapsikap! I wish you the best of luck here. There are so many wonderful hubbers here. If you ever need help or advice, you will get it. :) agapsikap from Philippines on February 21, 2013: Hi! tammyswallow,I'm also a newbie. Haven't published any hubs yet.but i'm looking forward  to do so. I'm taking it one step at a time. I hope i can go as far as you did  guys, i was really inspired by working moms online just like you. I have five kids and want them to have the best in life. Stephanie from Canada on January 30, 2013: Thank you tammyswallow.  I have been more active lately and in the past two days reached 925 page views and authorscore of 40.  So that looks way better than 0 authorscore, haha.  Thanks for the insight! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on January 30, 2013: If you interact in the commuity and get followers, they will read your hubs and you will get a higher authorscore. I have some great people listed on my profile. They are they best on Hubpages and they are all very supportive! Stephanie from Canada on January 27, 2013: I'm glad those are great statistics.  I ended up getting up to 572 since 4am this morning.  I want to do the Hub Ad payment but unfortunately it says I have to have a Google Adsense attached.  So for now I will be getting my Authorscore up (I wasn't active in the community at the very start so it went from 70 something to 0 fast), and writing more hubs :)  Being a stay at home lady helps with the time to write.  Thanks for your insight! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on January 27, 2013: Wow Educateurself! I don't know about the availability of Paypal in Pakistan. I don't know of any other alternatives. I would ask someone at Hubpages. Best of luck! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on January 27, 2013: Wow Neinahpets! If you have been here for one week, wrote 17 hubs, and have 500 page views.. those are excellent statististics. I had trouble getting approved for Google Adsense. You have to have about 20 hubs to get approved. You will still earn wages until you are approved if you have opted to join the Hubpages ad payments. Google adsense pays very slowly. After a year and 3 months, I am nowhere near the $100 payout for Adsense, but I do get a payout from Hubpages every month. If you have Hubpages set up as your main program of pay, you will still make wages regardless of the google approval. Way to go! You are off to a strong start! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on January 27, 2013: Yes cynusnite! I have Hubpages earnings set as my main source of income. I also accumulate with Google Adsense, but that is so much slower to to accumulate. After a year, I think I earned $33.00. Hope that helps! Educateurself on January 27, 2013: Thankx tammy again for reply.Ok now paypal isn't available in my country so what should i do?I mean is there any other way?Because i have writing really tightly and my hubs going well. Stephanie from Canada on January 27, 2013: Great insight that I could use.  I've been here a week and my hubs (total of 17) range from score 58-71 and I have around 500 page views.  I haven't been able to make earnings yet in anyway because I have not yet been approved for Adsense... and it's probably due to my AuthorScore - which doesn't make sense since every single hub I have written has been featured and has decent scoring.  Oh well, still learning!  Thanks!  Voted up! cyqnusnite on January 26, 2013: So those earnings are from the hubpages ad program? Tammy (author) from North Carolina on January 25, 2013: Hi Educateurself. When you reach the $50 payout, Hubpages will pay you through Paypal. Google Adsense is a different program and they pay you when you reach $100.00. I am pretty sure they mail a check to your address. Hope this helps! Educateurself on January 25, 2013: Nice article tammy really helpful it help me so much and increased my knowledge about earnings at hubpages but i have one question can you please tell me how hubpages pay you when your hubs views i mean how through paypal or anything else because i only know about google adsense to earn something.Please tell me the procedure how i can earn through hubs views. Thanx for listening. Tammy (author) from North Carolina on January 20, 2013: Thanks so much for reading Nakia. I wish you the best here at Hubpages! Nakia Deon on January 20, 2013: What a milestone!  Good job!  I am a newbie and when I reached a penny I was excited.  Can't wait to reach $50.  Your article definitely helped me with new ideas on how to get there.

Chitrangada Sharan from New Delhi, India on January 19, 2013: Very useful information..Thanks! Mahaveer Sanglikar from Pune, India on January 19, 2013: Nice information, useful for new Hubbers. Voted up and shared. greatnutrition on January 17, 2013: Thanks!  I'm still rusty, but it's nice to hear some experienced advice!! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on January 17, 2013: Thanks so much for reading and commenting JanMaklak and WELCOME to Hubpages! Surprisingly, you don't need to have a ton of hubs to make money on this site. You are better off to make interesting, well crafted hubs. Best of luck to you here! JanMaklak from Canada on January 16, 2013: Thanks for the straight goods on earnings.  I have just completes my second month of writing here and I have income of about 12.50 like you.  Now If you could write a hub about pulling in over $50 a month I'd be in your debt! Jan Tammy (author) from North Carolina on January 13, 2013: Thanks for reading and hang in there Lizam1. Keep trying all sorts of topics! Lizam1 on January 12, 2013: I'm impressed with your viewing figures.  Timely to find you as I have also realized that .20c a day is not going to help me buy the house I have my eye on:-) Tammy (author) from North Carolina on January 11, 2013: I post them to the most appropriate, depending on the hub. I put craft hubs under crafts, and so on. Any hub that is about trends I try to place in the WTF category as that one has the most readers. :) Tammy (author) from North Carolina on January 11, 2013: Thanks carozy and best of luck! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on January 11, 2013: I figured my stats and I hope this helps: 4% comes from Pinterest, .02% StumbledUpon, 1% Reddit (I think they are banning Hubpages for spam), Hubpages 7%, Google 58%, Facebook 2%, Other (including Digg, other hubbers, Bing, Search.com and more 27.98%. Andrea Serie from Brooklyn, New York on January 11, 2013: As a new Hubber, I found your Hub very helpful.  What community do you post your Hubs on Reddit?  I just took a look at the site and the communities are a bit confusing.  Thanks! carozy from San Francisco on January 11, 2013: These are great tips and a very thorough article.  I'll try to implement them to bring up my earnings. Jack Baumann from St. Louis, Missouri on January 10, 2013: How much traffic does Reddit, Stumbleupon, and Pinterest bring you? Tammy (author) from North Carolina on January 10, 2013: Thanks for reading faeriemusejo. Welcome to Hubpages! Tammy (author) from North Carolina on January 10, 2013: On Reddit you select submit link and paste your URL. If you post more than one a day, Reddit will ban you. They have been making it harder to submit Hubpages as they see us as spam. Best of luck to you! faeriemusejo from The Frozen North: Alaska on January 10, 2013: This is a great article! I have a long way to go and a lot to learn. I'm glad to know a few of these tricks up front ^_^ Tammy (author) from North Carolina on January 09, 2013: Anytime TravelinJack!

I'm curious to know if an experience hubber like yourself considers my direction a viable to make money.  Could you please check out my travel hubs and see if they are to standard!  Thanks!! RelayMom on January 08, 2013: Wow I am new to hubpages, and honestly I have no idea what half this stuff is yet. I have a lot to learn, but I'm having fun writing so far (I've only written two hubs but hey you gotta start somewhere) and I hope to continue. Maybe after I get a handful of hubs up I will try to figure out all the extra stuff going. Kimberly Vaughn from Midwest on January 08, 2013: Interesting! Thanks for sharing how you are doing.

47,"How To Search, Use And Attribute Photos And Images From Wiki Commons In Hubs",community," Rajan is a botany and chemistry major. He has worked as a poultry breeder for 23 years, breeding layer and broiler parents. By Alex Shunkov and formatted by Bcjordan [CC-BY-3.0 (www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0)], via This hub has been specially written as a guide for new hubbers who would like to incorporate images, available on Wikimedia Commons, in their hubs. Wikimedia commons is the largest free images resource and especially for public domain images. Though it is best to use ones’ own photos it is not possible many times due to a number of reasons. Hubpages and Google are very particular about others’ images being used correctly by way of proper attribution to the author of the image, incorporation of the license and the image source (URL). This hub will focus on the correct way to find and incorporate these images from Wikimedia commons. To use an image or photo there are basically 2 steps : 1. Searching for the image/photo which can be used for a commercial write up. Hubs are commercial write ups as they display ads from which the hubber earns money. 2. After locating the image/photo that one wants to incorporate in the hub, it is necessary that, images that are legally available for use are used and proper attribution to the author is ensured. It should be borne in mind that though images on Wikimedia Commons are free for commercial use they need to be correctly attributed. Go to the Wikimedia commons home page at this link http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page As  picture 1 below shows wikimedia commons Click on Images in the choices on top right which will open up the page as shown in picture 2 below. wikimedia commons In the search box type the keyword for the picture you are looking for and hit enter. I will take the example of the ‘raspberry’ keyword for this hub. A page like in picture 3 opens up. wikimedia commons  Now select whichever image you like so that it opens as in picture 4 below (I will click on the 2nd image for purposes of demonstration). public domain, via wikimedia commons You will see that this opens up the images’ main URL page. To the right of the image you can see a list of options in which this file (image) can be used. We are concerned with the first two options on the list. The 1st option is for Downloading the image to the photo capsule.The 2nd option is to enter details of the Page URL, and Attribution to the author. Click on the 1st option on top of the list.A box opens up as in the picture 5 below. Scroll to the bottom of the box and you will be given the option to download the image in various sizes (circled in red by me). If you prefer you can download the image size of your choice and save it to the computer from where you can upload it to the photo capsule OR You can import the image directly from the web - - By clicking the import button which is at the top on the left hand side of the photo capsule and pasting the File URL in the box given there. For importing the image to the photo capsule, keep the hub open in edit mode in another tab and add the photo capsule. Open the photo capsule in edit mode. Import the image by pasting the File URL in the box as explained above.Click the import button at the bottom of the list of URL boxes on the left.Within a few seconds the required image is uploaded to the photo capsule, as in picture 6 below. Keep this photo capsule in open in edit mode, as now you will have to fill in the source and attribution details. wikimedia commons hubpages Now click on the 2nd option “Use this file on the web”. This opens up the page as in picture 7 below wikimedia commons You can see here that information pertaining to the Page URL (in the top most box) is already highlighted. Right click this to select. Go to the photo capsule which you kept open in step 6.  Paste this page URL in the ""source URL"" box. Again go to the same page and copy the attribution and paste it in the ""name of the source"". Though attribution of this image is not required as the image is in public domain, it is better to attribute it so that it becomes a habit. The photo capsule in the edit mode would appear like this in picture 8 below, after typing ""Raspberries"" in the capsule subtitle box on top. In the caption box I will type ""Red Raspberry"". See picture 8. red raspberry By Vassil (Own work) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons After filling all the details, save the photo capsule. You have now correctly attributed the photo to the author and its source. Once you have saved the photo capsule, the final look of the photo will be like in picture 9 below red raspberry By Vassil (Own work) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons To a new hubber the entire process of incorporating an image might appear very daunting. But believe me it will be a breeze once you do it a few times. There are other sites also where you can find photos for commercial use, like on hubs. Each site has a slightly different way of attribution. Attribution is a way no doubt of making the use of images in our hubs justifiable to Google & Hubpages. But it is also a way to appreciate, respect and credit the author for using his work. We, as writers, would not like anyone to use our written work to be used without attribution at the least. Similarly, it is our moral duty to ensure that we do the same to others that we expect of them. I would like to thank the author, Wikimedia commons & Hubpages for the material used in this hub.  © 2012 Rajan Singh Jolly Audrey Selig from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on August 10, 2015: Hi Rajan - Is this way easier than the download to the computer and then to HP?  Do you not need to sign in or register? Thanks for a well explained hub that will help everybody. I use this site, but need to write down the instructions for complete understanding every time.

Geoffrey Kerosi from Nairobi on March 21, 2013: I have learnt a lot from this hub. Keep it up. Rajan Singh Jolly (author) from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on August 28, 2012: Gail, that is good. I hope you can do it now. Gail Louise Stevenson from Mason City on August 28, 2012: I tried it on Google Chrome and the options did appear.  When I used Internet Explorer, it didn't work. Rajan Singh Jolly (author) from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on August 27, 2012: gail, when you open the commonswikimedia.org site, type the name of picture you are searching for. Then, a page with many pictures of your search term will open. Click on the picture of your choice. An enlarged picture will open and in some seconds a list to the right of the picture opens as I have shown in this tutorial. Some photos might not show this list, but most of them do. I hope this solves your problem. Gail Louise Stevenson from Mason City on August 27, 2012: You're welcome. I tried wikimedia, but the options don't appear by the photo. When I click on a photo, I get a large photo with no options at all. I must be doing something wrong. Gail Louise Stevenson from Mason City on August 27, 2012: I did click on a picture, but there were no options appearing beside it. There was just a big picture. Gail Louise Stevenson from Mason City on August 27, 2012: Thanks, too. I'm glad I found your hub, so now maybe I can incorporate images into my hubs. Thanks again, Gail. Rajan Singh Jolly (author) from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on August 27, 2012: gail, I hope this simplifies it enough for you to be able to incorporate images in your hubs. Glad you found it useful. Thanks for visiting. Gail Louise Stevenson from Mason City on August 26, 2012: I was afraid of using someone else's images on wikimedia and elsewhere-and I don't really know how to import images to my hubs yet. After reading the directions here I will try again. Great information and directions. Rajan Singh Jolly (author) from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on August 21, 2012: Thanks for reading Mahesh. maheshtcr1 on August 21, 2012: Informative hub...... Thank you rajan jolly........... Rajan Singh Jolly (author) from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on August 09, 2012: From wikicommons you can use any number of images. From other sites use max 2 images from each site, Sujith You can g0 to the learning center and read everything there. The learning center link is https://hubpages.com/learningcenter/contents Good luck. Sreejith k from Kerala, India on August 09, 2012: Thanks for your response once again. How many images can we import from such sites in a single hub? Sreejith k from Kerala, India on August 09, 2012: Thank you so much . Rajan Singh Jolly (author) from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on August 09, 2012: Hi Sujith - I'm glad you found this hub to be useful. Regarding your question, no it will not be a problem getting Adsense approval even if you use wiki commons pictures. The only thing you have to do is to attribute it properly as explained in this hub. Secondly, do not apply before you have completed 6 months of active hubbing here, meaning keep writing and posting hubs regularly during these 6 months. Have at least 25 hubs published during this period. Hope this helps you. Welcome to Hubpages. Sreejith k from Kerala, India on August 09, 2012: Thank u so much rajan sir. I was searching for this hub. I am new here. but i have a doubt . will there be any problem in getting adsense when we take pictures from wiki media commons? Rajan Singh Jolly (author) from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on July 01, 2012: bdegiulio, Thanks for reading and appreciating. I'm glad you found it informative and useful. Rajan Singh Jolly (author) from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on July 01, 2012: I'm glad you like the hub. This hub was written to help out the newbies, as to many like me, it is the first brush with online writing and incorporation of images which has a lot of complexities associated with their usage for a starter. I'm glad this hub is useful in that respect. Thanks for giving it a read and commenting. Andrew Spacey from Sheffield, UK on July 01, 2012: Many thanks for this. Wikimedia Commons is a great resource. It also has unusual angles on subjects which you don't find elsewhere. For new hubbers who are a little uncertain your advice will make sure they select the correct picture and give due attribution. Bill De Giulio from Massachusetts on July 01, 2012: Very helpful info.  Thanks for the education and for sharing. Rajan Singh Jolly (author) from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on July 01, 2012: Glimmer Twin Fan, I'm glad this hub helped. Thanks for the read and vote. Claudia Mitchell on July 01, 2012: Extremely helpful to me.  Thanks! Voted up. Rajan Singh Jolly (author) from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on March 26, 2012: Hi Debbie, I agree. I'm glad to be of help. Pictures make the hub look so vibrant. Thanks for stopping by to read, appreciate and vote. Thanks. Deborah Brooks Langford from Brownsville,TX on March 26, 2012: I have gotten so scared of using pictures unless they say free. and then i am scare.. LOl. but this hub is really helping me thank you for sharing this hub voted up Debbie Rajan Singh Jolly (author) from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on March 24, 2012: bankscottage, all images on the web are not available for use due to copyright issues and different licenses attached to them. It is always better to search for images which have a clear cut option for commercial use. Even then, proper attribution is a requirement. I hope you find this a helpful guide. Thanks for the vote & bookmark. Welcome to HP. Mark Shulkosky from Pennsylvania on March 24, 2012: Great Hub.  I am fairly new to HP, but do use photos.  I have been using at least the URL for an attribute and the source name if possible.  The copyright issue has been a concern for me.  Sometimes I find that the photo I need is one that I don't have or one that is too specific for the public photo sites.  I have bookmarked wikimedia commons as another source for photos. Voted up and useful. Rajan Singh Jolly (author) from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on March 24, 2012: ithabise, I am happy to note the hub has offered you an insight into image use in hubs. It becomes extremely easy once we get used to doing it. Thanks for all the compliments. I appreciate your visit and comments. Michael S from Danville, VA on March 24, 2012: THANK YOU! This hub is so useful. I am one who has found photo attribution daunting. In fact, I have just recently learned how to do it properly. But as you said, once you get the gist of it, it becomes second nature. You've helped many. Rajan Singh Jolly (author) from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on March 24, 2012: sholland, thanks for giving this hub a read as also for the votes and sharing. I'm thankful for the bookmark. I hardly ever feel the need to go to other sites for images as Wikicommons hosts almost the complete variety of images. Rajan Singh Jolly (author) from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on March 24, 2012: Melovy, yes Wikicommons has the largest variety & all the images are free to use under different conditions of attribution. I appreciate your visit and comments. Susan Holland from Southwest Missouri on March 24, 2012: Great info!  I usually use Google and give the URL source.  I will bookmark Wikimedia for future use.  Thanks for sharing this! Votes and shared! :-) Rajan Singh Jolly (author) from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on March 24, 2012: Christy, the purpose of writing this hub is exactly this. I hope this helps those who are looking for some kind of a pictorial help with use of images in hubs. Thanks for the read and vote. Much appreciated. Yvonne Spence from UK on March 24, 2012: Rajan, if I need a photo and don’t have it in my own collection I go to Wikicommons first because I find it the easiest site to use. I think you have done a great job explaining it here and this would be helpful to someone new to Hubbing. Christy Birmingham from British Columbia, Canada on March 24, 2012: This hub is very useful for new hubbers who are not sure about the rules for adding photos to hubs. Well done Rajan, I vote up! Rajan Singh Jolly (author) from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on March 24, 2012: Alocsin, using images in hubs definitely adds to the overall value of a hub. I did face a lot of problems when I started out as this was my first brush with article writing and incorporation of so many capsules. Of all the capsules the photo incorporation capsule is of paramount importance as it's here that most newbies tend to make mistakes. I have seen many of them use watermarked images too. That apart because of the copyright and attribution issues related to images, I thought it best to do my bit in this direction. Thanks for stopping by to read, comment & vote. Aurelio Locsin from Orange County, CA on March 24, 2012: Quite useful to the new hubber -- I normally use Flickr for my images but am glad to know about this resource.  Voting this Up and Useful. Rajan Singh Jolly (author) from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on March 24, 2012: Kelly, that's a real big compliment coming from a seasoned hubber like you. I'm so happy the hub helped that wee bit. Take care, get well soon and thanks for all the lovely words. Rajan Singh Jolly (author) from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on March 24, 2012: jenubouka, I'm so glad that this hub has been of value to you. Just the reason I wrote this. Thanks so much for the kind words. Kelly Umphenour from St. Louis, MO on March 24, 2012: I do use Wikimedia but there's a step you made easier for me so thank you!!  This is excellent! jenubouka on March 24, 2012: This I did not know and what an extremely helpful tutorial on how to get a photo!  I think that some may have an awesome hub, yet they may lack the ability to take the pictures or not have the resources to get one. So being able to obtain a FREE photo that won't deter your hub is very important.  Awesome!! Rajan Singh Jolly (author) from From Mumbai, presently in Jalandhar, INDIA. on March 23, 2012: Vinaya, thanks for visiting and commenting. I learnt incorporating images in hubs the hard way. Hence this hub which should benefit new hubbers. Glad you stopped by. Thanks. Vinaya Ghimire from Nepal on March 23, 2012: When I'm not using my own pictures, the site I trust is wikimediacommons. This is very useful hub for the beginners. Well done Rajan"
48,Being Stupid Isn't Easy! You Could Be Their Next Victim,community," Don is a Writer and a Storyteller. He has published over 9 books on varied subjects along with many articles and commentary on his blogs. An exclamation of frustration Public Domain This article is a sarcastic Rant! But it's something that I just have to put out there; if for no other reason than to clear the Bile from my Mind!. When I was a kid, I remember my Dad saying; Opinions are worth just about what you pay for them, Son! Now, I know he didn't come up with this homily but he is the one who first put this fact of life into my mind. And, before you rad any further, my occasional rants are just that, MY OPINION! I have no desire to write something here that you, the reader likes or dislikes. It is a Rant! So, if you disagree with what I have to say here, or take umbrage at some part of what I say, then I apologize ahead of time and again, turn the page to something more entertaining written by someone more acceptable than myself. You see, in my opinion, when you are writing something spontaneous like a Rant, you can't be as aware of other's sensibilities the way you can when creating a well thought out article on an important subject. In this article, I get to rant about a few of the truly stupid things I have seen in my 5-plus years as a Hubber. If you are not inclined to see this as being totally ME, then please move on, right now! Perhaps i should use such words or phrases as; Vent my feelings, or Purge myself of my bad feelings, or Just let it out, or some other thing that makes what i am going to write more palatable to my readers. But, on second thought, NO! Make no mistake, this is a personal RANT from the heart of DON BOBBITT! Stupidity is boundless! ""The difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits"" — ALbert Einstein You see, once, in my more innocent years, I was very complacent and even understanding of those others in our population who, seem to be doing and saying such obviously Stupid things and seemingly not know any better. Now, decades later, being in my Senior years, and having a lot broader collection of life experiences, realize that there really are a lot of Stupid people in this world of ours. These are people who actually have something missing in their psyche! By that I mean, where the normal or average, or healthy human brain might tell a person something is, say dangerous; there are a select few who can look at the same situation and tell themselves, ""Oh No, I can do this with no problem!"". When I grew up, my parents, Uncles Aunts and others that I learned from, simply called such people, Stupid. That was OK to say back then. The world and our society was much simpler then. But today, I'm sure that right now there is some group or person is just waiting for me to distribute this article about ""Stupid"" people so they can protest my cruel and inhumane thoughts. Well, so be it! It's amazing how many people seem to have lived for decades without using their brain at all. Public Domain Again, this is my Rant, and it's about certain STUPID people. So, Names have been eliminated to protect some of the truly Stupid people I have known over the years! Come on, it's not so bad being Stupid. I know of several people who have survived in this world of ours for decades while being certifiably stupid. In fact, there are stupid people who are surviving quite well in every walk of life. There are stupid professors as well as stupid factory workers, and of course stupid Cops, Crooks, Bankers, Salespeople, and more out there. Stupidity knows no genetic bounds as to whom it attacks. Strangely, for some strange reason, Politics draws more than its share of stupid people. They are everywhere, waiting for an opportunity to exhibit their abject stupidity. Can you be smart and Stupid at the same time? Of course you can. Take for example Doctors, they have to study for years and the strongest skill for a Doctor is the ability to memorize enormous amounts of data. Doctors must memorize every part of the body, all of the potential diseases and illnesses a person can contract, as well as how to treat them and the drugs that can be used for treatment. And, their ability tor remember all of this often drives life-threatening decisions. But, Just because a Doctor has such a great memory does not imply that they are omnipotent. In fact, I am walking proof that a Doctor can be smart and Stupid at the same time. twenty years ago, I had a sinus infection, and my family doctor ran tests on me for weeks while putting me on certain drugs. Long story short, here; He took Urine tests every week, but we found out later that he never read them. ""He was too Busy"". Me, I was in Kidney failure, and actually had a disease that wiped out my Kidneys and put me in the position of requiring a transplant. He was to busy! My life changed forever. So, you can be a very smart, stupid person. And I have, after years of observation, determined that Stupid is not a disease. You can't catch it from someone when you kiss them or shake hands with them, or if they cough on you. So, If I have scared you a little by now, relax, you can kiss or shake the hand of a stupid person and not turn permanently Stupid yourself. Unless you are already so inclined. I know that makes some of you feel a little better. We can always hope it's a genetic thing, but i seriously doubt it. If stupidity was genetic, there would be hope that we could alter a stupid persons DNA and make them a ""cured"" stupid person. Maybe then there would be an SA organization where you get a coin you carry with you, that you can take out and show people how many days it has been since you last did something stupid. But even that might not work. I mean think about it, if you gave a stupid person a bottle of pills and they had to take one pill each day to ""not be Stupid"" can you really count os such a stupid person to actually admit they are stupid and take the darn pill? I think not! Oh well, so much for DNA modifications or pills for Stupidity. You'll Get used to him! I hate People who say: He's a nice person once you get to know him."" They might as well say; ""He's a Dickhead, but you'll get used to it."" You must have noticed that there are so many stupid people who have risen through the rank and file to positions of power around the world. We used to have an explanation for this phenomenon. It was called ""The Peter Principle"" The Peter Principle states that ""everyone eventually rises to their own personal level of incompetence."" In other words, regardless of whether you are a factory worker, an Engineer, a Lawyer, a manager in a corporation, or a Politician; whatever; you will doo well in your job and you will be promoted. In fact at every level of responsibility you accept, if you do well, you will be promoted to a higher level. But, once you reach a level where you are not doing you job well, you will have reached your personal level of incompetence. And, you will stay at this level for the rest of your carer. That, my friends is the Peter Principle. And, if you stop and think about some of your coworkers, now and in your past, you can probably come up with your own list of people who had or have responsible jobs but seemed to be really bad at that job, right? They are examples of the Peter Principle at work. Our government has proven that is is almost a benchmark organization for the implementation of stupid laws. Public Domain Now on to the Politicians. Take our politicians, Please! (OK, I couldn't avoid such a famous line.) Politicians are one of my most entertaining examples of this premise. You have to admit, most of these people are pretty stupid. At least they seem so, as we consider their actions from our perspective as the voters who put them in office. Right? We tell them to do something like ""Fix the Taxes"" as our mandate. They get to Washington and the next thing you see, they are up there, either doing nothing, or they are fighting to save the ""guppies"" in a pond, in a state on the other side of the country. We shake our heads and say to our friends, ""What is that fool doing?"" and the overall response is; ""The man is Stupid! You knew that when you voted for him. What did you really expect"" And that's true, we did vote for that politician. But in our defense, we tell ourselves, we're not Stupid, we only had two choices on the ballot and the other fool was REALLY STUPID!"" This is a great example of stupid decisions. It was obviously easier to drive around the dead tree than to stop for a minute and move the tree. Right? Public Domain Our society has and continues to design things that will save stupid people from their own .... well, stupidity. In factories, large amounts of money are spent on machines that are designed to stop a stupid person from hurting themselves. Think about it, if you have walked through a factory you will see numerous example of ""stupid people protection devices"". I'm not talking about using Goggles, or protective clothing and such; although having to REQUIRE the use of such tools is a sign in itself. I'm talking about such extreme things as the stamping or cutting machine that has two buttons on it. Why two buttons the machine? Well they put two buttons because if the operator happens to have a stupid attack, they still have to use both hands on a button so the machine will operate and not cut off their hands or arms that will invariably be stuck into the machine. This simple design has save thousands of people from losing a hand in these machines. Why would the operator stick their hand in such a dangerous machine? Only a stupid person would know. And the laws we pass as a nation, state or town that are designed for stupid people are so numerous as to be absurd; laws such as; OK, they put a sign that there is a Curve ahead, so logic would tell you that you should slow down. But Nooooooo, they have to put another sign up that says; Reduce Speed in Curve, and also tell you what the maximum safe speed is in the curve. How stupid are drivers that need such coddling? And a law ends up being passed to protect the government from law suits by these fools. They put of signs that say; RR Crossing Ahead. Then they put of a universal sign with the symbol of a RR Crossing. Then, they put flashing lights and long red and white striped arms that drop dow to block traffic when a train crossing is imminent. And what happens? Stupid people will actually drive around the flashing lights and dropped road blocking arms only to be hit by the oncoming train. Stupid? I think so! And another law ends up being passed to protect the government from law suits by these fools. I have to stop here. There are so many examples of stupidity in our world that I would end up putting my readers to sleep with them, such as; And, as I said, the list goes on, and on, and on! Come on! This is a Chicken or Egg thing. Which came first the house or the pole? Either way, stupidity struck someone up beside the head. Public Domain OK! I got a lot off of my chest here, so I will wrap it up, now. Here is a little test for you; Hopefully you answered NO to all of these questions. Otherwise? ou may need help; professional help! This content is accurate and true to the best of the author’s knowledge and is not meant to substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional. Brad on March 18, 2019: Don I agree, and I think it is a shame that every generation worries about taking care of the next generation. Sadly, in the last couple of generations, the new generation didn't turn out that well, and doesn't seem to have the same values of their parents. The prey of the continuously evolving politician is the loyal party voter. If people became intelligent independent voters, I believe we would have the people in control they see beyond the gridlock diametrically opposed ideology of the two parties. Have a great day Don Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on March 18, 2019: Brad - It is easy to just say that our supposed ""political leaders are STUPID"". But in reality, and in today's political environment they are just figureheads for PAC's and other groups who have agendas and need someone on the Hill who can push their priorities. Where we once had powerful lobbyists pushing things their way, we not have PAC's. Its a sad situation that the present and future generations of leaders (the X-Geners and the Millenials) really don't give a damn about anything but themselves and of course, they're young enough to feel they are immortal. Have a great day, DON Brad on March 16, 2019: Don Am I right, or wrong thinking that Hp is becoming a ghost town. So few articles are being written, and this can be proved when you go to the activity especially in the political category. You will see more forum than articles, and the amounts total of both is sparse. Maven claimed they had 100 million users between their three companies including hubpages. Even if hubpages had a million users, and only ten percent were active everyday, how many articles would be written? As for politicians being stupid, I believe they are really smart like those people that get to their level of Peter Principle incompetence. The examples that I have seen in many workplaces is that the Peter Principle rewards the incompetent not for doing the job, but for working their superiors. Those that can Do, those that can't teach. In the workplace it should be, those can do stay in place, and those that can't do, Manage, Direct, become upper management. Applying that to politics, the politicians are or become inept in doing things that benefit the country and the people. But that ineptness is in the eyes of the voter. They are the stupid ones, as you say, thinking that the politician once elected by them would do the job they campaigned on. Reality is that the politician never intended to do that job, and that is evidenced by all the politicians that failed to accomplish or even try to accomplish their campaign promises. The one phrase I really like is,""I am from the government, and I am here to help"". Brad on December 07, 2018: Don Thanks and once again a solid gold article. Have a great weekend Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on December 04, 2018: Brad - Great Comment and story about how you had to take those extra steps to make sure your family received the proper care. I know you've met them, those people who went for a medical career to make money and not necessarily to care for those who need healing. I am so glad your wife's situation was taken are of. Have a great day! DON Brad on December 03, 2018: Don I am glad you liked my comment, and I would have thought it would have had lots of comments. It is a great hub, and the examples are excellent. I agree with you that when someone plays with your life or well being they need to have answers to important questions. Another example, in 1999 my wife developed a hole in her retina. She went to an eye doctor in San Jose, where we were living at the time. He had a Retina surgeon consult with us, and while he was talking to us he was more focused on his phone than us. I cornered him as he tried to leave as I had many questions. While he didn't give answers to my questions, he tried to leave. And while trying to make his getaway he said, I know you are concerned about your wife, and blah blah blah. The story has a happy ending. We dumped these two doctors, and searched for another one. At the time this operation to fix a hole was only recently working. I worked with a guy who had several operation to fix the hole in his eye years before and they weren't successful. We searched and researched finding a doctor in Palo Alto California. He was the head of the ophthalmology department at Standford University. In fact, the abrupt doctor that we dumped was one of his students. Anyway, once we talked to this doctor we got all the answers, and we felt confident that he could do the job to fix the hole. End of story, he did and now 19 years later my wife hasn't had any problems. We moved back down to Southern California, and all the eye doctors that examined after the operation were amazed that her eye was like it never had a problem. Anyway, put that in your trove of stupid things. That would have been stupid if we just went with the original wheeler and dealer eye surgeon. It is too bad that hubpages is no longer interested in hubs, or hubbers. Because this article is Gold! Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on December 02, 2018: WOW! After a little thought, I can see where Stupidity might be contagious!!!! Oh Lord! this could spread faster than the Walking Dead TV shows!! Thanks for the comment. I feel your pain. I just don't trust anyone who thinks they can play with my life at will! As you might realize, I am an uncooperative patient until I get explanations that satisfy me! Have a great day! DON Brad on December 02, 2018: Don Doctors I agree with your opinion. Also, "" It is not what doctors know, if is what they don't know that kills you"". My mother was having to have a stint put in for dialysis treatments when she got home from the hospital. Before the procedure, I talked to the doctor on the phone. My mother lived in NY, and I in California. They put her through a dialysis treatment before the procedure. I guess there is some medical logic to it. But, I told the doctor that was not a good idea in my mother's case. And he came down almighty on me for telling him that. End of story my mother died shortly after that procedure, one day! You can catch stupidity, for example being a loyal political party member. Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on May 03, 2015: Jennifer Mugrage- Great comment. Yes, Stupidity is everywhere, and we often end up tripping over it every day in one form or another. SIGH! DON Jennifer Mugrage from Columbus, Ohio on May 02, 2015: Fun rant. I am one of those people who can be very smart about some things and very stupid about others. It is scary. As a very wise person I used to know would say, whenever she made a mistake  that made a lot of extra work for herself, ""Life's hard, when you're stupid.""  It's so true. Regarding stupid signs, my favorite one is in restaurant restrooms: ""Employees MUST wash hands before returning to work.""  Apparently, customers need not wash hands before returning to their meal! peachy from Home Sweet Home on March 29, 2015: some people aren't stupid but silly or non logical thinking. I am one of them Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on March 23, 2015: ocfireflies- I believe that a good RANT every now and then allows me to maintain a clearer perspective on what I read here on HP. I believe in being nice to others, even if I disagree, but sometimes ......... I just Gotta let it GO! LOL! Thanks for the read and comment. DON ocfireflies from North Carolina on March 22, 2015: Don, Somehow, one gravitates to those places he or she needs the most.  I have a rant built up inside of me regarding customer service and am working on creating a hub.  In the meantime, I was able to vicariously enjoy a rant by you.  Thank You!  Smiles. Kim Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on February 03, 2015: Rachel- No problem. Some days, for me, Confusion is a state of existence rather than some passing thing. LOL! Thanks for the read and comment. DON Rachel L Alba from Every Day Cooking and Baking on February 03, 2015: I don't know what happened, but now I see both comments.  I didn't see the first one on my screen which is why I wrote the second one.    Sorry for the confusion, it wasn't anything you did.  That happens to me once in a while.  Doesn't take much for confuse my life, lol. Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on February 02, 2015: Rachel L Alba, Normally, I hop from HP over to my book writing and reading news from around the world. So, sometimes I don't get to some comments I receive for a few hours, and I have my HP set to only print comments I receive until I review them. As  general rule, I let everything through except for ones filled with vulgarities and the occasional insane person. LOL! Thanks for your patience and understanding. DON Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on February 02, 2015: Rachel L Alba- When I was writing this, I was shocked to find literall hundreds of pictures available for use (free of course) along with dozens of videos. Obviously, the subject is a wide and popular one LOL! DON Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on February 02, 2015: Carb Diva- Your Dad was an observant man! Like I said, Stupid is not a Disease, but I believe it can be ranked as an Affliction, at least. Rachel L Alba from Every Day Cooking and Baking on February 02, 2015: I left you a comment also and now it's not here.  I know I hit the ""post comment"" button.  I don't remember everything I said but I remember I commented on the pictures of the pole in the middle of the driveway, which I thought was stupid and the picture with the line painted around the branch I thought was really, really, lazy. lol  I wish I could remember the rest. Doris James MizBejabbers from Beautiful South on February 02, 2015: I just can't imagine why someone would personally attack a sweet guy like you, Don. Oh well, it takes all kinds to make this world. Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on February 02, 2015: MizBejabbers- Love your story, and I am so glad you enjoy my strange sense of humor. In fact, I just deleted one persons comment as they went directly into berating me on some moral grounds about how people should be treated. I mean ....... Really! How can someone have missed the sarcastic humor I was presenting? And, to be so strange as to attack me? Oh well, Inhale, Smile, and move on in life, I say. Thanks for YOUR observant and kind response, DON Rachel L Alba from Every Day Cooking and Baking on February 02, 2015: LOL,  I enjoy reading most of your writings.  I admit, I don't have the patience to read every single word, but I get the jest.  I love the pictures where you write the caption, ""lazy or just stupid"".  I think to be lazy is stupid too; just my opinion.  Getting back to the pictures, I think the one on the top with the pole in the middle of the driveway was just stupid and the one where the line goes around the branch was really, really, lazy.  Just my opinion, lol  Good hubs. Doris James MizBejabbers from Beautiful South on February 02, 2015: Did you delete my comment or did it not make it? We are having computer problems today. Don Bobbitt (author) from Ruskin Florida on February 02, 2015: breakfastpop- True, So True.  Being treated like a child is really frustrating and honestly, it smacks of our being in a socialistic state, before anyone rises up to protest. Don't get me wrong, some socialistic things are a good thing in my opinion when we as a nation can efficiently care for our less fortunate citizens at reasonable costs. But when this turns into having a large group of people, several healthy generations worth never have to try caring for themselves and demand being ""given"" things, then, its time to re-assess where we, as a nation reconsider such opulent plans and the people taking advantage of them. DON Linda Lum from Washington State, USA on February 02, 2015: Don, you gave me my laugh for the day (actually it was good enough to last most of the week). My dad used to say ""If stupid was a crime we'd run out of prisons."" I hope you are feeling better now. Doris James MizBejabbers from Beautiful South on February 02, 2015: Glad you got it off your chest, Don. LOL I'm glad you brought out the Peter Principle because I've seen it at work for many years. People have stopped talking about it, and I guess that's because even the Peter Principle has its limits. I worked with a lawyer who had been licensed for 25 years, so he had seen his share of stupidity. His mantram was ""stupid people have stupid children"". He was speaking genetically, so he would disagree with you. I always tried to build my children's confidence by telling them how smart they were. One day I just had to say to my youngest who had just gotten himself into a situation, ""for a smart person like you, that really was a stupid thing to do."" He laughed and agreed with me. It would be really great if scientists would come up with a vaccine against stupid, but then the anti-vac. people would refuse to allow their children to be vaccinated. Stupid, just stupid! breakfastpop on February 02, 2015: I hope you feel better. Let's face it we live in a Nanny State that believes we are all children in need of guidance. It would be funny if it weren't so insulting and sickening!"
49,An Illustrated Guide for Pruning An Overgrown Apple Tree,community," Overgrown Apple Tree Without careful attention to pruning and other culturlal practices, an apple tree can become to tall, to wide, to dense in the middle and it looks unmanageable. However, it is not as difficult to rejuvinate as it looks.  Pruning Equipment folded pruning saw It will require laying out a little cash to get the needed equipment as indicated in the illustrations. I prefer the scissors pruners over the the anvil style, but either one works fine. They are for pruning small twigs, branches, and suckers. The loppers are for cutting larger branches and branches you can't reach with hand pruners. A pole pruner telescopes to reach parts of the tree you can't reach with the loppers. It has both a pruning tool and a pruning saw on the end. A pruning saw is used to cut large limbs that are dead or need to be removed. Please do not try to use a regular saw. A pruning saw has teeth set for pruning trees.  Before starting on the tree you need to know about the different types of cuts and what they do to a tree. A thinning cut removes the entire branch back to a side branch without leaveing a stub as the illustration  shows. This cut is also used to remove large limbs with the pruning saw. There are several benefits of a thinning cut, as follows: Illustration of a heading cut thinning and heading cuts compared A heading cut shortens the length of a limb by cutting off some of the end. It has both its pros and cons. They are: root suckers This tree has been trimmed too much in my opinion. apple tree before and after pruning  Pruning can be done anytime after the tree has defoliated and before growth starts in the spring. Pruning can be done in fall before extreme cold temperatures and in the spring after extreme temperatures are past. In some areas pruning can be done all winter long if one is careful not to prune just ahead of brief cold snaps. The best time is in the spring after the winter temperatures have ceased and before the growth of any foliage."
50,My First Month on HubPages,community," Aside from writing, Bill loves to travel, explore new places, and take lots of photos to document it all. Well, it’s been one month now and a lot has happened. I discovered HubPages in February of 2012, while reading an article on Yahoo Finance about a school teacher who could no longer teach and was earning an income by writing articles for HubPages. It sounded interesting so I checked it out. A few days later, and I was an official member of the HubPages community. After writing my first Hub I eagerly followed the process of registering for all of the earning channels, and after another day or so I was off and running. I’m still not certain that I understand all of the nuances of how we earn money doing this, but I think I know just enough to be dangerous. After publishing my first few articles I was addicted; hook, line and sinker. I can’t explain my excitement when I saw my first earnings, a whole two cents. I’m not kidding when I say I was excited. I even took a picture so that years from now I can recall my humble beginnings. Since then I have written 19 Hubs (my goal was 20 for my first month) and my earnings are up to over $3. I know, it doesn't sound like much, but I have read enough Hubs to realize that this is not something that will come early or easy. I must say that it has been an enormous help having an abundance of Hubs available to guide us newbie’s in addition to the HubPages help section. I also want to give a shout out to my fellow Hubbers who have offered words of encouragement. I think I can say with some certainty that I am now in this for the long haul. So what else have I learned in my first thirty days? Well, one very helpful tip that I picked up here on HubPages is to not rush my Hubs. In fact someone suggested that when you think you are done with a Hub and really, really want to hit that publish button, to resist and to let it sit for another day just to see if it sounds as good a day later. I have learned very quickly here that quality certainly counts when it comes to publishing good articles. Another very important thing that I have picked up is the whole back linking and linking of articles. I have embedded links to some of my other Hubs and included a links section in many of my Hubs, but again, I’m not sure that I am fully getting this. I am also trying to include as much visual content in my Hubs; pictures, maps, polls, etc. My very first earnings Bill DeGiulio And then there is the whole traffic issue. Clearly, traffic has a direct impact on earnings. To increase my traffic I have expanded my social network to include Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Linkedin. I’m not sure yet if this is having a positive impact but I’m also assuming that it’s not hurting. I have to admit that I check my traffic daily, sometimes many times during a day. I have just surpassed 1000 views which was one of my goals for my first month when I signed on. I do understand that the views from within Hubpages, while important, are not as important as views from search engines such as Google and Yahoo, so the traffic number needs to be taken with a grain of salt. I have tried to gain an understanding of the Hubscore, and to date have not seen any articles that can explain the formula behind this. Again, I’m not sure it matters a whole lot, but as with anything that is measured numerically it is my instinct to try to achieve the highest score possible. I don’t recall what my Hub score was when I first signed on, probably 50ish, but it is now up to 89 give or take a point or two, so I’m heading in the right direction. The one area of concern I am having now is whether I should continue writing Hubs that come from the same niche, such as Italy or Running, or should I start to branch out to other topics. Is it better to build a library of Hubs about a similar topic or to diversify? I guess for now I’ll just keeping writing about whatever happens to be first and foremost in my mind. One last thing that I am doing that has proven helpful is to carry a cheat sheet around with me. I find that I am thinking of ideas for articles to write in the darnedest places and it is helping me to pull out my list and jot down the idea. As it may be weeks or months before I get to all of these topics this will keep me from forgetting a good idea. So that’s it, thirty days in and moving in the right direction. Hopefully, this will be a long and fruitful relationship. If it does work out I will be forever grateful for having stumbled onto that article that led me here. Just goes to show you that you never know what life has in store for you and where it will take you. © 2012 Bill De Giulio MomsTreasureChest on October 31, 2017: Still good tips for those new to HubPages.  Would love to see your five year update of your thoughts, experiences, earnings, etc on your time with HubPages. Vivek-Koshy Thomas Poovathoor from San Antonio, TX on August 05, 2017: A few years later and this is still very helpful! Thanks for sharing your experience! I hope to grow into a helpful and enjoyable contributor on HubPages. Julie K Henderson on April 08, 2015: Thank you.  I have been enjoying the experience of writing for HubPages.  Have a wonderful day. Bill De Giulio (author) from Massachusetts on April 08, 2015: Hi Julie.  Thanks for stopping by and welcome to HubPages.  I'm still here three years after writing this hub.  It's been great fun.  Welcome and enjoy. Julie K Henderson on April 08, 2015: This is a nice report.  I learned a lot in my first month on HubPages, and I'm certain I have much to learn.  Thank you for sharing. Bill De Giulio (author) from Massachusetts on March 16, 2013: Hi Pierre.  Welcome to HubPages.  You are going great, keep it going.  Remember, to be successful here takes hard work, patience, and perseverance.  best of luck Pierre Eustache from Haiti on March 16, 2013: Reading such hub boost my motivation. Thanks for sharing your stats. When i remember that i wrote 4 articles for my first 4 months! :D Should read this before! Bill De Giulio (author) from Massachusetts on December 04, 2012: Hi vinayak1000.  It's never too late.  The more you write the more you'll make.  Thanks for the visit. vinayak1000 from Minneapolis on December 03, 2012: Great! I should have done the same thing. Maybe I still can. Since I make just about $3/month. Bill De Giulio (author) from Massachusetts on November 03, 2012: Yep, you hit the mail on the head.  It's definitely a long slow process.  Just keep producing good quality hubs and hopefully the rest takes care of itself.  Thanks for stopping by. Chantele Cross-Jones from Cardiff on November 03, 2012: Well you have done pretty well for your first month! I didn't reach $3 in one month till my 3rd month. Hubpages is all about a slow burner, building up quality hubs and backlinks and just hoping you get the traffic! lol! Good luck Bill De Giulio (author) from Massachusetts on July 26, 2012: Maybe I'll give it a go.  What's the worst that can happen, I don't get to 30 but still publish many more Hubs than I would have otherwise.  Thanks SusieQ42 on July 26, 2012: You're welcome.  It took me over a year to finally take the 30 day challenge.  I thought it would be a huge commitment but doing more than one a day works.  I linked them all together (most of them) and had plenty of views. Bill De Giulio (author) from Massachusetts on July 26, 2012: Thanks Susie.  I'm plugging away and doing what I can.  I thought about the 30 day challenge but I work a full time job and that would be tough.  Thanks for the feedback, it all helps. SusieQ42 on July 26, 2012: I just finished the 30 day hub challenge and found it helped increase my earnings.  I also set up pinboards on Pinterest and my traffic has increased, probably around 50 views each day.  I included some links at Linkedin and also tweet and like my hubs, just not all in the same day.  lol  HP doesn't recommend overdoing it on any of them.  After one year and a few months my traffic is up to around 300 views daily.  I think the best way to increase traffic is to find a popular topic that brings in many readers (check your stats) and write as much as you can about it.  I make the most on sources of online income.   God bless and keep on writing! Bill De Giulio (author) from Massachusetts on July 20, 2012: Hi Rachel.  Welcome to HubPages.  Glad you found this helpful.  I can tell you that if you stick with it you will learn a lot here.  Best of luck to you and thank you for reading and commenting. Rachel Koski Nielsen from Pennsylvania to Minnesota on July 20, 2012: Very useful, especially for a newbie like me! I know what you mean when you say you were excited about those first couple of pennies - so was I. I didn't expect to really earn anything, to be honest, because I didn't quite understand how the ad program works. Thanks for sharing your first month's experiences! Voted up, useful, interesting :) Bill De Giulio (author) from Massachusetts on July 07, 2012: Hi Ethel.  Thank you for reading and the support, very much appreciated.  The idea of a passive income stream is very appealing, especially as I get closer to retirement (?? someday hopefully).  I too am just amazed at all of the internet income generating possibilities.  Who would have thougth?  Certainly not me also.  Thanks again and have a great day. Ethel Smith from Kingston-Upon-Hull on July 07, 2012: I just dived in soooo long ago and find I am still learning. I write on whatever takes my whim it seems to me. These days hubpages is more a passive income, albeit small, for me. I even have two websites of my own these days. Yes life is strange. Who would have thought it? Not me for sure. Good luck on your internet journey. You have made a great start :) Janine Huldie from New York, New York on July 07, 2012: Thank you again for all your kind words and for following me as well.  Totally appreciate all the support!! Bill De Giulio (author) from Massachusetts on July 07, 2012: Hi Janine.  This is addicting and so enjoyable.  I am having a great time writing, reading, and learning something new every day.  Not only is this great fun but it's an education as well.  Thanks for reading. Janine Huldie from New York, New York on July 07, 2012: I also started about a month ago and thank you for sharing your experience so far.  I have to admit I love it here and am totally enjoying writing, sharing and reading other people's writing as well.  Voted up and sharing too. Bill De Giulio (author) from Massachusetts on July 07, 2012: Thanks Jools99.  I am still learning and that is part of the fun of writing here.  I have also stopped worrying about my hubscore, it is what it is.  I'm almost to 6 months here now and still addicted to this so I guess that's a good sign.  Thank you for taking the time to read and comment.  Have a great day. Jools Hogg from North-East UK on July 07, 2012: bdegiulio, this is a well written hub which certainly encourages others to try their hand at HubPages.  I have been here about 10 months and I'm still learning the ropes but that learning experience is all part and parcel of becoming a better contributor.  I don't worry too much about my hubscore, I haven't got a clue why it's 99 today and only 96 tomorrow.  And the advice about waiting a day to publish is good advice, as much as it sometimes kills me to wait that extra day, I usually do come back to a hub with a fresher eye and do some further tweaking :o) Voted up etc and shared. aa lite from London on May 23, 2012: I've read these in reverse order, I've just come from your 2 month update :) My personal feeling is that it is better to focus on a few topics and have big groups with many interlinked hubs.  I think this might work better for getting a good ranking in Google for a particular site.  If somebody is searching for a running related keyword, which one of your hubs answers, and google sees that, on this site you have this one particular hub that fits that query, but you have a lot more hubs about running and they are all linked together, it will think that this site is an authority on running, and will rate that one particular hub more highly.  Google considers many factors and nobody knows exactly what it likes, but if you believe what they say the prefer big sites focused on a topic, that are easy to navigate i.e the related pages are all interlinked. But also you should just write what you feel like writing about, if you really find a topic outside your range interesting, then write about it. Shasta Matova from USA on April 22, 2012: It is great that you are taking the time to read other hubs and learning how to write them. I personally like writing on a variety of topics because that keeps it interesting for me. It also helps me figure out what other people are interested in reading from me. I found that a lot of my topics don't generate a lot of views, and I can either not write them or just write them for my own pleasure.  Also, some topics earn more revenue than others.  Click on the stats at the top of your hub, and you will see - the more dollar signs, the better the earnings. Sandra Busby from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, USA on April 14, 2012: It is certainly a steep learning curve, not the writing so much for me as the technology and the driving traffic, etc.  We have been on about the same length of time.  Now I'm headed to read your two month update.  Thanks for SHARING. Bill De Giulio (author) from Massachusetts on April 13, 2012: Thanks Lenzy.  The first month was a frenzy of activity for me but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I just published a 2 month update if you have time to read it.  I didn't publish as much in my second month but with the nice weather comes other things that require time.  I am trying to keep the momentum going but it will be a challenge.  I very much appreciate your support and comments.  Hopefully you find the time to write more as you are a very talented write and I enjoy reading your Hubs.  Bill Lenzy from Arlington, Texas on April 13, 2012: I enjoyed the hub.  I wish I had more time to devote to writing but am now working full time. I liked seeing how your first month developed. Lenzy William Jordan from Houston on March 11, 2012: you seem to be coming along well been here 3 months and still working on hub score... Vasanthan R Menon from India on March 10, 2012: Almost 3 months and one hub old on hubpages, I have been a reluctant participant here. But your experience in one month has really woken me up...thank you Shandria  Ball from Anniston on March 10, 2012: good luck, I am still trying to figure things out after 4 months!!! Bill De Giulio (author) from Massachusetts on March 10, 2012: Thank you everyone.  I am determined to make this work.  And to be honest, it really doesn't feel like work at all, I'm having a blast so far.  Best of luck to you also and keep writing. cdemp11 from GA, USA on March 10, 2012: As a Hub newbie myself, this hub is a helpful reminder to keep writing and to make personal goals to work toward! Marion Elodie from London on March 10, 2012: I didn't really take enough time to figure how things work here and most importantly I haven't written many hubs, but it's good to read about someone else's experience. Thanks for sharing and good luck! mljdgulley354 on March 10, 2012: You have accomplished a lot in 30 days. Congratulations and good luck here on hubpages. It really is an addicting site. Bill De Giulio (author) from Massachusetts on March 10, 2012: Thank You.  Same to you.  I still have a lot to learn but we are making progress. marketnewb on March 10, 2012: Best of luck to you as you continue on your journey!"
51,10 Tips & Tricks For Writing Better Hubpage Articles,community," E.B. Black is a published author who writes fantasy, sci-fi, and romance novels. Writing is difficult. Anyone who says otherwise has never been a writer. There are different types of writers that face different challenges. Many write fiction, which includes things like novels, short stories, and scripts. But some write non-fiction, which likely includes you if you are interested in writing for hubpages. I've been writing both fiction and non-fiction seriously ever since I turned 18, I am now 33, so it's been about 15 years now. I've been on hubpages a few years, learning the ropes of how this site works. While we all have more to learn from each other, I've learned a few things about writing for this site that can improve your experiences and success on this platform if you follow my advice. Of course, your mileage may vary, every writing career is different and these are just suggestions. This may surprise you, but I actually have three times as many drafted articles as I have published articles on hubpages. Every once in awhile, I might delete some of them, but most of the time, I go back to an article idea when I get inspiration for it, edit it, and fill it out way after I originally created the article. This is how most writers work, no matter the field. I also write novels and I know a lot of authors who have a billion story ideas floating around their computer in word documents. We call them plot bunnies, which are ideas we have for writing a novel, that may or may not become a book later. There's never enough time to write all your idea, so you jot them down to use later. In the same way, it can help to brainstorm article ideas. Not just thinking about them, but actually writing them down by creating documents or pages that you can edit and publish later. This gets your creative juices going and it allows you to ruminate over the many different possibilities. Don't worry, the best ideas always float to the top and become something tangible. The good thing about brainstorming is that not all your ideas have to work, you're just letting your creativity run wild and free! When I'm creating new articles on this site, it can take me days to finish them. I take my time, think about what I want to say, and rewrite it if needed. I read through all the articles i link to and watch all the videos I post on each article, to make sure I am picking the right ones. This can take days of just researching alone, reading many different articles (that don't wind up fitting) and watching many different videos (that don't work.) This is why people like reading my articles because they can sense it when someone just slapped something together. Don't link someone to something or recommend something when you haven't looked into those things yourself. You want people to trust your recommendations, so make sure you're giving good ones. Don't forget to fact check yourself when talking about something and to take moments to research grammar and spelling if you need to. While there are editors on this site, no one can catch everything and it's always better to present your best work. Yes, it's a lot of effort, but you'll be prouder of the final result and more people will appreciate it as well. Hubpages rates our writing on its quality. This can help improve your quality. Hubpages has a lot of suggestions when it comes to formatting and they know what they're talking about. A lot of people have short attention spans when it comes to articles and they know how to help you format articles to keep people interested and reading. I hated their requirements when I first joined. I just wanted to write a block of text. That's what I was used to writing when I wrote novels and writing blocks of text is easy! I had to find pictures and videos? But that takes time, time that I could be writing other things! Not to mention, I didn't know where to look or how to do it, so it was a learning curve as well and sometimes you just don't want to learn new things. But overall, following their suggestions has made my writing better, not just on here, but I also have a blog and a newsletter that I write for my readers. I've used some of their suggestions and tricks to format those things as well. I get a higher volume of people reading me on those platforms as well because of hubpages and what it has taught me! Because they know how to make an article look pleasing, they know how to attract attention. We are lucky to be on a site that takes article writing so seriously and holds our hand like this, guiding us on how to improve our writing. I've never seen anything like it on any other site and it's not a resource you want to take for granted. So use it, even if it's difficult at first. Sometimes it can be hard to figure out what to write. My suggestion, in those instances, is to take something that interests you and write your opinion on it. The thing about hubpages is that it's not wikipedia. We can't just memorize facts and spit them out on our pages. In fact, in some instances that might be considered copyright infringement. So what we need to do instead is take something and put our own spin on it, by giving our opinion on it. You don't have to say that in the article, you just have to write it out and be honest. It doesn't have to be about anything important either, like politics or history, it can just be about what your favorite part of your favorite video game is or why you like watching romantic comdies. You'll be surprised by how many things you can come up with. It's very important not to steal images from people. Unfortunately, this happens a lot online. People think images are free, so they just google what they are looking for and steal whatever image comes out in the search results as long as it's what they like the best. We wouldn't want people to steal our hubpage articles and claim them as their own. I've had that happen to me and it was infuriating. I work hard on these articles and to have people just take them without permission really hurts. So we shouldn't do it with people's images that they worked hard to create either. Most of us do not have the money to pay for stock photos. I get it because I don't either. Luckily, there are different sites where you can find free images to use and I have linked them below. There is a reason that hubpages encourages us to write in multiple text blocks (instead of just one) and to add pictures and videos to our articles. Even when you read news articles, you'll find most of them are broken up by pictures, videos, and quotes. This is because if we see a giant block of text to read all at once, our eyes immediately get tired and we are much more likely to exit the page because of it. People come on here to enjoy themselves, not to feel like they are doing schoolwork. Make lists. (This article is a list for example!) Add pictures between paragraphs. Whatever you can do to make the page look like more fun to read and look at. The way to make an article unique is not to write an article that no one else has ever written. That may be your first thought, that you need to have an idea that no one else has ever had, but that's next to impossible. What's unique about your article is you. Only you have your life experiences, opinions, and perspective. Only you have your personality and the voice you bring to your work. I covered this some earlier when I said to write about your opinions, but do more than that. Tell anecdotes if it's appropriate. Share experiences. Be vulnerable. Be you. Don't expect to master writing articles right away. I've written a lot and deleted a lot. I had a ton of writing experience already when I joined hubpages. But you can tell my earlier articles from my more recent ones because they are not as good. There are giant blocks of text. Sometimes I ramble. It makes me cringe to look at them. But I've learned and I've improved through practice. I'm still learning and improving through practice. You get better at something the more you do it and rewriting an article is okay if it doesn't come out right the first time. (I've done that a lot.) Be patient with yourself and don't be afraid to try, even when you make mistakes. Thinking about writing an entire article can be overwhelming. That's why usually I take each article I write in chunks. Like I said, many of them take days to write. So I'll often start off with something easy, like looking for pictures for my article because I feel overwhelmed in the beginning. Doing an easier task in the beginning can make the later harder tasks seem less intimidating. When I finish that task, it gives me a sense of accomplishment because I know I've completed a step in the process. That helps keep me motivated. Then the next day, I might look for videos and links. The next day I might research. Another day, I might create headers for all my text blocks and outline what I am going to write. And then another day, I fill out all the words. I just do whatever I think I can handle that day and even if I do several steps all in one day, I still take it one task at a time to help motivate me. Like I said, writing isn't easy and you need to do whatever you can to help yourself get to that finish line. This involves patting yourself on the back a lot to keep you from feeling frustrated or overwhelmed. Excitement is contagious. People can tell when you care about something a lot. Like hubpages? I love writing articles for hubpages and I'm guess you can feel it based on what I am writing. I often procrastinate on writing my novels in order to write another article instead. That's how much I enjoy it. Writing about things you enjoy not only makes the reading experience better for your readers, but it makes your writing experience easier, too. Naturally, you will know more about something that interests you. It will also be easier to research where you need to learn more because the research will be fun.. You'll have a deeper involvement in it and more ideas. Hubpages is awesome because you can take something you really care about, like playing video games, and turn it into something productive that can make you money. All you have to do is talk about your interest and thoughts on videos games. This also leads to me feeling less guilty in life when I indulge in that youtube video or set aside an hour for a hobby because I can turn it into an article later. So it's almost like doing something more productive!

From losing a wallet or having it stolen, to spending a bit too much at the roulette wheel, every seasoned traveler has experienced their share of vacation problems. The key is to take these travel issues in stride, and not let them ruin your long planned vacation. One of the most important considerations when traveling is money, saving it and protecting it. Saving money, by selecting the cheapest lodging and airfare you can find, is a great way to make even the most limited travel budget go further. To protect your travel money, most seasoned travelers and travel experts recommend keeping valuables in a hidden wallet or travel pouch, either wrapped around your waist under your clothes or hung around your neck under your shirt. Another great way to protect your money and reduce the chance of theft is to keep the majority of your cash in the hotel safe, taking only enough out each day to pay for small incidental purchases. Use credit cards for meals, lodging, admissions, souvenirs and other larger purchases. Credit cards provide valuable consumer protection and the best currency exchange rates as well. Of course even the most well protected wallet can be lost or stolen, and there is one very valuable tip to keep a lost or stolen wallet from bringing your vacation to an abrupt end. Many seasoned travelers have learned to pack an extra wallet in their suitcase or backpack. This wallet will contain only a credit card or two and perhaps an ATM card. That way, if you lose your primary wallet, you still have access to ready cash with which to finish your trip. It is also a good idea to make an itinerary, and leave it at home with family members or a trusted friend. Having family members and friends know your itinerary will help them contact you in case of an emergency at home. It is also a good idea to keep copies of your identification papers, travelers check numbers, and a photocopy of your passport, at home. One word about the passport – I always take mine with me, even when traveling within the United States. The reason I do that is that the passport provides an additional piece of information, and that is important in the event your wallet is lost or stolen while on vacation. Since it is impossible to board a plane these days without id, having an extra form of id with you can make your life a lot easier. It is also important to make several copies of your important travel documents, including flight reservations, hotel confirmations, rental car receipts, etc. Put each copy in a different place - one or two in different parts of the suitcase or backpack, one in your back pocket, one in your purse or carry-on, etc. Also record important phone numbers in the address book of your cell phone for easy access. It is also important to carry basic medical information, such as your blood type, allergy information and information about medications you are taking, with you while on vacation. It is also important to carry your medications in your carry-on luggage or purse, and never to pack them in a checked suitcase. Paris at Night   Europe can either be one of the most expensive destinations in the world, or one of the least costly, depending on what you do, where you eat, where you stay and how you get around. Europe is a hit with budget travelers and the well heeled alike, but this article focuses on helping the former get the very most from their travel dollar. The goal of budget travel is not merely to spend as little as possible. The true goal of the budget traveler is to get the most value out of his or her travel budget, and to focus those limited funds on the things that mean the most to them. Often this means finding cheap lodging in order to enjoy a four star dinner at the finest restaurant in Paris. For others, it could mean buying food at the local grocery and cooking your own dinner, so that you can splurge on a night at the opera or the ballet. Listed below are some of our all time favorite tips for saving money on a vacation in Europe (or anywhere else for that matter): Ø Eat where the locals eat. Eating with the local people instead of the tourists is a great way to save money and enjoy some of the finest cuisine. The restaurants favored by local residents tend to be those that provide the best meals at the lowest prices. Ø For a quick and economical breakfast, pick up a roll, some fresh cold cuts and a piece of fruit from the local market. Then enjoy a delicious sandwich and a cup of coffee in the local park. Ø When eating out, choose the fixed price menu and the house wine for the best value. Most restaurants offer two or three choices on their fixed price menu, and these dishes are often a great way to sample the local cuisine. Ø Sleep cheap on the train. Overnight trains are a great way to both get from place to place and sleep cheaply. Be sure to bring a meal, bottle of water and snack along with you. You will save money by not visiting the dining car, and you will enjoy some great food as well. Ø Take lots of pictures and enjoy the people you meet on the road. Take pictures not only of local tourist attractions but of the friends you meet along the way. If using a film camera, it is best to bring the undeveloped rolls back with you and have them developed once you get back home, since film developing in tourist locations is usually quite costly. And of course a digital camera offers a great and cost effective alternative, and you can choose to print only the best shots. Ø Try emailing your postcards. Find a website that offers some great photographs of local attractions, or upload your own from your digital camera. Use these shots to send some great personalized email postcards to family and friends back home. Ø Try to learn at least a bit of the local language. If you know the language, or at least the names of the currency, it will be easier, and often cheaper, to buy the things you need. Ø When making large purchases, it is always best to use a credit card. Not only will your cash last longer, but credit cards provide the best exchange rates. Ø Get cash through an ATM instead of at currency exchange kiosks and hotels. Like credit cards, ATM cash transactions provide the best exchange rates, and you will avoid the sometimes costly fees charged by hotels and currency services. Ø Take advantage of all the discounts you are entitled to. Many locations provide student discounts, senior discounts, etc. If you are not sure about discounts, always be sure to ask. Ø Plan your vacation budget wisely. There are some excellent, and very inexpensive mementos of your trip, such as stickers, patches or postcards. For more expensive purchases, remember that the further you venture from the tourist attraction, the less expensive the souvenirs will become. Ø Tour the city with the locals. A bus pass or subway token is a great way to meet the local people and see the sights. The public transportation service of most European cities is remarkably efficient, clean, safe and easy to navigate. It is not necessary to speak the local language to navigate on the subway or the bus system of most cities. When it comes to traveling across Europe, many people assume that such an adventure is beyond their modest means.  However, the legions of college students and others on shoestring budgets that descend on Europe every summer undermine this assumption.  If these budget travelers can make Europe affordable, there is no reason you cannot as well. Europe is actually quite a travel bargain in many ways, and if you choose your lodging, meals and transportation carefully a vacation in Europe can actually cost much less than a week in some of the most expensive cities in the United States. One of the primary considerations of enjoying Europe on a budget is how to get around.  When it comes to getting around, there are basically three choices – the bus, the train and air travel.  Renting a car is often impractical in Europe, with the different types of roads, different laws and road signs in a myriad of unfamiliar languages. Europe’s intercity bus lines offer passes, similar to rail passes, that can be purchased for various lengths of time and which provide for unlimited travel during those times.  Single city to city bus tickets are often quite reasonable as well. The main disadvantage of the bus system in Europe is that it is slow compared to rail travel and air travel.  In addition, there is limited legroom on most buses, few opportunities to stand up and stretch, and some buses lack on board toilet facilities. For many people, the extra convenience of the train more than justifies the difference in price, and train passes are still quite affordable for students and others on a budget.  In addition to being faster, trains provide such amenities as toilets, and also sleeping quarters on overnight trains.  Be aware, however, that there is often an extra charge for sleeping cars and other first class accommodations, even for rail pass holders. One option that is overlooked by many budget travelers is that of city to city air travel.  In Europe, however, air travel is actually quite a cost effective alternative to train and even bus travel.  There are a number of excellent low cost air carriers all around Europe, and the fares they charge are often comparable to, and in some cases even lower than, train tickets between the same cities. No matter how you get around, you will need a clean and safe place to stay once you reach your destination.  There are a number of excellent low cost lodging options in Europe, ranging from hostels to hotels to bed and breakfasts.  In most cases, hostels will be the least expensive option, but for groups of two, three or more it may be just as cheap, or even cheaper, to rent a small room at a budget hotel instead. For those who arrive at their destination without reservations, there are hotel booking services available at most major train stations and airports.  These booking services can usually find you a place to stay, even if the city is very crowded.  For this service, they usually charge a small fee, either a set fee or a percentage of the room charge. Hostel in Czech Republic Budget travel – is hosteling right for you? Hosteling was once thought of as the exclusive province of college kids traveling through Europe for the first time. However, hosteling has grow to include all ages, and all types of people. When traveling on a budget, staying at a hostel can be a great experience for the traveler with a sense of adventure. Of course, hostel travel is not for everyone, and some travelers would rather spend extra money for solo accommodations. In general, hostel traveling is best suited to solo travelers, or to groups of young people traveling together. Hostel stays are generally not recommended for families traveling with young children, and many hostels do not accept children under a certain age. Most hostels are set up as dormitory style rooms, with a number of bunk beds arranged throughout the room. The number of bunk beds in a single room varies, with the average from four to ten bunks per room. Each traveler is assigned a specific bunk upon check-in. Almost all hostels in the United States divide their accommodations according to gender, with the female guests in one block of rooms and the male guests in another. In multi-floor hostels, each gender is often assigned a specific floor or group of floors. In many European locations and elsewhere around the world, however, many hostel rooms have mixed genders sharing a room. If this is a concern, be sure to ask about it. I, as a man traveling alone, have personally never encountered a problem with these arrangements, and I have stayed in hostels throughout Europe, including Rome, London and Amsterdam. Some visitors, however, are surprised at these arrangements. The bathroom accommodations at hostels vary as well, with some rooms containing a shared bathroom and shower, while other hostels will have shower and bathroom facilities located in the hallway. If this is an important consideration, you should make sure to ask about bathroom facilities when making the reservation. And reservations are becoming increasingly important at hostels, especially during the summer months in popular locations. Where once it was common for travelers simply to drop by the hostel and get a bed, it is now not at all unusual for hostels in popular tourist destinations to be booked solid for months. The main appeal of staying at hostels, of course, is the price. The nightly rate for a hostel rarely rises above $25 or $30 per night, with most hostel accommodations costing far less. With the average hotel room hovering around $100 to $150 in many locations, it is easy to see why hostels are becoming so popular. In addition, the staff at most hostels are extremely accommodating and knowledgeable about the local area. Unlike many staff members of some luxury hotels, who travel in from the suburbs and rarely see the city in which the live, hostel staff tend to live in their city, and they have an intimate knowledge of the local attractions, including which attractions are can’t miss and which ones are a waste of money. In addition, hostels often have access to discounts and coupons for local area attractions and restaurants, and they can provide valuable information on the best, lowest priced restaurants in the area. While staying at a hostel is not for everyone, and the local hostel will never be mistaken for a Ritz Carlton, hostels can be wonderful budget accommodations for the budget minded traveler. After all, the goal of travel is to get out and see the world, and hostel travel lets you spend your limited travel dollars doing just that. When most people hear the term budget travel, they often think first of the hordes of young backpackers who traverse Europe on shoestring budgets each summer. This image is very true, and backpacking is one of the best ways to see the most sights, in the shortest amount of time and for the smallest amount of money. Backpacking is one of the very best ways to travel light, and traveling light often allows you to travel more cheaply. Learning how to back your backpack the right way and to pack as lightly as possible, is an important skill, whether you are trekking through Europe for a month or just enjoying a weekend in the country. The first thing is to start with a lightweight but well built backpack that is able to withstand the rigors of travel. A quality backpack should have heavy zippers, pockets and flaps that close easily and stay closed, and lots of easy accessible compartments. Buying a backpack with a lock can be important as well, particularly if your backpack will be out of sight often, such as when you are on a crowded train or staying at a hotel or hostel. Another good alternative for many backpackers and other budget traveler is to buy a backpack that has wheels. The upside of such a design, of course, is that the backpack will be easy to wheel from place to place, and will function much like a rolling carryon suitcase, but without the bulk. The downside of the rolling backpack, however, is that such backpacks are considerably heavier when you do have to use them as backpacks. Whether or not a backpack on wheels is right for you will depend on your style of travel and your personal preferences. Of course what you put in your backpack is just as important as the backpack itself. It is important to pack wisely when planning for your backpack adventure. A good approach is to pack only a few quality and versatile items of clothing and combine them in new ways for variety. Packing a few accessories, such as scarves, ties and jewelry, are a great way to make the clothes you pack go further. They take up little room in the backpack, and they can provide new ways to wear the same clothes. It is also important to pack travel size toiletry items into your backpack. Shampoos, conditioners, deodorants, toothpaste and even toothbrushes all come in small travel sizes, so be sure to gather these travel size items for your trip. These travel size items are a great way to keep the weight of your backpack to a minimum. It is also important to buy a good pair of comfortable walking shoes since you will be wearing them for a long time. Shoes take up a great deal of space in a suitcase or backpack, so stick with one pair of good shoes, and use the rest of your backpack for clothes and other items. One good rule of thumb when deciding what to pack and what to leave at home is to pack those items that are not easily or cheaply purchased at your destination and leave behind those items you can easily purchase once you arrive. One important consideration for those who wear glasses is to pack an extra pair of eyeglasses. The importance of this tip will depend on the strength of your prescription and how important your glasses are go getting around. Most people who wear glasses have at least one extra pair. Investing in a hard-sided case and packing it in your backpack could potentially save you a lot of money and trouble if you lose or break your glasses. Cascades Timeshare Timeshares can be one of the most valuable resources for the budget minded traveler, but they are also one of the most frequently regretted purchases.  Many people get roped into buying overpriced timeshare units through high pressure sales tactics, or they are lured into expensive properties by the promise of a “free” vacation. No matter what the reason, there are a great many unwanted timeshares on the market at any given time.  What that means for the budget travel is the opportunity to pick up some great timeshare properties at prices that are a fraction of the original price. There are a number of places to look for resale timeshares, including real estate agents, bulletin boards, newspaper classified and even online auctions.  Any of these places can be a great place to pick up a quality timeshare at a budget price, but it is important to shop around, and to understand exactly what you are getting before making your purchase. One of the keys to buying a quality time share at a good price is to buy only in high demand areas, or in areas that are growing in popularity.  Remember that a timeshare is primarily a piece of real estate, and we all know that the three most important factors for real estate are location, location and location. Examples of areas in high demand include places like Hawaii, the California coastline, the coast of Florida, Orlando, Cancun, Myrtle Beach, and the Caribbean. It is also important to know the maintenance fees of the properties you are considering.  The maintenance fees are a large part of any timeshare ownership, and one of the primary reasons that current owners decide to dump their properties.  It is important to avoid properties that have very high maintenance fees unless you can buy it at an unbeatable price. It is always important to get the best price on any timeshare property you buy.  It is also important to read any timeshare resale contracts carefully, and perhaps even have a qualified lawyer review the paperwork, before you buy.  Remember that a timeshare is a real estate transaction, whether you are buying a brand new unit or a resale. Of course, it is also vital to make sure that buying a timeshare is the right move for you.  A timeshare can be an excellent deal for the budget minded traveler, but it is not right for every traveler.  Timeshares are generally suited to those who wish to travel to the same location every year.  Even though many people emphasize the exchangeability of timeshare resorts, the fact is that most timeshare owners spend the majority of their time at their home resort. Of course, the exchangeability of the timeshare property will be enhanced if you take the advice of buying a unit in a high demand area.  For instance, a time share unit in a property next door to Disneyland will obviously be easier to exchange than one a hundred miles away. The Mayan Ruins of Tikal, Guatamala One of the biggest considerations when it comes to budget travel is where to vacation.  Some vacation destinations are much less costly than others, so travelers on a budget need to choose their vacation spots carefully.  One of the most exciting, and least expensive, travel destinations for the budget traveler is the countries of Central and South America. Going where your dollars go farther is one of the cardinal rules of budget travel, and U.S. dollars are highly sought after, and incredibly valuable, in a number of Latin American countries.  For instance, for the same budget, you could spend a week at one of those priciest Caribbean resorts, or several months in many fascinating parts of Central and South America. Budget travel in Latin America has many advantages far beyond the monetary savings.  For instance, some of the most amazing and unforgettable sights just happen to be located in some of the world’s least expensive countries.  These easy to afford, hard to forget sights include the Incan wonders of Machu Picchu in Peru and the wonderful Mayan ruins scattered throughout some of the least costly parts of Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras.  A budget Latin American vacation can include such exciting adventures as exploring an unspoiled rainforest, white water rafting down some of the world’s most beautiful rivers, climbing active and extinct volcanoes, and diving off some of the world’s most spectacular coral reefs. The key to enjoying all this adventure while staying within your budget is to shun the standard tourist sights, and to take your time when traveling around.  By doing this, not only will you save money, but you will make contact with real people, and make some wonderful memories.  While in Cancun you may meet only other tourists, in the wilds of Peru you will meet all kinds of people, from peasant coffee farmers to experienced mountain guides and white water raft guides. Visiting an affordable country means you will enjoy wonderful meals, stay in unique and interesting places, and meet wonderful people you will never forget, all for far less than you would spend at home. When visiting Latin America, it is important to take your time, not simply because there is so much to see, but also because the pace of life there is slower and more relaxed.  And after all, relaxation is what a vacation should be all about.  And the best thing is, your vacation budget can last for many months in this most affordable of destinations. Taking it slow will allow you to spend time with and get acquainted with some of the most fascinating people you will ever meet.  Getting the perspective of the local population and learning from their varied experience, is one of the best parts of travel, no matter what your budget.  Travel provides a perspective and a view of your place in the world that nothing else can, and that is what makes it so uniquely valuable and exciting. Traveling throughout Central and South America is also a great way to boost the local economies, and help the lives of the wonderful people who live there.  Spending time in a small village, living with a local family in a small guest house, may well pay that family’s bills for weeks, help send their children to school, and help them enjoy a brighter future.  Instead of spending your money in a large tourist resort, try stepping off the beaten path for a couple of weeks or months. Not only will you save significant sums of money, but you will help people who need the money.  The beauty of budget travel in Latin America is that your money goes directly to the people who need it, instead of being filtered through resort owners, tour operators and hotel managers.    Adventure travel is one of the fastest growing segments of the travel industry, but it is often difficult to find good bargains when booking adventure travel.  With so many people itching to go on the adventure of a lifetime, the prices in those travel brochures can lead you to believe that adventure travel is beyond your means. That does not have to be the case, however.  The key to affordable adventure travel is to book directly from the providers of the adventure, instead of going through multiple layers of travel agents, tour operators and tour guides. Booking a tour directly has many benefits besides monetary ones, including meeting wonderful local people and enjoying the local culture.  Often the best way to enjoy a vacation on a budget is to book low cost airfare to the destination of your choice, take the local bus into town, and start asking around about the best adventure guides in town.  Local tour operators know the area, they know how to please their clientele, and best of all they are inexpensive.  U.S. currency goes quite a long way in many exotic locations in Africa, Asia and elsewhere, so dealing with local tour guides is the best way to make your adventure travel dollar stretch even further. Many inexperienced adventure travelers are unsure how they can possibly book an adventure tour on their own.  For one thing, there is often a language barrier in far off locations, and you may be many thousands of miles from home in an unfamiliar location. What these first time travelers often don’t realize, however, is that finding a tour operator is often the easiest part of the journey.  In many cases, the tour operators will find you as soon as you land, without you having to seek them out.  And in most places, especially those frequented by American tourists, the guides will speak at least a little bit of English.  Listed below are some of the best tips for booking your own budget travel adventure. Ø      Be sure to ask around before you leave.  Get opinions from other travelers who have done the adventure you plan on. Ø      Refer to your guidebook for references.  Guidebook writers are often quite knowledgeable about which tour operators are good and which are more questionable. Ø      Check on the message boards, both virtual and real.  Real message boards are available at hostels and local guest houses, and they can provide excellent information on local tours and tour operators.  The staff at local hostels can also provide excellent information about adventure travel.  And internet message boards devoted to travel can be great sources of information, both before you leave home and after you arrive in your far off location. Ø      Interview your potential trip leaders carefully.  Ask lots of open ended and probing questions about the equipment used, the experience level of the guides, the lodging the food, and what is and is not included.  Be sure to negotiate everything in advance, since you will have little leverage once the adventure trip has begun. Ø      Finally, if your crew did a great job, be sure to tip them generously after the tour has come to an end.  Good tour operators rely on these tips to supplement their often meager wages, and this helps to keep the best tour guides in business and the best tour operators in operation.    Just about everyone loves to travel, and travel is one of the most intriguing and fun activities one can engage in.  Travel provides the remarkable ability to see the world from a whole new perspective, and I for one believe that if people traveled more outside their country there would be far less war and trouble in the world. When asked why they do not travel, one of the most frequently cited reasons is lack of money.  Lack of funds, however, does not need to be a barrier to traveling the world.  Obviously if you’re flat broke you may not be able to travel as you wish, but most people have at least some disposable income, and it can be surprisingly inexpensive to travel to many places. One of the primary considerations for any budget minded traveler is where to stay.  Fortunately, there are many budget friendly options when it comes to putting a roof over your head for the night.  For solo travelers, hostels can provide, clean safe accommodations and the chance to meet and interact with people from all over the world.  Best of all, the prices are almost impossible to beat.  For instance, most hostels in major U.S. cities range from $20 to $30 a night, when a hotel room would set you back a cool $150-$200 or even more. In Europe, Asia, Africa and South America, hostel accommodations are even cheaper, with many charging the equivalent of $5 a night or even less.  The key is to check the internet and see what is available in your destination.  Many hostels even provide online booking, so you can arrive with your lodging issues already taken care of. For couples, a budget hotel can be a great choice.  There are many such hotels, motels and bed and breakfasts, located all around the world.  Again, many of them are on the internet, and like hostels many can be booked online before you leave home. Another great way to save money while still having a great vacation is to use the public transportation system.  Most destinations in Europe, and many in the United  States and Canada as well, have excellent, fast, reliable, and cheap public transportation systems.  You can probably by a weekly bus pass for less than what you would pay to rent a car for a single day.  And public transportation also frees you from the hassles of parking the car, keeping it gassed up and learning your way around. Another important key to traveling cheap is traveling light.  Trekking around Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, or the Americas does not require a mountain of luggage.  If you are unsure whether to pack it, chances are it is best left at home.  It is best to take a couple of sturdy and versatile outfits, and a good pair of walking shoes, and leave the rest at home. Getting the best airfare, along with finding the cheapest place to stay, is one of the essential cornerstones of successful budget travel.  There are a number of strategies for getting the best deal on airfare, from using credit cards to rack up frequent flier miles, to using discount airlines, to traveling in the off or shoulder season.  The strategy that is best for you depends on your individual needs, and on the location you choose. Keeping the money you do have for travel safe and secure is always a concern when traveling.  Most seasoned travelers have learned to use a hidden money belt to carry passports, plane tickets and the majority of their cash.  Using an in room safe is also a good idea.  It is generally best to use credit cards for major purchases, and keep only a small amount of cash on hand for incidental purchases.  Not only do credit cards provide the best exchange rates, but you are not liable for fraudulent purchases as long as you report the card stolen in a timely fashion. Travel does not have to be out of reach, even for the most budget minded traveler.  The key is to shop wisely, focus on your priorities and get the most out of the money you do spend.    A Mediterranean cruise is a dream honeymoon for many a couple, but many couples simply assume that such a dream is beyond their means.  It is easy to see why people think this, especially since the cost of the wedding itself today is so high.  Many couples feel there is simply not enough money left for a great honeymoon. If a luxurious Mediterranean cruise is your dream, do not despair.  Such a cruise may be more affordable than you think.  For one thing, there are so many cruise lines and so many cruise ships vying for the lucrative honeymoon market, and that competition helps to lower prices.  By shopping around, you can make your first cruise as husband and wife one you will always remember. There are many travel related web sites that focus on travel and cruises to the Mediterranean, and they frequently offer discounted packages.  It is important to search often, however, as these great deals are often snapped up quickly.  It is important to be persistent to get the best deal. After you have found the best deal on a low cost Mediterranean cruise, be sure to book it as soon as you can.  There are many different packages available for Mediterranean cruises, so be sure to shop around to find the one that suits you best.  There are a number of cruise lines and cruise ships that cater to honeymooners, and these ships often provide the most memorable, and most romantic, experiences. In addition, these honeymoon themed cruise lines are often very good at providing some of the best deals to newlyweds.  This is one area where you may want to consult a quality travel agent.  Travel agents are often quite good at sniffing out deals on Mediterranean cruises for honeymoons, so be sure to let the travel agent know when you want to go and where you want to go. If you can travel in the off season, or in the shoulder season, you may be able to spend a lot less on your Mediterranean cruise.  The prices on these cruises often drop substantially after the high season has ended, so be sure to check for good deals in the off season. It is important to start shopping early to book a honeymoon cruise, however.  Just as the wedding takes lots of advance planning, so too with the honeymoon, particularly if your dream is a cruise to a popular destination like the Caribbean.  By shopping around on the internet, however, shopping early and being persistent, you can probably score a much better deal than you ever imagined on the trip of a lifetime.
