0,Frida Kahlo; Story Of A Mysterious Woman,art,"  Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo was an artist who was born in 6th July, 1907. Later when she grew up, she changed her birth year to 1910, which was the year that the Mexican Revolution happened. She was the child of a very multicultural family, it was also the main topic of some of her art works like “My Grandparents, My Parents and I”. In the painting, Frida describes her mother and mother’s parents on the left-up of the canvas, above the Mexican lands, which symbolizes her Mexican mother’s roots. On the other side of the portrait, she images her German father’s side on the top of a sea. The “sea” in the painting means Frida’s European ancestors and describes her father’s culture. The work represents Frida’s mixed roots by its own.    “My Grandparents, My Parents and I” (1936) Frida had to deal with lots of pain and illnesses throughout her lifetime. At the age of 6, she was diagnosed with a disease called “Poliomyelitis” or shortly “Polio”. It is basically an infectious illness that paralyzes the person and causes some affects on central nervous system. The “Polio” left permanent damages on Frida and ended up her right leg being thinner than her left leg. Just to cover this up, Frida always wore long skirts that hid her legs. But that didn’t stop the bullies in school. Later in high school, she went to one of the best schools in Mexico City, “Escuela Nacional Preparatoria”. She was also one of the first female students that accepted to the medical department of national preparatory school in Mexico. The students there were way more different than her old classmates. They were more far-sighted and opened to debates about topics like diplomacy and politics. Her friends were as creative and explorer as her, she was even classmates with one of the most important future officials of Mexico like Alejandro Gómez Arias, Jose Gomez Robleda and Alfonso Villa Rojas. That developed her revolutionist side and created a single-minded, creative woman red. Her life changed when she got in a bus accident at the age of 18. A metal pole crushed her body and damaged her body parts like her collarbone, rib and legs. But the most painful and damaging injuries were the ones on her spine and pelvis. She became bedridden and stayed in coma for weeks. When she woke up and sobered up, she wanted painting materials from her dad. Her dad, Guillermo Kahlo, provided her the essentials and built up a mechanism that allows Frida to paint without standing up. He also placed a mirror on the top of her bed, so that Frida could see herself and create self-portraits. The very first painting she made after the accident was a picture of the bus.  In order to hear the views of an experienced artist; she reached up to Diego Rivera, who was a well-known painter at that time. He liked her art so much that it created a bond between two of them. That bond turned into a marriage in 1929 when Diego was 43 and Frida was 22. Diego wasn’t necessarily a handsome man, but he was very charming. Because of their appearance with each other, people used to call them “The elephant and the dove”. Diego had already married and divorced twice before Frida; and both of them were because of Diego’s disloyalty. He cheated on both of his wives, and unfortunately Frida wasn’t an exception. She was aware of this situation, that’s why she had secret affairs with some people like Russian politician Leon Trotsky and Mexican singer Chavela Vargas. Frida had several miscarriages because of the incidents and paralysis’s she’d been through. She got pregnant for the first time when she was married to Diego; and because of an argument they had, she aborted the baby. When she tried to get pregnant for the second time, she had a miscarriage and the following pregnancies weren’t different from the previous ones. Frida has always wanted a baby boy, but her body was not suitable for giving birth. It led her to depression and a great pain that she didn’t feel before. Frida reflected the darkness she was in to her art and she created the painting “Henry Ford Hospital”.  “Henry Ford Hospital” (1932) 7 years after this painting, right after she got divorced with Diego, she painted one of her famous self-portraits “The Two Frida’s”. The portrait was representing her two different sides; the Frida on the left was a heartbroken and a hopeless woman. But the other Frida was a strong and loving person who was attached to Diego with her heart and soul. The painting “Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird” was just the beginning of her self-portraits with animals. She painted herself in 55 portraits with animals around her. She also had pets like dogs, monkeys, parrots and pigeons in real life. Because of the fact that she was never going to have a baby, her pets were like her children. ""The Two Frida's"" (1939) ""Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird"" (1940) Soon after she got divorced, she had serious health problems and had several operations. In the hospital she was staying, Diego swore allegiance to her and they got married again. Frida’s health continued to become worse and worse every day; in 1953, her leg got cut due to gangrene. Right in the same year, she had a solo exhibition and had to attend from her bed. Frida was feeling like her death was close. So, she wrote these words to her diary; “I hope the way out is filled with joy, I hope I never come back…” She finished her last work 8 days before her death. Even though the painting looks like just watermelons on a table, the meaning behind it is actually deeper than that; the work called “Viva La Vida, Watermelons” was representing Frida’s final days. In 1954, she died at the blue house she was born in. Her house turned into museum a year after she passed out. Some people assume that she died because of overdose while some denote pulmonary embolism as her cause of death. ""Watermelons, Viva La Vida"" (1954) Frida Kahlo gave us 150 paintings throughout her life, she inspired millions of women like Madonna and rewrote the definition of “femininity” in the world. There have been hundreds of movies made and books written about her life, her iconic Vogue shoot was recreated again and again. Her soul and her name still live in Mexico’s heart as a great female artist, a powerful revolutionary and an inspirational woman idol."
1,Mughals Impact On Paintings,art," The Mughal Empire was the product of struggle with Afghans of the two founders, Babur and his son and successor Humayun. The good fortune and abilities of founders and builders along with prolonged political struggle led to the rise of Mughal Empire. The end of reign of Babur and his son Humayun gave rise to Akbar and who during his long reign made no commitments to the capital neither emotional nor political. Later in honor of the success in the Deccan, Jahangir bestowed upon the prince Khurram the title Shah Jahan and with the death of Jahangir in 1627, Shah Jahan eliminated all the rivals for the thrown and was crowned emperor at Agra fort in early 1628. Although all the Mughal emperors from Babur and Aurangzeb to even later Mughals have an impact on Indian history but their reign is also an example of wonderful world of art and architecture. The early Mughal painting like Hamza-nama provides an excellent means to define innovations of Akbar. Moreover, paintings like Humayun with two Hajjis, Two Rosy Pastors and court scenes elaborate different dimensions of art in Mughal Empire and how they impacted art and architecture and specially paintings. Although paintings in reign of every Mughal emperor outshines the others but paintings in reign of Jahangir elaborates different image of him and symbolizes sense of divine truth, care, love and kindness. Jahangir is considered to have been a weak and incapable ruler but painting of his reign contradicts the statement and justifies his true and divine character.   Akbar, the third Emperor of the Mughal Empire consulted with a Sufi who assured him that he’ll be praised with the birth of a son as he had no heir at the age of 28. Finally a male child was born and was named Salim and eight days after his father’s death Salim ascended to the throne and decided to give himself the name Jahangir. So this paper will be focusing on the reign of Jahangir and how his reign impacted paintings and how these paintings elaborates him as an influential, caring and a divine person. Although Jahangir is one of the most important Mughal Emperors but he is still criticized to have been an incapable ruler and even some orientalists have compared him with Roman emperor Claudius for both being weak men. His considerable addiction to daily dosage of wine and opium made him withdraw to a private sphere of life. However, art work and paintings of his reign depicts a sense of kindness and even divine truth and how he gave more value to family and even foreigners and these pieces of paintings and art are evidence of him being a true person more than just an Emperor. Paintings like Jahangir preferring Sufi Shaikh over King James I of England, his beautiful portrait with Akbar in his memories, Jahangir entertaining Shah Abbas and weighing Prince Khurram against gold and silver are evident to the fact that though he was made withdrawal to private life due to addiction to opium but still there was a true and an influential leader within him and thus these paintings are evident to his sense of true and divine nature.   Jahangir’s painting of him preferring Sufi Shaikh over King James I of England symbolizes his divine truth. Likewise his father Akbar, Jahangir was also believer of religion which can be seen in this painting where he favors a holy man over kings. In this painting Jahangir faced four bearded men of varying ethnicity, one of which is Sufi Shaikh accepting the gifted book while Jahangir is making statement on his spiritual leanings. In the painting Sufi Shaikh has been given more importance than Ottoman sultan and King James I of England standing below the Shaikh respectively. The painting is the evidence as to how Jahangir was a spiritual believer and did not distinguish between rich and poor as a true and real person would do. Moreover, his beautiful portrait with his father Akbar in which he can be seen holding a framed image of his father is the evidence as to how he admired his family and father. Even the painting of Prince Khurram weighing against gold and silver and painting of his return from Mewar is also the evidence of realism and love and attraction towards his sons and specially Shah Jahan who was favourite of Jahangir among the other sons and even later succeeded him to become the emperor. Moreover, painting of Jahangir entertaining Shah Abbas is a clear image of power and good foreign relations and evidence that he respected every king and foreigners in his courts. Paintings like distant Himalayan range and the Arrival in Bethelem are true evidence of Netherlandish naturalism and nature in Mughal paintings and reflection of how a person encourages naturalism and nature with piece of arts. These evidences are true for contradicting the criticism about Jahangir and how paintings portrayed him as a caring, kind and divine person more than just being an Emperor.   The art and architecture and specially paintings have been history changing moment among Mughal Empire as it provides evidences to Indian history. It is because of these evidences we can portray images of history today and thus evidences are enough to lighten the impact of Mughals and specially Jahangir on paintings.

2,About Capital of Pakistan Islamabad,art," The most important structure of Islamabad, the capital city of Pakistan is located at the centre of the city’s historic core. Built during the reign of Maharaja Nadeem, Shah Jahan, this fort is located on the north bank of Raja Musad’s Shaheewat Palace which is now known as Bahra-e Haq.  The fortress has a rectangular dome-shaped tower in which it houses many smaller buildings. The roof covers an entrance gate and two towers on either side of it. This small group of structures includes water cisterns built over the river Rialto, domes to cover the walls of the large courtyard, a well, a mosque, several other royal tombs and a walled garden that provides a view of the Peshawar skyline.  The Shah Jahan Mosque is a mosque dedicated to the Mughal emperor Muhammad Ali Shah. His grave is also present here. Most rulers of the 16th century had mosques built for them in their palaces here. However, the mausoleum of Mughal emperors including Babur, Aurangzeb, Ahmad Shah Aziz and Safdar have been removed.  The famous Shaj-e-Faisal mosque near the shrine of Sher Shah Suri and his wife, Sher Syed Begum Akbari, is another important monument of Mughal architecture. The Shah Suri masjid has both minarets and a prayer hall. Here, people come to pray under one roof after prayers and get some rest during the day. Another big mosque dedicated to the Shah Suri family is Faisal Masjid.  Shia Quaid is located in the centre of Pakistani politics, but he belongs to no region, province or province, but to Pakistan. One of the best examples of Nawabs is Shias Quaid who belongs to Peshawar and is the leader of the All Parties Association of Punjab. Due to its beautiful landscape, old town, historical monuments, rich culture, and cultural heritage, it is considered the country's national icon. He is also regarded as an inspiration and role model for youth.  The area around Shah Jahan mosque in the Shah Jahan Sharif Bazar is called the Main Square where the ruler of Pakistan is buried. There are two main squares in the city of Islamabad, both of which are named differently. A narrow road with a huge statue of Liaquat Ali Choudhry is the name of the main commercial area of Khanpur. On this road lies an underground building of the house of Nawab Qutb where his tomb is situated. In the 1950s, the main street of the city was renamed “Haji Shah Bano-e-Nath” and has paved the way for new residential areas for locals and tourists.  The Red Zone of Islamabad is a very special place of tourism. Many places are unique in the entire territory because of the presence of such rare plants like red cedar and oleander trees. So, some of the plants can be seen along the route to reach various destinations around the Red Zone.  The New City of Islamabad, known for being a modern metropolis, and especially for offering breathtaking views, has become the biggest architectural landmark in the country. More than 300 buildings and sculptures have been erected here along with numerous roads to facilitate traffic and ease movement.  Many people gather around this site every year to celebrate the International Day of Peace. They show their appreciation by having lunch or dinner there. Around these sites, there are more than 200 restaurants for people and tourists to enjoy some local recipes—no wonder the population of Pakistani cities is constantly growing nowadays."
3,Faisal Mosque Islamabad,art," The impetus for the mosque began in 1966 when King Faisal bin Abdul-Aziz supported the initiative of the Pakistani Government to build a national mosque in Islamabad during an official visit to Pakistan with his wife, Dr Bibi Farid. It was opened on April 13, 1968, by then Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and a crowd of approximately 1 million people turned out for it. Over the next years, the mosque grew from 50,000 square feet to over one million square feet. The structure of Faisal Mughal’s mosque is made of bricks, which are the main component of the structure, but it also has two minarets that have been carved into stone and used as decoration. Its name means “Eminence of Peace” referring to the fact that in this mosque “the Lord of all religions is the first religion of Islam”. Some scholars had suggested that the architecture of the mosque was inspired by the Taj Mahal and other historical buildings in India. But there were some allegations about how similar the design was to the structures of Islamic art and culture. In response to such claims and criticisms, a number of protests took place to halt construction for nearly 40 years at the site of the former royal residence where Mohan Singh Qadri (1899-1946), the king who died last month, laid down some important documents pertaining to the building of the city's most prominent historical monument. The original plan of the mosque was to be constructed between two areas that were initially intended to be named Jati Umrah and Asr Minah. However, after the death of the former prime minister Mr Zulfikar, the government decided to rename these two areas as Islamabad Capital City, Islamabad Cantonments, Islamabad Town Centre and Islamabad Square respectively. The first area of the new name given to the area where Mohan Qadri placed his grave has now become the Faisal Mosque. Other changes include adding another nave into the existing structure as well as making use of the space in front of the main gate to increase seating capacity. This new mosque serves both locals and visitors equally, and its surroundings were redeveloped after the Second World War to cater to the needs of military service members stationed in the region. After the completion of the war, the Faisal Mosque served as part of Lahore Port and currently forms part of Peshawar Fort. On October 16, 2017, the Faisal Mosque was handed over to Pakistan by the federal capital under the Presidential Agreement signed by President Arif Alvi and Defence Secretary Mohammad Tarin in 2015 for the purpose of enhancing security in the country by providing additional protection to the people of the city. According to sources, the agreement will see an increased focus on securing the location of the mosque which has been declared sensitive, due to mounting terrorism threats in the country with hundreds of attacks taking place every day. Due to the public uproar regarding the change, the federal government decided to backtrack and re-conceptualize the idea of having the mosque in a specific area and shifted Islamabad’s major security establishment to Faisal Mughal’s tomb. Under Pakistan’s constitution, the president is allowed to shift the headquarters of a provincial or federal government. The structure of the compound which houses the coffin of Sheikh Muhammad Hassan Gani Wali, the founder of the Faisal Dynasty, is completely built around the mosque and is expected to be completed within three months of the demise of Sheikh Muhammad Hassan. However, it will take almost double the period that it took to complete the first mosque given the additional precautions required to ensure safety and cleanliness for Muslims and their guests in the vicinity of the cemetery. The opening of Faisal Mughal’s Tomb also provides more room at present to hold religious meetings and address general gatherings. Both locations would be open to tourists in order to allow them to enjoy the view of the graves of eminent personalities including Sheikh Amin ul Haq, Sheikh Hamid Gul, Sheikh Waseem Akhtar and Sheikh Ahmed Gohtay. There will also be an option for tourists to tour the graveyard and experience the history of Islamic Architecture of the past which could create interest among future generations. This mosque will serve to host many functions including prayers, concerts, sports events, family gatherings, cultural activities, social gatherings, and the general public for general awareness-raising. Furthermore, with its location near the famous green hills of Islamabad, Faisal Mughal’s Tomb provides a better opportunity for tourism in this location than any other historical monument in the historic city. Since Faisal Mughal’s tomb is located on the top of one of the highest mountains in Islamabad, it offers numerous opportunities for recreational activities like skiing and mountaineering. Moreover, since it is a cenotaph of the founder of the Faisal Dynasty, a lot can be learned about the early days of the empire. Therefore, the shrine and tombs which will display various artefacts related to the conquest of foreign lands by Faisal Mughal can offer great insights into Pakistan’s rich history and culture. The Faisal Mosque will continue to operate as a museum of Islamic Art and Culture in Islamabad with separate sections dedicated to research and studies that explore the influence of Islam on ancient civilizations, political systems and architectural culture all over the world. At present, many sculptures that look somewhat like sculptures of animals, birds and elephants, have been discovered by archaeologists, resulting in further discoveries of artwork in the past. A special section of the museum contains valuable collections that include objects found or looted by British troops before they were destroyed during the First World War. Similarly, a collection of artefacts from Ancient Greek and Roman empires and Asian cultures and their associated traditions and practices, along with items from medieval warfare, weaponry and weapons, has been displayed here along with several paintings ranging from Medieval manuscripts to Buddhist ones. There will be an exhibition based on the life and works of iconic artists and architects across North America to explore their contributions. Also, the museum includes the work of renowned artist Rafiq Khokhar who painted murals about the life of Muslim women, which has served as an inspiration to him. One particular painting is of Lady Nur of Sufism, who was known as Sirulat bai. She represented the beauty of Islam’s fifth pillar as she was covered in jewels. Another mural that depicts Prophet Muhammad holding a sword and representing peace is of Malik bai Shabbar and that of Ghaznavi. Lastly, there will also be a few murals depicting historical figures of the reign, which will offer insight into the society and culture of different parts of the world in the 19th Century and the 20th Century. These works were created by Bahria Hashim who is working with the Karachi Museum to exhibit a range of sculptures and arts. As for the future, much remains unknown despite being the largest museum dedicated to Islamic art and culture in an international capital. Faisal Mughal’s Tomb is definitely the biggest addition to Islamabad’s cultural heritage and will bring great prestige to the city and the Faisal dynasty.

5,Various Uses and Benefits of Opaline,art," Nabeel is a senior content writer and editor at first move digital, he loves to write every day. google.com If you believe in green opal healing properties, the spiritual opal is a sought-after gemstone in today's chaotic world and is thought to assist in providing comforting support, but then again the man-made opaline has its own set of healing properties. You can call it opaline or opalite – it’s a man-made glass crystal with beautiful colors. It is because of its attractive looks, that opaline glass is used for making lovely jewelry and other decorative items. Is opaline the same as opal? No, opals are one of the world’s most beautiful gemstones with their famous play of color. Opals are natural and green opal healing properties are well known. In fact, because of the troublesome times, we are living in, green opal’s soothing water elements have the power to balance emotions and organize your thoughts. These are sought-after characteristics for anyone to possess. But opaline also has its own uses and it is believed that it can bring certain success to the wearer too. Unlike many other crystals, as suggested, opaline is a man-made stone created from glass. It has a different meaning for spiritual purposes when compared to natural stones. Opaline is thought to be an emotional stone and the name ‘opaline refers to different kinds of glassware. When you talk of opaline glass, it is talking about milky white-colored glass. The glass is made translucent or opaque by adding certain phosphates or oxides during the mixing. People have difficulty knowing exactly what opaline is as it is sometimes referred to as a type of glass or it is referring to the color of glass rather than the origin or age of the glass. Essentially, opaline is a man-made kind of glass and the name is in fact a trading name for man-made opal-like stones. It comes in different shapes and sizes and there is also a natural stone known as green Opalite that's found in several countries. The human-made version of Opaline still produces a crystal with the same healing benefits as nature. Opaline is associated with youth and it helps you see the world through child-like eyes. It gets rid of negativity with its positive, warm energy. It can lighten the mood of a person too and is of particular value to those who suffer from depression and other mental illnesses. With covid-19 hovering around, opaline is also known to assist with respiratory issues. So if you have lung problems or even, asthma, it pays to keep opaline close to you as it supports the oxygenation of your body. Opaline or opalite might be flawless but it can’t be likened to the beauty of the gemstone Opal. But how is opaline used?

If you can, try to wear some Opaline in some form of jewelry. Findling love, hope, and joy in even the darkest moments are possible when you keep opaline close to you. Its good luck- and healing properties will be a lot more evident if you can wear it rather than simply holding it for a while. By wearing it as a ring, a necklace, earrings, a bracelet, brooch, or other forms of jewelry, you can have regular contact with the stone. Crystal healing applies to a certain type of therapy which involves placing the stones on your body or on your desk or some other nearby place. It is thought to be able to draw out negative energy. Crystals are nothing new but people have certainly become more aware of them during the pandemic. At a time when health is a the forefront of many people’s minds, opals and opaline are experiencing renewed interest. During rocky times, people look for anything that can soothe and heal and opaline has certain qualities of healing and positivity as well as increased energy and even an improved immune system.

6,Lions in the Decoration of Temples in West Bengal,art," Dr. A K Chatterjee is a seasoned writer with more than 330 blogs in English and Bengali and 10 books mostly on travel, trekking and temples. Decorative lions; Shiva temple; Rajbalhat; Hooghly, West Bengal, India This article is basically in two parts. Part I is on the lion in general, and Part II is on Lions in Bengal temple decorations. The lion (Panthera leo) is the second largest member of the cat family. Only the tiger (Panthera tigris) is larger and heavier than the lion. Lions are of two types (Cat Classification Task Force of Cat Specialist Group, 2017) :1. Panthera leo leo (Linn.1758) which includes the Asiatic (Indian) lion, and the lions found in the western and northern parts of Central Asia.2. Panthera leo melanochaita (Smith, 1842), which includes lions of eastern and southern Africa and now extinct Cape Lions. Besides these, there were some extinct species of the lion, which include :1. Panthera leo sinhaleys - they lived in parts of Sri Lanka more than 39,000 years back.2. Panthera leo fossilis - fossils of this type of lions who lived in the middle Pleistocene age are obtained from different parts of the world.3. Panthera leo spelaea or the Cave Lion - they lived more than 11,000 thousands years ago.4. Panthera atrox or the American lion - they lived in the Americas more than 37,000 years ago. A lion, apparently an African one, from Annapurna temple; Barrackpore, West Bengal Lions, most probably due to the majestic looks with the beautiful mane of the male members of the animal, are one of the most widely recognized animal symbol in human culture across the continents from time immemorial. In almost all cultures the lion is the symbol of royalty, strength and magnificent beauty, and is associated with gods and monarchs. Lion as the ""Vahana"" (vehicle) of Goddess Durga; terracotta; Gopaleswar temple; Bankati village; Paschim Bardhaman The lions found in India belong to the Asiatic type (Panthera leo leo). It once roamed in the vast stretches of forested land from the Sind and Punjab to western parts of Bengal to the east and the Narmada river in the south. But due to indiscriminate hunting, now it is restricted only to the Gir National Park in Gujarat. (Reference : ""The past and present distribution of the lions in South East Asia"" - The Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society, 1920; 27 : 34-39; by Kinnear, N.B.). Once upon a time (more than 40-50 thousand years ago) African lions were found in the forests of Bankura and West Medinipur districts of present day West Bengal. This has been scientifically proved (Ref : Animal remains from south-western parts of West Bengal and their relevance to ancient civilization of the area - Zoological Survey of India publication, 2014). This is an interesting subject, especially for the Indians. Let us summarize :1. They are two sub-species of the same species.2. In size, Asiatic/Indian lions are a little smaller than their African counterpart.3. Indian lions have thicker coat and longer tail tussle.4. Indian lions have an abdominal skin fold which is not seen in the African subspecies.5. But the most striking difference which can easily be understood by laymen is the mane. African male lions have luxurious mane covering the whole head, so that their ears are not always visible. But the male Indian lions have only a small tuft of blackish mane and their ears are always visible. This is another interesting topic. To tell very briefly, the tiger is larger (12-13 feet in length as against 7-8 feet for the lion), heavier (tigers 650 pounds vs. lions 500 pounds), have more muscle strength and is a solitary animal by nature (lions are the only cats who live in groups called ""pride""). Many ancient cultures had the lion in a prominent place. Egypt, Babylon, Greece, Roman empire and other ancient civilizations had many references of the lion. This is true for India too. In Indian culture the lion is considered as the ""Pashuraja"" - the king of the animals. This is a little strange, because tigers are living in large parts of India from time immemorial, and Indians had good exposure to the might and beauty of the tiger. But we have ""Singhasana"" (the Lion throne) and not ""Baghrasana"" (the Tiger throne), the Nrisingha Avatar of Lord Vishnu is half-lion half-man and not half-tiger half-man and Goddess Durga, the most important Goddess of the ""Shakti"" cult, rides a lion (especially in the eastern parts of India where Durga has a very important and special place). Even the ""Ashoka-stambha"" (pillar erected by the famous emperor Ashoka who lived in the 3rd century CE) has lions on top, and not the tiger. It is difficult to guess why the lion, though being a lesser animal in size and strength, got the preferential treatment. Did the mane control the game? But still there is a catch here - the manes of the Indian lions are not so majestic like their African brethren. Lions are variously described in Indian mythology : 1. As ""Vahana"" (vehicle) of gods and goddesses.2. As part of Nrisimha Avatar of Lord Vishnu (the head and forelimbs are of a lion, the rest of the body human-like).3. As part of ""Yali"" (a mythical composite animal)4. As part of ""Narasingha"" or man-lion (Not the Avatar). Now, let us expand these a little. Lion as the ""Vahana"" (vehicle) of Goddess Durga; Terracotta; Sridhar temple; Sonamukhi, Bankura Nrisingha Avatar; stone work; Jaganath temple; Khidirpur, Kolkata Row of Yali or Viyala from a South Indian temple Man-lion or Manticore; stucco; Bhavaniswar temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Lions are described as the ""Vahana"" of some gods and goddesses : Durga : Goddess Durga is the chief Goddess and is considered as the principal form of Shakti, the Primal Female energy. Goddess Durga has been described in many forms, of which ""Nabadurga"" (Durga of 9 forms) is most widely known. Of the 9 forms of Durga in ""Nabadurga"", 5 have lions as Vahanas - Chandraghanta (this form of Durga is 10 armed), Kushmanda (8 armed), Skandamata (4 armed), Katyayani (10 armed) and Siddhidatri (4/8/18 armed). In the eastern parts of India including Bengal, the form of Durga generally worshiped is Katyayani. Durga on lion; terracotta; Shiva temple; Supur, Birbhum Goddess Jagatdhatri, who was initially derived from Durga, rides a lion. However, in later period Jagatdhatri is typically depicted in iconography as riding a lion which is on top of an elephant. Goddess Jagatdhatri on lion; terracotta; Ananda Bhairavi temple; Sukharia, Hooghly Goddess Chamunda is associated with Goddess Kali, and is decribed as the goddess who killed the demons Chanda and Munda. Goddess Chamunda is depicted to ride a lion. Goddess Chamunda on lion killing asura (demons); terracotta; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad This is a rare form of Lord Ganesha with 5 heads. Heramba Ganesha rides a lion. Goddess Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of Learning, knowledge and Fine Arts, is usually described to ride a white swan or sometimes a peacock. But a rare form of Goddess Saraswati in the Buddhism called the ""Bageswari Saraswati"" (who is actually the consort of the Buddhist god of Knowledge Manjushri or Manjunath) is depicted as riding a lion. Nrisimha (Nrisingha) or Narasingha is the 4th Avatar of Lord Vishnu. As his name implies, he is half-lion (upper oart of the body including the head and forelimbs) half-man (lower part of the body). Nrisingha Avatar in His half-lion half-man form; terracotta; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Manticore is an imaginary creature often seen in Greek and Roman Arts, with the body of a lion, the head of a man with big protruding fangs and the tail of a snake. The word ""Manticore"" or ""Mantichore"" means ""Man-eater"". The idea of Manticore has come from the story of ""Mardykhor"" (meaning ""Man-eater"") of the Persian mythology.However, a number of ancient Greek authors like Aelian, Ctesius etc. believed that the idea of Manticore originated in India. Aelian even wrote that Manticores lived in India. Man-lion (Narasingha); terracotta; Gangeswar temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Now, let us go to the Part II of this article - viz. Lions in the decoration of temples in West Bengal. Materials and methods The author has visited and photographed about 80 temples in 31 places in different districts of West Bengal.These photographs were carefully checked, and photos of lions in different forms selected. These are classified into several groups and analyzed. Lions in Bengal temple decorations We get lions in various forms in the decorations of temples in West Bengal. These are : 1. Vahana (vehicle) of Durga (different forms), Jagatdhatri and Chamunda.2. Nrisimha Avatar3. Yali4. Narasingha or man-lion (Not the Avatar)5. Over gates of, or on top of, temples6. Lion hunting : Three examples in the present series.7. Lions in temple walls and in angular plaques. 8. Lions in ""Mrityulata"" panels.9. Lions in ""Amita-vikram Purusha Murti"" - a symbolic representation of the Masculine power.10. ""Singhamukhi Nouka"" or boats decorated with the replica of the head of a lion.11. Lion-faced bow.  Goddess Durga is very widely depicted in innumerable temples of West Bengal, mostly in the ""Mahishasuramardini"" (Killer of the demon Mahishasura) form riding a lion, but also as the divine consort of Lord Shiva.Except in very few cases where Durga is portrayed sitting on a lion along with Lord Shiva (one such example is from Kotulpur, district Bankura; another one is from Shiva temple of Supur, district Birbhum), this Shiva-consort form of Durga is without the lion and is usually depicted riding Nandi the Bull, the vehicle of Lord Shiva. On the other hand ""Ardhanarishwara"", which is a composite form of Goddess Durga and Lord Shiva fused sagittally in the same body, is often depicted with a lion and a bull. However, the ""Mahishasuramardini"" (Killer of the demon Mahishasura) is always depicted as riding the lion, which is shown to attack the demon. The lions on which Durga rides are depicted in various forms, initially as a composite creature of a horse and a Monitor Lizard and later as a lion which seems to be an African one. Goddess Durga as ""Mahishaasura Mardini""; terracotta; Radha Damodar temple; Hadal-Narayanpur; Bankura Goddess Durga as ""Mahishaasura Mardini""; terracotta; Ramchandra temple; Guptipara, Hooghly Goddess Durga as ""Mahishaasura Mardini""; Bas-relief in stone; Shiva temple; Ganpur, Birbhum Goddess Durga as ""Mahishaasura Mardini""; stucco; Bhavaniswar temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Goddess Durga with Lord Shiva on lion; terracotta; Shiva temple; Supur, Birbhum Goddess Durga with Lord Shiva on lion; terracotta; Giri Govardhan temple; Kotulpur, Bankura Shiva and Durga as ""Ardha Nariswara""; colored stucco; Shiva temple, Birbhanpur, Paschim Bardhaman As already said, of the 9 forms of Durga (""Nabadurga""), 5 have lions as the Vahana - Chandraghanta (this form of Durga is 10 armed), Kushmanda (8 armed), Skandamata (4 armed), Katyayani (10 armed) and Siddhidatri (4/8/18 armed). In some temples like Ekteshwar Shiva temple of Bankura and Nandikeshwari temple of Sainthia, Birbhum, these 9 forms of Durga are picturized in stucco. In addition, Skandamata in isolation is depicted in terracotta bas-relief in the Rameshwar temple of Ilambazar, district Birbhum. Chandraghanta; painting in stucco; Nandikeswari temple; Sainthia, Birbhum Skandamata; painting in stucco; Nandikeswari temple; Sainthia, Birbhum Siddhidatri; terracotta; Ananda Bhairavi temple; Sukharia, Hooghly Skandamata; terracotta; Rameswar temple; Ilambazar, Birbhum Jagatdhatri is a special form of Goddess Durga. She is 4-armed, and is usually shown as riding a lion which is on top of an elephant. This can be seen in temples like Chandranath Shiva temple of Hetampur, district Birbhum and Ananda Bahiravi temple of Sukharia, district Hooghly. It is said that originally Goddess Jagatdhatri was devoid of the elephant. Such a picture of a 4-armed goddess on a lion can be seen in terracotta bas-relief in Charbangla temple and Gangeshwar temple of Baronagar, district Murshidabad. Goddess Jagatdhatri on lion and elephant; terracotta; Chandranath temple; Hetampur, Birbhum This may be an early Jagatdhatri on lion without the elephant; terracotta; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Goddess Chamunda is said to emanate from the body of Goddess Kali to kill the demons Chanda and Munda. In some temples like Shiva temple of Uchkaran, district Birbhum; Charbangla temple of Baronagar, district Murshidabad Shiva temple of Baghtikra village of Purva Bardhaman district; Jorbangla Kali temple of Itanda village of Birbhum district; Shiva temple of Sribati village of Purva Bardhaman district etc. lion-riding Chamunda can be seen. In Gopinath temple of Dasghara, district Hooghly, Chamunda is depicted as riding on two lions. All the these are in terracotta bas-relief. Chamunda on lion; terracotta; Jorbangla Kali temple; Itanda, Birbhum Chamunda on lion; terracotta; Shiva temple, Uchkaran, Birbhum Chamunda on 2 lions; terracotta; Gopinath temple; Dasghara, Hooghly Though two pictures in terracotta bas-relief of 5-headed Ganesha is seen in Ananda Bharavi temple of Sukharia, district Hooghly, the lion is missing here. And Lion-riding Saraswati is not found in any of the temples under study. These are negative findings, but in an analytic study, both the positive and the negative findings are important. 5-headed Ganesha without lion as Vahana; Ananda Bhairavi temple; Sukharia, Hooghly A large number of temples in Bengal has the ""Dashavatar Panel"" depicting the 10 Avatars of Lord Vishnu in terracotta, stucco, stone, wood carving, metal engravings and in paintings (murals/frescos). In these, Nrisingha Avatar, the half-lion half-man form of Lord Vishnu, is depicted faithfully as the 4th Avatar. Nrisingha Deva is depicted almost invariably in sitting posture killing the demon Hiranyakashipu by His bare hands (which are actually the paws of the lion) placing the demon on His knees. Prahlada, the son of Hiranykashipu, who was an ardent devotee of Lord Vishnu may or may not be present by the side of Lord Nrisingha Deva in these pictures. Nrisingha Avatar in terracotta; radha Vinod temple; Joydev-Kenduli; Birbhum Nrisingha Avatar in stucco; Bhavaniswar temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Nrisingha Avatar in stone; Gokulchand temple; Gokulnagar, Bankura Nrisingha Avatar in painting (mural/fresco); Kalleswar temple; Kalleswar, Birbhum Nrisingha Avatar in wood carving; Jaipur, Bankura In Shyamrai temple of Vishnupur, district Bankura, we can see an imaginary animal with an elephant-like head, lion like body and tail with wings of a bird carrying several elephants in its four legs. In the same picture we can see a smaller animal with the similar body type but without the trunk of the elephant. Some temple experts think that these two are the Bengal versions of the Yali or Viyala (specifically ""Gaja-Viyala"" or Elephant-headed Viyala). Yali or Viyala (Gaja-viyala); terracotta; Shyamrai temple; Vishnupur, Bankura A composite animal with the face and upper part of the torso of a man (though with big fangs) and the lower body of a lion (like the mythical Manticore) can be seen in many temples, either on the arch above the entrance or in the angle panels of the front facade of the temple. Some examples are Charbangla temple (terracotta), Gangeshwar temple (terracotta) and Bhavanishwar temple (stucco) of Baronagar, district Murshidabad. This, however, may be an example of ""Nara-Viyala"" or Human-headed Viyala. The main differences between Nrisingha Avatar and the Manticore (Man-lion) are two, apart from the fact that Nrisingha Deva is the 4th Avatar of Lord Vishnu and the Man-lion is a mythical creature.These are : 1. The head and forelimbs of Nrisingha Deva are of a lion and the lower body that of a man. In the Man-lion this is just the opposite.2. Nrisingha Deva is almost always seen to kill Hiranyakashipu by placing him on His knees, but the Man-lion is a solitary figure. Man-lion; terracotta; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Man-lion; stucco; Bhavaniswar temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Man-lion; terracotta; Gangeswar temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad In some temples, statues of lions are placed over the gate (often called the ""Singha Darwaja"" or the Lion Gate) or even on the top of the temple proper. Examples of the former are Shiva temple of Rajbalhat, district Hooghly and Annapurna temple of Barrackpore, district North 24-Parganas; one example of the latter is the 2-storey ""Dalan""-type Radhakrishna temple of Itanda village, district Birbhum. Lions on the main gate; cement-stucco statue; Shiva temple; Rajbalhat, Hooghly Lion on the main gate; cement-stucco statue; Annapurna temple; Barrackpore; North 24-Parganas Lions on main temple; 2-storey ""Dalan"" type Radha Krishna temple; Itanda, Hooghly Lion hunting scenes can be seen in temples like Gopinath temple of Dashghara, district Hooghly (this terracotta bas-relief picture is a part of the ""Mrityulata"" or ""Death-Creeper"" panel), Jorbangla Kali temple of Itanda, district Birbhum, Ramchandra temple of Guptipara, district Hooghly etc. Lion hunting in ""Mrityu Lata""  panel; terracotta; Gopinath temple; Dasghara, Hooghly Lion hunting scene; terracotta; Jorbangla Kali temple; Itanda, Birbhum This is a fairly big sub-chapter. Let us discuss this in separate segments. 1. Stylized lions depicted in temple walls :In many temples of West Bengal, we see lions, often in a stylized version, depicted on the temple walls, often on the arch panel over the entrances.A good example of the latter can be seen in the Charbangla temple of Baronagar, district Murshidabad. Stylized lions are also depicted in temples like Ananta Basudeva temple of Bansberia, district Hooghly and Shiva temple of Dubrajpur, district Birbhum (stucco work).2. Lions on the angle panel of the front façade of temples :This is a very common decoration and can be seen in many temples. Some examples are Shiva temple of Sribati village, district Purva Bardhaman; Shiva temple of Ganpur village, district Birbhum; Shiva temple of Bankati-Ajodhya, Paschim Bardhaman district; Shiva temple of Baghtikra, Purva Bardhaman district; Jorbangla Kali temple of Itanda village, district Birbhum; Malleshwar Shiva temple of Mallarpur, district Birbhum; Pancharatna Shiva temple of Itanda village, district Birbhum; Charbangla temple of Baronagar, district Murshidabad; Shiva temple of Surul, district Birbhum etc.Of these temples, the pictures from the Ganpur and Mallarpur temples are of stone (called ""Giripathar"" or ""Fulpathar""), the rest are in terracotta bas-relief.3. In a Shiva temple of Dubrajpur, district Birbhum, we can see a special picture of a lion with a single head and two bodies in bas-relief of stucco. The significance of this stucco decoration is difficult to interpret.Similar picture of a double bodied lion with a single head (along with other double-bodied figures with single heads) can be seen in a short ""Mrityulata"" type terracotta panel in a Shiva temple of Sribati village, district Purva Bardhaman.4. ""Mrityulata"" panel : In many temples, we can see a vertical panel with series of human and animal figures each attacking the figure below. This special panel is called ""Mrityulata"" (Creeper of Death). In these panels, lions are an integral part.Some examples are Lalji temple of Kalna, district Purva Bardhaman; Gopinath temple of Dasghara, district Hooghly; Nandadulaljiu temple of Gurap, district Hooghly; Radha Vinod temple of Joydev-Kenduli, district Birbhum; Jorbangla Kali temple of Itanda village, district Birbhum; Shiva temple of Sribati village, district Purva Bardhaman.5. ""Amita-vikram Purusha Murti"" : This is a special figure symbolic of the Masculine power where a bare-handed man is seen to subdue elephants and lions simultaneously. This can be seen in many temples.One of the examples are Shiva temple of Sribati village, district Purva Bardhaman. Lions on the arch panel; terracotta; Narayan temple; Dey Para; Jaipur, Bankura Lions on the arch panel; stone work; Shiva temple;Ganpur, Birbhum Lions on the arch panel; terracotta; Charbangla temple; Baranagar, Murshidabad Lion on temple wall; stucco; Shiva temple; Dubrajpur, Birbhum Lion with a single face and two bodies on temple wall; stucco; Shiva temple; Dubrajpur, Birbhum Lion on angle panel; terracotta; Gopaleswar temple; Bankati; Paschim Bardhaman Lion on angle panel; terracotta; Ratneswar Shiva temple; Bhattabati; Murshidabad Lion on angle panel; bas-relief in stone; Shiva temple; Ganpur, Birbhum Lion on angle panel; bas-relief in stone; Shiva temple; Ganpur, Birbhum Lion on angle panel; terracotta;  Shiva temple; Sribati; Purva Bardhaman Lion on angle panel; terracotta;Jorbangla Kali temple; Itanda; Birbhum Lion in ""Mrityulata"" panel; terracotta; Lalji temple; Kalna, Purva Bardhaman Lion in ""Mrityulata"" panel; terracotta; Gopinath temple; Dasghara, Birbhum Lion in ""Mrityulata"" panel; terracotta; Jorbangla Kali temple; Itanda, Birbhum Lion in ""Amita Vikram Purusha Murti""; terracotta; Shiva temple; Sribati, Purva Bardhaman Though ""Moyurpankhi"" or ""peacock-headed"" boats are common, there are some examples of boats decorated with the heads of lions. There are few examples of such ""Singhamukhi"" (Lion-headed or Lion-faced) boats in the decorations of temples of West Bengal, for example in the Rajrajeshwar temple of Dwarhatta and Ramchandra temple of Guptipara, both from Hooghly district. ""Singhamukhi Nouka"" or Lion-faced boat; terracotta; Rajrajeswar temple; Dwarhatta, Hooghly ""Singhamukhi Nouka"" or Lion-faced boat; terracotta; Ramchandra temple; Guptipara, Hooghly This can be seen in some temples like the Charbangla temple of Baronagar, district Murshidabad. Here two types of decorations are seen :1. Rows of such lion-faced boats along the arch panel over the temple entrance.2. Isloated lion-faced bows - often with Lord Rama breaking it. In the latter case, it represents the ""Haradhanu"", the Bow of Lord Shiva. Lion-faced bows in the arch panel; terracotta; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad LordRama breaking the ""haradhanu"" (LordShiva's bow) which is depicted as a Lion-faced bow; terracotta; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad A. Presence of lions in Bengal 1. It is clear from historical and archeological facts that presence of lions in Bengal and adjacent areas are Pre-historic only (References given above). 2. Artists in 16th - 19th century Bengal (when theses temples were constructed) could not practically see lions either in the wild or in captivity. Their only probable exposure was seeing the hunting trophy of lions (usually the staffed head) brought from Africa by the Europeans to decorate the walls of their drawing rooms. 3. So, logically the temple artistes followed either hearsay or descriptions given by their teachers, who in turn, were also in the same dark. This led to various types of depictions of the lion in temple decorations of Bengal, particularly in regards to the mane of the male lion, which is a characteristic feature of the lion.For this reason, on the one hand we see lions who look more like a horse (or a composite of the horse and the Monitor Lizard) than a true lion, on the other hand we see peculiar types of manes in the pictures, but in general, the lions depicted are more of African type than their Asian brethren. B. Types of lions picturized : This is not always clear in 200-250 years old terracotta or stucco works, but those pictures which are more or less clear enough show that the lions picturized are more African than Asian.Points : Abundant mane; invisible ears; lack of abdominal fold. Lion of Durga with a narrow horse like head; stone work; Malleswar temple; Mallarpur, Birbhum An African type lion; Shiva temple; Rajbalhat, Hooghly Lions in temple decorations in Bengal is a fascinating yet lengthy subject. The present study is made from analyzing temple decorations of about 80 temples from different districts of West Bengal, but still it can be said a Pilot Study at the most. Hopefully in future more researcher will come forward to study more temples so that we can learn more about this topic. * All photos are by the author.

7,"Nrisingha Deva, the 4th Avatar of Lord Vishnu in Bengal temple decoration",art," Dr. A K Chatterjee is a seasoned writer with more than 330 blogs in English and Bengali and 10 books mostly on travel, trekking and temples. Nrisingha Deva; Jagannath temple, Khidirpur, Kolkata Nrisingha (Narasingha/Narasimha) Deva is the 4th Avatar of Lord Vishnu. He is half-man half-lion (Nara = man; Singha/Simha = lion). His head and upper limbs are of a lion, the torso and lower part of the body is human. As per Hindu scriptures, Lord Vishnu appeared in 9 different ages in 9 different Avatars or reincarnations/manifestations, and the 10th one (Kalki Avatar) is still not manifested. These 9 Avatars of Lord Vishnu who had already appeared are as follows maintaining the appearance order :Meena or Matsya (Fish), Kurma (Tortoise), Varaha (Boar), Nrisingha (Half-man half-lion), Vamana (The dwarf), Parasurama or Bhargava Rama, Lord Rama or Dasharathi Rama, Balarama, Krishna and Buddha. Of these, the first 4 (Matsya, Kurma, Varaha and Nrisingha) appered in the Satya Yuga, next 3 (Vamana, Parasurama amd Lord Rama) appered in Treta Yaga and next 2 (Balarama and Krishna) appeared in Dwapara Yuga. The 10th Avatar Kalki will appear at the end of the Kali Yuga. Though this the standard list of the 10 Avataras (Dashavatara) of Lord Vishnu, there are some controversies. Though it is generally accepted that Lord Krishna is the 9th Avatara of Lord Vishnu, some believe that Lord Krishna was Lord Vishnu Himself and not one of His Avataras. They include Lord Jagannath as the 9th Avatara of Lord Vishnu. Yet another school gives this place to Lord Buddha. There are innumerable Vishnu (or Krishna) temples not only in India, but in almost every country where Hindus live. In most of these and other temples dedicated to different deities, either there are smaller shrines housing the 10 Avatars of Lord Vishnu, or the Avataras are depicted in temple decorations. It is an interesting fact that separate temples for these Avataras are not very common (except those dedicated to Lord Krishna and Jagannatha), and temples dedicated to Nrisingha Deva, the 4th Avatar is rather rare. There are only few temples dedicated to Nrisingha Deva in India, a list of which is given in the Appendix II. Nrisingha Deva is often called ""Narahari"" (meaning Man-Hari or Man-Vishnu, ""Hari"" being the other name of Lord Vishnu) in Bengal. There is an anecdotal connection between Lord Narahari and Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the 16th century great Vaishnava saint. It is said that while Sri Chaitanya was propagating the chanting of the names of Lord Rama and Lord Krishna among the masses by taking out processions (called ""Sankirtana""), the traditional Hindu Brahmins were agitated and they complained to the local Muslim ruler Chand Kazi to stop this ""Sankirtana"". Chand Kazi initially issued an official order to stop this, but after having a dream in which Lord Narahari appeared before him and asked to withdraw the order or face dire consequences, he was only too eager to reverse his order. Nrisingha Deva temples in West Bengal There are only a few temples dedicated to Nrisingha Deva in West Bengal. These include : 1. Nrisinghadeva temple, Nrisinhapalli, Navadwip, Nadia district.2. Nrisinghadeva temple, Gokarna, Murshidabad district.3. Narasingha temple, Talbagan South, Hanapara, Kestopur, Kolkata.4. Ugra Narasingha temple, Mayapur, Nadia district. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu with his followers in ""Sankirtana""; terracotta; Gopinath temple; Dasghara, Hooghly Nrisingha temple, Gokarna, Murshidabad Though the temples of Nrisingha Deva are rare in West Bengal, the presence of Nrisingha Deva in the decorations of temples in West Bengal is aplenty. In many temples, the 10 Avatars of Lord Vishnu is depicted in panels called ""Dashavatar Panel"". This are mostly of terracotta bas-relief, but works in other media like stucco, stone, metal engravings, wood carving and paintings (murals/frescos) are also seen. Here we'll have a brief study of the topic. Portion of Dasavatar Panel showing Nrisingha and Varaha Avatar; terracotta; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Nrisingha Deva in stucco; Bhavanishwar temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Nrisingha Deva in stone bas-relief; Gokulchand temple, Gokulnagar, Bankura Nrisingha Deva in wood carvings; Vishnu temple; Jaipur, Bankura Nrisingha Deva in painting; Kalleshwar temple, Birbhum The author has visited and photographed about 80 temples in 31 places in different districts of West Bengal. Among these, 25 temples have Nrisingha Deva in their decorations (a list of these temples is given in Appendix I). These photographs were diligently checked, and photos of Nrisingha Deva in different forms selected. These are then analyzed as per some characteristics. Nrisingha Deva with 2 arms; terracotta; Ratneshwar temple; Bhattabati, Murshidabad Nrisingha Deva with 4 arms; terracotta; Shiva temple, Dubrajpur, Birbhum In 23 temples we get 25 pictures of Nrisingha Deva, all as a part of the ""Dashavatar Panel"". Of these 25 pictures, 18 (72%) are of terracotta bas-relief, 3 (12%) of stucco (Bhavanishwar temple of Baronagar, district Murshidabad; Ekteshwar temple of Bankura and Nandishwar temple of Sahachak, Paschim Medinipur), 2 (8%) are of stone work (Jagannath temple , Khidirpur and Gokulchand temple of Gokulnagar, Bankura); 1 (4%) of wood carving (from a temple of Jaipur, district Bankura) and 1 (4%) of a painting (mural/fresco) (from Kalleshwar temple of Kalleshwar, district Birbhum). Classically, Nrisingha Deva is depicted as half-lion half-man form, with the head and forearms of a lion and the torso and lower limbs of a man. He is 4 armed, with upper right hand holding the ""Chakra"" and the upper left arm the ""Shankha"" (Conch), two ""Ayudha""-s of Lord Vishnu. Narasingha Deva is seen in the sitting posture holding the evil anti-Vishnu demon Hiranyakashipu on His knees and killing the demon by opening up his abdomen by His sharp claws.Nrisingha Deva is often seen accompanied by Prahlada, the son of Hiranyakashipu and an ardent Vishnu devotee. Now let us see what we get in the decorations of temples in West Bengal. Nrisingha Deva with Chakra and Shankha; terracotta; Raghunath temple; Ghurisha, Birbhum In our series of 25 pictures of Nrisingha Deva, we get 15 (60%) 4-armed and 10 (40%) 2-armed Nrisingha Deva. This is a little strange, because the fact that Nrisingha Deva is 4-armed is well known. Why the temple artists created the 2-armed version, and in such a high ratio, is not clear. 2-armed Nrisingha Deva; terracotta; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad 2-armed Nrisingha Deva; terracotta; Radha Damodar temple; Hadal-Narayanpur, Bankura 2-armed Nrisingha Deva; terracotta; Lakshmi Janardan temple; Ghurisha, Birbhum 4-armed Nrisingha Deva; terracotta; Giri Govardhan temple; Kotulpur, Bankura 4-armed Nrisingha Deva; terracotta; Jaipur, Bankura 4-armed Nrisingha Deva; terracotta; Madanmohan temple; Vishnupur, Bankura 4-armed Nrisingha Deva; colored stucco; Ekteswar temple; Bankura Of the 15 4-armed Nrisingha Deva, only 3 have Chakra (in upper right hand) and Shankha (Conch) in upper left hand. The other 11 4-armed Nrisingha Deva are not carrying any ""Ayudha"". In all these 15 cases, Nrisingha Deva is seen using His lower two hands to kill Hiranyakashipu. Of the 10 2-armed Nrisngha Deva, 2 cases are a little different from the other 8. In these two pictures (from Jorbangla Kali temple and Pancharatna Shiva temple of Itanda village, district Birbhum), Nrisingha Deva is seen carrying Prahlada in His lap and Hiranyakashipu is nowhere seen. Probably these two scenes represent the stage when Nrisingha Deva has lifted Prahlada in His lap after killing Hiranyakashipu. In other 8 2-armed Nrisingha deva is seen using both the arms to kill Hiranyakashipu. 4-armed Nrisingha Deva with Chakra and Shankha in upper hands and with lower hands killing Hiranyakashipu' terracotta; Raghunath temple; Ghurisha, Birbhum 4-armed Nrisingha Deva with Chakra and Shankha in upper hands and with lower hands killing Hiranyakashipu' terracotta; Madanmohan temple; Vishnupur, Bankura 4-armed Nrisingha Deva with Chakra and Shankha in upper hands and with lower hands killing Hiranyakashipu; colored stucco; Ekteswar temple; Bankura 4-armed Nrisingha Deva with Chakra and Shankha in upper hands and with lower hands killing Hiranyakashipu' stone work; Jagannath temple; Khidirpur, Kolkata 4-armed Nrisingha Deva without ""Ayudha' killing Hiranyakashipu; terracotta; Shiva temple; Dubrajpur, Birbhum 4-armed Nrisingha Deva without ""Ayudha' killing Hiranyakashipu; terracotta; Narayana temple; Jaipur, Bankura 4-armed Nrisingha Deva without ""Ayudha' killing Hiranyakashipu; terracotta; Radha Vinod temple; Joydev-Kenduli, Birbhum 2-armed Nrisingha Deva without ""Ayudha' killing Hiranyakashipu; stucco; Bhavanishwar temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad 2-armed Nrisingha Deva without ""Ayudha' killing Hiranyakashipu; terracotta; Shiva temple; Ajodhya; Paschim Bardhaman Nrisingha Deva with Prahlada in His lap; terracotta; Pancharatna Shiva temple; Itanda, Birbhum i) In 5 cases out of the total 25, Prahalada is present in the scene. ii) Of these, 2 are already described (where only Prahlada is present with Nrisingh Deva). iii) In the remaining 3 cases, Prahlada is seen standing at one side while Nrisingha deva is killing Hiranyakashipu. These are from Jagannath Temple of Khidirpur, Kolkata; Madanmohan temple of Vishnupur, district Bankura and Kalleshwar temple of kalleshwar, district Birbhum (the last is a painting). Nrisingha Deva with Prahlada in His lap; terracotta; Kali temple; Itanda, Birbhum Nrisingha Deva killing Hiranyakashipu while Prahlada is standing by the side; terracotta; Madanmohan temple; Vishnupur, Bankura Nrisingha Deva killing Hiranyakashipu while Prahlada is standing by the side; terracotta; stone work; Jagannath temple; Khidirpur, Kolkata Nrisingha Deva killing Hiranyakashipu while Prahlada is standing by the side; painting; Kalleshwar temple; Kalleshwar, Birbhum Presence of Nrisingha Deva in Bengal temple decorations is an interesting observation. The present study is on a small series, so it can be marked as a Pilot Study. If some researchers work with larger series, more facts may come forward. All photos : by the author.

8,Malevich's Black Square Demystified,art," On February 23, 1879 Kazimir Severinovich Malevich was born in Kyiv in Ukraine. He died from cancer on May 15, 1935. He was an illustrious Russian avant-garde artist. He pioneered the Suprematism technique. Kazmir studied and practiced art from a very tender age. It was at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture that Malevich undertook art. He was inspired by different styles ranging from Impressionism, Cubism to Futurism. Kazmir Malevich ""I have transformed myself in the zero of form and dragged myself out of the rubbish-filled pool of Academic art."" — Kazmir Malevich Kazimir Malevich a Russian artist painted the illustrious Black Square. The painting has achieved iconic status. The first version of the painting is said to have been completed in 1915. He painted four variations the last is thought to have been painted in the early 1930s or the late 1920s.It was first exhibited in The Last Futurist Exhibition 0,10 in 1915. When Malevich first exhibited the Black Square, he hung the painting where the wall meets the ceiling -in Russia this referred to as the “beautiful corner,” and it is normally reserved for religious icons. He considered “Black Square” sacred: a symbol for a new, spiritual enlightenment. Last Futurist Exhibition of Painting 0.10,” Black Square on the upper corner St Petersburg Dec 1915-Jan 1916 Unsplash Kazimir Malevich was a Russian artist. He painted some of his most important works in the beginning of the 20 century. He experimented with different styles during a career that spanned several decades. He completed his magnum opus between 1915 and 1918. During that time he mainly explored geometric forms (squares, triangles and circles) and their correlation within the pictorial space. “Black Square is meant to evoke] the experience of pure non-objectivity in the white emptiness of a liberated nothing.” — Kazmir Malevich Russia underwent numerous drastic changes in 1915. There was dramatic upheaval as the industrial revolution brought shifts in economic and social facets. A political revolution wrought by the First World War posed a novel challenge to the monarchy of Tsar Nicholas II. The most fascinating thing about the Black Square is that the standard methods employed in traditional painting are abandoned. The painting lacks tonal shading or even perspective. It lacks identifiable forms apart from the square itself. Color appears in its most basic form: it appears as a black square on white canvas. The painting was deliberately meant to represent nothing. It represents a void. Numerous art curators, critics and historians consider the Black Square ""zero point of painting."" Malevich held the belief that his two-dimensional form of art was a means for the mind of man to reach a celestial realm - to ascend to the fourth dimension. Young artists were titillated by the need to change. Simultaneously, they were becoming cognizant of novel art movements in Paris, France. In 1912, Malevich travelled to Paris and the work of Picasso and Braque infused him with exuberance. Malevich was also inspired by Futurist Filippo Marinetti. Futurism emphasized technology, speed and the violence of machines. “… the experience of non-objectivity … the supremacy of pure feeling.” — Kazmir Malevich Malevich later employed a radical technique of non-objective painting. He referred to it as ""Suprematism.""He was striving for a purer form of Cubism. The term Suprematism emanates from the perception of the lofty feeling that comes from absolute abstraction. Suprematism by Kazmir Malevich Unsplash He also designed costumes for the opera during this time. In 1913, in collaboration with Mikhail Matyushin, he created a piece titled Victory over the Sun. The theme of the opera was the victory of technology over nature and of modern man over the primal forces of the sun. Malevich's Sketch for the stage curtain for the opera Victory Over the Sun, 1928 ""It is from zero, in zero, that the true movement of being begins. — Kazmir Malevich The importance of the Black Square is found within the confines of the painting itself. It simplicity belies makes the painting imperative in the history of art. The Black Square is ambivalent in both its utter meaningless and its symbolism. It is represents aesthetic notion, architectural notion and geometric notion. The Black Square represents balance. “Up until now there were no attempts at painting as such, without any attribute of real life… Painting was the aesthetic side of a thing, but never was original and an end in itself.” — Kazmir Malevich After the death of Malevich, the painting became dilapidated due to the appalling conditions it was kept in by the Soviet administration. X-rays has revealed a hidden message on the Black Square. The inscription reads ""Negroes battling in a cave"". The Black Square is currently exhibited at the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, Russia.

9,Animal Moms in Bengal Temple Decorations,art," Dr. A K Chatterjee is a seasoned writer with more than 330 blogs in English and Bengali and 10 books mostly on travel, trekking and temples. A bird feeding its chick; terracotta; Gopinath temple, Dasghara, Hooghly It is often said that "" a mom is a mom always, all ways"", and that is true not only for man, but for non-human animals too. In a short article, we'll look into this topic, but in a special situation - that is animal moms in temple decoration of West Bengal. To show the presence of animals with their offspring in the decorations of temples of West Bengal. In a field study, the author has visited and extensively photographed a number of temples in different districts of West Bengal. These photos are searched for animals with their babies, segregated and analyzed. Though there are a number of animals and birds depicted in the decorations of temples, animals with their babies are rare indeed. In the present series, we get only 2 animals and 1 bird with babies : 1. Cow and calf : Though the cow (and its male counterpart the bull) is commonly found in the decorations of temples, especially in the Krishna Leela scenes, specifically cows with their calves are a rare finding. We find 4 temples with 5 pictures of cows with calves, all in terracotta bas-relief. The temples are : Ananta Basudeva of Bansberia, district Hooghly; Jorbangla temple of Vishnupur, district Bankura; Lakshmi Janardan temple of Debipur, district Purva Bardhamn and Sridhar temple of Sonamukhi, district Bankura. 2. Tiger and cub : This can be seen in a terracotta panel in Jorbangla temple of Vishnupur, district Bankura. 3. A bird feeding its chick is depicted in terracotta in Gopinath temple of Dasghara, district Hooghly. Cow and calf; terracotta; Ananta Basudeva temple; Bansberia, Hooghly Cow and calf; terracotta; Lakshmi Janardan temple; Debipur, Purva Bardhaman Tiger with cub; terracotta; Jorbangla temple; Vishnupur, district Bankura Bird and chick; terracotta; Gopinath temple; Dasghara, Hooghly Of the 5 pictures of cows with calves our series, 3 pictures show the calf is having its feed from its mother's udder, while in one the calf is seen to approach for feeding and the 5th picture (from Sridhar temple, Sonamukhi) just depicts the cow and the calf sitting together. Significance : 1. The cows shown in the Bengal temple decorations are obviously Zebu or Indian cattle, i.e. Bos indicus. Now, Bos indicus species is characterized by 3 unique features which differentiate it from the European counter part, Bos taurus. These are : i) Presence of a hump on shoulder; ii) presence of Dewlap (""Galakambal"" in vernacular) and iii) big ears which are usually drooping. For example, in a terracotta bas-relief from Charbangla temple of Baronagar, district Murshidabad showing Lord Krishna killing Aristasura the Bull Demon, the bull depicted has clear-cut hump and the dewlap. But in the pictures in our series we see that the cows depicted are typically Indian (with prominent hump and the dewlap) in only 2 of the five cases (in Jorbangla and Sridhar temples). Now the question is why so? Why in other cases the artists failed to draw Indian cattle with characteristic features?It is difficult to answer, but an educated guess is that the artists have no clear-cut knowledge about it. 2. The Indian cow's gestation period is on the average 285 days, and more importantly, the mother cow weans her calf in about 2 weeks time. Thereafter, the calf starts eating grass etc., though it can, and does feed on its mother's milk for a longer period than this. The age of the calves depicted in the present series are difficult to guess, though in the picture from Lakshmi Janardan temple of Debipur the calf is quite small.

Cow and calf from ""Gostha Leela"" scene; terracotta ; Lakshmi Janardan temple; Debipur, Purva Bardhaman Cow and calf from ""Gostha Leela"" scene; terracotta ; Lakshmi Janardan temple; Debipur, Purva Bardhaman Cow and calf; terracotta; Sridhar temple; Sonamukhi, Bankura Cow and calf; terracotta; Jorbangla temple; Vishnupur, Bankura In the present series, we get a single picture of a tiger with a cub. Let us discuss a little about the tiger and tiger cubs in general. Tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest member of the cat family. Its nearest rival in size and strength, viz. the lion, is literally far behind. While the tigers are 12-13 feet in length and about 650 lbs in weight, lions are about 7 feet in length and about 500 lbs in weight.Tigers are solitary animals, and they live in the jungle in a specified area of its own.Tiger cubs are born mostly in between March and June. The gestation period of a tigress is typically 93 - 114 days and the litter is of 2 -3 cubs (maximum 6 cubs).The cubs have closed eyes at birth, and the eyes start to open by 14 days. They drink milk only for about 8 weeks, and then the mother trains them to eat meat. Weaning is complete by 5-6 months, but the cubs stay with the mother for about 2 years. At the age of 2 years, the young tigers leave their mother and start to live in their own area in the jungle, though at first the areas overlap with each other's and their mother's. Now, let us focus to the picture in our hand.As already said, it is a bas-relief in terracotta from the Jorbangla temple of Vishnupur, district Bankura. Here we can see a tiger playing with a cub. The tiger is, in all probability, the mother, because the male tigers are notorious for killing the cubs. During 15th-19th century, tigers were plentiful in Bengal. This was reflected in temple decorations where we can see several picturization of the tiger, mostly in hunting scenes and also in some scenes where we can see tigers attacking men.But a tiger mom with its cub is a rare finding. Tiger hunting scene; terracotta; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Two tigers mauling a man; terracotta; Jorbangla temple; Vishnupur A tiger (presumably the mother) with its cub;  terracotta; Jorbangla temple; Vishnupur Birds are actually feathered Theropod dinosaurs and are the only known dinosaurs living today. They lay eggs, which require incubation for a varying period before hatching. Once hatched, the chick is usually featherless, with closed eyes and basically helpless. They require parental care of varying periods for their survival. Parents care for them, feed them beak-to-beak, and teaches them to fly and forage. The chicks leave their parents when they learn to fly or forage for their own food. In Bengal temple decorations, birds are plentiful, being depicted as : a)Vahana or vehicle of gods and goddesses like Kartikeya (Peacock), Brahma (swan), Saraswati (Swan) and Laksmi (Owl).b) In isolated bird (mostly in angular plaques and in the arch over temple entrance) - peacocks and parrots mostly.c) In a flock - a flock of swans is called ""Hansalata"" in temple decorations, and can be seen in many temples.d) Imaginary birds (like the ""Rock"" or ""Singha Pakshi"" from the Ramayana). But a bird feeding its chick is extremely rare in temple decorations. We are fortunate enough to get such a picture in terracotta bas-relief. From the picture, it is difficult to identify the bird type, but possibly the birds thus portrayed are common birds like the Common Mynah.

In this short article, this unique topic has been discussed. This is a small series, and if some researchers work with larger number of temples, we may come to know of more interesting things. * All photos are by the author. © 2022 Dr A K Chatterjee"
10,Workers of Different Professions in Bengal Temple Decorations,art," Dr. A K Chatterjee is a seasoned writer with more than 330 blogs in English and Bengali and 10 books mostly on travel, trekking and temples. Palanquin bearers; terracotta; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad From the very early periods, temples in Bengal are being decorated on the external as well as the inner walls. These decorations include a multitude of subjects, starting from gods and goddesses, scenes from the two epics the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, holy texts like Puranas including ""Dashavatara"" (the ten Avatars of Lord Vishnu) and Krishna Leela (life stories of Lord Krishna), social events etc. on one hand and vegetative and geometric designs on the other. In the present article, we'll discuss about a particular subject - presence of the pictures of workers of different professions in the decorations of temples of West Bengal. Guards with different weapons; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Soldiers; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad The present study is from 40 temples situated in different districts of West Bengal (a list of these temples are given in the Appendix) visited and photographed by the author. The photographs are analyzed and grouped into several relevant groups, and the salient points discussed. The medium of these decorations are usually bas-relief works in terracotta, stone and stucco; wood carvings; paintings and a in a few cases metal works. The vast majority of these decorations are in terracotta plaques, and hence to the common people, temple decorations has become synonymous with terracotta works. Terracotta work on front facade; Gopaleshwar temple; bankati; Paschim Bardhaman Nrisingha Avatar of Lord vishnu; stucco; Bhavaniswar temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Kurma (Tortoise) Avatar of lord Vishnu; bas-relief work in stone; Shiva temple; Bankati; Birbhum Matsya (Fish) avatar of lord Vishnu; mural; Kaleswar temple; Birbhum Krishna slaying Bakasura, the Bird demon; brass engraving; Brass chariot, Ajodhya, Bankura These constitute a long list as follows (This is just an alphabetical list, and in no way represent the volume of the pictures of a particular group or other) : 1. Acrobat2. Blacksmith3. Boatmen4. Carpenter5. Cart drivers - horse drawn carts and chariots, bullock carts, 6. Dancer7. Door-keeper (Dwarpala)8. Fan-bearer9. Farmer10. Flag bearer11. Guards - including two highly interesting picture of Brahmin guards wearing the sacred thread.12. House-maid13. Hunters - tiger hunters, deer hunters, bear hunters, lion hunters and bird hunters (both Indian as well as European).14. Keepers of different domestic animals like the cattle (cowherds), horse, elephant and even camels.15. Musicians - including Vocalists, Violin players, Drum players (Dhak, Dhol, Khol etc), Veena player, Tabla player, bugle players etc.16. Navy or naval soldiers (or pirates, as opined by some).17. Palanquin bearers18. Priest19. Soldiers - both Indian as well as European. Of these 19 groups, the most volume of pictures goes to dancers and musicians, hunters and soldiers in that order. Besides these, there are some not so common findings which are grouped under ""Miscellaneous"" : This group presents some unique professionals like a female ""Hookah-Bardar"" (carrier of Hookah), ""Shiuli"" (persons who climb date palm trees to cut the tree-trunk to collect the tree-sap), milkman, snake charmer, lady vendors or merchandise sellers who carry their goods in a basket on their heads, persons who use a wooden instrument called ""Dhenki"" in Bengali to de-husk paddy, weavers who spun an instrument called ""Charka"", wrestlers, attendants to rich persons etc. Now, we'll discuss these groups one by one. That acrobats constituted a number of loosely threaded professions in 18-19th century Bengal is clearly evident from their presence in the decorations of many temples of West Bengal. Some of the examples are can be seen in temples from Bankati, district Paschim Bardhaman; Raghabeshwar temple of Dignagar, district Nadia and Ganpur, district Birbhum.Interestingly, this type of acrobats can still be seen today, especially in fairs and in rural areas of Bengal. Acrobat; terracotta; Shiva temple; Bankati; Paschim Bardhaman Acrobat; bas-relief in stone; Shiva temple; Ganpur, Birbhum Female acrobat; terracotta; Sridhar temple; Kotulpur, Bankura Blacksmiths (""Kamar"" in Bengali) were, and still are, an inseparable part of our society. They can be seen in every village, town and even big cities. In Pratapeshwar temple of Kalna, Purva Bardhaman district a blacksmith is depicted in a terracotta plaque. Blacksmith; terracotta; Pratapeshwar temple; Kalna; Purva Bardhaman We have several types of boats in this part of the country, starting from small single-man canoe to big boats which transport heavy goods as well as passengers. In yesteryears, boats were the major mode of travelling, business and military use, either for attack or defend. Consequently, boatmen of several classes appeared in the seen. In temple decorations, boatmen are shown basically in two situations - 1) part of epics and religious texts like Krishna Leela; and 2) social events. The examples of the former are a) Guhak Chandal taking Lord Rama, Mother Sita and Lakshmana across a river in his boat (Gangeshwar temple of Baronagar, district Murshidabad) and b) Noukabilas (Joyride in a boat) scenes from Krishna Leela (examples galore, some of them are Jorbangla temple of Vishnupur, district Bankura; Narayan temple of Jaipur, district Bankura; Ananta basudev temple of Bansberia, district Hooghly; Shiva temple of Ganpur, district Birbhum etc.). Boats and boatmen in social events are depicted in many temples like Shiva temple of Sribati, district Purva Bardhaman; Gopaleshwar temple of Bankati village, district Paschim Bardhaman; Rajrajeshwar temple of Dwarhatta, district Hooghly etc. Story from the Ramayana : Guhak Chandal ferrying Rama-Laxmana-Sita in his boat; terracotta; Gangeshwar temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Nouka Bilas : Krishna leela; terracotta; Jorbangla temple; Vishnupur Nouka Bilas; bas-relief in stone; Ganpur, Birbhum Boatman; terracotta; Gopaleshwar temple; Bankati; Paschim Bardhaman Boats; terracotta; Rajrajeswar temple, Dwarhatta; Hooghly Boatmen; terracotta; shiva temple; Sribati; Purva Bardhaman Like the blacksmith, carpenters are also a vital part of our social system. However, their depiction in temple decorations are rare. One such example can be seemn in a Shiva temple of Ganpur, district Birbhum. Interestingly, this picture is a low-relief work done in a type of stone known as ""Giripathar"" or ""Fulpathar"".  Carpenter; bas-relief in stone; Shiva temple; Ganpur; Birbhum There are two types of wheeled vehicles - a) Chariots and b) Carts. They are differentiated by the type of wheels, more specifically, whether wheels are spoked or not. If the wheels are spoked, the vehicle is called a Chariot, if not, a Cart. Both these types of vehicles with their drivers are depicted in the temple decorations, but it seems that the temple artists did not know or avoided this classification based on spokes of wheels. For this reason we see on the one hand chariots of the heroes of the epics with solid spoke-less wheels (example is the chariots of Rama and Ravana , and those of Arjuna and Karna in various temples), and the vehicles of common men with spoked wheels. Carts/chariots of common men can be horse-driven or bullock-driven, and we can see both types in temple decorations. Examples of horse-driven vehicles can be seen in Gopaleshwar temple of Bankati village, district Paschim Bardhaman and bullock-carts are present in Madanmohan temple of Vishnupur, district Bankura and Gopinath temple of Dasghara, district Hooghly.

In the human history, the pre-historic men danced as rituals, specially before hunting, and presumably also to express joy. The history of dance is a very long and interesting one which is beyond the scope of this article. It only suffices to say that the two main streams of dance flowed along the religious and entertainment channels. In the temple decorations of West Bengal, we thus see religious dances as well as dances for entertainment, which we shall call Social dances for convenience. Examples of religious dances include ""Nagar Sankirtan"" introduced by Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu; ""Ras-leela"" dances of Krishna Leela; ""Tandava"" dance performed by Lord Krishna on the hood of Kaliya Naga the Serpent etc. Examples of Social dances include dances performed before kings, landlords and the Rich; classical and folk dances and dances by the ""Badia"", a nomadic tribe who travels from places to places and earn their livelihood by dancing among other petty jobs.

In our present series we get two beautiful examples of ""Dwarpala""-s, one from a Shiva temple of Dasghara, district Hooghly where we can see two big high-relief terracotta statues of two guards on either side of the main entrance, and the other, a stucco figure, from a dilapidated temple of Bali-Dewangunj village, district Hooghly. Two ""Dwarpala""-s ; terracotta; Shiva temple; Dasghara; Hooghly ""Dwarpala"" in stucco; Bali-Dewangunj; Hooghly It was a custom in the past in the pre-electric supply era to post one or sometimes two person/s on one or both sides of the throne or chair on which the king or landlord sat. Their duty was to fan the dignitary. In the present series we get some pictures of these fan-bearers. Examples include in the Ramraja panel (which shows Lord Rama on throne) from Pratapeshwar temple of Kalna, district Purva Bardhaman, a man with a fan (from Gopinath temple of Dasghara, district Hooghly); and a woman fan bearer in front of a rich lady (from Lakshmi Janardan temple of Ghurisha, district Birbhum). Fan bearer in Ramraja panel; terracotta; Pratapeshwar temple; Kalna; Purva Bardhaman Fan bearer lady (partly damaged); terracotta; Lakshmi Janardan temple; Ghurisha; Birbhum Fan bearer; terracotta; Gopinath temple; Dasghara, Hooghly Our country is basically an agricultural land, so farmers are an inseparable part our lives, so logically we'd like to see a large number of pictures depicting the farmers. But in the reality, farmers are very poorly represented in temple decorations. May be the rich and aristocrat patrons who financed the temple construction did not consider it is important and ""fashionable"" to picturize farmers on the temple-walls. In the present series, we find only one picture of a farmer with a plough on his shoulder from a Shiva temple of Ganpur, district Birbhum. He is looking towards the sky, as if to see whether there is any sign of rain-bearing clouds. Farmer; bas-relief in stone; Ganpur, Birbhum Flag bearers were, and still are, a common sight in front of processions. In temple decorations there are many scenes with flag bearers. Two examples from the present series are from Charbangla temple of Baronagar, district Murshidabad and Rajrajeshwar temple of Dwarhatta, district Hooghly Flag bearers; terracotta; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Flag bearer; terracotta; Rajrajeshwar temple; dwarhatta, Hooghly Armed guards are sometimes difficult to differentiate from soldiers in temple decorations. So empirically isolated armed persons are labelled here as guards. There are many pictures of such armed persons in our temples , two of these stand out from the others. One of these is a picture of two armed female-guards (from Shiva temple of Bankati-Ajodhya, district Paschim Bardhaman) and the other (actually two pictures from Shiva temple of Sribati village, district Purva Bardhaman) is highly interesting, to say the least. In it an armed guard is depicted as usual, but the man is wearing the ""Janeu"" or the sacred thread, the unmistakable sign of the Brahmins. Now, in Bengal in the past the guards were almost always from the so called lower communities like ""Bagdi"", ""Dom"", ""Bauri"" etc. who were famous for their marshal skills. But the Brahmin community, at the top of the social ladder, were usually scholarly and did not join the armed professions, though there were many exceptions. So, the depiction of an armed guard with the sacred thread is no doubt highly significant.

However, there is a point of caution. The ladied thus depicted to perform household chores may not be maids at all, but the ladies of the house themselves. But for the sake of description, we've taken the liberty to brand them as house maids. Examples are from Ananta Basudeva temple of Bansberia, district Hooghly and Radha Vinod temple of Joydev-Kenduli, district Birbhum. In both these pictures, the lady is seen to carry a broom, used to sweep the household. House maid with a broom; terracotta; Ananta Basudeva temple; Bansberia, Hooghly House maid with a broom; terracotta; Radha Vinod temple; Joydev-Kenduli; Birbhum As the temples were constructed by the local landlords & rich merchants, & as it was fashionable to be involved in hunting, it was inevitable that the artists would be encouraged to put hunting scenes in the temple art, either directly by the patrons paying for it, or by the fact that it was an attractive subject for their work. For this reason, the medieval temples in Bengal have a rich collection of hunting scenes, mostly in terracotta, but also in other medium like stucco or wood. In our present series we get a large number of hunting scenes as well as pictures of the hunters who were either Indian or European. The weapons used in hunting as shown in the temple decorations ranged from bow & arrow, sword, dagger, spear and muskets.The game animals include tigers, lions, deer, bears, birds and even rhinoceros.

This is also reflected in the decorations of temples. Thus we get pictures of cowherds, dog keepers, horse keepers, elephant keepers called ""Mahout"" in Bangla and even camel keepers.

They probably represent European naval soldiers, though the possibility of them being Portuguese pirates cannot be ruled out. Naval soldiers or Portuguese pirates? terracotta; Jorbangla Kali temple; Itanda; Birbhum Soldiers on a boat; terracotta; Jorbangla temple, Vishnupur As palanquins were the common mode of transport not only for the rich but also for the common men, specially the ladies, in 17th to 20th century Bengal, their depiction in temple decorations is only what is normally expected. We see the presence of palanquins and palanquin-bearers in a large number of temples. Some examples are Lakshmi Janardna temple of Ilambazar, district Birbhum; Radha Krishna temple of Ula-Birnagar, district Nadia; Shiva temple of Ganpur, district Birbhum; Raghabeshwar temple of Dignagar,district Nadia; Charbangla temple of Baronagar, district Murshidabad; Ramchandra temple of Guptipara, district Hooghly and Ananta Basudev temple of Bansberia, district Hooghly.It is interesting to note that in Ananta Basudev temple the palanquin bearers look like Europeans.

As already said, armed persons in groups or processions are labelled as ""soldiers"" in this article. Some examples are from the following temples : Gopinath temple of Dasghara, district Hooghly; Shiva temple of Bankati village, Paschim Bardhaman; Shiva temple of sribati village, Purva Bardhaman; Ratneshwar temple of Bhattabati, Murshidabad; Jorbangla Kali temple of Itanda village, Birbhum and Krishnachandraji temple of Kalna, Purva Bardhaman. It is interesting to note that the soldiers depicted in the Krishnachandraji temple are actually armed Shaivite Yogis.

""Hookah-Bardar"": This term is used for a particular group of workers whose duty is to prepare the Hookah for use by their masters. In the Raghabeshwar temple of Dignagar village (constructed in 1669 AD), district Murshidabad we can see a highly interesting picture oif a female ""Hookah-Bardar"" who is seen to present the hookah to his mistress (yes, not the master!). This is a brilliant example of smoking by upper-class ladies in Bengal of that era. 2. ""Shiuli"" : There is a group of particular professionals who climb date palm trees to shave the tree-trunk to collect the tree-sap which later oozes out of the cut-marks. This date palm sap is used as a refreshing sweet drink and date palm jaggery is prepared from it. Both these are highly popular in Bengal even today.In a temple of Ajodhya village, district Paschim Bardhaman, we can see a picture of a ""Shiuli"" in a terracotta plaque. 3. Snake charmer : A snake charmer vwith his snake is displayed in terracotta bas-relief in Raghabeshwar temple, Dignagar, district Nadia. 4. Lady vendors : In some temples we get pictures of lady vendors or merchandise sellers who carry their goods in a basket on their heads. Examples are Nabaratna Shiva temple of Panchthupi, district Murshidabad; Gopinath temple of Dasghara, district Hooghly and Shiva temple of Ganpur, district Birbhum. 5. ""Dhenki"" operator : As already said, ""Dhenki"" is a wooden instruments by which paddy is de-husked to get rice. Though nearing obsolescence by the advent of mechanised rice mills, ""Dhenki"" is still used in rural areas of Bengal.We get a nice representation of this profession in bas-relief in a stone plaque from a Shiva temple of Ganpur village, district Birbhum. 6. Weavers : Weaver spinning cotton to produce thread an instrument called ""Charka"" is depicted in a terracotta plaque in Gopinath temple of Dasghara, district Hooghly. 7. Attendants to rich persons can be seen in some temples. One example is Lakshmi Janardan temple of Ghurisha, district Birbhum where in a terracotta plaque we see two female attendants on either side of an aristocratic lady. 8. Milkman : An absolutely essential worker in the society is the humble milkman. In Lakshmi Janardan temple of Surul, district Birbhum, we can see a milkman milking the cow in terracotta. However, the ""milkman"" in the scene may be Lord Krishna in his ""Gostha Leela"". 9. Wrestlers : Professional wrestlers were a part of the entertainment scenario in the past. in many temples we can see pictures of wrestlers, a large percentage of whom were Shaiva Yogis. 10. Men who used to prepare ""Bhang"" (a cannabis preparation) : Interestingly, in many temples we can see Shaivite Yogis preparing ""Bhang"", a cannabis preparation which was used by the ascetics in a major way. some examples are Ananda Bhairavi temple of Sukharia, district Hooghly; Shiva temple of Sribati, district Purva Bardhaman; Shiva temple of Ganpur, district Birbhum; Radha damodar temple of Hadal-Narayanpur, dustrict Bankura etc. Female ""Hookah-Bardar""; terracotta; Raghabeshwar temple, Dignagar, Nadia ""Shiuli""; terracotta; Ajodhya, Paschim Bardhaman Snake Charmer; terracotta, Raghabeshwar temple; Dignagar; Nadia fdemale vendors; terracotta; Nabaratna Shiva temple; Panchthupi, Murshidabad ""Dhenki""; bas-relief on stone; Shiva temple; Ganpur, Birbhum Female attendants; terracotta; Lakshmi Janardan temple; Ghurisha, Birbhum Milkman; terracotta; Lakshmi Janardan temple, Surul, Birbhum Wrestlers; terracotta; Jorbangla Kali temple; Itanda, Birbhum Preparing :Bhang""; terracotta; Ananda bhairavi temple; Sukharia, Hooghly Before concluding this long discussion, we must mention Lord Vishwakarma and his presence in temple decorations in Bengal. Lord Vishwakarma, as per Hindu scriptures, was ""Swayambhu"" or self-manifest, though in some texts he is referred to as the son of Bramha. Lord Vishwakarma is the Celestial Engineer and he is credited with construction of the universe. He is also the god of all workers, especially who perform their jobs with the help of some instruments. In iconography, Lord Vishwakarma is depicted as sitting on, or standing by, an elephant, with some tools in his hands (usually hammer and chisel). As this article is on all sorts of workers, it is essential that Lord Vishwakarma is mentioned here. Viswakarma in temple decorations : In the present series, the best picture is from Nalateshwari temple of Nalhati, district Birbhum.

12,Tiger Hunting in the Decorations of Temples in West Bengal,art," Dr. A K Chatterjee is a seasoned writer with more than 330 blogs in English and Bengali and 10 books mostly on travel, trekking and temples. Tiger hunting on hoirse; terracotta; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, district Murshidabad Hunting is the practice of killing any living thing, usually wildlife, for various reasons like :- i) Obtaining food for self or family;ii)Trading of fur, horns, bone & meat;iii)Saving fellow human beings (one example is the hunting of man-eater tigers).iv)Conservation of the ecosystem (one example is the killing of foreign species of predator animals to protect the local ones);v)Recreation or sports. Accordingly, hunting has been categorized into 3 basic types : 1.Subsistence hunting;2.Therapeutic hunting.3. Sport hunting. (Ref : “Types of hunting - Tourism teacher”; https://tourismteacher.com) Hunting has a long history and may well pre-date the appearance of man on earth. There is evidence that ancestors of modern man practiced hunting, chiefly for food. Next we see the early humans engaged in hunting - many prehistoric rock paintings show men hunting animals. Weapons used for hunting include a variety of articles, starting from the stone-made weapons of the Paleolithic men to guns & other firearms of the present day, with bows & arrows, spears, swords & daggers in between. Now, in general animals are faster than man. So, while pursuing the game animals, man has utilized many vehicles like chariots, carts etc. & many animals as mount, like horses & elephants and also has taken the help of many fast animals for hunting - the most common & important among them is the dog. Different breeds of dogs, especially hounds, were & still are, used as an aid to hunters to find, chase, and retrieve games, and sometimes to kill. Pre-historic rock painting showing men with spears; some the men are on horseback. Bhimbethka, Madhya Pradesh, India Bison hunting by pre-historic men; Rock painting, Bhimbethka, Madhya pradesh. Two European hunters on horse back accompanied by a dog; terracotta; Gopinath temple; Dasghara, district Hooghly Hunting was an honorable activity in India from the very early period, as evident by the fact that gods & mythological figures are described to be engaged in hunting. Lord Shiva, one of the Trinities of Hinduism, has a name ""Mrigavyadha"" meaning “the deer hunter”, thus glorifying the act of hunting. The Kings & princes of the two great Hindu epic Ramayana & Mahabharata were also described as expert hunters. Later, during the feudal and colonial times hunting was regarded as a regal sport in India, & the kings & princes were involved in hunting in a big way. Mughal emperors were avid hunters. It is said that firearms were introduced in hunting scenario in India during the reign of Mughal emperor Akbar (1556 - 1605 CE).There were professional hunters in their pay roll called Shikaris. The tradition was continued in the British period as the British loved & encouraged hunting. Lord Rama killing the demon Maricha  in the guise of a golden deer. Terracotta; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, district Murshidabad. A royal hunter on horse back hunting lion; terracotta, Gopinath temple; Dasghara, district Hooghly A great ritualistic hunting festival takes place in the western districts of southern West Bengal (mainly Purulia, Jhargram, West Medinipur and Bankura) annually on 13th April. Tribal communities armed with bows and arrows, spears, axes, swords, knives, nets and traps ritually hunt animals like fishing cats, jackals, foxes, wolves, wild boars and several bird species. Though hunting in any form is completely banned in India, this ritualistic hunting is still going on despite all efforts to stop it by the Government. (Reference : “Hunting festivals of West Bengal - an untold story of wildlife massacres”; https://www.conservationindia.org). Tiger is a big game animal, and it was (and still is) hunted for prestige and trophy, though rarely man-eater tigers were/are hunted as Therapeutic hunting. The Royal Bengal (or simply the Bengal) tiger constitutes about 80% of tiger population and it is found mostly in India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar. Historically, tigers were hunted since ancient times by the royals as well as the common hunters (the Shikari). Lord Shiva is depicted to use tiger skin as his cloth. Tiger skins were used as the seat-cushion of important holy men. Keeping a stuffed tiger or tiger head in the drawing room was a sign of aristocracy and valor. The tradition of tiger hunting continued in the colonial period. European hunters were very fond of tiger hunting, and the Indian princes and Maharajahs followed their footsteps more enthusiastically than ever. Tigers were hunted on foot, on horseback, on elephant-back and from ""Machan""-s (a raised platform made of wood and bamboo). This caused a sharp decline in the tiger population of India. Much later, people understood the perils of this sort of senseless tiger hunting and early thoughts of Tiger Conservation started. Government stepped in and banned tiger hunting except for dire therapeutic need. Now conservation work is trying its best to restore the tiger population in India.There are many tiger reserves in India now like the Sundarbans, Ranthambhor, Bandhabgarh, Kanha, Bandipur, Jim Corbett National Park, Sariska, Dampa, Melghat, Tadoba, Bor, Mundanthurai, Nagarjunasagar-Srisailam, Nagarhole, Palamau,Panna, Satpura etc. It should be mentioned here that in the Sundarbans area of Bengal, tigers are considered as the manifestation of the local god ""Dakshin Ray"" and the goddess ""Banabibi"" who rides a tiger is considered as the protector of men, especially those who enter the forest to collect wood or honey. Interestingly, ""Banabibi"" is respected by both the local Hindu and Muslim communities (Hindus as a goddess and Muslims as a ""Pirani"" or holy woman).

Hunting tiger on hordseback; terracotta; Radhakrishna temple; Ula-Birnagar, district Nadia Tiger hunting on elephant back; terracotta; Gangeshwar temple; Baronagar, district Murshidabad Hunting tigers from the top of trees; terracotta; Jorbangla temple; Vishnupur, district Bankura Before entering into the subject of the presence of tiger hunting in temple decorations in Bengal, a little discussion is necessary regarding temple decorations in Bengal as a whole. From the very early periods, temples in Bengal are being decorated on the external as well as the inner walls. The medium of these decorations are usually bas-relief works in terracotta, stone and stucco; wood carvings; paintings and in a few cases metal works. The vast majority of these decorations are in terracotta plaques, and hence to the common people, temple decorations has become synonymous with terracotta works. These decorations display a multitude of subjects, starting from gods and goddesses, scenes from the two epics the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, holy texts like Puranas including Dashavatara (the ten Avatars of Lord Vishnu) and Krishna Leela (life stories of Lord Krishna), social events etc. on one hand and vegetative and geometric designs on the other. 11th century Sun Temple of Sonatapal village, district Bankura with its cut-brick terracotta decorations.

For this reason, the medieval temples in Bengal have a rich collection of hunting scenes, mostly in terracotta, but also in other medium like stucco. Lion hunting; terracotta; Ramchandra temple; Guptipara, district Hooghly Rhinoceros hunting; terracotta; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, district Murshidabad Deer hunting; terracotta; Madanmohan temple; Vishnupur, district Bankura The present study is made from 31 temples from different districts of West Bengal, the names of which are given in the Appendix. Many temples have tiger hunting scenes in their wall-decorations. In these scenes, tigers are seen being hunted by hunters on horseback mostly, but hunters on foot (in Krishnachandraji temple of Kalna and Radha Shyam temple of Vishnupur) and on elephant-back (in Gangeshwar temple of Baronagar and Advaita Prabhu temple from Shantipur, district Nadia) are also depicted.Some of the temples with tiger hunting scenes with hunters on horseback are Rajrajeshwar temple of Dwarhatta, Raghunath Shiva temple of Ghurisha, Jorbangla temple of Vishnupur, Radha krishna temple of Ula-Birnagar, Charbangla temple of Baronagar, Ananta basudeva temple of Bansberia, Shiva temple of Baidyapur, Ramchandra temple of Guptipara, Shiva temple of Ganpur and Shiva temple of Bankati-Ajodhya. Interestingly, among these temples, all but three have terracotta work. The two exceptions are :i)Shiva temple of Ganpur, district Birbhum which has bas-relief work in stone;ii)Shiva temple of Bankati-Ajodhya, district Paschim Bardhaman which has two tiger hunting scenes in wood engraving. iii) Radhashyam temple of Vishnupur, district Bankura which has a bas-relief of stucco on stone. Tiger hunters This is an interesting subject. Though in majority of tiger hunting scenes show Indian hunters (Shikari) as evident by their dresses and head-gears, the tiger hunting scene from Krishnachandraji temple of Kalna shows European hunters (as evident by their dresses and hats). Carrying the dead tiger This is beautifully depicted in terracotta bas-relief in the Jorbangla temple of Vishnupur, district Bankura.

The number of temples in the present series is small (31), so this study can be said a Pilot Study at the best. Hopefully, some researches will pursue this sort of studies with larger series.

14,The Wynwood Dream or A South Beach Nightmare,art," Tripsavvy.com Wynwood is an area of Miami that thrives artistically. It has a history, for me like no other, in regards to an art district but I'm not here to tell you about that history, the internet is flooded with that information, Google on. My mission statement is to inform you on how the artist in Miami, not all, but the local artist with no ties to corporate America, the minority artist who are shunned by the neighborhood they help build up. Wynwood was officially founded in 2003 and Wynwood Walls came about in 2009. Many artist were involved and help developed not just the neighborhood but the idea of a grand artistic neighborhood that'll rival anything we've ever experience. Sure Wikipedia is going to name a bunch of rich people and artist that are more familiar to us but it doesn't mention the small businesses and local artist who through social networking and persistence help popularize the big picture. For many years prior to 2017, artist from all over the world were allowed to express themselves in this friendly neighborhood with it's assortment of art galleries, bars, clubs, art walks and entertainment, that is until corporate America came in and gentrified the neighborhood and violated the rights of the artist and entertainers that use to fill the streets utilizing their first Amendment, their freedom of expression. Back in 2016 I participated in the art walk during Basel in Wynwood. There was entertainers in the streets, singers on every corner, food trucks all around, and artist peddling art to passerby's. I don't see none of that now. What strikes me is the restrictions that the police, city and the code enforcers place on the very people who partook in the effort to popularize the Wynwood dream when twenty years ago the police and the city of Miami never cared about that neighborhood. There was no school, pool or park in Wynwood back then. In fact there was economic failure at the hands of the city. Twenty years before that Wynwood was a rundown neighborhood flooded with drug dealers and faced many of the problems most urban areas faced and was nearly completely destroyed by riots in 1988. The neighborhood has came along way but don't think that the city of Miami cared one bit about it as oppose to their precious beach. They only came to help after residents made the attempt and succeeded at making it a place where art could thrive. When the city saw the progress made, then they united with corporate America to move in and take over raising rent for those who lived in the neighborhood for generations only to replace their homes with art related structures. Gentrification of course, ousting a lot of the people who help make Wynwood what it is today. As for the local artist, I can empathize. Why can't I post up on a corner and express myself as an artist or entertainer? I believe their ultimate goal is to make it Wynwood like South Beach which caters to the tourist. So what's wrong with catering to tourist? Nothing, most might speculate but I see things differently. South beach has been paradise for people vacationing for generations but there's somethings that I see that I don't like or agree with. I am a homeless man in a very complicated situation but I am also optimistic, positive and always motivated. I am very aware of my surroundings and what I see is what most people are not aware of. I don't know how many restaurants or fine diners there are on South Beach but I do know how many black waiters and waitresses there are on South Beach....NONE!. In fact you'll barely even see any natural American born citizen working as a server. And don't get me wrong, they have jobs on the beach but it's washing dishes and or anything else in the back where they can't be seen. Open your eyes and see that the majority of American born Blacks, Puerto Ricans, and even American born Caucasians are homeless people on the streets of South Beach. Why is this? Most businesses on South beach are own by people who are not American in nature. What I mean by this is that they have no respect for our culture, they can care less about our customs and holidays which ironically makes sense. Why would they? Why would they care about American holidays for instance and (no pun intended) why would a German, Italian, someone from Belize, Paraguay etc... care about Valentine's day when it's an American holiday? It's something they don't celebrate. Valentine's day is just an example to say that they value the opportunity but don't respect it. They hire their own kind to work their businesses and rather hire someone illegally under the table than to hire an American who would pay taxes. Now please, I'm not speaking generally, I don't put this on every business but like I said look around. If your in South beach or plan to visit, ask your server where they are from.  So what does Wynwood and South Beach have in common? Not too much yet. You see corporate American could never really get a grasp on South Beach. Ever wonder why there's no Wendy's, Denny's or Pizza Hut etc.. on South Beach. Do I really need to answer that question for you? I hope you get the point. For a long time the mom and pop businesses on South beach have maintained ownership of their land and very few have sold their land to corporate America. Personally I don't see anything wrong with that, but of course, I don't think anyone needs a Walmart on South Beach. It' would only destroy businesses and opportunities. If you see CVS and Walgreens on every other block, well that's because they rent that space, they will never own it. Now for the point at hand. The Wynwood take over is what ultimately makes Wynwood and SOBE very different. You can't express yourself as an artist on South Beach either. You see all those green card holders or unnatural citizens selling bracelets all around the beach with their table at their fixed allotted locations? It's a monopoly. They have fixed the opportunity for you to be able to sell, the law applied only caters to a selected few as long as it ain't an American minority that was born in America. This is not an opinion, open your eyes and see it for yourself. Now comes the question, how many black or American born Caucasians do you see in Wynwood? I'm not going to answer that question, seeing is believing. I'm not trying to stir the pot or attempt to make my opinions, facts. How many local artist and entertainers that pay taxes, do you see in Wynwood selling anything that don't work for a corporate American entity?  Just that you know, the majority of people you'll see in Wynwood strolling about are AMERICANS that were born in AMERICA. Yeah, of course you see tourist but I assure you the city of SOUTH BEACH hate it. It's taking money out of their jurisdiction. More shocking to me is that most tourist don't even know about WYNWOOD. Why? because their hotels reservations are on the beach for the most part and it's the duty of that hotel to make sure the tourist stay on the beach. If you didn't know, Miami has more Mayors than most countries have combined. With that is a competition to drive tourist to their part of town to engage in the local economics. Locals on South beach want to oust all American workers and even it's illegals to make way for casinos to turn it into a Vegas like city. But who cares, I don't care about SOBE, it doesn't care about me and those I see sleeping in the streets. They won't hire me, not as a waiter or let me express myself as an artist. I have to rent or buy a gallery to do so, so the minority artist can never flourish in an environment made to violate the rights that one is not aware of. When the local artist began renting warehouses in Wynwood back in the early 2000's, the warehouse owners welcomed them with open arms. When corporate American moved in, the owners raised the rent to make the locals artist leave and pave the way for corporate and elite galleries. I was devastated. Meanwhile Fendi and Gucci and stores like that began sprouting around Wynwood which only hires people with accents to work at their locations. Once again, this is not my opinion, open your eyes and take a look for yourself. I don't want Wynwood to be like SOBE though it's looking like it's transforming into it because if it does than you'll will never see a American working there unless they own a business there and they most likely be American born which means they will only hire their own kind or illegals. I am experiencing what I am going through in the streets because I choose to. It's like Cory Booker, the former Mayor of Newark, NJ living in the projects while he was Mayor with his family to be able to live it in order to come up with a solution to the problems he encounters and witnesses. I am not hungry, I am not poor. I am actually doing very good in life. I am in a position to help others less fortunate. I run a website and movement called TOESLAM and my mission statement is to empower artist so that they in turn can empower their community. Please go to TOESLAM.com and join the movement to save Wynwood and places like it. © 2022 Felix J Hernandez"

Accordingly, hunting has been categorized into 3 basic types : (Ref : “Types of hunting - Tourism teacher”; https://tourismteacher.com) Hunting has a long history and may well pre-date the appearance of man on earth .There is evidence that ancestors of modern man practiced hunting, chiefly for food - many prehistoric rock paintings show men in hunting.

Prehistoric rock painting showing hunters with spear, both on foot and on horseback; Bhimbethka, Madhya Pradesh, India Hunting was an honorable activity in India from the very early period, as evident by the fact that gods & mythological figures are described to be engaged in hunting. Lord Shiva, one of the Trinities of Hinduism, has a name ""Mrigavyadha"" meaning “the deer hunter”, thus glorifying the act of hunting. The Kings & princes of the two great Hindu epic Ramayana & Mahabharata were also described as expert hunters. Later, during the feudal and colonial times hunting was regarded as a regal sport in India, & the kings & princes were involved in hunting in a big way. Mughal emperors were avid hunters. It is said that firearms were introduced in hunting scenario in India during the reign of Mughal emperor Akbar (1556 - 1605 CE). There were professional hunters in their pay roll called Shikaris.

Though at present wild rhinos are found only in the reserve forests of North Bengal (mainly Jaldapara and Gorumara forests) and they are of only one variety, viz. the single horned Indian Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), even in the 19th century rhinos (both single horned Indian rhinoceros and double-horned Sumatran rhinoceros) were found in the southern parts of Bengal, especially in the Sundarbans area. The ""Dhali"" community of southern Bengal got their name from their using ""Dhal"" (shield) made from the tough hide of rhinoceros. Dhalis were part of the soldiers of King Pratapaditya. There are historical evidence that in 1868, a wild Rhinoceros was captured from Chittagang area (present day Bangladesh) and it was sold to the London Zoo. In 1876, a wild rhinoceros was killed by firearms in Comilla (present day Bangladesh). In the end of 1899 or early 1900 AD, a wild rhinoceros was killed by a hunter named Kalachand (ref : www.jagonews24.com). It is said that the disappearance of rhinoceros from Sundarbans was due to widespread rhinoceros hunting. A rhinoceros from Jaldapara National Park; West Bengal A rhinoceros from Pabitora Wild Life Sanctuary, Morigaon, Assam As the temples were constructed by the local landlords & rich merchants, & as it was fashionable to be involved in hunting, it was inevitable that the artists would be encouraged to put hunting scenes in the temple art, either directly by the patrons paying for it, or by the fact that it was an attractive subject for their work. For this reason, the medieval temples in Bengal have a rich collection of hunting scenes, mostly in terracotta, but also in other medium like stucco and stone. The game animals shown in these decorations are tiger (most frequently), deer (second-most common), rhinoceros and birds. Rhinoceros hunting is depicted in temple decorations only rarely. In a study of 28 temples from different districts of West Bengal, we get pictures of rhinoceros in 3 temples only - viz. Charbangla temple (1760 AD) and Gangeshwar temple (1753 AD), both from Baronagar, district Murshidabad and Radhashyam temple of Vishnupur, district Bankura (1758 AD). We’ll discuss about these.

(A list of the temples in the present series is given in the Appendix). These photographs were then searched and the hunting scenes were segregated and analyzed. In the present series, we can see scenes of rhinoceros hunting and rhinoceros attacking men from three temples, two from Baronagar, district Murshidabad  - Charbangla temple (1760 AD) and Gangeshwar temple (1753 AD).,  and one (Radhashyam temple 1758 AD) of Vishnupuir, district Bankura. The construction dates of these three temples are significant. All these temples were constructed in mid-18th century, when rhinoceros were present not only in northern parts of Bengal, but also in the Sundarbans area of southern Bengal. So, it will not be wrong to presume that rhinoceros-hunting was practiced in Bengal in that era. Weapons used in these scenes are muskets (in Charbangla and Gangeshwar temples) and bow & arrow (in Radhashyam temple).

Pictures of rhinoceros hunting in temple decorations is further interesting as it clearly proves the presence of rhinos and that the custom of rhinoceros hunting was in vogue in Bengal during that period. The number of temples in the present series is small (29), so this study can be said a Pilot Study at the best. Hopefully, some researches will pursue this sort of studies with larger series.

18,Windchimes - Natural Jam Session,art," We have a wind chimes outside, and some inside. My hubby uses the outside wind chime for fishing. He listens for it. An old fishing rhyme: Wind from the east, fishing the least. Wind from the west, fishing the best. One can only assume that the waves ruffle differently with a wind change. Coupled with the sun movement east to west. And, last but not least, fish sense of smell and good eyesight. Of course, if you are eating pizza while fishing, and that particular fish is fond of, well... You get the picture."
19,Planter Idea: Repurposing my Pink Toilet,art," We removed our old pink toilet from the basement bathroom. My hubby has had hip surgery and taller toilets are going to be the standard in our home. But, since it was outside now, and being of lazy nature, we decided (for now) to fill the tank and bowl with potting soil. Add some plants, and call it good.  Walmart, with Easter, had some fragrant Hibiscus, tulips and Easter Lily. Burgundy and blue hibiscus and a purplish tulip. Miracle grow potting soil. Some small rocks in the bottom of the tank and bowl. Remove plants from container, place in position. Fill dirt around them up to rim. Water. If the bowl gets too much rainwater, it will probably ""flush"", and the tank has a hole in the bottom, where I removed the filler hose and also the rubber flopper."

Pakhmara, bird, bird hunters, tribal, West Bengal, hunting, bird hunting, Satnoli, terracotta, temple decoration. Hunting has a long history and may well pre-date the appearance of man on earth .There is evidence that ancestors of modern man practiced hunting, chiefly for food - many prehistoric rock paintings show men in hunting. Bird hunting is also being practiced since time immemorial. Hunting has been categorized into 3 basic types : 1.Subsistence hunting : hunting for food and business;2.Therapeutic hunting : to get rid of harmful animals to protect man and ecosystem;3. Sport hunting : hunting for fun and trophy. (Ref : “Types of hunting - Tourism teacher”; https://tourismteacher.com) Birds were and still are hunted for subsistence and sport purposes. Dogs used as tracker and retriever in bird hunting includes German Wirehaired Pointer, German Shorthaired Pointer, Labrador Retriever, Brittany Dog, Jack Russel Terrier etc. In this article, we'll have a short discussion on bird hunting in general and then shall go into our main topic - ""Pakhmara"", the tribal bird hunters of Bengal and their presence in decorations of temples in West Bengal Hunting was an honorable activity in India from the very early period, as evident by the fact that gods & mythological figures are described to be engaged in hunting. Lord Shiva, one of the Trinities of Hinduism, has a name ""Mrigavyadha"" meaning “the deer hunter”, thus glorifying the act of hunting. The Kings & princes of the two great Hindu epic Ramayana & Mahabharata were also described as expert hunters. In the Mahabharata, there is the famous incidence of the Archery test of the Pandava and the Kaurava brothers by their teacher Dronacharya where he asked his students to shoot a bird. Arjuna, the middle of the Pandava brothers and possibly the greatest archer in the Mahabharata, focused only on the eye of the bird and succeeded.Later, during the feudal and colonial times hunting was regarded as a regal sport in India, & the kings & princes were involved in hunting in a big way. Mughal emperors were avid hunters. It is said that firearms were introduced in hunting scenario in India during the reign of Mughal emperor Akbar (1556 - 1605 CE). There were professional hunters in their pay roll called Shikaris. The tradition was continued in the British period as the British loved & encouraged hunting. Weapons used for hunting includes a variety of articles, starting from the stone-made weapons of the Palaeolithic man to guns & other firearms of the present day, with bows & arrows, spears, swords & daggers in between. A great ritualistic hunting festival takes place in the western districts of southern West Bengal (mainly Purulia, Jhargram, West Medinipur and Bankura) annually on 13th April. Tribal communities armed with bows and arrows, spears, axes, swords, knives, nets and traps ritually hunt animals like fishing cats, jackals, foxes, wolves, wild boars and several bird species. Though hunting in any form is completely banned in India, this ritualistic hunting is still going on despite all efforts to stop it by the Government. Bird hunting is continued from time immemorial to the present day and is done mainly for 2 purposes : 1. Subsistence : i.e. for food (meat and eggs) and business by selling meat and eggs as well as the birds alive and also their body parts like feather (eg. peacocks), beak (hornbills) etc.2. Sport : Sport hunting of birds is still a popular activity in several countries including the USA. Ritualistic bird hunting is a combination of the above two types, done for subsistence and sport.One special ritual is still followed during the traditional Durga Puja by wealthy families in Bengal where one or more Indian Roller bird/birds (Nilkantha in Bengali) is/are released by the head of the family. These birds are captured by the Pakhmaras, the Bird hunting people of Bengal. Traditional bird hunting in India is practiced by the tribal people in almost all the states. Game birds are birds which are commonly hunted. These can be divided into following groups : A. Birds captured alive and sold as pets or rituals :These include a large variety of birds with the common factors of their beauty and legends associated with them.The examples of the former group include several types of parakeets, song birds like Hill Mynah, falcons and other birds of prey and many types of smaller birds. B. Birds hunted for meat :These include several varieties of ducks, storks, wild Turkeys, Partridge, pheasants, Quail, Jungle foul, snipes etc. However, members of the tribal community often hunt any available bird for meat. C. Birds hunted for body parts :Examples of these include the peacock for their beautiful plumage which has some religious usage too and hornbills for their big and spectacular beaks used by many tribes as ornaments and head-gears. D. Birds hunted for ritualistic use :The example of Indian Roller is already given.

In addition to this, several types of nets and traps are used to capture birds. Now-a-days, birds are hunted mainly by air-guns and Pellet or Shot guns by city people. Bows & arrows and catapult are still used by rural  and tribal people. In the western part of present day West Bengal we see a special indigenous bird-hunting weapon called ""Satnoli"" being used by ""Pakhmara""-s, a special group of bird hunters who hail from several tribes of the region. Satnoli : The term translates into “seven tubes”. It consists of seven tube-like segments made from bamboo. The bird hunters make a long weapon by joining the separate segments before hunting a bird. The tip of ""Satnoli"" usually has a sharp iron spike, though some kind of strong adhesive is also used in some cases to capture birds alive. Pakhmara, the Bird Hunting tribe of West Bengal Pakhmara is the common name given to a number of tribes who are the traditional bird hunters. The term ""Pakhmara"" translates into ""Pakh"" meaning bird and ""Mara"" means who kills. So the term ""Pakhmara"" means people who kills birds. They are subdivided into 4 groups - ""Jarasand"",These s ""Kalketu-Fullara"", ""Jangipuri"" and ""Daihati"". This classification is based on the type of birds they hunt. Of them, the ""Kalketu-Fullara"" subgroup occupies the highest position among them in social strata. They mostly live in the districts of Purva and Paschim Bardhaman, Birbhum, Murshidabad in West Bengal and in some areas of the state of Jharkhand like Jamtara, Dumka, Godda and Hazaribagh.In West Bengal, they are mostly concentrated in areas like Aushgram, Guskara, Laudoha, Faridpur, Haripur, Ukhra and villages around Durgapur. Though they are Hindu by religion and are mainly followers of Lord Shiva and his avatars like Dharma Thakur, they are Nature Worshiper. In Murshidabad district, Pakhmaras worship the Banyan or Ficus benghalensis (""Bawt"" in Bengali) and the Sacred fig or Ficus religiosa (""Ashathwa"" in Bengali) trees. Though the Pakhmaras uses Bengali as their main language, they have a code language of their own, which resembles the language of the Malpahari tribe of South India. The Pakhmaras hunt bird by nets, traps and Satnoli, which is described alraedy. Hunting in temple decoration in West Bengal Now we'll go into the second part of our discussion, viz. Hunting in temple decoration in West Bengal. Temple decorations : What and Why Traditionally, temples in India are decorated both externally and internally. This include bas-relief works, 3-dimensional structures and paintings (murals and frescos). The subjects of these decorations are myriad, and range from gods and goddesses to the epics (the Ramayana and the Mahabharata), stories from religious texts (eg. Krishna Leela, Dashavatar etc.), social stories and legends and animate & inanimate objects (animals, hunting scenes, kings and queens, common men and women of different professions, floral and geometric designs etc.) These decorations are done mainly for beautification, but their role as a social media cannot be ignored. At the time when there was no media like news papers, radio, TV or the internet, the temple decorations played a vital role of disseminating knowledge about many things, both religious and secular, among the masses. Goddess Durga in terracotta; Radha Damodar temple; Hadal-Narayanpur, Bankura Lord Shiva with his consort Durga on Nandi the Bull; terracotta; Raghunath Shiva temple; Ghurisha, Birbhum Lord Vishnu on his mount Garuda; terracotta' Kali temple; Itanda, Birbhum Tales from the Ramayana : lord rama on throne;  terracotta' Vishnu temple; Hadal-Narayanpur, Bankura Scdene from the Mahabharata : Arjuna shooting a fish through the central hole of a wheel/disc; terracotta; Vishnu temple; Hadal-Narayanpur, Bankura Lord Ganesha; terracotta; Nalateshwari temple; Nalhati, Birbhum Hunters; terracotta; Krishnachandraji temple; Kalna; Purva Bardhaman Kurma Avatar in stone; Shiva temple; Ganpur, Birbhum Matsya Avatar in stucco; Bhavanishwar temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Metal engraving; Brass Ratha/chariot; Ajodhya village; Bankura Wood carving in temple decoration : Goddess Saraswati in Saraswati temple; Ambalgram; Purva Bardhaman Mural in temple decoration : Kurma avatar; Kalleshwar temple; Kalleshwar, Birbhum In general, stones are used in different parts of India both for construction of temples and to decorate them. However, due to the lack of sufficient amount of good quality stones in Bengal, here majority of temples are brick-built, and their decorations are mostly of things other than stone. These include terracotta mostly, but other types of media like stucco, stone work, wood work and in few instances metal works were also used. Temple decoration in terracotta; Jorbangla temple, Vishnupur, Bankura Temple decoration in stone carving : Shiva temple; Ganpur, Birbhum Temple decoration in stucco : Charbangla temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Wood carving in temple decoration : Kalki Avatar; Narayan temple; Jaipur, bankura Metal engravings in temple decoration : Goddess Kali in brass; Brass Chariot; Ajodhya village, Bankura Mural in temple decoration : Shri Chaitanya deva with Nityananda; Nrisinghadeva temple; Gokarna, district Murshidabad As the temples were constructed by the local landlords & rich merchants, & as it was fashionable to be involved in hunting, it was inevitable that the artists would be encouraged to put hunting scenes in the temple art, either directly by the patrons paying for it, or by the fact that it was an attractive subject for their work. For this reason, the medieval temples in Bengal have a rich collection of hunting scenes, mostly in terracotta, but also in other medium like stucco. We’ll now discuss about this interesting subject. Hunting scene in terracotta; Ramchandra temple; Guptipara, Hooghly Hunting scene in wood engraving; Shiva temple; Bankati-Ajodhya; Paschim Bardhaman Hunting scene in stone : Shiva temple; Ganpur, Birbhum Hunting scene in tderracotta; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Pictures of hunting were collected from 29 temples of different districts of West Bengal by the author who travelled personally to and photographed extensively the temples mentioned. (A list of the temples in the present series is given in the Appendix). These photographs were then searched and the bird hunting scenes were segregated and analyzed. In the present series, picture of bird hunting is depicted in 3 temples only, viz. Radhavinod temple of Joydev-Kenduli, district Birbhum , Shiva temple of Bankati-Ajodhya village, Paschim Bardhaman and Lakshmi Janardan temple of Ghurisha, district Birbhum. 1. Radhavinod temple of Joydev-Kenduli was constructed in 1683 AD. It is a brick-built temple with nine turrets, called Nabaratna type temple. It has extensive terracotta decorations. The bird hunting scene is also a terracotta plaque bas-relief. It shows a a turbaned man hunting a flying bird with a ""Satnoli"" type weapon. 2. Lakshmi Janardan temple was constructed in 1739 AD. It is also a brick-built Nabaratna type temple with nine turrets. It also has extensive terracotta decorations.The bird hunting scene in this temple is also a terracotta plaque bas-relief. It shows a person hunting a bird sitting on a tree with a Satnoli type weapon. 3. There are several 19th century  temples in the twin village of Bankati-Ajodhya, Paschim Bardhaman. In one of the temples, there is a small terracotta plaque containing the bas-relief of a ""Pakhmara"" hunting a bird on a tree with a ""Satnoli"". Nabaratna (9-pinnacled) Radhavinod temple; Joydev-Kenduli; Birbhum Pakhmara or Bird Hunter; terracotta; Radhavinod temple; Joydev-Kenduli; Birbhum Nabaratna (9-pinnacled) Lakshmi Janardan temple; Ghurisha; Birbhum Pakhmara or Bird Hunter; terracotta; Lakshmi Janardan temple; Ghurisha; Birbhum Pakhmara or Bird Hunter; terracotta; Shiva temple; Ajodhya, Paschim Bardhaman The temple decoration of West Bengal is simply amazing. It contains so many things that any keen observer is bound to admire the artists who created such wonderful art with a wide reaching inner message. Even a seemingly unimportant event involving marginal people was beautifully depicted in important temples so that people coming to the temples can see these Pakhmaras engraved on the temple, thereby understanding their importance in the society. This study is done on 28 temples only, so it is nothing but a Pilot Study at the best. Hopefully, other researchers will come forward and do extensive research on larger series.

23,Hunters and Hunting in the Decorations of Temples of West Bengal,art," Dr. A K Chatterjee is a seasoned writer with more than 330 blogs in English and Bengali and 10 books mostly on travel, trekking and temples. Tiger hunting; terracotta bas-relief; Charbangla temple, Baronagar, Murshidabad Hunting is the practice of killing any living thing, usually wildlife, for various reasons like :- i) Obtaining  food for self or family; ii) Trading of fur, horns, bone & meat; iii) Saving fellow human beings (one example is the hunting of man-eater tigers). iv) Conservation of the ecosystem; v) Recreation or sports. Accordingly, hunting has been categorized into 3 basic types : (Ref : “Types of hunting - Tourism teacher”; https://tourismteacher.com) Hunting has a long history and may well pre-date the appearance of man on earth .There is evidence that ancestors of modern man practiced hunting, chiefly for food - many prehistoric rock paintings show men in hunting. Weapons used for hunting includes a variety of articles, starting from the stone-made weapons of the Paleolithic man to guns & other firearms of the present day, with bows & arrows, spears, swords & daggers in between. While pursuing the game animals, man has utilized many vehicles like chariots, carts etc. & many animals as mount, like horses & elephants. Man has taken the help of many animals too for hunting; the most common & important among them is the dog. Different breeds of dogs, especially hounds, were & still are, used as an aid to the hunter to find, chase, and retrieve game, and sometimes to kill it. Pre-historic rock paintings showing men with spears on horseback; Bhimbethka, Madhya Pradesh, KIndia Hunter on horseback; terracotta; Ramchandra temple, Guptipara, Hooghly Hunting was an honorable activity in India from the very early period, as evident by the fact that gods & mythological figures are described to be engaged in hunting. Lord Shiva, one of the Trinities of Hinduism, has a name Mrigavyadha meaning “the deer hunter”, thus glorifying the act of hunting. The Kings & princes of the two great Hindu epic Ramayana & Mahabharata were also described as expert hunters. Later, during the feudal and colonial times hunting was regarded as a regal sport in India, & the kings & princes were involved in hunting in a big way. Mughal emperors were avid hunters. It is said that firearms were introduced in hunting scenario in India during the reign of Mughal emperor Akbar (1556 - 1605 CE). There were professional hunters in their pay roll called Shikaris. The tradition was continued in the British period as the British loved & encouraged hunting. All hunting in India is prohibited now under the Wild Life Protection Act 1972. Pre-historic cave painting showing a huge bison with few men, possibly hunters; Bhimbethka; Madhya Pradesh, India Rama killing Maricha the demon in the guise of deer; Ramayana story; terracotta; Vishnu temple; Joypur, Bankura Indian hunter (Shikari) on horse; terracotta; Lakshmi Janardan temple; Debipur, Purva Bardhaman European hunter on horseback; terracotta; Gopinath temple; Dashghara, Hooghly A great ritualistic hunting festival takes place in the western districts of southern West Bengal (mainly Purulia, Jhargram, West Medinipur and Bankura) annually on 13th April. Tribal communities armed with bows and arrows, spears, axes, swords, knives, nets and traps ritually hunt animals like fishing cats, jackals, foxes, wolves, wild boars and several bird species. Though hunting in any form is completely banned in India, this ritualistic hunting is still going on despite all efforts to stop it by the Government. As the temples were constructed by the local landlords & rich merchants, & as it was fashionable to be involved in hunting, it was inevitable that the artists would be encouraged to put hunting scenes in the temple art, either directly by the patrons paying for it, or by the fact that it was an attractive subject for their work. For this reason, the medieval temples in Bengal have a rich collection of hunting scenes, mostly in terracotta, but also in other medium like stucco, stone and painting. We’ll now discuss about this interesting subject viz. “Hunting in temple decoration of West Bengal”. Objective of the study The objective is to analyze the different hunting scenes present in different temples of West Bengal. Materials and method Pictures of hunting were collected from 28 temples of different districts of West Bengal by the author who travelled personally to and photographed extensively the temples mentioned. (A list of the temples in the present series is given in the Appendix). These photographs were then searched and the hunting scenes were segregated and analyzed. Scheme of study The discussion will be under following headings : The vast majority of the pictures used for temple decoration in Bengal is Bas-relief of terracotta plaques, but other media like stucco, stone-work and wood-carving are also seen. Hunter in terracotta bas-relief; Jorbangla temple; Vishnupur, Bankura Hunting scene; stone carving; Shiva temple; Ganpur, Birbhum Tiger hunters; carving on wooden door; Shiva temple; Bankati-Ajodhya; Paschim Bardhaman Though the vast majority of hunters depicted in hunting scenes in the temples of the present series are native Indians, there are some European hunters too. Some examples of the latter can be seen in Gopinath temple of Dashghara, district Hooghly (AD), Radhakrishna temple of Ula-Birnagar, district Nadia (AD) and Krishnachandraji temple of Kalna, district Purva Bardhaman (AD). Indian Hunter; terracotta; Raghunath Shiva temple; Ghurisha, Birbhum European hunters; terracotta; Radha Krishna temple, Ula-Birnagar, Nadia Hunters are depicted either on foot, or on some mounts. However, vehicles like chariot or cart are not found in hunting scenes in this series. A. Hunters on foot can be seen in Nabaratna Shiva temple of Panchthupi, district Murshidabad; Radhakrishna temple of Ula-Birnagar, district Nadia; Ramchandra temple of Guptipara, district Hooghly; Charbangla temple of Baronagar, district Murshidabad, Krishnachandraji temple of Kalna, district Purva Bardhaman etc. In the last mentined temple, there is a scene where European soldiers on foot are hunting a tiger with lance  or spear. B. Hunters on mounts : Two animals as mounts of hunters are depicted in different temples - horse (mainly) and elephant. i) Horse : Horses are depicted in majority of hunting scenes as the mount of the hunters, signifying that horses were the preferred mount for hunting at those time. Examples can be found in a large number of temples including Rajrajeshwar temple of  Dwarhatta, district Hooghly, Radhakrishna temple of Ula-Birnagar, district Nadia; Charbangla temple of Baronagar, district Murshidabad ; Gopinath temple of Dashghara, district Hooghly, Lakshmi Janardan temple of Debipur, district Purva Bardhaman; Dolmancha of Talchinan, district Hooghly; Ramchandra temple of Guptipara, district Hooghly; Raghabeshwar temple of Dignagar, district Nadia; Jorbangla temple of Vishnupur, district Bankura etc. ii) Elephant : Elephants as mounts of hunters can be seen in some temples. Examples are Rajrajeshwar temple of  Dwarhatta, district Hooghly, Ananta basudeva temple of Bansberia, district Hooghly; Gangeshwar temple of Baronagar, district Murshidabad; Ramchandra temple of Guptipara, district Hooghly; Raghunath Shiva temple of Ghurisha, district Birbhum etc. European hunters on foot; Krishnachandraji temple; Kalna, Purva Bardhaman Indian hunter on foot; Pancharatna Shiva temple; Panchthupi; Murshidabad Hunter on horseback; Dolmancha; Talchinan, Hooghly Hunter on elephant; Banbishalakshi temple; Purushottampur, Hooghly The following weapons are depicted in the hunting scenes of the present series : 1) Spear or Lance : This was perhaps the most favored weapon of the hunters, as it was depicted in almost all the temples. Hunters are seen using spear riding horses, riding elephants and while hunting on foot. Animals like tiger, lion, bear and deer are all shown being hunted by spears. These can be seen in temples like : a) Hunter on foot carrying Lance or spear : Nabaratna Shiva temple of Panchthupi, district Murshidabad (2 scenes); Krishnachandraji temple of Kalna, district Purva Bardhaman etc. In the last mentioned temple, there is a scene where European soldiers on foot are hunting a tiger with lance or spear. b) Hunter on horse : Gopinath temple of Dashghara, district Hooghly, Lakshmi Janardan temple of Debipur, district Purva Bardhaman; Dolmancha of Talchinan, district Hooghly, Ramchandra temple of Guptipara, district Hooghly; Raghabeshwar temple of Dignagar, district Nadia; Siva temple of Bankati-Ajodhya, district Paschim Bardhaman (this is an example of hunting scene in wood carving) etc. c) Hunters on elephant with spear : This can be seen in temples like Ananta Basudeva of Bansberia, district Hooghly and Rajrajeshwar temple of Dwarhatta, district Hooghly. 2) Sword : Sword is the second most common hunting weapon depicted in the decorations of Bengal temples. Animals hunted by sword in this pictures include tiger and lion. Deer, being very fast runners, are very difficult to hunt by sword, and are thus logically excluded. Sword is shown to be used by : a) Hunters on foot with swords : This is seen from  hunting scene in Ramchandra temple of Guptipara, district Hooghly. b) Hunter on elephant with sword : this can be seen in Raghunath Shiva temple, Ghurisha, district Birbhum. c) Hunters on horse with sword : This can be seen in several temples, some of which are Ramchandra temple of Guptipara, district Hooghly; Shiva temple of Supur, district Birbhum; Radha Krishna temple of Ula-Birnagar, district Nadia; Charbangla temple of Baroinagar, district Murshidabad; Gopinath temple of Dashghara, district Hooghly etc. 3) Dagger : Though daggers, being short in length, are not suitable for hunting, yet there are some pictures in some temples in the present series which depict hunting by daggers. Examples are : i) Hunter with dagger on foot : this can be seen in Ramchandra temple of Guptipara, district Hooghly and Charbangla temple of Baronagar, district Murshidabad. ii) Hunter with dagger on elephant can be seen in Gangeshwar temple of Baronagar, district Murshidabad. Animals hunted by daggers include tiger (Gangeshwar and Ramchandra temples) and bear (Charbangla temple). 4) Muskets : As already mentioned, firearms were introduced in hunting during in India during the reign of Mughal emperor Akbar (1556 - 1605 CE). So, it is not unnatural that hunters with firearms will be depicted in temple decorations of Bengal. In keeping with this tradition, we see hunters with muskets in the decorations of some temples like Charbangla temple of Baronagar, district Murshidabad and Krishnachandraji temple of Kalna, district Purva Bardhaman etc. 5) Satnoli : The term translates into “seven tubes”. It is a special weapon used to hunt birds by the traditional bird hunter tribes (Pakhmara) of the western parts of West Bengal. It consists of seven tube-like segments of bamboo. The bird hunters make a long weapon by joining the separate segments before hunting a bird. This is depicted in 2 temples of the present series, viz. Radhavinod temple of Joydev-Kenduli, district Birbhum and Lakshmi Janardan temple of Ghurisha, district Birbhum. Hunter with spear on horseback; terracotta; Raghabeshwar temple, Dignagar, Nadia Hunter with spear on elephant; terracotta; Rajrajeshwar temple; dwarhatta, Hooghly Hunter on foot with spear; Nabaratna Shiva temple; Panchthupi, Murshidabad Hunter with sword; terracotta; Ramchandxra temple; Guptipara, Hooghly Hunter with dagger; terracotta; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Hunter with sword and dagger; Ramchandra temple; Guptipara, Hooghly Hunters with musket; terracotta; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad A bird hunter using Satnali for hunting birds; terracotta; Radha Vinod temple; Joydev-Kenduli, Birbhum From ancient times, man has used some domesticated animals in hunting (not as mounts). The commonest animal thus used is the dog. Dogs as hounds are a common accompanying assistant to the hunters. There are several breeds of hounds who are specialized for hunting. They are used for finding, chasing, hunting and collecting the hunted games. Besides dogs, big animals like cheetahs are sometimes used for this purpose. The other common animal-assistant in hunting is the birds, mostly hawks and falcons which were and are still used in bird-hunting. Now let us see how this is reflected in temple decorations in Bengal. In the temples of the present series, we see dogs accompanying hunters in many temples. In one or two cases, the animal accompanying the hunter seems to a cheetah (with tails longer than that of a dog), but we cannot find a single example of birds like hawk or falcon accompanying the hunters. Dogs accompanying hunters are depicted in many temples like Charbangla temple of Baronagar, Jorbangla temple of Vishnupur, Gopinath temple of Dashghara, Lakshmi Janardan temple of Debipur, Dolmancha of Talchinan, Ramchandra temple of Guptipara, Raghabeshwar temple of Dignagar, Ananta Basudeva temple of Bansberia, Madanmohan temple of Vishnupur, Shiva temple of Baidyapur, Jorbangla Kali temple of Itanda etc. Cheetah as a hound : In a hunting scene from Ramchandra temple of Guptipara, district Hooghly, we can see an animal accompanying the hunter with a very long tail and a face which is broader than that of a standard hound dogs depicted in other hunting scenes. Most probably it is a cheetah. Hunter with dog; terracotta; Jorbangla temple; Vishnupur, Bankura Hunter with a cheetah (possibly); terracotta; Ramchandra temple; Guptipara, Hooghly These include animals and birds, we do not find any aquatic animals (like fish or crocodiles) being hunted in any of the temples of the present series. A. Animals : These include tigers and deer mostly, but other animals like bears, rhinoceros and lions are also seen in few cases. Tiger and rhinoceros hunting are described separately below. Bear hunting; terracotta; Jorbangla; Visnupur, Bankura Bear hunting; terracotta; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Bear hunting; terracotta; Nabaratna Shiva temple; Panchthupi, Murshidabad Deer hunting; terracotta; Madanmohan temple; Vishnupur, Bankura Deer hunting; terracotta; Rajrajeshwar temple; Dwarhatta, Hooghly Deer hunting; terracotta; Lakshmi Janardan temple; debipur, Purva Bardhaman Deer hunting; terracotta; Nabaratna Shiva temple; Panchthupi, Murshidabad Hunting lion; terracotta; Gopinath temple; Dashghara, Hooghly Hunting lion; terracotta; Jorbangla Kali temple; Itanda, Birbhum A. Tiger hunting : The Royal Bengal (or simply the Bengal) tiger constitutes about 80% of tiger population and it is found mostly in India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar. Tiger is a big game animal, and it was (and still is) hunted for prestige and trophy, though rarely man-eater tigers were/are hunted as Therapeutic hunting. Historically, tigers were hunted by the royals as well as the common Shikari. During the British period, European hunters were very fond of tiger hunting, and the Indian princes and Maharajahs followed their footsteps. Tigers were hunted on foot, on horseback, on elephant-back and from Machans (a raised platform made of wood and bamboo). This causes a sharp decline in the tiger population of India. Conservation work is trying its best to restore the tiger population in India. There are many tiger reserves in India now like Sundarban, Ranthambhor, Bandhabgarh, Kanha, Bandipur, Jim Corbett Natinal Park, Sariska, Dampa, Melghat, Tadoba, Bor, Mundanthurai, Nagarjunasagar-Srisailam, Nagarhole, Palamau,Panna, Satpura etc. B. Tiger hunting in decorations of Bengal temples : Many temples have tiger hunting scenes in their wall-decorations. In these scenes, tigers are seen being hunted by hunters on horseback mostly, but hunters on foot (in Krishnachandraji temple of Kalna) and on elephant-back (in Gangeshwar temple of Baronagar) are also depicted. Some of the temples with tiger hunting scenes with hunters on horseback are Rajrajeshwar temple of Dwarhatta, Raghunath Shiva temple of Ghurisha, Jorbangla temple of Vishnupur, Radha krishna temple of Ula-Birnagar, Charbangla temple of Baronagar, Ananta basudeva temple of Bansberia, Shiva temple of Baidyapur, Ramchandra temple of Guptipara, Shiva temple of Ganpur and Shiva temple of Bankati-Ajodhya. Interestingly, among these temples, all but two have terracotta work. The two exceptions are : i) Shiva temple of Ganpur, district Birbhum which has bas-relief work in stone; ii) Shiva temple of Bankati-Ajodhya, district Paschim Bardhaman which has two tiger hunting scenes in wood engraving. Tiger hunters This is an interesting subject. Though in majority of tiger hunting scenes show Indian hunters (Shikari) as evident by their dresses and head-gears, the tiger hunting scene from Krishnachandraji temple of Kalna shows European hunters (as evident by their dresses and hats). Tiger hunting : hunter on horseback; terracotta; Rajrajeshwar temple; Dwarhatta, Hooghly Tiger hunting : hunter on elephant; tewrracotta; Raghunath Shiva temple; Ghurisha, Birbhum Tiger hunting in wood engraving; Shiva temple; Ajodhya-Bankati, Paschim Bardhaman Tiger hunting on foot; terracotta, Charbangla temple, Baronagar, Murshidabad Tiger hunting by Europeans carrying musket; terracotta; Krishnachandraji temple; Kalna, Purva Bardhaman This another highly interesting topic, and requires elaboration. Though at present wild rhinos are found only in the reserve forests of North Bengal (mainly Jaldapara and Gorumara forests), even in the 19th century rhinos (both single horned Indian rhinoceros and double-horned Sumatran rhinoceros) were found in the Sundarban area. The ""Dhali"" community of southern Bengal got their name from their using ""Dhal"" (shield) made from the tough hide of rhinoceros. Dhalis were part of the soldiers of King Pratapaditya. There are historical evidence that in 1868, a wild Rhinoceros was captured from Chittagang area (present day Bangladesh) and it was sold to the London Zoo. In 1876, a wild rhinoceros was killed by firearms in Comilla (present day Bangladesh). In the end of 1899 or early 1900 AD, a wild rhinoceros was killed by a hunter named Kalachand (ref : www.jagonews24.com). So, the presence of rhinoceros and rhinoceros-hunting in the decorations of Bengal temples is totally justified. In the present series, we can see scenes of rhinoceros hunting and rhinoceros attacking men from two temples, both from Baronagar, district Murshidabad. They are Charbangla temple (1760 AD) and Gangeshwar temple (1753 AD). The construction dates of these two temples are significant. Both temples were constructed in mid-18th century, when rhinoceros were present not only in northern parts of Bengal, but also in Sundarban area of southern Bengal. So, it will not be wrong to presume that rhinoceros-hunting was practised in Bengal in that era. Weapons used in these scenes are muskets. Rhinoceros hunting; terracotta; Charbangla temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Bird hunting is a popular tribal custom picked up by the gentry since ancient times. Birds are hunted mainly as source of food (meat and eggs), but also for their feathers and different body parts which were and still are used in traditional medicine. Besides this, birds are also hunted for their feathers and beaks (mainly Hornbill birds). But birds were/are also hunted as a sport or trophy. There is a diffuse group of tribal bird hunters in West Bengal who are loosely called “Pakhmara” (literally “Bird killer”). As already stated, they commonly a weapon called “Satnali” to hunt birds. (Ref : Bird hunting tribe of Bengal - The Pakhmaras; https://www.getbengal.com). It is such an interesting subject that it deserves a complete article on it, and I’ll do exactly that in close future. Bird hunting; terracotta; Radha Vinod temple; Joydev-Kenduli, Birbhum Some temples have scenes in their decorations which depict wild animals attacking hunters. Examples are : Bear attacks a man; terracotta; Lakshmi Janardan temple; Ghurisha, Birbhum Tiger attacking the hunter; terracotta; Ramchandra temple; Guptipara, Hooghly An elephant attacking a man; terracotta; Gangeshwar temple; Baronagar, Murshidabad Terracotta panel showing men are being attacked by a rhinoceros, a bear and a tiger; Gangeshwar temple; Baroinagar, Murshidabad Two tigers mauling a man; terracotta; Jorbanglka temple; Vishnupur, Bankura. A terracotta panel from Rajrajeshwar temple, Dwarhatta, district Hooghly shows two men are carrying a dead deer hanging from a pole. Interestingly, this is the system by which game animals were and still are carried by the hunters and their assistants in India. Two hunters carrying dead game animal; terracotta; Rajrajeshwar temple; Dwarhtta; Hooghly In any analytical study, the negative findings are equally important as the positive findings. In other words, what is not there is equally not less important than what is there. In the present analytic study of hunters and hunting scenes from the decorations of Bengal temples, this principle stands true. We’ve discussed what are there (the positive findings), now we’ll focus our attention to some negative findings, i.e. what are missing. Let us see these. Terracotta panel showing a boat in a river with crocodiles in water; Rajrajeshwar temple; Dwarhatta, Hooghly Terracotta panel showing a boat in a river with crocodiles in water; Krishnachandraji temple; Kalna, Purva Bardhaman Hunters and hunting scenes in temple decoration in Bengal is an interesting subject. The number of temples in the present series is small (28), so this study can be said a Pilot Study at the best. Hopefully, some researches will pursue this sort of studies with larger series.

25,"Japan: Courts and Culture – Exhibition at The Queen’s Gallery, Buckingham Palace",art," Frances has many years' experience writing about exhibitions in art galleries and museums. Hexagonal Jars and Lids. 1670-1690. – Image by Frances Spiegel (2022) with permission from RCT. All rights reserved. Japan: Courts and Culture at The Queen’s Gallery 8 April 2022-12 March 2023 The Royal Collection Trust (RCT) includes several hundred remarkable examples of Japanese art, many received as gifts from the Japanese imperial family. The collection, one of the finest in the western world, is important because of the unique provenance and outstanding quality of the items. It is the result of the fascinating diplomatic, artistic and cultural relationship between Japan and Britain over a period of more than 300 years. Japan: Courts and Culture explores that relationship from first contact in 1613 to Japan’s very modern diplomatic relationship in the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. The exhibition features fine examples of porcelain, woodcut prints, exquisite fans, painted and embroidered screens and lacquer as well as samurai armour and weaponry. Speaking recently, Rachel Peat, curator of the exhibition, said: “It’s a real opportunity to see first-hand the precious materials and intricate techniques which have so profoundly shaped British taste and which helped forge a lasting relationship between the two nations. We hope visitors will enjoy discovering the worlds of ritual, honour and artistry that link the courts and cultures of Britain and Japan to this day.” In a display of so many treasures it’s extremely difficult to choose “the highlights”, but the hexagonal Kakiemon-style jars and Lids from Arita, Hizen Province (shown above), really stand out. In the late seventeenth century Queen Mary II acquired many jars like these and displayed them at Hampton Court Palace. As a result, they are known as ‘Hampton Court vases’. The jars have rounded shoulders, straight neck and six curved sides tapering to the foot. They are decorated with birds and women in Kakiemon-style with glazed enamels of blue, red, green and yellow. It’s unusual to get a matching pair where the designs are symmetrical when displayed side-by-side. The vases were not made on a potter’s wheel. Instead, they were made in separate panels and then carefully assembled. This was a labour-intensive process and luxury items like these were not made after the eighteenth century. Embroidered Folding Screen 1880-1897. Image by Frances Spiegel (2022) with permission from RCT. All rights reserved. Japan: Courts and Culture at The Queen’s Gallery 8 April 2022-12 March 2023 Another piece that really impresses is this embroidered screen. Presented to Queen Victoria for her Diamond Jubilee in 1897, the four-leaf folding screen was a gift from the Emperor Meiji. From the 1800s screens like this were used to furnish the Imperial Palace in Tokyo and as diplomatic gifts to foreign rulers and sovereigns. The screen dates from 1880-1897 and shows the mountainous landscape of Arashiyama near Kyoto which rocks and trees and a foaming river. The brightly coloured silk used for the river stands out among mainly muted colours, making the water appear to gush out of the frame. The name of the actual artist is not known but the screen probably came from one of the three most important Kyoto firms of Nishimura, Iida and Kawashima, all used by the Japanese imperial family from the 1880s. Below each of the four panels is a smaller panel embroidered on a black background in silk with green and cream leaves and red berries. On the back of the screen is a silk painted scene of ducks in flight. Chinese Junk – Model Boat. Image by Frances Spiegel (2022) with permission from RCT. All rights reserved. Japan: Courts and Culture at The Queen’s Gallery 8 April 2022-12 March 2023 This piece is a table caster which may have been purchased by King George IV. It was originally one of a pair but the second no longer exists. The boat combines Chinese and Japanese elements. It is based on a Chinese boat called a junk but is decorated with Japanese gold lacquer. The junk has a clockwork mechanism that allowed the mobile display of condiments at the dinner table. Originally, the junk would have had wheels. The sides of the caster are decorated with gold lacquer showing sprays of peonies, chrysanthemums and camellias. Below the flowers two dragons face each other. Japan: Courts and Culture is at The Queen’s Gallery, Buckingham Palace, 8 April 2022 – 12 March 2023. Further information about the exhibition can be obtained from Royal Collection Trust. There is also a fully illustrated book published by the RCT to support the exhibition. © 2022 Frances Spiegel"
26,Fastenings - Types & It's Applications (Part Two),art," Although they are associated with clothing, many buttons are eminently suitable for soft furnishings. They are made from plastic, wool, leather and shell, or maybe fabric-covered. Buttons can be both functional and decorative. They are not very strong, so use them where they will not receive a great deal of strain: bedlinen and scatter cushions are ideal. 1. Marking Up Mark up for buttons and buttonholes, and make holes. Check the button position through the hole, and secure a thread. 2. Stitching On Sew on the button, making stitches through the hole in the shank. Make 12 to 14 such stitches before fastening off. Sew parallel stitches over a pin under the button. Take out the pin. Wind the thread around the slack to form a shank. Fasten off on wrong side. 1. Fitting Fabric Cut fabric to cover the button and overlap. Lay the button face down on the wrong side, and fold the fabric over the teeth. 2. Securing Snap the back of the button into place. These buttons are sold in a variety of types and sizes. Read the instructions - they vary. Position buttonholes and buttons very carefully to prevent openings from gaping. To give a buttonhole strength, make the fastening edge from a double thickness of the material and use a buttonhole stitch. Many sewing machines have a special attachment for sewing buttonholes. For an unusual finish, you can use rouleau loops instead of buttonholes. 1. Marking Up - Mark the centre of the buttonhole and align the button with the mark. Mark the width plus the thickness of the button, plus a little for oversewing the ends of the hole 2. Cutting Out Sew buttonhole stitch along either side of the mark and across the ends. Cut a hole at the end of the mark with an unpicker or small, sharp scissors. Cut open the hole. 1. Cutting Hole Mark the position and length of the buttonhole as required with tailor's chalk or vanishing ink. Use an unpicker or small, sharp pair of scissors to cut open the length of the buttonhole. 2. Starting Edge Thread a needle with buttonhole thread. Secure it at one end of the slit, if the hole is at a right angle to the edge, start at the end that will take the strain. Oversew across the end. 3. Stitching Edges Working in buttonhole stitch, sew closely along one side of the buttonhole. At the far end, oversew again. Work along the second side, and fasten off. First, sew the buttons in place on one edge of the opening. Pin the rouleau strip in place along the other edge of the opening, folding it to form loops. Adjust the loops to fit the buttons, size and spacing. Tack and oversew the rouleau in place. Ideal for strength and invisibility, metal and plastic zips are available in a wide variety of weights, lengths, and colours. They are suitable for all but the most lightweight furnishings. Metal zips are the strongest, but plastic zips are available in a wider range of colours and are also more flexible, although you must take care not to damage them when ironing. 1. Positioning Select a zip for the fabric, taking wear and tear into consideration. Make sure that the zip is long enough for the task. Lay the zip on the seam line on the wrong side of the fabric, and mark the point where each line ends. 2. Sewing In Pin, tack and sew the fabric pieces at both ends of the zip, starting at the fabric edges and stopping at the pin markers. Tack the opening for the zip between the pins closed along the seam line, and press the seam allowance open. 3. Pinning Zip Lay the fabric right side down with the seam pressed open. Place the zip right side down on the tacked part of the seam. Make sure that it is placed centrally, with the teeth lying on the join. Pin and tack the zip in place. 4. Sewing on Zip Turn the fabric right side up. Using the zip attachment on a sewing machine, sew through all the layers of fabric around the zip. Keep the stitching about 8 mm from the zip teeth. Remove the tacking stitches. 1. Tacking in Place Follow steps 1 and 2 for a centered zip. Place the zip on the tacked section, and set to one side so that the teeth are on the seam allowance. Pin and tack in place. 2. Sewing on Zip Turn the fabric right side up. Using the zip attachment on a sewing machine, stitch through all the layers of fabric around the zip. Follow the tacking stitches cloesly. 3. Finished Zip Take out the tacking stitches. An offset zip is less visible than a centered one, so this is a particularly useful way of hiding a zip that does not match the fabric. 1. Placing Sew seam with allowances wider than the zip. Leave an opening for zip at seam end. Fold both allowances to one side. Lay fabric right side up, and fold back top piece. Pin, tack, and sew one side of the zip, right side up on the bottom allowance. 2. Second Side Lay the top fabric piece over the zip, and line up the seam allowances. Turn the fabric pieces over. Pin and tack free edge of zip to free seam allowance. Turn right side up again, open zip, and sew along the tacked edge of zip. 3. Finished Zip Seam allowances both lie to one side of seam, with the zip between them. The zip is completely concealed beneath the top seam allowance. This method is generally used for loose covers on chairs and sofas. 1. Piped Side Lay one edge of the open zip right side down on the inside of the allowance of the piped edge. Pin, tack and sew 3 mm from the zip teeth, using the zip attachment on a sewing machine. 2. Plain Side Close the zip. Turn back the seam allowances of both edges. Lay the unpiped edge on the zip to meet the piping. Pin, tack, and sew the zip in place.

27,Fastenings - Types & It's Applications (Part One),art," A cover that has to be removed from time to time for cleaning needs a suitable fastening. Fabrics for removable covers range from robust furnishings materials suitable for a sofa to fine cotton and delicate textiles used for bed linen and cushions, so take care to match the fastening to the type of soft furnishing. For a heavy-duty closure, use zip or robust hooks and eyes. More lightweight, decorative fasteners include fabric ties and buttons. Hide press studs and velcro tabs or strips within a seam. When a cover needs only infrequent cleaning, consider slip stitching one seam, and opening it when necessary. Velcro is also known as ""touch-and-close"" fastening. Two strips of material, one covered with tiny hooks, the other with small loops, adhere to each other when brought together. Although easy to apply and use, it is too stiff for lightweight or medium-weight materials. Continuous lengths of several widths and colours, and spots of various sizes are available. 1. First Side The seam allowance must be wider than the spot. Mark sites for the spots and pin half a spot to one allowance. Hand sew in place. 2. Second Side On the opposite allowance, align the second half of the spot with the first. Pin and sew in place. Space spots 5 cm to 10 cm apart. 1. First Strip Use a tape slightly narrower than the seam allowance. Place one half on the allowance, and pin, tack, and sew it in place. 2. Second Strip Pin the other half of the tape on the opposite allowance. Check the alignment, and adjust if necessary. Tack and sew in place. Press studs are available in both metal and plastic, and in a limited variety of colour and sizes. They are sold either loose, to be stitched or individually, or mounted to a tape, which is more convenient for long openings. Although they are a simple means of fastenings two edges together, press studs are not very sturdy and will pop open under any moderate strain. They are suitable for bed linen and scatter cushions, where they can be unobtrusively mounted. 1. The Socket Mark positions 6 mm from the edge with pins every 5 cm to 10 cm. Place the socket of the stud on the seam underlap, and work a few stitches through each hole. 2. Aligning Halves Place the ball half of the press stud on the overlapping fabric in the position marked by the pin. Check its alignment with the socket half, and sew in position. 1. First Strip The seam allowance must be wider than the strip. Turn under the raw edges on the ends of the strip, position it on the seam allowance, and pin in place. 2. Aligning Strips To align the two strips accurately, lay the second one on the first and close the studs. Pin the second strip in place, working from the back, and turn under the raw ends. 3. Sewing on Strips Open the press studs and tack and sew both edges of the strips. Work in the same direction each time to prevent puckering, and use the zip attachment on a sewing machine. Hand-sewn metal hooks and eyes are a simple fastening for edge-to-edge or overlapping fabric pieces. These easy-to-hide fasteners are available in a number of different sizes, and are sold either loose or mounted on a plastic strip. They are strong enough to take quite considerable strain, making them particularly suitable for furniture covers. 1. The Eyes Mark positions for the fasteners with pins every 5 cm to 10 cm. Hold the eye in place, and sew five or six times through each metal loop. 2. The Hooks Check the hooks' alignment. Stitch over the hook neck and through the loops. If the seam allowances gape, slipstitch the edges. 1. First Side The seam allowance must be wider than the strip. Neaten the raw edges of the strips. Place the eye strip on the allowance, and pin, tack, and sew in place. Use a zip attachment if necessary. 2. Second Strip Fasten the hooks and eyes to align the strips. Pin the hooked strip from the back, undo the hooks and tack. Sewing through both layers of fabric will leave visible stitching. If sewing through one layer only, slip stitch the seam allowance to prevent gaping. Fabric ties make an unusual change from ready-made fasteners. Flat fabric ties are easily made up and attached, and make a decorative fastener for light-weight furnishings such as bed linen and scatter cushions. Rouleau strips are narrow tubes made up from bias strips, which can be tied or mounted as loops along an opening as an alternative to buttonholes. 1. Cutting Ends Cut the length and twice the width of the tie, plus 1 cm all around. Fold the edges of the long sides to the wrong side by 1 cm and press. Cut across the corners diagonally, fold the ends down to the wrong side, and press. 2. Sewing Fold the fabric in half lengthways, wrong sides together. Pin, tack, and sew all the sides, about 2 mm from the edge. Make up the other tie. Pin one end of each tie to each side of the opening, sew in place and tie into a bow or knot. 1. Sewing a Tube Fold the required length of bias strip, use a strip that is 2.5 cm to 3 cm wide, in half lengthways, right sides together, press, and sew 6 mm from the edge. 2. Attaching Thread Thread a large, blunt needle with a strong thread or fine twine. Secure the thread to one end of the rouleau and push the needle into the opening of the tube. 3. Turning Tube Work the needle and thread along the tube and out at the other end. The end of the rouleau will follow: take hold of it and pull the tube right side out. 4. Finishing Strip Snip the thread of the tube, and tuck the raw edges of the rouleau back to the inside. Oversew the ends neatly with small stitches to finish off.

28,Basic Sewing Designs and Techniques: Frills & Pleats,art," Frills are most often used on bedlinen and scatter cushions. Use single frills for a delicate effect, double frills for a robust finish, or for furnishings with different fabrics on each side. Frills need from one-and-a-half to three times their finished length in fabric: gather heavy fabric gently, light ones more tightly. Pleats, which need two-and-a-half to three times their finished length in fabric, give a formal look. Use tailors tacks to align pieces, and allow extra fabric at corners. Cat a strip of fabric to the width and length required, allowing extra fabric for the seam you choose for joins. Hem the bottom edge by hand or machine, as shown in the image. Neaten the top edge of the fabric and gather it using, one of the methods shown here. Cut a strip of fabric to the length required and double the finished depth plus 3 cm. Join lengths as necessary and press the seams flat. Fold the strip in half lengthways, wrong sides together, and press. Gather the fabric through both edges. 1. Gathering Stitch Use this method for medium-to-heavyweight fabrics and double frills. Using a strong thread, tie a knot in the end that will not pull through the fabric. On the seam line, make stitches as if tacking, adjusting the length to suit. 2. Gathering Fabric When you reach the end, hold the free end of the thread firmly. Ease the fabric towards the knotted end to the correct length and fullness, and knot the free end. Even the gathers out, and pin and tack in place. 1. Long Stitching Set the machine to the longest stitch. Slightly increase the top tension to make the gathers easy to pull up. Sew 1 to 1.5 cm from the edge, leaving the edge free. 2. Gathering Fabric Run a second row of stitches close to the first. Pull up the free ends of the thread, making sure that the secured ends stay in place. Knot the gathering threads. 1. Securing Thread Cut a piece of strong thread or fine twine to the length of the fabric band and lay it on the band about 1.5 cm from the raw edge. Carefully zigzag over it. 2. Making Gathers Stitch over one end of the strong thread several times, and gather the fabric by holding the free end and easing the fabric along towards the secured end. 1. Making a Sample Decide on the size of the pleat, make a strip of four or five pleats, and pin and press it. Make the pleats deep enough to give a firm edge, but do not overlap them, except at corners. Measure the length of the sample section. 2. Calculating Lengths Unpin and measure the strip. Divide the length of edging you need by the length of the pleated strip. Multiply this by the length of the sample piece when unpleated. The result is the length of fabric needed. 3. Marking Pleats Make up the edging, joining with plain or flat fell seams as required. Mark up the wrong side with lines for folding as you join the lengths, ensuring that joins will be hidden in the folding back section of a pleat. 4. Stitching Pleats Fold the pleats o the lines and pin them. When all the pleats are pinned, tack along the seam line about 1.5 cm from the top edge. Press the strip sew along the seam line and remove the tacking stitches. 1. Marking Up Box pleats take three times the final length in fabric, so multiply the length to be edged by three for the fabric needed. Mark lines for pleating on the wrong side of the strip. 2. Making Up Fold and pin the fabric on the marked lines to form the box pleats. To secure the pleats, tack along the seam line, and press and sew the pleated strip. 3. Turning Corners At a corner, fold the pleated strip, and attach as necessary. The corner fold should run down the middle of a pleat. Finished box pleats make a very formal decoration. Bows - A bow can either be used as a simple trimming or act as a fastener. Cut a strip of fabric to the length and double the finished width required, adding 2 cm each way for seam allowances. Fold the strip in half lengthways. Pin, tack, and sew 1 cm from the raw edge. Leave a gap in the centre of the seam on the long edge to allow for turning the right side out, and sew across the ends diagonally. Snip the seam allowances at the corners, turn right side out, and press. Slipstitch the opening close and tie in a bow. Fringes, colourful ribbons and cords, and delicate lace can be found in department stores and haberdashers. Allow for seams, corners, and neatening, and check that trimmings are preshrunk and colourfast if they will be washed. If a trimming needs two rows of machine sewing, sew the same way both times, to prevent puckering. 1. Applying Fringe If there is a line of ""stay"" stitches on the fringe edge, leave them in. Lay the fringe face down on the right side of the fabric, with the part you will sew through on the seam line. Pin and tack in place, butting the ends at any joins. 2. Stitching In Lay the second panel of fabric right side down on top of the first piece and the fringe, aligning the edges. Pin and take through all three layers along the seam line. Sew along the tacking line, and remove the tacking. Turn right sides out. 3. Finishing Seam If necessary, remove the manufacturer's stay stitches from the fringe by unfastening them at one end and gently pulling them out. Fringes can also be sewn on the edge of the fabric, or over the stitches of a hem, on the right side. 1. Folding Corners If lace is sewn into or onto an edge, it must be mitred at corners. Fold it back on itself, right sides together, and press. Fold one end back diagonally, and press. 2. Sewing Across Fold the top end flat on the other again. Pin, tack, and sew along the diagonal fold. Remove the tacks and trim the excess lace. Press, and neaten the edges. 1. Tacking Always mark the position and tack ribbon first. Needles mark some satin ribbon, so tack this at the edges. At corners, fold narrow ribbon, and mitre bulky ribbon as for lace. 2. Joining Ends At corners, diagonally fold one end under and sew it on top of the other. On a straight length, fold one end under by 1 cm, lay it over the other, and slipstitch.

29,Trimmings and Their Types: Binding & Piping,art," A variety of easy-to-apply edgings can be used to decorate furnishings. Trimmings are not structurally important, but when used with imagination, binding, piping, or frilled or pleated edging can add a smart and individual finish to curtains, cushions, bed linen, or blinds. In addition to these hand-finished edgings, there is also a host of ready-made trimmings available, such as braids, fringes, lace, ribbons, and cords, which can be stitched onto or into a seam or hem to provide extra colour and texture. These edgings add both decoration and strength to soft furnishings. binding is made from strips of fabric that are cut on the bias - a line diagonal to the grain, or wave - and will not pucker on curves. Ready-cut bias binding can be bought in a variety of weights and colours, but it is easy to cut strips from most kinds of fabric. Piped edging is made by covering a length of piping cord with strips of bias binding. A piping cord is sold in a range of diameters, suitable for different furnishings and weights of fabric. Always preshrink piping cord and bias strip by washing them. 1. Finding the Bias Check that the edges of the fabric are cut along the grain. Fold the fabric diagonally, so that one straight raw edge lies parallel to the adjacent edge. This fold is the bias line. Press in place. 2. Marking Strips Calculate the length and the width of binding needed - allow extra for joins. Rule measured lines parallel to the bias crease, marking with vanishing ink or tailor's chalk, and cut the strips. 3. Joining Strips Join stripes by placing them right sides together at right angles to each other. The raw edges and the straight gains should align. Pin, tack if necessary, and sew 5 mm from the raw edges. 4. Trimming Joins Open the seam and press it flat. You now have a bias strap with two corners sticking out at the seam. Snip off these corners. Join pieces as necessary to make up the required length of the strip. 1. Finding the Bias This is a useful way of making a long length of bias binding. Take a rectangle of fabric with straight edges, and fold one short side down diagonally to meet the adjacent edge. Press in place and cut along the bias line crease. 2. Sewing Pieces Lay the triangle on the other piece, right sides together and short straight edges aligned, so that when sewn they will form a diamond. Sew the pieces together, using a plain seam with a 6 mm allowance, and press the seam open. 3. Marking Strips Lay the fabric right side up. Mark lines parallel to the bias across the whole of the fabric, spaced to the desired width for the finished strip. Use a straight edge and either vanishing ink or tailors chalk to mark the lines on the fabric. 4. Forming a Tube Fold the fabric right sides together, aligning the marked edges. Align the ends of the marked lines, offsetting them by one: they will form a spiral. Pin along these edges to form a tube: the seam will spiral. Turn the tube right side put. 5. Cutting a Strip Check that the bias lines on the pinned edges meet. Turn the tube inside out again, tack, and sew a plain flat seam 6 mm from the edge. Press the seam flat. Starting at one end, cut along the marked line in a continuous spiral. 1. Measuring Cord Choose a cord and wash to preshrink. Measure around it and add 3 cm for seam allowances: this is the width of the bias strip that is required. Cut a strip to this width and the required length. 2. Covering Cord Lay the cord along the centre of the wrong side of the bias strip. Fold the strip over the cord, and pin and tack. Sew close to the cord, using a zip attachment if you use a machine. 1. Pinning Piping Cut and cover the required length of piping cord - add 10 cm for joining lengths if necessary. Lay the piping on the right side of one piece of fabric, with the raw edges aligning. Pin in place, snipping the seam allowance at corners, and tack. 2. Sewing In Lay the second piece of fabric on top of the piece with the piping attached, right sides together, and raw edges aligning. The piping will be sandwiched between them. Tack and sew through all the layers close to the cord, using the zip attachment. 1. Thinning Cord Sew the piping to the right side of one piece of fabric. Allow a 2.5 cm overlap, and leave 5 cm of each end free. Open a few stitches on each end to reveal the cord. Unravel the ends, and cut half the strands from each. 2. Binding Cord Twist the ends of the cord together and bind with thread. With the piping ends flat and the wrong side up, fold one end to the wrong side by 6 mm. Lay the other end of the binding on top of it and trip the overlap to 1.5 cm. 3. Sewing Join Fold the overlapping ends of the binding around the cord. Sew along the seam line, over the join, securing the piping to the fabric. Slipstitch the join in the binding. To disguise a join, make it at a seam or in a central position on a panel. 1. Matching Up This is the neatest way to join piping. Sew the piping to the right side of one fabric piece, with a 10 cm overlap free and with the seam unpicked. Fold back the corner plus 6 mm of one end of the bias strip diagonally, on its straight grain, and press. 2. Pinning Bias Strip Lay the other end of the bias strip on top of the folded end. Make sure that the straight grain of the two ends matches, and that both ends lie flat. Carefully pin the two pieces of bias strip together along the fold in the bottom end. 3. Joining Ends Tack and sew along the pinned fold line, and trim off the excess fabric from the ends of the bias strips. Press the finished seam flat. Unravel the ends of the piping cord, cut strands away from each to thin them, and twist them together. 4. Finishing Join Stitch and bind the two ends of the piping cord together securely with a needle and thread. Fold the diagonally stitched bias strip over the bound piping cord ends. Tack the joined piping to the main fabric, using a zip attachment if machine sewing.

30,How and When to Use Fabric,art," BEFORE YOU BEGIN A SOFT furnishing technique, there are a few basic rules about handling and estimating amounts of fabric that you need to bear in mind. Cutting out fabric and joining panels are skills that are essential for almost every sewing project. When using a patterned fabric, you must match the design motifs between joins in panels, and between pieces of fabric that will be positioned side by side, as in the case of curtains. Before you cut out the fabric, assess the final appearance of the pattern by placing it against the object that it will cover and adjusting it until the design motif is positioned to your satisfaction. When you intend to make up a soft furnishing using seams in the fabric, as well as over panels of fabric. Use a patterned fabric, first consider the placement of the pattern in a tape measure to determine the size of the pattern repeat in relation to the item you are decorating, such as a window or a fabric. It is important to bear in mind the size of the pattern piece of furniture. You should match the pattern across any repeat when calculating the amount of fabric required. Manufacturers indicate the size of the pattern repeat on the selvage, or on a ticket attached to the roll, To establish the dimension of the pattern yourself, measure the distance between identical motifs. When making up a pair of furnishings to hang side by side, such as curtains, consider how the pattern matches across the drops. Make sure the pattern will match edge to edge when the curtains are closed. Cut out one curtain, then match the second to the first. When dressing a window with a curtain or blind, it may be impossible to avoid having a partial pattern repeat at the top or bottom. For a short curtain (left side of the image), place the partial pattern above the heading, and the full pattern at the bottom hem. A full-length curtain should have a full pattern at the heading (right side of the image) and a partial pattern along the bottom hem. Cutting out fabric is not difficult as long as you are careful and use a sharp pair of scissors. The most effective and comfortable method of cutting out fabric is to lay it out on a smooth, flat surface. You may need to use a clean floor as a worksurface when cutting out a large piece of fabric. To cut out fabric accurately, you will need the basic sewing kit. 1. Marking Fabric should be cut on the grain - along the weft threads and across the warp threads. Lay a set square at right angles to the selvage, and mark the cutting line using a vanishing-ink pen. 2. Cutting Fabric using a pair of dressmaker's scissors, cut steadily along the marked line. Some loosely woven fabrics can be cut following the gap made by pulling out a single thread. Notching Fabric: you may need to join lengths of fabric from the bottom edge to the top edge. To identify the direction of the lengths, and to continue any pile or shading from length to length, cut notches at the top edges. For most soft furnishing techniques, you will need to join when greater strength or flatness is desired, however, use panels of fabric to form a single, large piece. Most techniques require joins to be made with plain flat seams. When greater strength or flatness is desired, use flat fell seam or french seams. To join panels you, you will need matching thread and the basic sewing kit. 1. Tacking Panels after the fabric has been cut to size, layout the panels right sides together, and match their raw edges. Pin and tack the panels together, making a seam 1.5 cm (% in) from the edges. 2. Sewing Seam Remove the pins before machine sewing along the tacked line. Remove the tacking stitches after you have finished sewing. 3. Flattening Seam Press the seam allowance flat to smooth the finished join. When you are using patterned fabric, you will need to match the pattern repeat across seams. Before cutting out the fabric, decide where you want the pattern to lie when the soft furnishing is complete. Cut out the first piece, then cut the second piece by matching the pattern with reference to the first. Join panels after all of the required pieces of fabric have been cut out. To align the pattern repeat when joining fabric, you will need matching thread and the basic sewing kit. 1. Matching Pattern Along the edge of one panel, press a 1.5 cm (% in) seam allowance to the wrong side. Turn the panel over and place the pressed edge on top of the raw edge of the other panel, right sides up. Match the pattern over the panels. Keeping the edges together, fold the pressed panel onto the other panel,  right side facing. Pin the panels together along the fold line. 2. Stitching Panels Open out the panels and make sure the pattern remains aligned. Ladder stitch along the fold line to temporarily secure the panels together. Fold the panel's right sides together again, and sew a plain flat seam along the fold line. Remove the ladder stiiches. The placement of joined panels of fabric on or across large pieces of furniture or windows is as important as the positioning of pattern repeats. Place the fabric against the furniture or window, and decide what looks most appropriate for each type of furnishing and fabric. Across a window, place the fabric joins to the sides. For bed and table furnishings, center a complete fabric panel down the middle of the length of the furniture.

31,Hot Foiling Tips And Ideas,art," Paper crafting has been my passion since I was a child. I love sharing paper projects, ideas, and products. Get more from your paper. If you want to foil cards and embellishments for your papercraft projects, you have options to consider depending on your budget. There are machines that help you achieve beautiful, foiled images. But there are additional purchases in supplies and tools that come with these machines. Only you can decide which system is right for your needs. There are just a few things to know and understand about foiling so that you can get the most out of the products and supplies you have to create amazing projects. Toner Foiling Most folks have an inkjet printer in their homes. That is a printer that uses a cartridge filled with liquid ink. The liquid is spread out to create an image. A laser printer on the other hand, uses a powder to create the image. Foils will stick to the powder, but not the dry ink. The powder is a plastic material that is dry when the image is produced. Then when you put it through the laminator, the heat makes the plastic liquid again and the foil sticks to that liquid. So, if you have a laser printer, you are ready to go and create some foiling projects. If you are like me, you are not ready to commit to an additional printer, so we will show you how to foil without the expense of buying a second printer. What You Would Need Preprinted Toner Sheets If you do not have a laser printer, you can purchase preprinted toner sheets, usually in sets. With these sheets, all you have to do is cover the sheet with foil and run it through a laminator. They come in different sets like backgrounds, sentiments, images and more. Toner Foils When you are using toner sheets or designs, you want to make sure that you are using toner foils for the best results. These foils often come in both sheets and rolls. Toner Inks There are toner inks that you can use with your stamps to create stamped images that can then be foiled. You must, however, use a semi-gloss paper rather than card stock or the paper will rip. This technique works om images, but not sentiments. Foiling With A Laminator One of the most popular techniques is foiling with a laminator. The thing to understand about using this form of foiling is that you cannot use an inkjet printer to create a project with the laminator on heat foil. You must use a laser printer. Inkjet images will not work. Hot Foiling Foils The difference between toner foiling and hit foiling is that hot foiling has adhesive built into the foil sheets. There are many companies that sell hot foil machines and foils. There are so many projects that you can craft foil. Here are some of our personal favorites: On Greeting Cards On Scrapbook Pages Other Craft Foiling Projects The first material that would come to mind is of course paper. And that has been the most popular material to foil. But craft foiling goes far beyond that. With A Foil Quill There are many materials that the freestyle foil quill can craft foil on because you can craft foil freely. But the options do not stop there. You can foil on fabric with a foil quill that is used with a Cricut or other electronic cutting machine. Why not add foil to your vinyl projects? Since many folks like to work with vinyl, why not consider adding craft foil to your custom vinyl projects? Leather is another great option. You can cut leather or faux leather with many of these cutting machines so< why not add a touch of foil to your creations? I will bet that you never considered foiling wood. Machines like the Cricut Maker will actually cut very thin wood. So, it is possible to add foil to a wood project. Or you could use the Freestyle Pen to work on wood projects. With A Hot Foil System Materials can vary from system to system, but here are some generalized items you can foil with systems like the Glimmer Hot Foil System and The Gemini Hot Foil system: When you are considering a machine system, always make sure to research the item to make sure that it will fit the kinds of materials you like to use You always want your foil to be slightly bigger than your image or page. As the foil is going through thr laminator, it shrinks slightly from the pull of the rollers and the heating process. If the fil just barely fits the bottom of the image/page, you may get some cutoff from the process. You can create custom foiled projects with just a simple laminator For most hot foil techniques, you will need to use a laminator if you do not have some kind of hot foil system. There are different types of laminators with different features and sizes. You can decide the type of laminator depending on your specific needs. Price will be dependent on the features that you want and the size that you need. If you are just going to use the laminator for foiling, you can purchase a simple one for somewhere between $30-$40. If you want to use the laminator for other home or offices uses, you can get a unit with additional features. For hot foil projects, you would either use a toner sheet that can be plain or in a design. The toner sheet and the foil are run through the laminator in a parchment paper pouch. Then the foiled toner sheet can be cut with a die cutting machine or a punch, The heat from the laminator bonds the foil to the toner sheet. Some toner sheets have designs such as card front designs built into the toner sheet. the foil is then placed over the toner sheet and run through the laminator. You then have an instant card front design. Again, a parchment ""envelope"" is placed over the project. Another way to use a laminator with foil is to use a transfer gel. These most often are used with stencils. The stencil is applied to cardstock. The gel is rubbed onto the stencil and allowed to cure preferably overnight. Then the foil is placed over the cardstock and run through the laminator. Parchment is used to protect the parchment. If you want additional features, you can expect to pay a bit more for your laminator. A basic laminator is fine for most foiling techniques. No matter if you have a laser or an inkjet printer, you can use a laminator with your craft foil without using gel medium or toner sheets. Yes, you need to get a laminator. But in the long run, if you enjoy foiling this will be a cost saver. Remember, you must allow the laminator to heat for about 15-20 minutes before you use it. Otherwise, you will not get the expected results. With laser-printed images, the heat from the laminator reactivates the toner so the Deco-Foil sticks to the toner just as if you used an iron on the surface. For inkjet printers, the process is slightly different. You need to use a glue pen or any other glue that remains tacky when dry. You apply the glue to the image where you want the craft foil to be visible. Then you let it dry. Place the craft foil on the image where you want it. Then use the laminator. (you could also use a hot dry iron) No matter which printed image you use, you must always place a piece of parchment paper over the image before it is laminated. If you forget the parchment paper, the glue or toner could melt onto the carrier rollers and damage the laminator. I like to run the image through the laminator twice just to make sure that the craft foil adheres to the image, What To Look For In A laminator Speed If you are just doing occasional laminating for craft foiling, then speed probably is not too important. But if you are planning to use the laminator for other paper projects for home or office projects, then you may want to look at the speed of the machine you are looking at. Size Most paper projects are not too large, but size can be important if you want to foil larger projects. Chose the size that is right for your projects. Go the larger size if you have the choice. That gives you more options for future projects. Paper Jam Would be a feature that you should consider. Removing projects can be a messy situation. Paper jam features make your life easier if the unexpected happens. Temperature Settings Sometimes you can get better results with the option of changing your temperature settings. You can keep it simple or have the option. It is up to you. Automatic Shutoff Feature This is one option that you defiantly should consider. It is a safety option that can be important if you get distracted and forget to turn the laminator off.  As long as you have access to a laser printer, you can create foiled images with just a few steps Supplies Remember to always follow the manufacturer's directions for your laminator to get the best results Before you start foiling, you need to dust the image and the foil with a soft cosmetic brush, otherwise you will get spots and uneven foiling The Minc Foil Machine has features that are different from most laminators The Minc machine is a foiling machine marketed under the Heidi Swapp brand. They come in different sizes, depending on your needs. The smallest machine has a 6.5"" opening. The largest Minc has a 13 "" opening which is perfect if you want to do a lot of foiling for projects like scrapbook pages. The major difference between a laminator and a Minc machine is in the rollers. Both machines heat the project. But with the Minc machine there are a top and bottom roller that also squeeze the project as it is going through. So you get the heat, but you also get pressure too. The laminator on the other hand, does not use pressure. More Minc Information There is a release button in the back of the Minc should there be a mishap or problem with your project. The release button stops the pressure and you can pull out the problem. Time to throw the project and the carrier sheet away, There is no fix when that happens Other Minc Products There is a toner ink marker available in the Heidi Swap Brand. It is made to be used with Minc Foil. It has three replacement nibs and is compatible with the Minc Machine. You can add personal touches to all of your products. : First, write with the toner marker on the surface you wish to add foil. Second, place any color reactive foil (sold separately) over the writing. Third, run the foil through the MINC machine and voila! You have easily added the perfect, personal touch to your project. What Are Carrier Sheets Carrier are heat resistant plastic folded over that can be used with a Minc machine for foiling. Do not get these confused with laminator sheets which have adhesive the covers and bonds into the paper. Mark the difference in bold letters if you have both so you do not get them confused. They cannot be used in a laminator. If they get dirty, they can be cleaned with some acetone and a cotton ball. There are just a few things that you need to know when it comes to crafting foil. Why would it be important to know the differences in foils? The fact is not all foils are comparable with all techniques. Knowing the right foil to use for your project guarantees you a higher success rate. Textile Foil Textile foil is a thicker foil that is made for garments, but also gives perfectly good results on paper. Heat Foil In this case, a significant amount of heat is needed to get the foil to transfer onto your project. Some popular brands in heat foils include Papercraft Foil Rolls by Crafter's Companion, Glimmer Hot Foil Rolls by Spellbinders, and Foil Quill Rolls and Sheets by We R Memory Keepers. Reactive Transfer Foil With this foil, not only will you be using heat, but also a reactive agent as well. The reactive agents could include specialized transfer gel, transfer paint, or ink toner, you can transfer foil onto your project. These foils are generally used with a laminator or a Minc machine. Some of the more popular brands include Heidi Swapp MINC Reactive Foil, Therm O Web iCraft Deco Foil Transfer Sheets, and Gina K Therm O Web Fancy Foils. Adhesive Foil This foil uses liquid or sheet adhesive to attach the foil to the surface of your project. The foils transfer onto the tacky surface in the shape or design of the adhesive. Prima's Rub-On Foil Sheets, Ranger Ink Foil Sheets, and Re-Design Decor Foil Sheets are just some of the foils available in this category Cricut Adhesive Foil This is a foil that is manufactured for the Cricut It is used exclusively with the Cricut Foil Transfer Kit. It uses pressure to apply the foil onto your project. Avoid jagged edges when you can. Use a good pair of sharp scissors, a paper trimmer, or a rotary cutter. Whatever you use, make sure it has sharp edges All het foils require a significant amount of heat to get the foil permanently adhered to the base material What To Consider When Buying Hot Foil Most manufacturers of hot foil systems will also have hot foils available. for the most part, you can use other hot foils as well. The only exception to that is the Minc System where you have to buy the foil specific to that system. So, you may want to shop around and see which foils work best for you for the price. Your first consideration when buying a craft foil should be the quality of the foil itself. You want to buy the foil that works the best for your projects. Buying cheap foil but getting bad results is not a good bargain. The next thing to consider is how much foil are you getting for the price. You can of course figure out the cost per inch. In my view, rolls are better than sheets, because you can cut the exact amount that you need on a roll verse more waste on a sheet. Always figure in the cost of shipping if you are ordering online. Some websites offer free shipping if you order a set amount of product. If you are a prime member at Amazon, for the most part, your shipping is free. So, if one site is offering a better price, but shipping is high, you probably are not getting the best bargain. Deco Foils There are a lot of different craft foils on the market. Probably, the most well-known and appreciated is called Deco Foil. Deco Foil is a trade name for the foiling paper made by Therm-O-Web. It is a thin, shiny craft paper with a distinctive metallic look. Originally it was made to be used with a transfer gel medium which can be a bit on the expensive side, but well worth it. They can be bought individually or in bundles on Amazon. Generally, the bundles are a better buy Paper Craft Foil Rolls By Crafter's Companion Glimmer Hot Foil Rolls By Spellbinders You can purchase these as single units or in bundles four Foil Quill Rolls And Sheets By We Are Memory Keepers Sheets Rolls Minc Hot Foil    You can actually die-cut craft foil even though it is very thin. Craft foil is better when you handle it with care. Even the slightest touch can leave a mark on the foil. But that is no problem, you can still use the foil with this crinkle technique. All you do is wad the craft foil in a ball with your hands. Then straighten it out and lay it on your die-cut plate. Follow the manufacture's directions for the die-cut sandwich for your machine and die-cut the foil. Once you have cut the foil, be very careful when you remove the die cut. One thing to note is because the craft foil is thin, it may leave a mark on your cutting plate. You can add color to foil with your alcohol markers. You can use partial coloring or color the whole thing. This is fun with foiled die cuts. You can custom them using any color you like. If you have a laser printer, using craft foil becomes very easy. You actually do not need any transfer gel medium at all. Steps To Using A Laser Printer With Deco Foil Supplies The Foil Quill Free Style Pen has the different tips. You can buy them individually or as a bundle, The magnetic mat is an accessory as a separate purchase There are two kinds of option when it comes to using a foil quill. There is a free style which works anywhere and a foil quill which is attached to an electronic cutting machine. Free Style Foil Quill The Free style Foil Quill Pen allows you to foil anywhere you please. No machines needed beyond the pen. the Freestyle Pen is a specialized heat pen that allows you to put tip to foil and add shining designs. Available in four tip width options - standard, fine, bold, and calligraphy - you can foil on a wealth of various surfaces including acetate, plastic, wood, leather, and more. Just a few steps to use this amazing tool: Foil Quill Designed to be used in place of the pen or blade of many popular Cricut, Silhouette, Sizzix and Brother electronic die cutting machines, this Foil Quill allows you to foil designs from SVG files on your computer. There are even hundreds of images available on special Design Drives that you can add in glimmering foil on all your projects! You can purchase an all in one kit or buy each tip individually. The tips include a Standard, Bold, or Fine Tip versions for your machine. The Foil Quill is compatible with:   Foiling systems are an additional way to add foil to your paper craft projects. Rather than using a laminator to foil, they utilize a twostep system. The foiling system includes a platform and a docking station where the platform is placed to be heated up. Foiling System Accessories  The first part of the system is the hot foil machine. Much like die cutting, a sandwich is created. The parts of that sandwich include a special die (stamp) to foil, the platform of the foil machine, some shims, the paper to foil, the foil itself as well as some shims. The component of that sandwich is heated on the platform of the hot foil machine. Then, the platform as well as the sandwich, once heated, is run through the die cutting machine (the second part of the system). The die cutting machine takes that heated sandwich and compresses the hot foil onto the project.in the pattern of the die. It should be noted that not all hot foil machines are compatible with all die cutting machines. A lot of that has to do with the thickness of the hot foil machine platform fitting through the hole of the die cutting machines, The Spellbinder's Glimmer machine has the largest list of compatible die cutting machines This is something to consider if you already have a die cutting machine. Then, the second part of the system is the die cutting machine. Once the platform has heated the components of the project, the platform as well as the sandwich is slowly run through the die cutting machine. The foil is then removed from the cardstock to real the finished project. Hot Foiling Tips  Manufactured by Spellbinders, the Glimmer Hot Foil System has been one of the most popular systems on the market. The reason for that popularity is based on the fact that the foil machine is compatible with so many die cutting machines (the second part of the foiling system) The Glimmer Process Each Glimmer foiling machine comes with two shims-a clear shim(plate) and a milky shim (plate) On thinner materials you, would use just one plate. Thicker materials like leather would use two plates in order to get the same results. Glimmer Tips Prices are based on prices seen on Amazon. Bundles may vary so decide what is the best price point for your budget Foil Quill Freestyle Heat  Foil Allows you to foil anywhere $18 for individual tip-$72 for the complete kit.

It has a temperature setting, cool down and auto shut off feature $155. You will need foil and heat foil dies to create your projects. This machine is only compatible with the Gemini Die Cut Machines. If you have the larger Gemini, you will also need an extender plate. Heidi Swapp Minc Machine Reactive Transfer Foil To achieve beautiful foiled results, this system requires a reactive agent to transfer foil from a sheet to your project.In most cases, that reactive agent is toner ink but you can also purchase specialized transfer gel, transfer paint, and even transfer toner ink pensIn most cases, that reactive agent is toner ink but you can also purchase specialized transfer gel, transfer paint, and even transfer toner ink pens!! $63-$115. You will need the minc foil and carrier sheets. You will also need a die cutting machine. You can use any die cutting machine that you have. As well as dies These gels are manufactured by Thermoweb. They are used to transfer foils to paper without heat. They also use heat foil with a laminator, so we included this information for your consideration. Transfer Foil Gel This gel has an opaque white glossy finish Use with Deco Foil Transfer Foils or Flock Sheets. Compatible with most hot laminators The Duo Gel The duo gel works a little differently than the transfer gel. This gel works to transfer foil to paper using heat from a laminator, but also from pressure from a die-cutting machine. Transfer Gel DUO is a permanent transfer medium that dries clear and remains tacky for easy use. Deco Foil Clear Transfer Pens Simply hand-draw or stencil a design on your paper project, cover with foil and run through a die cutting machine or laminator! TWC Hot Foil Gel Package contains 2 ounces of hot foil gel that dries clear I have seen a few other transfer gels on Etsy, but I have always had good results with the Deco Foil brand. This is the easiest way to foil with the least number of extra products or machines needed. This is perfect for anyone who wants to try foiling. The gel is used with stencils. The Duo Transfer gel can be used in two ways. You can use it with a laminator, or you can use it with any die cutting machine that you may have. You always must allow it to dry for 24 hours before using it. Supplies Using A Laminator Using A Die Cutting Machine Other Tips    Transfer gel is a medium that allows you to laminate foil without using a laser printer. This is a great technique that uses stencils to create a foiled background. The one thing to remember is that you have to get the stencil washed immediately after use. Supplies Transfer gel can be used with stencils to create foiled backgrounds. A laminator is used in this kind of foiling Correa Enterprises For the best use of transfer gel or transfer gel duo allow the paste to dry 24 hours to get the best foiling results Glue dots are fantastic when you use Deco-Foil without transfer gel medium. Create polka dot effects on your project. Or use the glue dots to accent flower centers with a vibrant color of Deco-Foil. Create a custom foiled greeting card with recycled lids and foils Craft Foil Tip If you’re using adhesives and your foil missed a spot, go back over that spot with more foil to see if you can cover that spot up. You can foil elements and embellishments for cards and scrapbook pages Card by Correa Enterprises Craft Foil Tip Always adhere to your foil's shiny side up! The shiny side should always face you. These are plain black toner sheets that do not have any adhesive backing. Each package has 8. 5 inches x 11 inches; 3 Sheets per package. These are used with the Deco Foil Transfer Foil in a laminator. You simply cut a shape from your electronic cutting machine. Or you can die cut an image. Or you can punch an image. Tips: Remember to heat your laminator a good 15-20 minutes before using it. That way you will have the maximum heat you need to get a good foiling Using Toner Sheets With Die Cuts You can use toner sheets with die cuts to create foiled embellishments for your greeting cards, journals, planners and junk journals. You can create layered flowers using your electronic cutting machines to make alternate cardstock and foiled flower layers. Using Toner Sheets With Leftover Foiled Pieces Another option is to use leftover pieces of foiled images from other foiled projects on toner sheets. There is no waste when using these leftovers on a piece of fresh toner paper.  Did you know that you can use the left-over foil sheet to create an additional project? You can actually get two projects from one sheet of craft foil. This is a great way to extend your craft budget and help the environment. You can use this technique for any project you have made with either any laminated or Deco Duo Paste. You can also use the Deco or any other foil card fronts for the same technique. Negative Foil Tips Tips On Negative Foiling    Deco Foil Clear Toner Sheets  Deco Foil Toner Sheets are heat-activated transfer papers used to create custom designs and embellishments. Simply use scissors, punches, dies, or an electronic cutting machine to create any shape, layer with Deco Foil Transfer Sheets, and run through a hot laminator. You get three sheets in each package. The sheets are 8.5"" by 11"" each. There are regular toner sheets as well as peel and stick toner sheets. They are compatible with most laminators and can be used with most of the Deco Foil transfer sheets. Toner Sheet Tips Note from the manufacturer: Due to the delicacy of designs, foil may not adhere to all the minor design details.

32,Temporality In John Millais' Ophelia,art," Post Graduate (Master of Arts) in English Literature and Philosophy Ophelia Wikimedia Commons The painting titled ""Ophelia"" was painted by Sir John Everett Millais sometime between 1851 and 1852. He was one of the founding members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood along with William Holman Hunt and Dante Gabriel Rosetti. The group believed that mimesis or the imitation of nature is the central purpose of art. Hence, they sought a return to a ""pre-raphaelian"" age of art before the mannerist style of painting took over from Raphael and Michelangelo. The painting ""Ophelia"" was completed in two stages. First, the background landscape was composed and then the figure of Ophelia was painted in the foreground. Ophelia herself was modelled by Elizabeth Siddall, who was 19 years of age at the time of the painting. In order to portray the painting, Siddall had to float in a bathtub full of water to depict the drowning Ophelia. As the painting was done through winter, Millais had put oil lamps below the tub to keep the water warm. Once, the lamps went out and the water became icy cold. Millais was engrossed in his work and Siddall did not complain. As a result of her prolonged exposure to the cold water, she eventually became ill with severe pneumonia. Her father held Millais responsible for Siddall's predicament and had Millais cover the costs of her treatment under the threat of legal action. The painting depicts the character Ophelia from Shakespeare's play Hamlet singing a lament as she drowns in a river. The pose and the upward gaze resembles the traditional depiction of martyrs and saints in classical Christian iconography. The painting is wrought with a detailed depiction of flora from the English countryside. The flowers highlighted in the painting corresponded with the Victorian concept of the ""language of flowers"" where the depiction of a flower in art signified a specific meaning. In the painting, the dishevelled garland highlighting the red poppy flower denotes sleep or death. In this case, the poppy flower seems to communicate the symbolism of death to the viewer as this painting depicts Ophelia's final moments. But, the most striking feature of the painting is the portrayal of the flow of time which might not be initially apparent to the viewer. The painting flows from right to left (from Ophelia's toe towards her head) as per the viewer's eyes. The hues of green on the right side of the painting (towards Ophelia's toe) are deeper and the flora on the right side seems greener and more ""alive"". Wildflowers, bushes and shrubs dominate the right side of the painting. As the viewer's eye follows the movement from Ophelia's toe towards her head, the background flora on the left stands in stark contrast to the right. Greener hues give way to more muted shades of brown and grey. Broken branches and rougher edges of the flora juxtapose the more tender and milder geometry of the vegetation on the right side. The left side of the painting is more flooded compared to the right side suggestive of the lower ground on the left side. Hence, the stream depicted in the painting flows from right to the left, from the direction of Ophelia's toe towards the direction of her head. The viewer can let his/her imagination trace the path of Ophelia as she flows with the stream towards the left side of the painting. We might assume that Millais portrays Ophelia on the verge of her death and she dies as her body drowns out of the frame on the left side of the painting. This concept of the flow of time from life towards death is wonderfully illustrated by Millais through the symbolism of the pastures and the flora of the English countryside. The flora on the right side is more alive than those on the left (as mentioned earlier) and the broken branches on the left side symbolizes an impending catastrophe. The red poppy is the most overt symbol of death within the frame but this temporal framing of the subject matter moving from right to left, essentially moving toward death highlights the nuanced approach of Millais towards his art. The symbolism of flower might be the accepted practice of conveying meaning through art back in the Victorian era, but the flow of time from life towards death depicted in the painting by contrasting the pastoral hues on right and left sides of the painting seems to be the more elemental and cerebral choice for symbolism in the painting, particularly for modern viewers who are not familiar with the antiquated Victorian concept of ""language of flowers"".

33,Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in Bengal temple decorations,art," Dr. A K Chatterjee is a seasoned writer with more than 330 blogs in English and Bengali and 10 books mostly on travel, trekking and temples. Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu with an image of Lord Krishna; stucco work; Shiva temple; Birbhanpur, Paschim Bardhaman Shri Chaitanya Deva with his customary yellow/golden dress; stucco work. Shri Radhashyamsundarjiu temple, Khardah, North 24-Parganas. This is an article on the influence of The 15th-century Indian saint Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu on the construction of temples in Bengal and his presence in the decorations of Bengal temples. Yet, it will be unfair if we do not touch the life story of this great personality. So, we are first going to know a little about the life of this great saint, though very superficially, and then shall proceed to our topic. Shri Chaitanya, Mahaprabhu, saint, Hinduism, Bhakti Yoga, Devotion, reformer, Krishna, Sannyasin, ISKCON, Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Hare Krishna Mahamantra, Sankirtan, Shadabhuja Gauranga. The 15th-century Indian saint Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (often spelt as ""Caitanya Mahāprabhu"") was one of the all-time great saints of Hinduism. It will be unfair to describe him just as a great saint, he was in true sense a great social and religious reformer who single handedly brought a lot of changes in contemporary social and religious structure and re-introduced the ""Bhakti Yoga"" or the devotion cult which swept the contemporary Bengal and large parts of India like a Tsunami. He popularized ""Krishna worship"" but in a different way from the traditional Hinduism. His Krishna was not just an Avatar of Lord Vishnu, one of the three great Gods of Hinduism viz. Brahma The Creator, Vishnu The Sustainer and Maheshwar (or Shiva) the Destroyer, but the Supreme God-head, the Ultimate from which everything emanates and to which everything goes at the end. Shri Krishna of Shri Chaitanya is The Alpha as well as The Omega. Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's mode of worshiping Krishna with ecstatic song and dance had a profound effect on Vaishnavism in Bengal and large parts of contemporary India. He was also the chief proponent of the Vedantic philosophy of ""Achintya Bheda-Abheda Tattva"". He founded ""Gaudiya Vaishnavism"", which is gaining strength day by day and spreading all over the world (especially by the ISKCON or the International Society for Krishna Consciousness) till today.He popularized the chanting of the ""Hare Krishna"" Maha-mantra (""Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna/ Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama/ Rama Rama, Hare Hare""), the most effective mode of salvation in the present ""Kali Yuga"". To his followers, Shri Chaitanya is considered as an avatar of the Supreme Lord Krishna, a theory which has support of various scriptures including the Bhagavata Purana (Canto 11, Chapter 5, Verse 32). He is also considered as the combined avatar of Radha and Krishna.Born in Nabadwip or Mayapur (as per some authorities) in present-day West Bengal on the full-moon night of 18 February 1486, (as Vishvambhar Mishra) to Jagannath Mishra and Sachi Devi, Shri Chaitanya is sometimes called ""Gauranga"" or ""Gaura"" due to his molten gold–like complexion, and ""Nimai"" as he was born underneath a Neem tree (Azadirachta indica). Nimai was a very naughty yet extremely gifted child, who excelled in his studies to become a scholar at a very tender age and came to be known as ""Nimai Pandit"". He was married at the age of 14/15 years as per the contemporary tradition to Lakshmi Devi, who unfortunately died due to snake bite. On ardent request of his mother, Nimai remarried Vishnupriya/Bishnupriya Devi. Nimai started spreading Krishna devotion by ecstatic singing and dancing (called ""Sankirtan"" or ""Kirtan"") after a visit to Gaya, a famous pilgrimage site in Bihar. He started to break the social and religious barriers. To him everyone is a ""Bhakta"" (devotee) irrespective of religious belief, creed or cast. People , particularly belonging to the oppressed lower casts, flocked to him and joined his Sankirtans. This ired the upper cast Pundits and they tried their best to stop Shri Chaitanya, even by complaining against Nimai to the Muslim Rulers. But even the Muslim Rulers were impressed by Shri Chaitanya's teaching and he was allowed to preach his Bhakti Yoga. His closest disciples were Shri Nityananda (often called ""Nitai""), Adwaita Acharya, Shribasa Thakur and Gadadhar Pandit. These four along with Shri Chaitanya are known as ""Pancha Tattva"" in Gaudya Vaishnavism. Nimai was initiated in the life of a Sannyasin (ascetic) at the age of 24 years by Guru Keshab Bharati who renamed him as ""Shri Krishna Chaitanya Bharati"", ""Shri Chaitanya"" in short. The suffix ""Mahaprabhu"" (""The Great Master"") was added later by his followers. Shri Chaitanya travelled all over India and ultimately settled in Puri, Odisha, the great pilgrimage place where the main temple of Lord Jagannath (a form of Lord Vishnu) is situated. His teachings attracted everyone including the King of Puri Maharaja Pratap Rudra who along with his ministers (specially Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya) became disciples of Shri Chaitanya. What occurred next is shrouded in mystery. Shri Chaitanya simply disappeared one day. There are several theories regarding his disappearance, even a version with hints of conspiracy which tells that he was murdered inside the Jagannath temple. Whatever might be the mode of the end of his mortal life, Shri Chaitanya is one who is really Immortal. If we look at the history of temple construction in Bengal, it will be very clear that temple construction in Bengal took place in two phases. The first of these phases stretched from the ancient Hindu periods to 12th-13th century CE.Thereafter, a lull started because of the Muslim invasion and subsequent Muslim rule in Bengal region. Obviously, the Muslim rulers were not in favour of construction of Hindu temples. This lull phase went for about 300 years. In the mean time, two events occurred. One, the all-powerful Time diluted the anti-Hindu feelings and attitude of the Muslim rulers who gradually were adopting the local life style and began considering themselves as a part of this land and its time-honoured culture. They gradually became less intolerant to Hinduism. This change in attitude of the Muslim rulers played a role in the revival of the tradition of temple construction in Bengal. The other more powerful and influential factor was the emergence of Bhakti Movement of Shri Chaitanya Deva. Shri Chaitanya Deva, with his preaching of the Devotion Cult, broke the class and caste barriers prevailing in the contemporary Bengal society. His Bhakti movement attracted all sorts of people even crossing the religious barriers. Even the Muslim Rulers were impressed by Shri Chaitanya's teachings. This played a very definitive role in the revival of temple construction in Bengal and thus the second phase started from the middle of the 15th century CE and continued with great vigour up to the third quarter of the 20th century (Ref : ""PASCHIMBANGLAR DHARMIYA STHAPATYA - MANDIR O MASJID"" by Shri Tarapada Santra). This discussion may straight forwardly lead to a conclusion that the decorations of temples in Bengal will show Shri Chaitanya and his life stories with elaborate details. But alas, this is not what we find in the decorations of temples in Bengal. Though there are plenty of pictures of Lord Krishna and His Leela (life stories) in the temple decorations, the presence of Shri Chaitanya, who is considered as the avatar of Lord Krishna/ Radha-Krishna or even the Supreme God Krishna Himself, is rare, except with the only possible exception of ""SHADABHUJA GAURANGA"" (6-armed Gauranga). This indifference to Shri Chaitanya is largely inexplicable. Sun temple; Sonatpal, district Bankura. This is a thousand year old temple (pre-Islamic era). Gokulchand temple; Gokulnagar; district Bankura; 17th century Krishna Leel in terracotta; Charbangla temple, Baronagar, Murshidabad; 1760 AD 6-armed Gauranga; Shiva temple, Uchkaran, Birbhum; 1769 AD. The objective of this study is to find out the presence of Shri Chaitanya Deva in the decorations of Bengal temples. This is the result of an analysis of a field study of about 100 temples from different districts of present-day West Bengal. The author travelled to these temples and photographed those extensively. The photos are then analyzed to find out the presence of Shri Chaitanya Deva. A list of the temples with the year of their construction is given in the appendix. Decorations on the external and internal walls of temples is a great art. In Bengal, this has been extensively used. The purpose of this decorations is not only beautification, but a lot more. Temple decorations act like a social media or encyclopedia. At old times, there were no media, no newspaper and majority of the common men had no access to the books, especially the holy books or scriptures. Even the two great epics the Ramayana and the Mahabharata were out of the reach of the common men. Here the temple decorations stepped in and played a great role in teaching and preaching the masses. For this reason we find not only the religious pictures , but depictions of stories from the epics, folk tales and above all, various social practices and events in the temple decorations. Battle of Ramayana; terracotta; Shiva temple, Uchkaran, Birbhum Battle of Mahabharata; terracotta; Jaipur, Bankura Social event in temple decoration : hunting scene; Terracotta; Ramchandra temple, Guptipara, district Hooghly The vast majority of the decorations in Bengal temples is in bas-relief work in terracotta tiles, but other media like stucco, stone, wood, and metal (especially in metal chariots associated with some temples) are also variously used. The second medium other than the bas-relief work is pictures drawn on walls of temples - murals and frescos. Terracotta; tale from Mahabharata (Bhishma on bed of arrows); Madanmohan temple, Vishnupur Stucco; Krishna Leela : Kaliya Daman ; Bhavanishwar temple, baronagar, Murshidabad Stone; Krishna Leela : Vastraharan; Shiva temple, Ganpur, district Birbhum. Wood; Shiva temple, Bankati; Paschim Bardhaman Mural on temple wall - an image of Lord Vishnu in his fish-avatar; Kalleshwar temple, district Birbhum. Engraving on brass; collected from the brass-built Ratha (chariot) from the village of Ajodhya, district Bankura. This is our main topic of discussion. Our finding is given below : In the present series of temples, we can see that the available pictures of Shri Chaitanya can be grouped into 4 groups as follows :1. Pictures of Sankirtan.2. Pictures of ""Gaur-Nitai"" (i.e. pictures of Shri Chaitanya with Nityananda, his chief associate).3. Shadabhuja Gauranga (6-armed Gauranga).4. Miscellaneous. However, not a single picture of the end of Shri Chaitanya is found in any of the temples of the present series. One important point (specially for the un-initiated) is that in paintings and in colored stucco works in temple decoration, it is customary to show Shri Chaitanya Deva in yellow/orange dress and Shri Nityananda in blue dress. This is depicted in several temples. The main feature of this scene is Shri Chaitanya al dancing with uplifted arms along with his followers. In some of these scenes, we can see that Shri Chaitanya is lying on the ground unconscious by the tremendous mental surge of devotional ecstasy. Examples : 1. Pictures of Sankirtan where Shri Chaitanya is seen dancing with his followers can be seen in Ratneshwar temple, Bhattabati, Murshidabad district; Shiva temple of Dubrajpur, district Birbhum; Shiva temple of Supur, district Birbhum; Damodar temple of Hadal-Narayanpur, district Bankura; Gopinath temple of Dashghara, Hooghly district; Sridhar temple of Kotulpur, district Bankura; Lakshmi Narayana temple of Ghurisha, district Birbhum and Lakshmi Narayana temple of Ilambazar, district Birbhum. 2. Pictures of Sankirtan where Shri Chaitanya is seen lying unconscious in ecstasy can be seen in Narayana temple of Jaipur, district Bankura and Damodar temple of Hadal-Narayanpur, also of district Bankura. Sankirtan : Sridhar temple; Kotulpur, district Bankura Sankirtan; Shiva temple, Dubrajpur; district Birbhum. Sankirtan; damodar temple, Hadalnarayanpur, district Bankura Sankirtan; Gopinath temple, Dasghara, District Bankura Sankirtan; Laksmi janardan temple; Ghurisha, district Birbhum Sankirtan : Shri Chaitanya is lying unconscious; Jaipur, District Bankura Sankirtan : Shri Chaitanya is lying unconscious; damodar temple; Hadal-Narayanpur, district Bankura In the stricter sense, this is actually an extension of the Sankirtan scene, but as devotees believe till today that Shri Chaitanya and Nityananda were the avatars of Lord Krishna and Lord Balarama respectively, so their presence together has some special importance. This can be seen in Ratneshwar temple, Bhattabati, Murshidabad district, Vrindavan Chandra temple, Gobrahati, Murshidabad district (terracotta); Ekteshwar temple, Bankura (stucco); Radhagovinda temple of Jagadanandapur, Purva Bardhaman district and Nrisinghadeva temple, Gokarna, district Murshidabad (fresco/mural). Gaur-Nitai in terracotta; Ratneshwar temple, Bhattabati, district Murshidabad Gaur-Nitai in terracotta; Vrindavan Chandra temple, Gobrahati, district Murshidabad Gaur-Nitai in stucco; Ekteshwar temple, Bamkura Gaur-Nitai in Mural/fresco; Radha Govinda temple, Jagadanandapur; Purva Bardhaman Gaur-Nitai in stucco; Shiva temple; Birbhanpur; Paschim Bardhaman Gaur-Nitai in mural; Nrisinghadeva temple; Gokarna; Murshidabad This is a special subject and require detailed discussion, which I'll do it in a separate article. Here I'm writing on this fascinating subject in brief. The concept of 6-armed Garuanga came from the belief that Gauranga (other name of Shri Chaitanya) was a combination of 3 Avatars - Shri Rama, Shri Krishna and Shri Chaitanya himself.In iconography and temple decorations this is depicted as Shri Chaitanya having 6 arms - the two upper arms holding bow and arrow are of Lord Rama; the middle two hands holding the Banshi (flute) are of Lord Krishna and the two lower arms holding the Danda (stick) and the Kamandalu (water pot) are of Shri Chaitanya himself. Incidentally, the Danda and Kamandalu two the signs of a Sannyasin (ascetic). There are profound significances of this form of Shri Chaitanya, which will be discussed in another article. It is believed that Shri Chaitanya showed his 6-armed form to 3 persons : Nityananda, Sarbabhauma Bhattacharya and the King of Puri Maharaja Prataprudra. In temple decorations of Bengal this Shadabhuja Gauranga motif is depicted profusely - mostly in terracotta, but also in stucco, stone work and in fresco/murals. Examples :1. Shadabhuja Gauranga in terracotta : This can be seen in Shiva temple of Ukhra, Paschim Bardhaman district; Gopinath temple of Dashghara, Hooghly district; Shiva temple of Dubrajpur, district Birbhum; Damodar temple of Hadal-Narayanpur, district Bankura; Dakshina Kali temple of Malancha Sahachak, Paschim Medinipur district; Pancharatna Shiva temple, Itanda, district Birbhum; Madanmohan temple, Vishnupur, district Bankura; Shiva temple of Uchkaran, district Birbhum; Narayan temple of Jaipur, district Bankura; Shiva temple, Sribati, district Purva bardhaman and Ratneshwar temple , Bhattabati, district Murshidabad. 2. Stucco : Shadabhuja Gauranga in stucco can be seen in Ekteshwar temple, district Bankura. 3. Stone : Shadabhuja Gauranga in stone work can be seen in a Shiva temple, Ganpur, district Birbhum. 4. Fresco/mural : Shadabhuja Gauranga in fresco/mural can be seen in Kaleshwar Shiva temple, Kaleshwar, district Birbhum. In mural/fresco, the upper two arms are shown in Green color (complexion of Lord Rama was Green), the middle two arms in Blue (complexion of Lord Krishna was Dark Blue or Black) and the two lower arms in yellow color (the complexion of Shri Chaitanya was like molten gold). Shadabhuja Gauranga in terracotta : Ratneshwar temple, Bhattabati, Murshidabad Shadabhuja Gauranga in terracotta : Dakshina Kali temple, Sahachak, Paschim Medinipur Shadabhuja Gauranga in stucco : Ekteshwar temple, Bankura Shadabhuja Gauranga in stone : Shiva temple, Ganpur, Birbhum 1. In Radha Govinda temple of Jagadanandapur, Purva Bardhaman district we can see a scene of a procession in which Shri Chaitanya is dancing with his followers, and in the background we can see Lord Jagannath. Is it a scene of Puri? 2. In Adwaita Paat temple in Babla, Shantipur, district Nadia, we can see a picture of ""Pancha Tattva"" (Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu with Nityananda, Adwaita Acharya, Shribasa Thakur and Gadadhar Pandit).3. In Radha Shyamsundar temple of Khardaha, North 24-Parganas, there are high relief figures of Shri Chaitanya in stucco. Shri Chaitanya in front of Lord Jagannath; stone work;  Radha Govinda temple, Jagadanandapur ""PANCHA TATTVA"" : Adwaita Paat; Babla, Shantipur The presence of Shri Chaitanya in Bengal temple decorations is a fascinating subject to say the least. The small number of temples (around 100) in the present series makes this article a pilot study at the most. Hopefully, some researchers will come forward with larger series in future, so that we may know some more facts about this subject. 1.""PASCHIMBANGLAR DHARMIYA STHAPATYA - MANDIR O MASJID"" by Shri Tarapada Santra. 2. many internet sites including Wikipedia, ""Back to Godhead"" etc. Photos : All photos are by the author.

34,Jurassic Wonders: Dinosaur Sculptures in the California Dawn,art," Mark Tulin is a baseball fan from Philadelphia, PA. He has four books of poetry and one short story collection, available on Amazon. Mark Tulin There were no humans two hundred million years ago, back in the dinosaur age. We only came on the scene two hundred thousand years ago. I wonder what the world was like without any human interference? Was the world a better place without humans? There was certainly no energy crisis. No destruction of the environment or world wars. No cell phones, no right or left-wing politics. No killing of animals for sport. It must have been peaceful back then, except for a few hungry dinosaurs. I thought about these questions during a recent dinosaur exhibit in Cathedral City, California. Photo by Mark Tulin In Cathedral City, CA, (2022), Ricardo Breceda's metal sculptures of dinosaurs are on exhibit free to the public. The display is affiliated with the Museum of Ancient Wonders. The artist is Ricardo Breceda from Durango, Mexico. He made a metal sculpture of a Tyrannosaurus rex for his daughter Lianna after she asked for a dinosaur for Christmas. She loved Jurassic Park III so much that she wanted one for herself. Lucky for her, she had a father who could recreate life-size dinosaurs. There are eleven life-size dinosaurs on a vacant lot off Palm Canyon Road. Cathedral City is a desert community, and it is a thrill to see these metal creatures against the backdrop of mountains and palm trees. Photo by Mark Tulin Dinosaurs roamed the Earth in the Mesozoic Era, which began in the Triassic Period, 230 million years ago. Due to a catastrophic meteorite impact on Earth, the Dinosaurs became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period more than sixty-five million years ago. These Velociraptors are considered a smaller version of the giant dinosaurs. They measure sixty feet long, twenty-five feet tall, and could weigh up to twenty tons. And they ate a variety of vegetation and lived approximately seventy-five years. Mark Tulin Photo by Mark Tulin The Spinosaurus Aegyptiacus was among the largest terrestrial carnivores. The dorsal sail along its spine helped regulate body temperature and was a source of attraction for mating. The Spinosaurus lived on land and water and hunted for food in both domains. Photo by Mark Tulin The Triceratops was a giant quadrupedal plant-eating dinosaur. It had a frill of bone at the back of its skull and three prominent horns. It lived during the Cretaceous Period (145.5 million to 65.5 million years ago), making it one of the last non-avian dinosaurs to have evolved. Paleontologists estimate that the body length of Triceratops approached thirty feet. The largest adults are believed to have weighed 12,000–16,000 pounds. mark tulin Mark Tulin The Dinosaur display is at the corner of East Palm Canyon Drive and West Buddy Rogers Avenue in Cathedral City, California. The free public exhibit will be on display throughout the year 2022. The metal dinosaurs, created by artist Ricardo Breceda, are historically accurate in size and placed in four vignettes. There is a juvenile T-rex, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Parasaurolophus, Camarasaurus, two Spinosauri, two large T-rexes, and two Velociraptors. You can see more of Breceda's sculptures at the Sky Art Sculpture Garden in Borrego Springs.

35,The Art of Hand-Sewing,art," Although Sewing Machines can produce almost every variety of stitch, there are always times when you need to sew by hand. sometimes a hand-sewn effect is desired and hand sewing can also complement machine sewing - tacking, for instance, is the best way of aligning and holding together layers of fabric for machining. Needle marks and stitches can be hidden by careful preparation before undertaking any hand sewing, look carefully at the fabric, and select the finest needles possible and a thread of suitable colour and weight. right-handed people should work from right to left, left-handed people from left to right. Pinning and tacking is used to hold fabrics pieces together before sewing. Pin perpendicular to stitching. Use tacking thread in contrasting colour. Remove tacking after sewing. Pin the fabric pieces together. Secure the end of the thread either by stitching over it or by tying a knot in it. Make all the tacking stitches about 1 cm long, or alternate stitches 1.5 cm long at the front with stitches 5 mm long at the back. Slipstitch is used for hems or where a seam must be sewn from the right side of the fabric: for example, to close the opening through which something was turned right sides out. Secure the thread and take the needle across the opening. Make a stitch 2 mm long in the seam-line fold. Bring the thread back across the opening and make a similar stitch on the front side. Continue this process to the end, and fasten off in the seam. Tailor's tacks are used to mark fabrics that need to be joined accurately or to transfer a pattern mark to one layer of fabric or two identical pieces. Make tailor's tacks with doubled thread in a contrasting colour to the fabric. When a number of different marks are needed on one section of fabric, use a different colour for each to help you to distinguish them. 1. STARTING OFF Make a stitch about 1 cm long through the fabric, pull the thread through, leaving a 1.5 cm length of thread on the surface. Insert the needle into the first hole of the stitch again. 2. FORMING A LOOP Make a second stitch through the same holes. Pull the thread through, but leave a loop of tacking thread large enough to fit around your index finger standing out from the fabric. 3. FINISHING OFF A few stitches make a loop of many threads on the fabric. Finish the tack with the needle at the front of the fabric, and cur the thread to leave an end of 1.5 cm matching the start of the tack. 4. SNIPPING THE THREADS If the tacks are marking two layers of fabric, ease the layers apart and snip the threads as below. If they are made through a pattern lying on the fabric, cut the loop to remove the pattern. Ladder stitch is ideal for joining two pieces of patterned fabric, ensuring that the pattern matches exactly across the seam prior to more permanent sewing. Essentially, it is tacking the fabric sections together from the right, or patterned side. Although using a ladder stitch may result in a certain wastage of fabric, it is an essential technique for achieving a neat and professional finish when joining pieces of patterned fabric. You will need an iron for this task. 1. ALIGNING PIECES Lay the fabric right side up, overlapping the edges. Fold the edge of the top piece under by 2 cm or more for a heavy fabric. Press the fold, align the pattern, and pin the pieces. 2. STARTING SEAM Thread a needle with tacking thread and secure the end of the thread on the seam line. Make a stitch 1 cm long inside the seam-line fold in the top piece of fabric. 3. FORMING A LADDER Make a stitch of 1 cm long in the bottom piece of fabric. Make ladder-like stitches to the seam end, and fasten off. Fold the fabrics right sides together, sew, and remove ladder stitches. Blanket stitch is used mainly for neatening the raw edges of fabric, but it can also be used decoratively. Use a thick thread for decorative blanket stitch, especially if the thread is the same colour as the cloth so that the texture of the edging is clearly evident. Closely worked blanket stitch is used to secure the edges of buttonholes: proper buttonhole thread, which is fine but very strong, should be used for this. 1. MAKING STITCH Make the blanket stitches about 1cm in from the raw edge for heavy fabrics, 5 mm for light fabrics, and 3 mm for button holes. Catch the thread behind the needle. 2. TIGHTENING STITCH Pull the needle through. The caught loop of thread runs along the edge of the fabric before turning into the stitch away from the edge. Tighten gently to avoid puckering the edge of the fabric, and repeat the stitch all along the edge. Space the stitches widely on heavy fabrics, closer on light fabrics, and right next to each other for buttonholes. This stitch is used for strong, permanent seams, particularly in awkward places, such as tight corners, where a machine is difficult to use. It can also be used sew in zips, if a machine cannot be used. A backstitch every so often in a hem, ensures that even if the hem catches and rips, only a short length will come undone and need resewing.  From the front, make a stitch 1 cm long. Push the needle to the back of the fabric, 5 mm back along the stitch, and bring it to the front 5 mm beyond the stitch. Repeat the process, sewing each stitch into the end of the previous one. At the front, the stitches should be 5 mm long; at the back they should be 1 cm long, and overlap.

36,Essential Basic Sewing Kit for Beginners,art," To achieve a professional finish for your soft furnishings, proper equipment, and a clean, well-ordered worksurface are essential. Keep your sewing equipment separate from your other household tools, and use it only for sewing tasks. Having a worksurface large enough for the task is vital - when making extremely long curtains. the floor may be the only suitable on which to work. Bear in mind comfort when establishing a work area. Sit on a chair with firm support, and position the table high enough to avoid backache. Work in a well-lit room, particularly when there is limited daylight available. Fabric must always be cut accurately to ensure perfect hanging and fitting. Select scissors that are sharp, durable, and comfortable to use. Avoid using fabric scissors for household chores, since they will quickly become blunted. Use dressmakers scissors for cutting out templates and fabric, embroidery scissors for cutting detailed work, and pinking shears for neatening raw edges. A lot of my own people in my family depend all their work on high-quality sewing machines, But my mother requires good quality tools alongside it. Having good scissors that can cut clear and with accuracy is a must household item, even for those who have nothing to do with sewing. I usually make fabric crafts alongside resin crafts, I can say this with absolute clarity, that these scissors are very reliable and cleave through fabric like butter. I am very happy that we have some professional shears around the house, which makes our life a lot easier when we're doing big projects in the house. As a bonus, they also give a measuring tape along with it as a gift. Overall, They work very well and are affordable. An iron should be used not only at the finish, but throughout the making up process, for tasks such as flattening seams, hems, and turnings, Select and iron with a steaming facility, if possible. It is not the weight of the iron, but the moisture and heat that flattens the fabric. An ironing board should be height adjustable and possess a padded, purpose made cover that is easy to keep clean. In most cases, a sewing machine is faster and easier to use than sewing by hand. Modern sewing machines are simple to operate and provide an extensive range of useful facilities, including straight stitch, zigzag stitch, and reverse settings. Most machines are available with sewing attachments like a zip foot, which is used for such tasks as securing a zip to a seam. Keep spare bobbins nearby, and wind the thread on before you begin to work Use plain, stainless steel pins, or for greater visibility on the fabric, pins with coloured glass heads. For safety and easy access, keep pins in a box or in a pincushion. A wide range of sewing needles is available for fabrics of different thicknesses. A threader facilitates threading a needle. Select thread according to the project, and to the colour, type, and weight of the fabric. Tacking thread is available in a range of colours and is easier to break than other threads. Accurate measuring and marking up are essential for sewing. A stretch-resistant, cloth tape measure enables you to work easily around curves and corners. Mark fabric with a clearly visible colour that is easy to remove. Use tailor's chalk or a vanishing ink pen for this purpose. Do not press fabric before vanishing ink has disappeared completely. Many soft furnishings require the fabric to be cut at perfect right angles. A large, perspex set square is ideal for helping you to mark right angles accurately. A bodkin is a blunt, thick needle with a long eye, used for threading cord, ribbon, or elastic through heavy fabric or casings. Unpick seams quickly and easily using a seam ripper. Clothes pegs are helpful when you need to temporarily secure fabrics to stiff objects such as buckram or a lampshade frame. You can use brown paper, tracing paper, or graph paper for making up a pattern or template. Few special tools are required when making up most cushion covers or simple upholstery. For attaching buttons or tufts to a cushion cover, you will need a long upholstery needle, these are available in a range of sizes. To fit a fabric cover to a simply shaped piece of furniture, such as a footstool, use upholstery skewers to stretch and hold the material firmly in place before securing. These upholstery tools should only be used on thick fabric. Do not use skewers or upholstery needles on sheer fabric, because they will tear the material.

39,Heat Transfer Vinyl-Tips And Ideas,art," I love to learn new crafts and are always on the lookout for new products and ideas to make crating easier for the crafting community Heat transfer vinyl is a versatile vinyl that can be applied to fabric and other surfaces easily with the right tools. Heat Transfer Vinyl (also known as HTV or iron on) is one of the most popular vinyl products on the market. It generally comes in either sheet or on a roll. Most HTV comes in 12-inch widths. On a typical HTV sheet, you will find a clear plastic carrier sheet covering the top area. On the other side, you get the heat-sensitive adhesive part of the vinyl. This is not tacky or sticky to the touch. It only gets activated when heat is applied to it. Adhesive vinyl has a papery backing and HTV has a plastic-type backing sheet often referred to as a carrier sheet. The carrier sheet is the shiniest side of the HTV and is the side that is placed against the mat. It is usually a clear plastic that is relatively hard. Make sure that you don’t cut through the carrier sheet as it is designed to hold your design in place until you have heated the vinyl onto your project. HTV comes in a variety of colors and styles, Shopping for all the styles and colors for your project is fun To use HYV you just cut the design from your electronic cutting machine from the vinyl, You weed it to get any parts not the design of the area. You place it on your project surface to apply the design. You apply heat to the surface. There are lots of different brands and often these manufacturers will have their own names for a specific type of HTV. Basic Types Of HTV: HTV Tip If you are unsure on what side to cut, peel a corner to reveal which side is the liner An SVG file is a graphics file that uses a two-dimensional vector graphic format created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It describes images using a text format that is based on XML. SVG files are developed as a standard format for displaying vector graphics on the web. Since text is used to describe the graphic, an SVG file can be scaled to different sizes without losing quality—in other words, the format is resolution-independent. This is why website and print graphics are often built in the SVG format, so they can be resized to fit different designs in the future. So, this file is used by electronic cutting machines. The file enables you to create the image or graphic in any size that you need for your project.  HTV Vinyl is mostly used on fabric projects Heat Transfer Vinyl Tip Place the HTV shiny side down. The shiny side is not actually the HTV – it’s actually the carrier sheet (what the HTV is attached to). Your cutting machine should be cutting the HTV and not the shiny carrier sheet. The quick answer to this question is that you can apply Heat Transfer Vinyl to any fabric that can handle a hot iron or heat source for 20 seconds. Pocket Design Sizing If you are creating a pocket design for a garment, the design size depends on the size of the shirt. Generally, a child-size would be 3"" by 3"". An adult pocket design would be 4"" by4"", Then increase the design slightly for large, extra large, and sizes above that. Make sure that you read and understand the manufacturer's directions before you start on your project. Different makers may have different temperature requirements and time settings to get the best results.  Keep The Carrier Sheet Intact The carrier sheet is the film backing on the vinyl that is there to keep your vinyl designs together. It is important that you do not cut through or you will wind up with two pieces of vinyl and no way to attach your design,To keep the carrier sheet intact, always make sure that the shiny side of the vinyl is facing DOWN when you position it on your cutting mat and that your cutting machine is set to vinyl. If you are using a cutting machine, there are a few skills that you should be familiar with on your machine. They include importing files from your computer into you machine. You should also be familiar with the process of sizing a project. Finally, you need to know how to mirror a design. Taking the time to learn these functions will help you get better results and have less frustration. Preparing The Cut File The first step in your project is to prepare the cut file on your electronic cutting machine. If you do not have a cutting machine, it is possible to cut a file by hand. A cut file is a design that you use to cut your vinyl that is then applied to the surface of your project.The most common type of file used is the ""SVG"" file. It is pretty universal to most cutting machine software applications. Other types of files that you may run into include Studio, png., Dxf., or jpg. If you have a Silhouette cutting machine, you will use Studio files only. Since you get the basic software free, you will have to upgrade to the Silhouette Designer Edition or higher in order to use cut files.There are plenty of free cut files on the internet and most likely your machine software will have plenty available. There are some files that may be free to use for personal use. Others will be free to use for personal use and commercial use (That means you can make and sell items with the file) And there are plenty of files that can be purchased. If you have selected a cut file from the internet, you will need to understand the steps to import that design from the internet into your cutting machine software. Start out with a design that is already in your software, then become familiar with the step to adding more files. Scaling The Design The next step in the process is to decide how big or small your design needs to be on your surface. So you need to measure the surface to decide how big or small the design needs to be. Lay out your surface and use a ruler to decide how tall and how wide the design should be. Get an idea of where it should be placed on the piece.Now, using your software, take your measurements and change the size by adjusting the width and the height of your design. Always remember to cut with the shiny side down (the carrier side) The dull side should be facing you. While the dull side is usually the same color,it can also be white. Mirroring The Design The next step is to mirror or flip your design horizontally. There is a specific reason why this step is very important to your finished project. When you are working with Heat Transfer Vinyl (HTV) or iron-on vinyl, you are cutting the design on the back of the vinyl. HTV has a clear carrier sheet that covers the top of the vinyl. The other side has the heat-sensitive adhesive, You are actually cutting on the adhesive side The carrier sheet holds the design in place so that you get a clean cut. When you apply the design to the surface, the adhesive side goes down. That way when you apply the heat it will stick to your project. You have to flip or mirror the design so that it is the right way up on your project before you cut it. Tip: People like to leave a reminder somewhere where they can see it."" Did you remember to mirror the image?""  Cutting The Heat Transfer Design You are now ready to start cutting the design. The first thing to do is to load the mat with the Heat Transfer Vinyl. If you are using a mat, make sure to smooth the vinyl with a brayer or a spatula to make sure that ir is totally smooth. The HTV always goes glossy side down no matter what cutting machine or mat that you are using. So you will be cutting with the matte (duller) side up. If your vinyl came on a roll, cut the piece to fit your mat.Now you are ready to adjust the cut settings on your cutting machine. The process will be a little different for different machines. Just make sure to select the exact setting for the type of Heat Transfer Vinyl that you are using. (flocked HTV may have a different setting than smooth HTV)You may want to do a test cut ahead of the actual project to make sure that you will get the right setting for your designNow you are ready to get the cut started, Weeding The Vinyl Your image is cut and now it is time to weed (clean any excess vinyl not part of the design). You want a clean design transferred to the project with no extra bits that are not part of the design.The first step is to trim any large part of the vinyl that might be able to be saved for future designs. If your vinyl design is small just trim around the design with a pair of scissors.Personally, I like to use a weeding hook to weed my designs. It has a sharp point at the end that makes weeding easy. You can also use tweezers, a craft knife, or even a straight pin.Seeing the cut lines can be a bit challenging. You can lift the vinyl to try to see the cut lines. You can also hold it up to a window or a light. Another option is the Cricut Bright Pad. This is a bright light that will help you see the cut lines more clearly.Once you see the cut lines, use your tool to lift the excess vinyl, not part of the design, off the carrier sheet. Once you have the design all weeded. you can flip it over to get a peek at how the design will look. Weed your design on a warm bottom heat press platen to speed up weeding Hot Weeding Another option when it comes to weeding is called hot weeding. Instead of weeding on your cutting mat, you would weed on a warm surface like the bottom plate, (paten) of your heat-press, a warmed heat transfer pillow, or an Easy Press. This trick will only work with a sticky carrier sheet. Products like Easy Weed, Holographic, and even Glitter HTV could be used with this process. Do not use this for fine detail or intricate patterns.  Create A Weeding Box Section off your design with a weeding box or cut lines. A weeding box is just a square cut around the edge of your art. The extra lines help separate the design from the material that you want to save. It makes it easier to weed your design on the cutting mat. Placing your HTV design in the right place will guarantee that you will be pleased with the results There are always questions when it comes to where to place your HTV design on your garment or project. A front-centered size decal for a child would be 5.5"" by 7"". For an adult, consider size of 7.5"" by 9"". Let's start with T-shirts. That is the most common and popular project. The first thing you want to find out is the exact center of the shirt. Now all you need to do is fold your design in half. Place it centered to your crease mark and you will get perfect placement every time. HTV Tip For shiny polyester materials and coated polyester, use a damp cloth with rubbing alcohol and gently apply it to the area on the garment you want to apply your design. Allow it to dry and apply your material. This will allow the adhesive to better penetrate the garment This handy tool will help you get professional results every time It may look difficult but applying heat transfer vinyl is not as difficult as you might think. Here are the steps that you need to get a successful application: Ironing The Design On The Surface Now you are ready to iron your vinyl onto the surface of your project,There are three ways to get this done:Home Iron We recommend that you use a heavier dry iron rather than a lightweight steam iron that you may have at home. Heat and pressure are what make the best permanent transfer of the design. It is very difficult to get the pressure you need with a light iron. Also, the holes on the plate of standard steam irons may cause uneven pressure to your design.No matter what iron you use, do not use an ironing board, It is not steady enough to give you the pressure you need. Do not use a granite countertop. It will not hold the heat to get the design on.Use a sturdy table or a block of wood at about waist high Most HTV is ""cold peel"" vinyl. That means that you have to wait for the vinyl to cool almost all the way before you remove the carrier sheet. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations.  HTV Tip If you receive the temperature settings with your HTV that is great! Make sure you keep them. You could store it directly with the HTV or in a folder with a sample of your HTV or simply a notepad with a description. The Easy Press line by Cricut has been a popular tool for applying HTV There are a variety of Easy Press options to choose from. This has been a popular brand for a while now. Other companies have come out with similar products at different price ranges. If you are choosing an Easy Press or other similar products, you should take the time to do a complete comparison to make sure that you are getting the most for your money. Cricut Mini The smallest of the line. Perfect for small areas Has three heat settings Easy Press 2 9"" by 9"" base. Precise temperature controls up to 400℉. Insulated Safety Base and auto-shutoff feature Easy Press 3 12"" by 10"" base plate.

Compatible with Cricut Heat™ app for wireless connection & step-by-step guided flow.3 heat settings up to 400 ºF (205 ºC) for iron-on/HTV, Infusible Ink™ & sublimation projects Easy Press Tips The Cricut Mini Press is perfect for those small items when you need just a lttle heating area to apply HTV Heat presses are the largest option when it comes to applying HTV Heat presses are the bigger version of the tools to apply HTV. There is nothing wrong with using a home iron for your HTV. The right iron at the right heat setting will give you good results. But taking that idea one step further, the heat press will do a better job, easier and with better results. There are lots of options when it comes to heat presses. From the little minis to the big clam shell models, you are sure to be able to find something that fits your needs and budget. The littlest mini starts around $49 and then some of the models go near $1000. There are three basic designs to the larger heat presses-clam shall (opens from the top), Swing away (swings away to one side or the other) and draw style Clam Shell A clam style press takes up the least amount of space. It opens like… you guessed it, a clam! Because of this minimal movement, it has the smallest footprint. All you need is about a 3-foot workspace. This type of press tends to be smaller and lighter as well. Draw Style On a draw heat press, the bottom platen will pull out like a drawer. The top platen stays in place. With the bottom platen pulling out, it gives more space for the operator to align the apparel and transfers on the platen before application without the worry or nuisance of the upper platen in their way. The draw-back (no pun intended), is that this takes up a little bit more space in front of the press when the platen pulls out. Swing Away The third style of heat press is a swing-away. This popular style allows the upper platen to swing-away to the side instead of the lower platen pulling out. This still allows the operator to work in a clear space without having the heated platen in the way. In this case, you will need some extra space for the upper platen to swing to the side – about 18-24 inches more for a safe amount of space. There are specialty presses for things like hats. But many of the higher end presses have accessories that answer your specialty items needs. You decide what suits your needs. You should take into consideration what space you have available when you are considering a heat press. Some of the larger clam shell models are very heavy and take a lot of counter space verses a smaller more portable version. Cricut has come out with a smaller version of a clam shell heat press called an auto press. It has the same features of a larger heat press in a smaller version.   Heat Press Tips HTV Tip Most HTV will need to have your design mirrored unless otherwise specified Layering HTV It is a lot of fun and very satisfying to be able to layer HTV in your designs. Adding those extra elements makes a unique and truly custom finished product. But not all HTV can be layered. It is important for you to know which products can be layered.When pressing multiple layers, it is important you remember that the first layer will receive the additional heat of each layer after it. When pressing multiple layers, it is important to remember that the first layer will also get heat from all the layers after that. You are much better off with several short presses. Short presses also reduce any chances of shrinking of the HTV. Layering Guide Holographic HTV is the shiny sparkly rainbow of colors that are loved by all who create HTV designs. There are a few tricks to working with this type of vinyl that will make your projects easier and more successful: If you pull out your vinyl project from the dryer and the vinyl is peeling up, that usually means that you did not apply it right. (too much heat or not enough-not pressing long enough, ect. Why HTV Does Not StickThe quality of the vinyl-cheap vinyl has a tendency to adhere poorly. You might be saving money but getting poor results. It does also have a shelf life. If you have HTV sitting in your craft space for years, it may not stick.The heat and pressure that you use. Most vinyl products come with guides that tell you the heat settings. If you press it too hot or too long, you may ruin the vinyl. The opposite is also true. If you do not press it hot enough or long enough, it will likely come off in the first wash, Always use the manufacturer's settings for the best results.When you prewash your item before you adhere to the vinyl, never use a fabric softener. The softener will add a coat over the fabric that the vinyl will not stick to.Sometimes the corners of the vinyl piece do not stick properly. More than likely that is from not pressing all the corners. HTV Tip Wait at least 24 hours before you wash a garment that you have applied HTV to When you are working with patterned HTV there are just a few things to remember to complete the project with less hassle and better results. Picking The Right Pattern There are so many beautiful patterns to choose from that you can get dizzy from all the choices. When you are designing and considering a patterned piece of vinyl, think about the pattern and how often the pattern is repeated, You also want to think about how much white space there is in the pattern. This will help you decide the size of your design. The repeat will help you determine where to cut so that you get more design and less white space. If the pattern is big and bold, you are more likely to get more pattern and less white space. Placing Your Patterned Vinyl For this type of HTV, you need to place the patterned side up. Also with this HTV, you do not mirror the design in some vinyl (check with the manufacturer on this one, because it could vary. What you want to understand in using patterned HTV, is if there is an attached carrier sheet. That is what will determine if you mirror or not. Do a test cut for this type of vinyl, because products can vary. You want to waste as little vinyl as possible. Using A Heat Mask Some patterned types of vinyl again, do not have a carrier sheet attached. So you may have to purchase a heat mask as a separate item. This is different than transfer tape that is used for adhesive vinyl. To use a heat transfer mask, all you do is remove the clear sheet from its paper backing. Apply it over your design that is cut and weeded. Burnish (rub) it with a scraper or credit card. Then remove the patterned backing. That’s it! It is ready to press!  Here is the perfect solution for storing all of your precut HTV vinyl designs. Heat Transfer Vinyl is not at all difficult to use and apply to your garments or other fabric materials. You can design and apply HTV easily and without stress. This was just a starting point to get you into this exciting medium. Once you understand the right way to do it and have the tools you need, you will find yourself getting into the creative process. You will need new and exciting options to create fabric projects for yourself, your friends and your family. Happy crafting ! © 2022 Linda F Correa"
40,Velociraptor Claw Fossil Necklace Using Air Dry Clay,art," Air-dry clay is perfect for beginners because it is easy to shape and, unlike polymer clay, it requires no oven. The clay can be shaped any way you want and it only needs to dry, to create the desired item. Then it can be painted and in order to protect it from humidity, a layer of gloss can be added. The gloss makes the colors more intense and also gives depth to the design. To create jewelry, it is necessary to use small bits of clay, which have to be modeled relatively quickly, to prevent drying. By comparison, polymer clay can be modeled over a period of a couple of days. You can leave polymer clay on the table and continue modeling the following day, without the fear that it might dry out. After modeling, air-dry clay must be left in a place with airflow, so that the moisture of the clay evaporates. It should not be put in direct sunlight, since that might lead to an accelerated drying on one side and to the formation of cracks. If you notice cracks on the surface of the clay item, you can use slip (a mixture of clay and water), to cover the cracks. If you also notice a deformation of the item, then you can use a piece of damp cloth or a damp towel, which you can place on the item and leave overnight. This should moisturize the clay and make it soft again so that it can be brought back to the desired shape. Do you love making your own jewelry, and do you also like modeling clay? Why not combine those two passions, to create your own jewelry, that you love wearing every day? In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a velociraptor claw necklace using air-dry clay. Materials: air dry clay modeling tools a toothbrush paint brush water Take a piece of air-dry clay the preferred size. Start creating a banana-like structure, to shape the claw. Make the tip of the claw pointed and the base wide, so that it resembles a velociraptor fossil claw. Use the toothbrush to create the porous surface of the claw base. As you can see, besides the modeling tools, that you can buy online or in a shop, you can also make some of the tools yourself, using simple household items. Punch a hole in the top of the claw, for the necklace cord, using the plastic modeling tool. Remember that you can dip the tool into some water, to prevent the clay from sticking to the tool. Make this hole large enough for the cord to pass through. Once the shape is ready, leave the clay to dry. Lay it on a sheet of parchment paper and let it dry. This can take a couple of days, depending on the humidity in the room. Flip it over after a day to help it dry quicker. Once the piece is dry, paint it, using a lighter color. Then apply a darker color, making sure you create parallel lines along the claw length. At the top of the claw use an even darker shade, to give the item a natural look. After the paint has dried, apply a layer of gloss varnish. This will protect the clay from humidity and give the piece a unique look. Now add the black cord to create the necklace. Take the left hand cord and bring it down crossing over the right cord. Make a knot next to the pendant, by first creating a loop. Then bring the left cord up through the loop. Pull both ends of the cord together. Make another knot at the end of the cords. Now that your necklace is ready, enjoy wearing your new handmade necklace."
41,How to Remain Healthy and Happy,art," Health tips. According the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in six Americans struggle with their mental health. In today’s world, a person who does not have access to quality primary care should make sure to maintain good mental health and stay involved in life, family and work in order to reduce the risk of suffering from depression and anxiety. It is very important that people take time out to understand what their mental state may be, where it affects them and how they can help themselves in overcoming those challenges. The best way to avoid losing your mind is being realistic about these issues as they are normal reactions. If you find yourself struggling to cope with mental health issues like depression or anxiety, it might be time to talk to your doctor. Your doctor will be able to guide you in finding appropriate medications or counseling services for your condition. You might also need medical attention if you become severely depressed or suffer an overdose of substances that affect the brain or body. Seeking treatment will allow you to live more of your life and take control of your own well-being and avoid the cycle of unhealthy self-compassionate habits and bad relationships that will hold you back. When you need to seek medical care, seek emergency help to relieve stress and keep your safety in mind. When talking about dieting, some people think negatively about food and others think positively. However, this topic can lead to many conflicts between the two. Dieting, at its core, is about eating less than you normally would and also doing things differently. Most people choose one or the other way. For people who struggle with self-esteem issues, feeling guilty about a certain food choice might actually encourage them to make better choices. If you are suffering from severe depression, it is imperative to remember that when you feel hopeless, it is okay not to be okay. You do not need all your friends to know about your struggles and in fact, when you receive the support you deserve, you will lose all of those toxic influences on who you are and what makes you happy. Knowing that you need the outside help to get through this tough time and learn how to adjust can empower you to focus on what truly matters and helps you rewire your thought process and behaviors so that nothing holds you back. Make sure to reach out to friends and family because what your mind and body are telling you is that you need their love and encouragement. Not having that support could trigger depression and stress that is not worth living. You may think what do I eat? What do I drink? But is that really true? Is that real life or my imaginary world? Do I always enjoy drinking wine or beer? No. As long as I like it. Some foods are absolutely essential for us and healthy for our bodies. This includes fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy and legumes. Other products, like chocolate can cause addiction but that happens with every new habit. A lot of people like to try out new recipes and enjoy them. They don’t understand why we cannot enjoy some foods while others are so much fun. Just enjoy them! Don’t go crazy trying to change yourself overnight. Take it slow, you can only improve over time. Start small and trust me, it will pay off. Try to keep track of your progress over the next week and see what changes you see yourself making over your day. Look up and read some healthy tips to incorporate the little bits into your daily routine. These tips will keep you focused on changing your habits and getting you moving in the right direction!

42,Granny Stripe Blanket Crochet Pattern,art," Hello, my name is Sue and I have 14 years crochet experience. I love crochet and I am passionate about sharing crochet skills with anyone. Vintage Granny Stripe Blanket Photo 1 For this blanket I used two strands of Stylecraft Special DK held together throughout. Stylecraft yarn can be purchased from many places however I usually buy from the Wool Warehouse website and I have added the link below. I have used UK crochet terms throughout. Finished size approx 78” x 78” or 192 x 192 cm The quantities listed are for a double bed size blanket You will need 4 of each of the following colours; Duck egg Vintage peach Mushroom Camel Wisteria Pistachio Buttermilk You will also need a 6 mm Crochet hook and possibly a 6.5 mm crochet hook for the foundation chain or loosen your tension for this row. If you want to adjust the size of your blanket then the rule of thumb for a granny stripe is to chain in multiples of three and then add two more chains. So for this blanket I chained 195 then added two more at the end to total 197. Choose your preferred order of colours. I laid one of each colour in a row then took a photo, mixing them up and taking photos of each mix every time, then chose the most appealing order for me. I chose to use the pistachio colour intermittently; otherwise I kept the order of colour throughout. You may wish to use a larger hook for the foundation chain because if it is worked too tightly your blanket will be distorted. If you are new to crocheting you may find my instructional videos below useful for making your blanket.  Row 1 - Chain 197 and work one double crochet (dc) in 2nd chain from hook. Then work a dc in each chain until you reach the end. 196 stitches (sts). Now turn your work ready to go back the other way. Row2 – Chain 3, work 1 treble (tr) into the first stitch. *Miss 2 sts and then work 3 tr into the next st*. Repeat from * to * until 3 sts before the end, miss 2 sts and work 2 tr into the last st. Turn. Row 3 – Ch3 and working in the space between the trebles on the previous row, work 3 tr. Work 3 tr into each space between the trebles on the previous row until the last stitch – this will be the 3rd chain of the chain 3 you made at the start of the previous row, make 1 tr stopping when you have 2 sts left on your crochet hook. Cut the first colour leaving a tail. Finish the 2 sts left on your crochet hook with your next colour. Tie the tails of the 2 colours once to hold in place. You are now ready to continue. Turn. I find this method of joining in new colours the neatest. Row 4 – Ch3, work 1 tr in to the first space between the trebles of the previous row. Now work 3 trebles in each space between the trebles of the previous row until you get to the final space. Work 1 tr into the space and 1 tr into the 3rd chain of the chain 3 at the beginning of the previous row. Again, I think this practice makes the neatest edge. Turn. Row 5 – Ch 3, work 3 trebles into each space between the trebles of the previous row. Once you reach the end of the row make 1 tr into the 3rd chain of the ch 3 at the start of the previous row, stopping when you have 2 sts left on your crochet hook. Cut this colour leaving a tail and complete the treble with the next colour. Tie the tail ends together once. You may find it easier to sew your tail ends in as you go as it is an enormous job to tackle at the end. Repeat rows 4 and 5, working two rows of each colour until the desired length has been reached. Fasten off. Border I made a row of double crochet all the way round the edge of my blanket, working 3 double crochet in each corner. I then finished with a round of crab stitch. This gives the edging a nice ropey effect that I thought was fitting for this chunky blanket. Crab stitch is just a reverse double crochet and is completed as follows; Join yarn to any side of your blanket and ch 1. Insert your hook in the stitch to the right of your ch 1. Grab your yarn with the hook and pull through – 2 sts on hook. Yarn over your hook and pull through these last 2 sts and that’s it. You follow this all the way round your blanket doing exactly the same, even on the corners. Be prepared to have to twist your hook around a bit more than usual in order to pick up your yarn going in this direction. It may seem a bit awkward at first but go slowly, you’ll be fine. I have added A link to a tutorial for the crab stitch however it uses American crochet terminology so a Double Crochet (UK crochet term) will be referred to as a Single Crochet (American crochet term). The crab stitch is referred to as a Reverse Single Crochet. However they are exactly the same stitch.

44,How to Make an Abstract Painting Using Tissue Paper,art," Learn how to create beautiful paintings to decorate your home or to offer as a gift to your friends and family. You can learn different painting techniques and understand how to apply them. Before starting to paint a logical question arises. What is the best medium you should use? Oil colors are more difficult to use and the necessary solvents also require a certain amount of experience. As a beginner, you should start with colors such as gouache, watercolor, or acrylic colors. Watercolor and gouache require a different technique than acrylic colors because they remain active, that is underlying layers can be blended when we add water or other colors. By comparison, acrylic colors dry hard and new colors can be applied over them and therefore it allows the artist to work on layers. There are special colors used for glass or textiles and they have different characteristics, which have to be taken into consideration when starting to work. Another aspect to be considered by the artist is the painting surface. Canvas, cardboard, wood, paper, or glass are some of those surfaces. For the color application, you can use brushes, which are of different types as well as other tools, such as sponges, tissue paper, cotton pads, etc. Buying brushes that have a better quality will prevent them from shedding or losing their shape. When you start a painting you should begin with the bigger brushes and then use the finer ones later on, for the details. You can wipe and dry your brushes with a paper towel, use a palette for color mixing, an old towel to clean and dry your hands, as well as a water container for the colors. To mix colors you can use a palette knife. If you’re looking for new ways to get creative with color and make your house more beautiful, then here’s a fun technique to try at home, which is easy and therefore fit for beginners, called tissue paper painting! Materials: Tissue paper Paintbrush for mixing the colors Painting palette Paint Canvas Take a corner of the tissue paper and fold it. Prepare the paints on the palette, by mixing white and black. Prepare 2 or more different shades of grey paint on the palette. Each shade should be deeper than the other. Take a corner of the tissue paper and fold it. Start applying the paint on the top side of the canvas using tissue paper. After applying one grey shade, apply another, adding parallel lines on the canvas. Remember to also apply the color on the edge of the canvas, so that you can also hang the painting on the wall without a frame if you want. Once the grey color is finished, take another tissue paper and apply the white color, by creating further parallel lines on the canvas. Continue by drawing some black lines in the same direction, remembering that those lines should be thinner and shorter. Now you can take another folded tissue paper and add the final color, gold. Don't forget to add the color to the edge of the canvas, as well. Now the painting is ready and all you need to do is let it dry. Additionally, after it has dried, you can also add a layer of varnish, if you want to make the paint more durable and increase the gloss. You can frame it, or simply hang it on the wall, without a frame, because you have also decorated the edges of the painting. Your new painting will now decorate your home, and your friends and family will be able to admire your art."
45,Making a Miniature Bread Using Polymer Clay,art," Polymer clay is a good medium to be used by beginners because it is very versatile and gives you the possibility of using your imagination to create a great variety of shapes. Learning a few simple techniques will allow you to obtain the best results when working with polymer clay. One characteristic of this type of clay, as compared to other types, such as air-dry clay, is that it does not necessarily require the application of a protective layer of sealer. Baking makes polymer clay water-resistant and it will withstand wear and humidity very well. In fact, some of the varnishes are problematic, and it is always good to test them before use and to only use them if it is really necessary. Some types of varnishes can peel, become cloudy, or sticky and this is one more reason why they should be avoided. Sometimes the use of varnish is necessary, such as in the case of decorating the surface of your items with gold foil, or mica powder to prevent the decorations from rubbing off. If polymer clay is kept for a longer period of time it may become hard and crumbly. Nevertheless, it is not necessary to dispose of it, because there are several methods to make it soft again. One useful method is to warm the clay. This will make it softer and easier to work with. You can either put it on a heater or place it in a plastic bag and put it in some hot water. Another method is adding some mineral oil or liquid clay. In order to obtain a resistant and beautiful polymer clay item, baking is very important. While underbaking leads to breakage, overbaking will lead to a darkening of the colors. Always use a thermometer when baking and never bake at a temperature lower than indicated on the package, since this will make the item brittle. As a rule, you should consider that baking a little longer than indicated will make the clay more durable and resistant to wear. It is recommended to protect your projects from burning during the baking process. You can use an inverted lid or some aluminum foil to do that. Never use nail polish on your polymer clay, because it will dissolve it and make it sticky. Paint can be used on clay, and most acrylic colors do not create problems, nevertheless, it is useful to test the colors you will use, because, depending on their chemical structure, some colors may remain sticky. Regarding the polymer clay brands, there are different brands on the market, and each of them has different characteristics. If you are a beginner, it is useful to use major brands such as Fimo, Premo, or Cernit. When storing your clay, you don't necessarily have to wrap it up, as you would do with air dry clay, but it is recommended to keep it away from heat sources. In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how to create this miniature bread out of polymer clay. Materials: - polymer clay in beige and white - soft pastel - baby powder - a brush - cutters Mix the beige and white polymer clay to create the bread dough. Create the shape of the bread. Using the cutter, create the scoring pattern on top of the bread. Start by adding the yellow pastel using the brush. Apply the second color, orange. Then apply the final color, brown, to give the crust a realistic aspect. Now sprinkle a little bit of baby powder on the top of the bread and bake the item according to the instructions on your polymer clay packaging. The polymer clay bread is ready now and you can enjoy turning it into a jewelry item or a charm!"

Knot the end of the cord to stop the square sliding knot from sliding off when you finish the bracelet. Cut the cord end. Make a second knot at the other end of the metal link. Now the link has a knot on both ends. Knot the other end of the cord as well. Cut the cord end. Now use the lighter to burn both cord ends. Cut your thin strip of leather to the desired length and attach the metal link with the cord. To prevent the cord from moving while working, attach the cord to the leather strip using a clamp. Take a piece of cord, make a loop on the leather strip, next to the metal link, wrap the cord around the loop several times, pass one end of the cord through the loop and pull the other end of the cord to tighten the loop. Remove the clamp as soon as the cord has been attached. Now burn the ends of this cord. Wrap cord on both sides of the metal link, to attach the link to the leather strip. Move the clamp to the end of the leather strip, in order to wrap the nylon cord here as well. Take another piece of cord, make a loop at the end of the leather strip, wrap the cord around the loop several times, pass one end of the cord through the loop and pull the other end of the cord to tighten the loop. Cut the cord with the scissors. Burn the ends of the cord with the lighter. Now that the cord has been attached to the leather strip, take a short piece of cord to create the square sliding knot. Lay out the bracelet, making sure you have knotted the ends. This stops the finished knot from sliding off. Tie the cord knot using either an overhand or reef knot around the bracelet cords. Take the left-hand cord and bring it down crossing over the right cord. Take the left cord under the main bracelet cords and make sure you go under both cords. Then bring the left cord up through the loop you left in the right-hand cord and pull both ends together. This is now the first knot of the square knot done. Next, repeat the steps but on the other side. So lay the right-hand cord across the bracelet, leaving a loop. Then repeat the steps to make a few more complete square knots. To hide the ends cut off the excess cord. Burn the ends with a lighter. And that’s it! The sliding knot and your bracelet are ready! Now you can enjoy wearing your new handcrafted bracelet or offer it as a gift to someone you love."

Later it was converted into a Hindu shrine dedicated to Mandapeshwar Shiva. in the 16th century, the Portuguese occupied the area and started using these caves as a Christian shrine. They constructed a church (the Church of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception) in 1544 AD on top of the hill in which the caves are cut; that old church is in ruins now. In the early part of 18th century the Mahrattas defeated the Portuguese and caves got back their past Hindu heritage. But in the later half of the 18th century, the Mahrattas were defeated by the British, and a new church (The Church of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception) was constructed on the North-west side of the caves.After independence, the caves again started functioning as a Hindu shrine. It is under the protection of ASI (archeological Survey of India).The ruins of the old church is also under protection of archeological society. Mandapeshwar caves and the ruins of the old Church on top Mandapeshwar caves, protected by a fence, is situated just beside a busy road near Shivaji Nagar bus stand. On entering the premises, there is a big garden in front, beyond which is the hill with the caves. On top of the low hill the ruins of the old church can be seen. The caves have three parts : the main cave is situated centrally, flanked by other secondary caves. Mandapeshwar caves The huge cave, cut in the rock, is rectangular in shape. In front there is the Mandapa, which is a large space supported by several decorated stone columns. There are several relief works on the walls, most of which are now eroded and difficult to interpret. There is a small but beautiful stone statue of Nandi the bull, the Vahana or vehicle of Lord Shiva, in the sitting posture facing the sanctum. There is a beautiful stone-made lampstand near the Nandi statue with burning lamps. There is a broken stone statue of the hind portion of an animal just adjacent to the Nandi statue. From the looks of the hind portion of the body and the tail, it looks like a bull. Most probably it was the old/original Nandi statue. The sanctum is again a big rectangular room with some blurred images in relief work on the walls. There are two Shivalingams (the aniconic phallic form of Lord Shiva) in the sanctum. One is old, an elongated stone Lingam with signs of ageing on it, the other, near the back wall, is smaller and rather new. Both the Shivalingams are worshiped by the devotees.

These are devoid of any idols, and looks like the Vihara of the Buddhist caves elsewhere. Cave on the left of central caves, Mandapeswar At first, there is a small Mandapa supported by well decorated pillars. On the western wall of this Mandapa, there is a huge high relief work depicting Lord Shiva with Goddess Parvati and several other figures, supposedly of the ""Gana""-s, who were companions of Lord Shiva and other nymphs and minor gods and goddesses The beautiful relief work shows Lord Shiva in His human-like Nataraja form. Though the image is partly broken, especially in the lower part, still the grace and beauty of Nataraja is clearly visible. Inside the Mandapa, there is a big rectangular hall like cave, again resembling the Vihara portion of a Buddhist cave. It is empty.
