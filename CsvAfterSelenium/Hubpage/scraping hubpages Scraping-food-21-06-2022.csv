0,Amazing Packaged Healthy Food & Snacks,food," Nabeel is a senior content writer and editor at first move digital, he loves to write every day. www.google.com When you ask ‘is packaged foods a good career path?’, you can be sure the answer is yes because food is required by everyone and the food packaging specialist will design food containers that meet every safety and hygiene requirement. Good, wholesome food with fresh flavors is possible when you’re working hard at your desk. Covid 19 has seen many people putting more emphasis on eating healthily and the food industry has rallied to satisfy consumers’ needs. Packaged healthy foods offer convenience and safety and packaged food technologists are responsible for making sure that all foods reach consumers fresh and safe www.google.com Attractive food packaging is essential because brands are highly competitive. High-quality, attractive packing that is robust and tightly sealed is important if these brands want their products to sell. Being creative is what will allow a company to stand out. They make use of trendy food packaging materials such as - Customers are drawn to products that have visual appeal because of the trendy, functional packaging. Apart from visual appeal, packaging needs to be protective, and also easy to open. The pandemic has also had an impact on the way people buy food. People are more interested in packaged foods because it's hygienic and safe to order online. Hygiene and safety are super important to prevent illness. If you want to become a packaged food specialist, dealing with food will require you to have a degree as you will need to know how to package the food and snack product.  www.google.com Look at the packaging for mixed berries as an example. A wonderfully healthy snack is mixed frozen berries in Greek yogurt and whipped up together in a blender. A smoothie like this is rich in vitamin C and fiber. Properly frozen foods maintain their flavor, color, and texture than foods preserved in other ways. The packaging has to make sure that oxygen doesn’t enter and change the color and flavor of improperly packaged foods. Packaged healthy foods and snacks, therefore, have to be moisture-proof, durable, leakproof, and easy to seal. This is what protects food from odors and flavors. Different kinds of foods will require different kinds of packaging, Liquid-type foods will be packaged differently to dry foods. So packing technologists will be responsible for the design of a range of packaging products. They will have to sample different materials and source sustainable, biodegradable materials while keeping costs in mind. www.google.com Retailers have done their research and seen how consumers have turned to healthy foods and snacks for both adults and kids. Pre-packaged goods became important during the lockdown as people were told to work from home. Fresh foods and snacks such as nuts, dried sausages, and nuts have gained favor. Research tells us that while people are working from home, they appreciate that food packaging helps them with choosing the correct portion sizes too. They will buy a frozen macaroni and cheese that says suitable for 2 people or suitable for 4 or 8 people. Covid-19 has seen consumers taking a new look at their diets. They’re wanting foods that are quick and easy to prepare and that can boost their immunity and help with stress. They want foods and snacks with natural ingredients such as fruit, vegetables, and nuts. www.pixabay.com Food packaging specialists are responsible for finding economical but robust and eco-friendly packaging options. They have to be clued up on how long these food containers will last on the shelf. Customers demand food that is fresh, crisp, and tasty with an accurate sell-by-date. The best packaged healthy foods and snacks include healthy ingredients such as vitamins, probiotics, herbs, and antioxidants. It’s important to read labels as they tell you which products come packed with preservatives, artificial coloring, and high-fructose corn syrup among others. Coming up with snack foods today is a complex process. Consumers are fussier than ever and foods and snacks have to be well labeled. The labels have to display information that says things such as ‘fewer calories and fats’ or ‘rich source of protein’. The food industry has become a massively hot market in the past 2 years. With people working more at home, they want healthy, organic, portable snacks as well as healthy, prepared meals delivered to their door. www.pixabay.com This content is accurate and true to the best of the author’s knowledge and is not meant to substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional. © 2022 Nabeel"
1,RightOnTrek Brings You The Meals For Trekkin,food," Television takes a hit when summer comes because more people go outside. But in actuality spending time in the outdoors is something people should do all year ‘round — because it’s healthy and good exercise and a way to enjoy the world. Camping and hiking increased recently because having to be inside was just too much and more people than ever before found the great outdoors, well, a great place to be. So more folks went outside for getting their exercise and moving around and seeing new areas of parks and forests. And hiking definitely is a great way to spend time outdoors, with getting the needed gear for doing it safely and right being a bit of fun in itself. But one thing that most don’t find enjoyable is having to figure out what kinds of food to bring with them — and that means snacks too — especially if they’re out for the entire day and not just taking a jaunt. Or multiple days. It means a lot of things when the belly isn’t full and all those calories being burned hiking up a mountain trail result in a grumbling tummy. What’s needed are ready to go meals, but not something super complicated or just a jumble of foodstuffs put together without any real idea of what lies ahead, but a sensible and organized meal plan for the day that a person can rely on. And which tastes good too, don’t you know. RightOnTrek understands that because they’re all about made to order backpacking meals that get shipped to you ready for business. Because a proper meal makes hiking or camping pleasant and enjoyable. RightOnTrek will let you customize your meals for multi-day use, go ala cart or sell you a BackCountry Meal Kit that’s a full day nicely compacted in a carry sack with even a carabiner pinching at the top. So we went with BackCountry #2 and #5; for example found in #5 (Vegetarian) is plenty of protein packed, calories-restoring edibles, broken down by Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner: from Cranberry Walnut oatmeal and of course dark coffee (condiments provided), to lunch with Vegan jerky (more flavorful, less spicy in our opinion) and snacks like a Chex mix, raisins, Montana-made Lentil Crunchers and a dried fruit bar. For dinner there’s Bechamet style Mac and Cheese, a chocolate bar and hot tea (note: not a complete list of what #5 provides). But what about for those not going the Vegan route — that’s where #2 comes in (and again not a complete list): for breakfast there’s a Cheesy Mushroom Egg Scramble and crackers, with lunch hitting on Beef jerky, cheddar cheese, 3-seed crackers and a granola bar. Dinner sees Chicken Alfredo Pasta and a chocolate bar and hot tea. Because we really liked the looks of that Cheesy, we took an early morning hike just so we could try it out. And yeah the effort of bringing what was needed to be able to cook/heat it up and eat in a relatively civil manner might have seemed a bit excessive, but still it was worth it — surprisingly fluffy and tasty. And the coffee slip was fine too. RightOnTrek, as noted earlier, makes their meals available outside of the kits, for example there being a method for creating multi-day meal plans. But instead, let’s explore just what they offer ala carte and which are referred to as Adventure Meals: Breakfast — Banana Bread Oatmeal, Blueberry Bliss Granola with Yogurt, Hearty Morning Coconut Granola and Savory Mountain Grits, and the Cheesy Scramble and Cranberry Oatmeal previously noted. Dinner (but hey if you prefer it as lunch go ahead) — Backcountry Chili and the Mac and Cheese previously noted, Chicken Alfredo Pasta and Chicken Coconut Curry, General Tsoys Mountain Rice and Hearty Beef Bolognese. Also High Country Pad Thai and Vegan Shepard’s Stew, Broccoli Beef Stroganoff and Cauliflower Forest Chicken Risotto. RightOnTrek’s website does more than just offer purchases — they provide details for planning one’s next hiking adventure and noting custom itineraries created by the hiking community gathered on the site. Custom maps can be ordered and tailored for one’s pace, starting point and season and of course building a trail menu from their edibles is right there — and for sure they’re concerned about sustainability and the environment.

2,A Very Delectable Zucchini Dish and an Egg Alternative to Tuna Fish,food," garlic powder I stumbled on a summer squash appetizer,

mostly by luck and experimentation in

my mostly humble cooking abilities.

I sliced several fresh golden squash

into 1/4 "" to 1/2' slices and then laid

them out on foil coated with olive oil

in a baking pan. 

I preheated the oven

to 350 because it takes my oven a

long time to preheat. I always prehate

this delay even more

I then melted two sticks of butter

in the microvwave (for a healthier base

you can use olive oil)and then removed

the bowl of liquid butter to use as

a baste. Into the bowl of liquid butter

I add a generous amount of fresh

garlic as well as a generous amount

of parmesan cheese. I have also at

times added Italian bread crumbs

if i desire a more crunchy finished

appetizer. I stir it all together in the

bowl until it makes a smooth paste
 
and then using a spoon I plop an
 
amount on each goden squash slice
 
and spread it across the diameter
 
of each cut piece to the edges.
 
I then place it in my oven
 
and let it cook 10 to 15 minutes
 
until every slice is sizzling and the paste
 
has started to brown on top. You must keep
 
an eye on the squash so that it doesn't
 
burn. The paste almost every time acts as
 
an insulator so it's not a big problem.
 
Then I move the pan to my oven rack so that it
 
sits about six inches below the broiler.
 
I let it broil for a minute or so till the paste
 
on top turns a golden brown.
 
then walla, you have a juicy, cheesy
 
garlicky flavored, slice of pure heaven
 
for your taste buds to savor.
 
You can also use zucchini
 
following the same recipe.
 
I have never served this to anyone
 
who did not absolutely love it.
 
Give it a try!
 
My next recipe is basically an addition
 
to tuna salad to make it tangy and to
 
lessen a bit of the fishy taste that tuna
 
is known for. You should buy a jar of
 
pickeld eggs and instead of using regular
 
eggs in your tuna salad replace them with
 
sliced pickled eggs. The eggs that are
 
pickled in beets are the best and they
 
help to change and enhance the flavor
 
of your tuna fish salad or sandwich.
 
Of course if you hate pickled eggs forget it.
 
I have also made deviled eggs this way
 
using pickled eggs and then laying the
 
mushed yolk in each half to be served after
 
chilling. Its a switch form the norm and the
 
bright purplish, maroon egg halves look
 
so pretty with the yellow yolk crowns. My dream recipe which I drool over
but have never eaten or found anywhere
is stuffed cabbage with a twist.
no rice or the usial beef for the stuffing.
Just finely ground corned beef stiffed
in each cabbage rolled tightly.
Cabbage and corn beef were meant
to be paired they compliment each other
so well but I have never fun cabbage
stuffed with corn beef. perhaps a small
dollop of mustard blended in to the corned
beef for those of you who like it spicy.
or even a dollop of finely ground sauerkraut
would be ideal if it were mixed in to the
corned beef stuffing?
The problem I run into is that you
don't want to use a tomato sauce on
stuffed corn beef cabbage. and a mustard
sauce would most likely overpower the
flavor of the corned beef. Perhaps a swiss
cheese sauce similiar to what you'd find in
a fondue would be delightful and maybe a
dash of saurkraut juice in the swiss cheese
sauce would enhance it even more. I am still
working on the perfect sauce for this recipe.
but I will bet all of my readers mouths are
watering at the thought of such a treat.
I have always wanted to prepare hundreds
of these and sell them from a carnival booth
at the local fair in my nieghborhood. 

It would take a lot of work but offering 
the crowds two stuffed cabbages of corn 

beef times eight hundred or so
I just might recoup some profit. 
That's a lot of cabbages and stuffing.
I hope my recipe ideas will bring some of
you a tasty delight at your next meal. © 2022 Matthew Frederick Blowers III"
3,Sno-Balls: How a Sub-Tropical Metropolis Became Known for Its Sno(w),food," I am a 6th generation New Orleans native and the daughter of a former sno-ball stand owner. When people think of New Orleans, snow is not something that comes to mind, especially during the summer months. There is a good reason for this; the sub-tropical climate makes for a town more synonymous for its overbearing humidity. Ironically, however, it is this incalescent tenor that overtakes the area that has long been the inspiration for this snow. For years, residents and visitors alike have sought ways to beat the heat, thus leading to the creation of one of New Orleans' most iconic summer treats. What began with street vendors manually scraping blocks of ice has through the years grown into a staple that has expanded beyond the confines of New Orleans and is steadily spreading across the country. Refreshing, affordable, and customizable to personal taste, their popularity is no wonder. We can thank two New Orleans gentlemen for getting the ball rolling (no pun intended) and creating the industry known as Sno-Balls. Center image is a relic from my father's sno-ball stand back in 1976. First things first -- it does not do the sno-ball justice without clarifying what the sno-ball isn't. This means pointing out its distinction from a snow cone, as sold in your conventional ice cream trucks and concession stands. Though the two confections may look similar -- are commonly thought to be one in the same -- only one has the consistency of actual snow. This is because rather than crushing the ice, it is finely shaved, allowing it to absorb your flavored syrup of choice rather than having it simply poured over top (and sinking to the bottom). Gerard Hansen of the Hansen family who are the founders of the oldest operating sno-ball stand in the world, explains: ""You actually put the syrup on in layers to get consistency throughout the body of the sno-ball. So therefore, the flavor stays with you throughout the process of eating it."" Sno-balls are also far more elaborate. There is generally a wider variety of flavors, with the option of adding toppings (condensed milk is especially popular) or even stuffing them with ice cream. Some establishments have made the decoration of the sno-ball an art form, such as Snola in Uptown New Orleans, famous for their cheesecake-stuffed version. Autochrome image of children gathered around a French Quarter sno-ball vendor, published in the April 1930 issue of National Geographic. National Geographic New Orleanians' enjoyment of shaved ice during the summer months can be traced as far back as the 19th century, when vendors used to chip the shavings off of an ice block by hand. By the 1920's, this practice became popular, and hand-held ice shavers were designed explicitly for the purpose. In the 1930's, two machinists dedicated themselves to improving this method, albeit for different reasons. While their respective enterprises evolved independently of one another, it would seem they developed side by side, as both provided New Orleans with just the thing in the midst of the Great Depression during those infamous summer heat waves. These two men were Ernest Hansen and George Ortolano. Ernest and Mary Hansen and their ""Sno Bliz"" machine. Only In Your State The first of New Orleans' sno-ball pioneers was Ernest Hansen, who engineered the ships docked along the Mississippi. On one of these sweltering summer days, he and his son were craving some shaved ice. They caught an ice cart wheeling past, where the vendor manually shaved the ice from a large block. Hansen was disenchanted by this method, as it made the ice prone to sweaty hands plus the dirt and grime particles of the city air prior to even getting to eat it. Motivated to improve the sanitation of the product, he sought a more hands-off method of preparing the ice. Using his engineering background, Hansen got to work in 1933 to construct an entirely electric ice shaving machine. He completed his invention in 1934. At first, Hansen's machine was strictly a home and family affair, but two years later his wife, Mary, got the idea to set it up outside on a makeshift stand and sell shaved ice topped with her homemade flavored syrups. This experiment was successful, and by 1939, the family was able to open their first brick and mortar store and trademarked their sno-balls under the name ""Sno-Bliz."" They moved to their current location, a white shack on Tchoupitoulas Street, in 1944. Mary continued to make all of her syrups from scratch. Though she had started with the ""safe,"" familiar flavors of strawberry, blueberry, and grape, customer satisfaction emboldened her to experiment. She entered a period of frenzied flavor innovation and created such new flavors as cream of nectar, cream of coconut, and even chocolate. These syrups would be made fresh each day to ensure their quality -- a tradition that granddaughter Ashley, who runs the sno-ball stand today, has continued. Hansen's Sno-Bliz remains the world's oldest operating sno-ball stand, still running Ernest Hansen's original Sno-Bliz machine, which he patented in 1950. Hansen's is iconic for their exotic -- and sometimes limited -- flavors, concocted with secret recipes. Some of these include: ""Brown Pelican"" (root beer based), cream of wedding cake, and banana's foster, topped with real bananas caramelized in brown sugar and vanilla. George Ortolano in front of his corner grocery store. SnoWizard Almost parallel to the shaved ice enterprising of Ernest Hansen, George Ortolano, son of Sicilian immigrants, developed a similar vision. Unlike Hanen, Ortolano was already an established entrepreneur. He owned a small grocery store, which he was struggling to keep afloat during the Great Depression. He noticed a gathering of customers at a nearby snow cone stand, was inspired to sell the inexpensive treat in his store to draw in new customers. In 1936, Ortolano created his own ice shaving machine to produce ""fine, fluffy, shaven"" snow from blocks of ice used in household ice boxes. The second world war, however, interrupted his business developments, and his engineering efforts were temporarily re-directed towards shipbuilding for the military. Ortolano meanwhile acquainted his family with his machine, who, in turn, introduced the sno-ball to their own grocery stores. The sale of sno-balls generated a slow but steady stream of new business. Regulars buying these sno-balls in Ortolano's store became intrigued with his machine, and Ortolano soon began receiving requests for it from people eager to begin their own businesses. Unlike Ernest Hansen, who opted to keep his machine unique to his own shop, Ortolano was open to the idea of selling his invention, and set out to improve his original wooden machine for commercial use and production. He developed a new model made from galvanized metal, incorporating knowledge he had gained from his shipyard experience during wartime. If Ortolano was going to sell his machine, however, he would need a name. He considered many, with ""Ice Commando"" being a top candidate. Ultimately, he settled on the name of ""Snow Wizard"" because it was, by his own description, ""like magic the way it turned blocks of ice into fine, fluffy snow."" Conceptual drawing of George Ortolano's SnoWizard machine. SnoWizard As demand for Ortolano's Snow Wizard machine increased, so did the time he would spend manufacturing them. He abandoned the grocery business completely to devote all of his energies to his budding new enterprise. After initially manufacturing most of his machine parts by hand, Ortolano was forced to automate production to keep pace with sales. Blueprints were drawn to standardize the parts and automate assembly, and the galvanized metal was upgraded to stainless steel. This re-designed model warranted a modernized take on the machine's name. The ""w"" was dropped from ""snow,"" and the two words were fused together into one: SnoWizard. Like Mary Hansen, Ortolano's wife, Josie (affectionally known as ""Mrs. O""), created her own flavors from original recipes. The flavors and extracts from the family grocery store gave her a plethora of possibilities. Josie's trademark was to combine flavors with cream, which earned her the nickname ""Queen of Cream"" from customers. Her nectar cream, ice cream, and chocolate cream flavors became local favorites. Today, the SnoWizard enterprise continues to supply both their machines and their endless array of flavors to sno-ball makers worldwide. Pelicans' ""Unicorn"" sno-ball. Ehren E. Grunewald There are a few sno-ball joints that operate year-round, but most establishments only sell them seasonally. Sno-ball season generally runs from March to October. While New Orleans remains, by far, the hotbed for sno-ball options, the industry has been growing nationwide. Pelicans, for instance, has built up a large chain with locations spanning over 17 states. Look up ""sno-balls"" (or ""snoballs"") in your local area to see if this tasty treat is available near you!"

What I Liked About Mod Pizza If you’re looking for a quick, affordable option when it comes to dining out with friends or family, Mod Pizza may be what you’re looking for. After waiting in line and ordering my pizza, I was blown away by how fast everything was prepared. My pizza was ready in less than 10 minutes—and that included dicing up my toppings and adding them myself! As someone who works in an office environment each day, speed of service like that is hard to come by these days. Even better? The price tag was extremely reasonable for all of us on a budget. At just $7 per person, we were able to enjoy lunch without feeling guilty about spending too much money.I Liked What I Didn't Like: While there isn’t much to love about Mod Pizza if there were one thing that could use improvement it would be their sauce options. While they do offer some unique sauce choices (like roasted garlic cream), they don’t offer as many as other pizzerias do. What I Didn't Like About Mod Pizza As much as I love Mod, there are some things they could improve on. My biggest complaint is that their pizza isn't traditional enough. After living in Chicago for four years, I know what deep dish pizza tastes like. While Mod's ingredients are fresh and tasty, they don't have that great combination of deep-dish crust and sauce/toppings that makes Chicago style so popular. If you're looking for something more traditional than flatbread, then you might want to check out Grimaldi's instead of Mod. But if you're just looking for a quick meal at an affordable price, then definitely try Mod! The service is always fast and friendly, too. I highly recommend it! I would recommend Mod to anyone who wants delicious food but doesn't want to pay through the nose for it. With a wide variety of options and locations all over California, it's easy to find one near you (or simply order online!)."
15,All the Tea in China! But What About the Tea in Turkey?,food," My writing includes my personal travel experiences, destination, history, and cultural information. Turkish Tea And Simit Bread The drinking of teas in Turkey is not only a social ritual but has a substantial economic impact on the country. Imagine this.... Turkey is the 5th largest exporter of tea globally, but at the same time, the nationals are the largest consumer in the world; with an average of seven pounds per person annually. That's a lot of tea! Tea, Simit bread, and backgammon are an integral part of social gatherings in Turkey. We will discuss that social tradition later in this article. Records tell us that tea has been an essential part of the culture in Turkey as far back as the 5th century when it was used to barter with China. Coffee was hugely popular but after World War I, the availability of coffee was limited and became very expensive. It was at this time, that the consumption of tea skyrocketed. It was also at this time, that the government became involved in the tea harvest and the export of the leaves became an important source of revenue. By the mid-1800s, tea had become the beverage of choice for the Turkish people. And today, it is still the preferred go-to. Served in ince belli, clear tulip-shaped glasses, the ritual of this beverage is found in households, shops, and kıraathane (teas houses for men only). The ince belli has given Istanbul a huge economic boost as the hand-blown glass industry has seen profound growth. The glasses used for this fabulous infusion are an important part of the tradition. After being prepared in a double-stacked pot, the beverage is served at a boiling hot temperature. The water from the smaller of the two pots is held back to dilute the tea for those who prefer a weaker variety. Typically, Turkish tea is very strong. The stronger version, very crimson in color, is called koyu and the weaker version is acik. Respectively, the words translate to dark and light. The glasses are not gripped like a mug but instead are held by the fingertips at the rim. Sugar is often used in this infused beverage although milk is not. Double Stacked Teapots are Called ""Caydanlık"" Black teas are the preferred type in Turkey. Rize Turist Çay is the preferred brand throughout the country. Other popular brands include Dogadan Cay, Dogus Cay, Lipton, and Ofcay. Homegrown tea is actually preferred by nationals. The tea is usually infused as a loose leaf as opposed to bagged. While Black tea is a social tradition, herbal varieties are used for holistic purposes. Apple is commonly consumed for digestive issues and to boost the immune system. It is also thought to balance blood sugar. Yarrow is thought to have anti-inflammatory properties and Sage is considered a ""heal all"". Along with the tea, simit bread is served. Taste and texture vary by region but this bread is compared to an American bagel, similar in shape and encrusted with seeds (sesame, poppy, flax, and sunflower). While tea is consumed with simit, the bread itself is not always served with tea. Street vendors sell the bread and it is considered a typical breakfast choice served with fruit preserves or cheese. Although tea has been a social tradition for what seems like forever, the younger people have also embraced the ritual. For that reason, tea cafes are popping up in record numbers. In the cafes, especially in the kıraathane, backgammon is commonly part of the social aspect of drinking this time-honored beverage.  We all travel for different reasons. No matter why we travel, to some degree, we experience cultural emersion in our destination. Even if our emersion is simply enjoying different food and drink that counts! Personally, I love to discover the local traditions and the impact those traditions have on the lives of local people. The drinking of teas and the simit bread in Turkey was a surprise for me. I had always equated Turkish coffee (in small cups with someone waiting to read the leaves) as the social tradition of the country. From my experience, I learned the economic impact (the export of tea, the glassblowers, and the sprouting up of new cafes) was in many cases, life-changing for many. The economics doesn't even address the importance of the social aspect this tradition brings to the table. Traditions around the world have stood the test of time because everyone benefits in one way or another. What traditions do you observe and how do they impact your life? What new traditions have you been exposed to while traveling? I invite you to come back and leave comments in the section provided.

Cultivation of potatoes in South America may go back 10,000 years, but tubers do not preserve well in the archaeological record, making identification difficult. A flatbread is a bread made with flour; water, milk, yogurt, or other liquid; and salt, and then thoroughly rolled into flattened dough. Potato flatbread – in pancake, scone, or potato cake form – is popular all over the world, and it's not hard to see why. The result is a fluffy, tender, flexible gluten-free flatbread without yeast. Flatbreads can be frozen. Just stack the individually cooked flatbreads between layers of parchment/ baking paper and freeze. The flatbread dough keeps well for 4 to 5 days in the fridge. Just seal it in an airtight bag so it doesn't dry out and then you can make fresh sweet potato flatbreads throughout the week."

18,"Shrimp, Mussels and Clams, Oh My! Learn How to Cook Buzara Like an Authentic Croatian!",food," My writing includes my personal travel experiences, destination, history, and cultural information. Shrimps Buzara After my most recent visit to Dubrovnik and your virtual visit, it's time for us to explore one of the most traditional dishes of the region. Buzara, which is similar to a stew, is made with shrimp. Using the same recipe, you can substitute mussels or clams. There are two types of Buzara; red and white. The difference is the white Buzara is made with white wine and the red is made with red wine and a bit of tomato paste. Typically, in Dubrovnik, you will find the red Buzara. Around the coastal region, where Dubrovnik is located, in Croatia, there are substantial vineyards. Most of those, for some reason, grow red grapes. Europeans always choose fresh local products over importing ingredients and for this reason, the red Buzara is more typical to Dubrovnik. I especially like the red over the white. But, I love seafood, so I'll take either in a heartbeat! If fresh and never frozen shrimp are available in your area, this should be your go-to. Frozen will also work. Most often, the Buzara is served with polenta or pasta. You can also serve it with a salad and crusty bread. My personal preference is to enjoy Buzara with a salad and pasta using the bread to soak up the juice in the bowl! I told you, I always go big! * Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000-calorie diet. Your daily values may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs. Some People Prefer to Mix the Shrimp with the Pasta, I Prefer the Pasta on the Side Pro Cooking Tip: If I am out of bread crumbs, I use a couple of teaspoons of instant mashed potato flakes. Add slowly to the sauce until you reach desired thickness. To be honest, you can use the potato flakes in any dish to thicken. They don't lump up and there is no alteration to the taste. This recipe was for the red Buzara, again, typical to Dubrovnik. Personally, this is one of my favorite dishes. I learned the recipe when living in Europe and it has become a go-to. There aren't a lot of ingredients. This dish can be prepared in about 15-20 minutes and it's simple to make! I also happen to be a seafood lover and this dish fills that craving. Served with pasta and a good, fresh crusty bread, and I'm a happy gal! I have been served Buzara in a few restaurants where they have used a combination of shellfish, namely shrimp, mussels, and squid. In my opinion, Buzara is delicious with whatever shellfish it is prepared with. I hope you have enjoyed this recipe. After giving it a whirl, please come back and leave comments on this article!

20,Rakia: How to Make It and the Important Rules of Drinking It!,food," My writing includes my personal travel experiences, destination, history, and cultural information. Homemade Rakia It seems that Rakia is ""The"" drink of the Balkans! So, it's not surprising that Rakia would be the adult beverage of choice in Croatia. ( The Balkans region includes: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia. Some parts of Greece and Italy are also considered to be Balkan states). And to be honest, I'm told that Rakia is the national drink of every Balkan country! (I'll tell you about my first experience with Rakia in a bit!) Rakia is made by distilling fermented fruit. It's made out of almost any fruit, but I've been offered honey and walnut varieties during my time spent in Albania. Friends, it is some powerful stuff! Medica is raki made with honey. The alcohol content ranges from 45 to 65 percent! When I moved to Albania, I had never heard of Rakia before. Ouzo? Yes. Rakia? No. On my first morning, I went to a local cafe a few blocks from my apartment. I ordered a coffee and along with it, a small metal glass with a clear liquid was served to me. Hey, I was a foreigner, I drank the liquid down. My gosh, it was alcohol! Who would have thought that was served in the early morning hours! Wow! Was I shocked! I can't even tell you that it tasted good because I was instantly on fire down to my toes! Welcome to the Balkans! So, as my education on Rakia continued, there are many things I learned about this drink. The process of making this traditional drink is centuries old. The Kazani has three basic parts. There is the pot, the lid, and a pipe that the steam is used to transfer. The kettle is placed over an open fire. Fire is a critical part of the process of making Rakia. It cannot be too strong or too low. The heat of the fire is important so that the pomace is not burned. Once the liquid reaches the boiling point, drops begin to come from the vaporizer. These first drops are almost pure alcohol. A good temperature to keep while your brew is cooking is about 20 C. The Rakia Kazani As the product distills, there are three parts that are distinctly different. The head and tail are used in the next batch of Rakia, kind of like a starter. Once the distillation process has begun, start to finish is about 3 hours. The distiller gets the perk of tasting the product during the cooking period. It is complete when the desired taste has been achieved.  It's important to note that while Rakia is enjoyed as a national drink in the Balkan countries, it's also found in other countries in some other form. Each country, even within the Balkans, has its own specialty. As mentioned, this beverage is strong. While I know many people who have made a night out drinking Rakia, my experiences are much more sedate. If I was offered a glass, I accepted and drank it. I never could drink it every morning with my coffee. God knows I tried to live the traditional life, but that was one aspect I couldn't maintain! I tasted some Rakia which was really good. It was smooth and had no ""burn"". There were also varieties I drank, that were strong and much harsher. It depends on the brew, the fruit, the distiller, and his/her preferences. And so, when you are traveling, you have the exposure to new and different things. Some experiences you will enjoy for the rest of your life and they will become of you. other experiences, you will look back and say ""I tried, but it's not for me""! And you know what? That's perfectly ok! It was like that for me. I tried it, but it's not my cup of tea. However, I am happy about the experience!

21,5 Delicious Plant-Based Chicken Recipes for New Vegans,food," Cynthia loves sharing delicious and nutritious vegan recipes. Here are five great plant-based chicken recipes for people who are either looking into a vegan lifestyle, or who are looking for delicious meatless recipes in general. Many vegans and plant-based individuals continue to seek to revisit enjoyable pre-vegan food experiences. Chicken dishes were certainly part of many of our happier memories of meals with family and friends. Two of the recipes below-- the Chick'n Pot Pie Soup and the Caesar Chick'n Salad-- are made using the wholefood, non-GMO extruded soy product known as soy curls. Another soy product, tofu, is used to create a delicious faux chicken Chinese cuisine, General Tso's Chick'n. Surprising jackfruit, a tropical tree fruit, turns up in one recipe with its incredible meaty texture in the Butter Chick'n dish , and the final chicken stand-in-- the famous Chick'n-Mushroom-Rice Casserole-- is formed from wheat protein, frequently called gluten or seitan. Bring your own ideas and applications of taste wizardry along. Enjoy these creative comestibles and the blessings of being both imaginative and kind. A take on a General Tso's Tofu Chick'n Bowl--a GF variation of the recipe by Michelle Blackwood at Healthier Steps The first plant-based chicken recipe (chicken-mushroom-rice casserole below) is a wonderful mix of umami and savory flavours of mushroom, rice and herbed gluten (seitan) analog. If you have the time and interest, you can save money by making your own gluten in the traditional manner (recipe in video above). An alternate recipe that eliminates the labour-intense ""washing of the wheat"" and follows (using vital gluten flour). A broth recipe is available to be used with the second recipe. The broth is used to more highly flavour the gluten, and to tenderize it (the longer you cook it). OR for convenience sake, you can purchase the Morning Star or Gardein-type faux chicken strips (plain, no crispy coating). With the commercial gluten you will not have to make a broth. *You can also purchase vegan chicken-like seasoning, or make your own, such as the recipe found HERE (scroll down the article) 1 hour 30 min 1 hour 30 min 3 hours Serves six adults 3 cups vital gluten flour 1/2 cup tapioca flour 1/3 cup whole wheat flour 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast 4 tablespoons chicken-like seasoning* 2 1/4 cups water 1/4 cup soya sauce Ingredients for the Broth   10 cups water 1/2 cup soya sauce 2 tablespoons chicken-like seasoning* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder This is a classic vegan potluck casserole,  without the usual regrettable canned mushroom soup (yay). Get the recipe from Emily at Thank You Berry Much Lindsay over at the Live-In Kitchen promises that this Indian-influenced butter chicken recipe will provide the cook with aroma all day. And that the meaty texture of the jackfruit never fails to impress. In urban settings you should be able to find jackfruit in Asian grocery stores and possibly elsewhere. If you can't find it in your community, you can purchase here from Amazon. Go see this delectable recipe from Lindsay at the Live-In Kitchen If you have not met soy curls yet, you are in for a pleasant adventure. Soy curls are  produced from the whole soy bean, not from an isolate flour. They are extruded and dehydrated, and when re-hydrated they have a very similar look and texture to real chicken 'tenders'. Like tofu, they are great at absorbing the flavours that you cook with (in this case, spices and herbs generally used in cooking chicken). I'm finding the soy curls in a local store, but if you are having a problem getting hold of them you could contact either Butler Foods.com or Amazon. Such a yummy comfort soup is chick'n pot pie soup! Get the recipe from Whirled Soup Don't you just want one of these right now? Get the recipe from Sarah McMinn at My Darling Vegan Tofu is really another word for flavour sponge. This is my favourite tofu recipe-- the flavours are slightly sweet and spicy, such a nice combination, I think. I always feel so great after I dine with the General! My absolute favorite tofu dish!

There is even evidence to suggest that the people of Pompeii – whose city was destroyed by Mount Vesuvius in 79AD – had a widespread focaccia baking and selling industry. Over time, it evolved to become what we now know as the modern pizza. Focaccia bread has ancient origins and its traces date back to the second century BC. It was already prepared by the Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Greeks. Focaccia is a flat leavened oven-baked Italian bread, similar in style and texture to pizza; in some places, it is called ""pizza bianca"" (“white pizza”). The dough of focaccia is flavoured with olive oil and sometimes topped with herbs, vegetables and other ingredients like raisins or olives. The word Focaccia is derived from the Latin word ""focus"", or hearth, and is the precursor of Pizza as known today. Focaccia can be eaten as it is, warmed up, toasted or in other recipes. It can be cut into a variety of shapes, including squares, long skinny rectangles or triangles. It can be sliced in half and used for making sandwiches and is also a tasty addition to a bread basket or an accompaniment to a bowl of soup or a salad."

30,Speedy Berry Crumble Recipe,food," Ryan has been an online writer for over a decade and loves to share and educate. By Marco Verch A great way to enjoy a successful Summer is to make the most of its edible offerings. Particularly, those seasonal fruits will go down well when thrown together in a dessert like a fruit crumble. It's a really fast and simple way to enjoy most fruits during Summertime. Just take your fruit of choice and combine them with sugar; top them with streusel (crumbly dough mix); and pop them into an oven for more than half an hour. Voila! In this recipe, I have for you the means to make a Berry Crumble for the occasion. These fruits won't require cooking--just toss and sit with sugar vanilla and citrus to macerate. The same goes for the topping as the ingredients can be rubbed together to form it. Again, really fast and simple to make. Oh, and above all, it's also quite delicious. Of course, fruit crumble is a healthy dessert for you. In fact, it's among the healthiest desserts to come by and it's mainly because of the fruit. Whether it's an apple, stone fruit, berries, tropical, or a combination of two or more, these desserts can help you stay fit despite the calories. No diet should ever exclude fruit given the benefits of the nutrients. Fruit like apples and blueberries, for example, provide fiber, Vitamin C, and antioxidants. Besides the fruit, brown sugar provides its own wealth of nutrients for your body's everyday needs. This is because, unlike white sugar, brown sugar also contains molasses which gives it the brown color.  It contains minerals including potassium, iron, and calcium, though in small amounts. Still, brown sugar is preferred over white sugar in some recipes. However, you should still be careful how you consume all sugars given some conditions and health risks like diabetes and obesity.

33,Truffles: The Rare Delicacy Hidden by Earth,food," Deepa is a freelance researcher and journalist. She writes and makes documentaries and videos. mfrescoinc.com History tells us that as early as 2000 BCE, the Amorites who lived in Mesopotamia and Syria dug out and ate truffles. Truffle eating habits of the Amorites were proof of the barbarity of these people to the neo-Sumerians, as the rich taste of truffles was unknown to them. There is mention in historical documents that in 3000 BCE, the Babylonians went truffle hunting on beaches and deserts. In the modern world, truffles remain among the few most coveted and delectable food ever.  The ancient Greeks loved truffles and the tradition of truffle hunting is still alive in Greece. Truffles are historically known to have aphrodisiac powers, mythologically a favourite of the love goddess Aphrodite herself, and lauded as divine as they are supposed to have been born when the Greek King of Gods, Zeus, struck the earth with thunderbolts.  mfrescoinc.com The Périgord region of France has a popular fairy tale that tells another story about the origin of truffles. A woman lost in the woods finds an old man who though very poor, treats her to his humble food of burnt potatoes. The woman is a fairy and she turns the potatoes on the plate into tasty truffles. The old man becomes rich selling them but when he dies, his children turn into greedy and lazy lot. The fairy came back after many years. The children of the old man do not offer her food thus making her angry. She hides the truffles under the soil and turns the arrogant offspring of the old man into pigs. Now they have to run around and labour to find the truffles again.  Ancient people used pigs for truffle hunting but once the pigs found them, it was difficult to keep the find safe from being eaten by the pigs themselves. Pigs love truffles. Nowadays, dogs with special training do the part, and the hunters no longer have to worry about their harvest being eaten instantaneously. Dogs have little love for this human delicacy. From 1985, pigs were banned in Italy from being used as truffle hunters as their excitement could destroy the delicate habitat of truffles. There are black truffles and white ones. They grow connecting themselves to the roots of certain trees-the birches, oaks and some more. France and Italy are known for the best quality wild truffles. During the Middle Ages and in the renaissance period especially, truffles were royal treats and coveted gifts. greekreporter.com In Europe, good quality truffles cost 3000 euros per kilo. Of the 80 odd varieties of truffle in the world, only 7 can be cultivated, a fact that ski-jumps the price of this food item. Only in 1815 did someone find a way to cultivate truffles; Joseph Talon, a small farmer of Coragnes, a hamlet in southeastern France, had the ingenuity to find the connection between the truffles he found in his area and the roots of the holm oak trees that grew there. He uprooted a few acorns off the holm oaks and planted them in the barren land he owned. It takes 8 years for truffles to grow and though we do not know exactly how Talon managed to be patient all those long years, we know that he became the first successful farmer to cultivate and harvest truffles. Many tasty varieties of truffle still elude farming; they just do not grow when you try to cultivate them.  UNESCO In 2021, truffle hunting in Italy has been included in the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list by UNESCO. Tuscany in Italy is known for truffle hunting as a tourist attraction. The trained dogs go about the trees in the forest sniffing the ground. Once the dog finds a truffle, it starts digging. But the owner stops the dog and carefully extracts the truffle from the ground using a small spade. Before extraction, the hunter often sniffs it out for the ripened aroma. If it is too young as is detected from the scent, the hunter has to leave it behind for harvesting on a later day. It is this special aroma to the raw truffles that makes them an uncooked addition to many food palates. They are used shaven or grated with the skin as and when the dish demands. Before we conclude, let us remember that chocolate truffles got their name from their similarity to natural truffles.  Amorite, britannica.com.

34,Asian Marinated Fried Chicken Wings,food," Carlton Haynes is the innovative, professional chef by trade who loves to cook. When putting this marinade together make sure a allow enough time so that your chicken wings can get fully marinated for at least 4 to 6 hours o that these flavors can really penetrate into the chicken wing down to the bones so that you will taste it Asian Marinated Fried Chicken Wings My love for marinades goes way back to when I first started cooking, I use to watch as my God father Chef Charlie Bryant use to add flavor to his meat by marinating them, he use to use wet and dry marinades to penetrate the meats to add depths of flavor to whatever he was preparing. Most curries have spices like cumin, cinnamon, and cloves but also herbs like bay leaf or basil some type of pepper, But with this curry glaze I kept it super simple by using a curry powder along with some ginger, chili powder,  and we added a twist Curry Glaze I have people ask me what makes a good curry glaze, Well here is my opinion, I thin its the blend of seasonings also herbs so you can have a balance of sweet and also savory , but it also has to have hint of spiciness to give it that pop, not to hot but enough heat to know that it's there but not to over powering. Most curries have spices like cumin, cinnamon, and cloves but also herbs like bay leaf or basil some type of pepper, But with this curry glaze I kept it super simple by using a curry powder along with some ginger, chili powder,  and we added a twist by adding the Ghee to make it all stand out even more when it's done. What is Ghee In my opinion Ghee is a clarified butter that has a smoother and much more self-indulgent tasting butter that to me is really more buttery than regular. Curry GlazeIngredients 1/2cup of light corn syrup 1/4 cup of Dijon mustard 1/4 cup of Ghee (clarified butter) 2 teaspoons of onion powder 2 teaspoons of pineapple juice 1 teaspoon of granulated garlic 3 teaspoons of curry powder 1 teaspoon of sea salt 1/4 teaspoon of chili powder 1/3 teaspoon of ginger powder Methodslet's begin to making this really good and tasty curry glaze, Using a heavy-duty pot on medium high heat, Starting at the ingredient list start adding each item 1 by 1 until everything is inside on the pot stir to combine all of the ingredients and when the curry glaze starts to come to a boil lower your heat to medium low heat and let the curry glaze cook on medium low for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes continue to stir then remove from the heat cover and let it sit on the side. I believe that layering of flavor goes with every step of your cooking process and the flour also needs to be seasoned to continue that process while your cooking.

35,The Most Popular Coffee Brewing Methods,food," I love coffee, and I enjoy writing about it. As a former barista, I tested various coffee preparation methods and equipment. Coffee Brewing Methods If you want to know how to make coffee at home, this is your first step. It’s a quick overview of all the popular brewing methods. This list is not complete; it's just an introduction, and its purpose is only to show you the most popular brewing methods, and to give you an idea on what to try next. A more scientific approach is this listing of coffee brewing methods by physics and chemistry. We’ll review here all popular brewing methods, and we’ll point you to a brewing guide whenever we have it. However, we can only cover so much in this coffee brewing introduction. The video above is a great comparison, if you don't want to read. However, if you want to learn more about all preparation methods, and what type of coffee they produce, I suggest reading the entire article. We review here espresso, Turkish coffee, drip coffee, French press, and cold brew. We also review some variants, such as pour over as a manual drip coffee method, or cowboy coffee as a Turkish coffee variant. Why so many variants? To each their own, but it comes down to two major things: convenience, and taste. The balance of these two is the reason we have so many brewing methods. If you want more control over the brewing factors, and you want to tweak the recipe to your taste, then you choose a manual method. This means less convenience, you need to give your coffee a full 5-10 minutes of your morning. It doesn't sound much, but not everybody has their own life style, and I have friends and family who love the coffee I make, but they wouldn't spend the 10 minutes in the kitchen. The coffee capsule is their choice. Pulling an espresso shot. BrewEspressoCoffee Espresso is my favorite coffee brewing method. The small concentrated coffee drink is almost coffee essence, but the flavors are different than any other coffee type. I loved espresso as a customer, way before I worked in a coffee shop. I drink coffee prepared in many ways, but my daily cup is an espresso shot. Espresso is prepared by forcing pressurized hot water through a layer of compacted, finely ground coffee. The standard serving for espresso is a shot, which is about one fluid ounce, (30 ml). The double shot is very commonly ordered in coffee shops, and is a 2 ounce drink. Espresso is a very concentrated coffee, with a lot of body, aroma, and flavor. Espresso contains a lot of coffee oils and soluble solids, which create the unique mouthfeel. Espresso can be described as a thick coffee with flavors that linger on your palate for up to 30 minutes. Modern espresso is prepared with a pump espresso machine that generates 9 bar pressure when extracting the shot. A shot of espresso is extracted very fast, in about 20 to 30 seconds. Most other brewing methods are extracted for 3 to 5 minutes. A common misconception is that a stronger coffee is espresso. If we prepare a drip coffee to the espresso strength, it would be undrinkable. Espresso as a brewing method is unique, selectively extracting good coffee flavors and avoiding tannic and bitter flavors. Espresso is unique as a coffee beverage, there is nothing else like it. The foamy layer on top of the drink can only be produced at a high pressure. Espresso is the base for many coffee drinks from the coffee shop menu. Popular espresso drinks are the Americano, latte, cappuccino, cortado, and flat white. More info about espresso. Turkish coffee and Turkish delight served with water Turkish coffee, is a method of infusing very finely ground coffee in hot water. this brewing method is very popular in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, and is also called Greek coffee, or Arabic coffee. Contrary to a common belief, we do not boil Turkish coffee. If the brewing temperature raises too much, the brew will boil over. Some recipes call for a second boil, in order to extract more from the coffee grounds. This will extract compounds that need higher temperatures. However, the single raise has a better flavor, since all of the bitter compounds need more brew time in order to extract. What is unique to the Turkish coffee method is the grind size. Grind size for Turkish is the finest possible, almost to a powder. Turkish coffee is often compared to espresso, and is one of the strongest coffees among brewing methods. Turkish coffee is a very thick. concentrated coffee, similar to espresso, however, it doesn’t contain too much caffeine, as we might be inclined to think. Turkish coffee is for those who like bold flavors, and think that French press is not strong enough. Turkish coffee is prepared in a traditional coffee pot called cezve. In North America the pot is called ibrik, a word imported from the Eastern European immigrants. If you like clear coffee, stay away from this brewing method, as the spent coffee grounds grounds are not filtered, they are left to settle at the bottom of the cup. The grounds simply sink completely at the bottom of the cup, forming a compact disk that is not disturbed if coffee is drunk carefully. It is very easy to over-extract Turkish coffee, and to get a bitter cup. It is common practice for many Turkish coffee lovers to over-extract it on purpose, since they add sugar to it, and that balances the bitter notes. Cowboy coffee brewing on open fire Cowboy coffee is very similar to Turkish in many ways. The preparation method is the same, we grind coffee and we infuse it in hot water. The main difference between cowboy coffee and Turkish is that cowboy coffee uses a coarse grind. The coarse grind extracts slower, so we need to boil coffee more. Cowboy coffee doesn't boil over as easy as Turkish, hence can be over-extracted. The coarse coffee grounds don't sink as they do with Turkish so you will get more floating bits. Many people use a strainer with cowboy coffee, because it is easier to filter it with a strainer. Cowboy coffee is the ""emergency brewing method"". You only brew coffee that way if you don't have any other option. A Moka pot, or a percolator, or a French press will make you a better cup, and the equipment costs are really low. But if you are camping and all you have with you is a pot and some ground coffee, then cowboy coffee is your choice. Brewing Pour Over on a scale Drip coffee, or filter coffee is the most popular coffee preparation method. Drip coffee method requires pouring hot water over ground coffee beans. The coffee grounds are contained in a filter which allows the brew to pass through in a collector vessel. Drip coffee relies on gravity. The most popular method of filtration for drip coffee is the paper filter. The paper filter brews a clean cup, and retains almost all of the coffee oils. For drip coffee lovers that prefer a fuller body, a perforated metal filter, or a sieve coffee filter are great options. The non-paper filters allow coffee oils and fines to pass through into the cup, for a different mouth feel than traditional paper filters. The coffee from a paper filter drip brewer is clean, with a high ratio of caffeine extracted per spoon of ground coffee. Technivorm Moccamaster auto drip coffee maker Automatic drip coffee makers are a convenient way to brew. They are meant to produce consistent results, using a standard recipe. Most often, electric drip coffee maker is calibrated to brew 8 coffee cups. Medium ground coffee is placed in a paper filter, and the the machine will heat the water to around 200 °F, (96 °B). Then hot water is poured over the coffee bed at a predetermined flow rate. There is a strict relationship between grind size and brew temperature, and if one of the two variables is off, the other one needs to be adjusted as well. Machines are calibrated for medium grind size. (The preground coffee from the store.) While good electric coffee makers make great coffee, there are a couple of problems with this approach. Firstly, you can only brew a pot of coffee, which is typically more than most people need. Secondly, cheap equipment is often poorly calibrated. Most of the times the temperature control is not accurate, resulting in over-extracted, or under-extracted coffee. Adjusting brewing variables is not possible because temperature and water flow rate are predetermined. Barista making pour-over coffee Pour over, or hand drip, is the manual way of making drip coffee. Pour over uses the same principles as the automatic drip coffee maker, however, because we have more control over the brewing variables the final cup is different. The specialized paper filters and the dripper are also part of the success. The dripper’s shape, flow rate, material, and the flow rate are all brewing variables that affect coffee flavor. There are a variety of paper filters, with various flow rates, and filtration capabilities. However, dripper manufacturers create the filters to complement the brewing device. Incorrectly pairing drippers with filters will result in average results. Most pour over manufacturers appeal to a special segment of the market. People who love Chemex coffee don’t love coffee made in a Kalita Wave cone, or in Hario V60. Many pour-over devices compete with high-end automatic coffee makers such as Technivorm or Bonavita. Manual drippers offer more control over the brewing process, whereas automatic drip coffee makers offer convenience. Most manual drip coffee brewers are single cup brewing devices, but there are some that brew more than a cup at a time. These compete with automatic drip coffee machines in third wave coffee shops. Coffee Bag Pour Over The pour over bag is a convenient adaptation. It's still drip coffee, except coffee is prepackaged ground, measured for exactly one cup, and ready to brew. The customer opens the sealed bag just before brewing, places the bag over a coffee mug, and pours water similarly to the pour-over method. With single serve drip bags, you get everything that you love in a pour-over, without the need of using a grinder, or a cone. The drip bag brews a stronger cup, with more body than your regular drip coffee cup. This method is very convenient, and is a great way to make good coffee in a hotel, while camping, in a vacation... The biggest problem with pour over drip coffee bags is the packaging. The other problem is the shelf life of coffee. The packages need to be flushed with nitrogen, or vacuum packed, to maintain freshness. Ground coffee goes stale fast. Check with the vendor, and ask about their packaging technology. Single use drip coffee bags need a lot of extra packaging to ensure freshness. This isn't quite ecofriendly. Freshly brewed French press coffee French press, or press pot, is a simple coffee maker with a beaker and a plunger/filter. The beaker contains the coffee grounds and the filter, and the plunger has a circular screen filter that helps with the filtration. The French press, as it is known in North America, is called a coffee plunger in Australia and New Zealand and cafetière in the United Kingdom. In order to brew a French press coffee we need to pour hot water over coffee grinds and to let it steep for 3 to 5 minutes. When steeping is finished, we press the plunger-filter to the bottom of the beaker, to filter the coffee. French press coffee has a full body, and is a thinner cup than espresso but thicker than drip coffee. The aroma and flavor of a press pot coffee are intense, and compared to espresso many times. French press as a brewing method is very versatile. As a manual brewing method, French press allows the barista to change brewing factors and parameters. We can make a few tweaks to the brewing recipe to create a different cup. As other methods that brew a strong cup, traditional French press delivers a cup with an ample body, but this will mute the brightness we get with drip coffee. However, by tweaking a few things, we can get a cup that is very similar to a pour over. Single serve coffee bags are just like the tea bags, only they contain ground coffee. Steeping coffee bags use immersion as the brewing method. You should expect a coffee similar to French press. However, the bag that holds the ground coffee acts like a paper filter, and the method will produce a clearer cup, and with less oils than French press, but stronger than drip. The single serve coffee bag method is cheap and convenient. You don't need any equipment, and no special skills to brew a cup. Just steep a coffee sachet in hot water for a couple of minutes, and you have a decent coffee. The disadvantage of this method is that coffee might get stale if the bags are not individually packaged. The other disadvantage is the restricted selection choice. Moka pot on a tray MokaHead.com The Moka pot uses steam pressure for coffee making. Similar to the espresso method, the steam pressure pushes the water through coffee grinds, but with much lower pressure. The Moka pot can create about 1 bar of pressure, compared to a real espresso machine that deliver 9 bars of pressure. Coffee made in a Moka pot is very bold, and resembles espresso. It has less aromatic oils and lacks the crema. However, it is a great espresso alternative as a base for coffee drinks such as latte and cappuccino. A big problem with the Moka pot is thermal inertia. The coffee pot is hot for a long time after taken off the stove. Because of this, coffee must be poured in cups immediately otherwise we over-heat the coffee, and extract to much bitter flavors. Despite this little problem, Moka pot coffee is very easy to make, and even if you do it wrongly, it will still be a decent cup. Poring Cold Brew over ice Cold brew is a good way to prepare coffee for people with stomach problems. But many people choose cold brew for its delicate flavors. To make a batch of cold brew, we need to steep coffee grounds in cold water for 12 to 36 hours, then filter it. Because it takes so long to brew, people prepare large batches and store them in the fridge for several days. Modern cold brew coffee makers use various methods to speed up the extraction. Vacuum extraction is one of the most popular choices, but spinning, or agitation is another method. Modern cold brew coffee makers can make a cup in a few minutes. Cold brew lacks the well defined coffee flavors that we find in hot brewed coffee. People who love drip coffee, or espresso, might not enjoy cold brew. However, cold brew appeals to many coffee lovers who appreciate delicate flavors. Cold brew is sweeter than regular coffee, and maybe this is why so many people love it. There is no bitterness and no acidity in cold brew. People who want to reduce their sugar consumption can can drink it as is. The caffeine content in cold brew is about the same as with hot brewed coffee. However, it is important to compare beverages with the same brew ratio. Since cold brew is prepared as a concentrate, it needs to be diluted to normalize caffeine content and TDS. The bitter flavors are extracted from the grounds only at higher temperatures. This is why cold brew can be steeped for days in the fridge. The most important though, is that you can start brewing cold brew using the items in your kitchen. Buying a cold brew coffee maker makes brewing more convenient, much more expedient. Learn here How To Make Cold Brew Coffee at Home. Keurig Coffee Maker WikiMedia.com There is no consensus whether single serve coffee machines are a distinctive brewing method or not. However, if you think about it, Keurig brewers use pressure to push water through the coffee grounds. The pressure is not as high as with espresso machines, so the flavor profile is different. But the pressure addition improves the extraction, and the capsule can be smaller. Coffee specialists don't agree if single serve coffee makers such as Keurig are a different coffee brewing method or not. Water is pushed under pressure through the coffee grounds, so it's not a drip coffee. However, the coffee puck resistance in the capsule is much to low to create any considerable pressure during extraction. No other coffee maker can brew coffee in a similar way. This type of coffee makers provide a clean cup, with a decent aroma and flavor. The most important feature of the Keurig machines though, is the convenience. Freshly Brewed AeroPress in Espresso Cup AeroPress is a manual coffee maker that uses a combination of immersion and pressure for brewing a cup. The preparation is a two step process, with a few minutes of steeping followed by pushing the coffee sludge through the coffee grounds under pressure. This second step helps to extract more soluble solids from the grounds, for a stronger cup. The AeroPress was invented by Alan Adler, a retired Stanford University engineering instructor. He wanted a better tasting coffee, and none of the options at the time were able to make the coffee as he wanted it. AeroPress coffee is strong with an ample body and reminds of espresso. The AeroPress method is known for its versatility. You can brew from the mildest and brightest cup of drip brewed coffee to an espresso-like cup. People also make cold brew in the AeroPress. The most notable detail about the AeroPress brewing is the lower brewing temperature, compared to other methods. This gives the AeroPress a milder taste compared to espresso, or drip. Coffee is still extracted fully because of the longer immersion time and the pressure added to the extraction. The AeroPress holds 8 ounces of water, so we can only brew one coffee cup at a time. If we brew the coffee stronger, we can then dilute it with water, similarly to an Americano. Percolator Pieces Coletti Bozeman Percolator is one of the oldest types of coffee makers. Percolating coffee gets a bad reputation of producing bitter and over extracted coffee, but the reality is that you can make an awesome coffee cup using the percolator. The coffee percolator brews by continually cycling the nearly boiling brew through the coffee grounds until coffee gets strong enough to be consumed. The steam pushes the water through a column to the top of the percolator, in the grounds basket. Water then falls on the coffee bed and gravity pulls the brew back into the percolator pot. The cycle repeats until the desired strength is obtained. It is very easy to expose the ground coffee to higher temperatures, especially if the percolator is on a hot stove, or fire. Also, the partially brewed coffee is still heated to a high temperature so that it can be pushed through the column back in the coffee bed. All these make coffee brewed with a percolator very susceptible to over-extraction, hence a bitter taste in your cup. However, if we carefully control the brewing process, we can avoid over-extracting coffee. Barista brewing vacuum pot coffee Jonathan McIntosh via Flickr The vacuum pot, or syphon as it is also called, is a coffee maker that uses vacuum and gravity as the brewing energy. It is composed of borosilicate glass chambers, connected tightly, so that air pressure is not lost between the two chambers. The two glasses are separated by a coffee filter. The vacuum pot is a full immersion brewing method that uses vacuum to improve the extraction. A heat source boils the water in the lower chamber, turning it into vapor and forcing it in the upper chamber, (the immersion compartment). When all of the water was forced up, the barista adds coffee grounds in the brewing chamber, (upper glass), and mixes in the slurry to facilitate the grounds saturation, and turns off the heat. As it cools down, the lower chamber will have a lower pressure, which will pull the brew down, through the filter, decanting the brew. This lower chamber will become the collector recipient. The whole brewing will take about 3 minutes. The relative complexity of the vacuum pot is not for show only. The special brewing technique produces a smooth, full-bodied, crisp, and clean coffee, without muting any of the origin flavors."
36,What are Fresh & dried figs’ nutrition and benefits?,food," I am a banker but that's not what I only do. My passion for reading and writing has drawn me to this platform and I would love to enhance fresh and dried figs' nutrition and benefits Nutrition is important and is very essential for every living creature on this planet earth, especially animals like humans and animals. In most cases, they have diverse needs and different needs at the same time. Not only do we need to meet their basic requirements but also consider their nutritional needs as well. While it may seem tedious to take care of a pet’s diet from scratch, you can always try something new with some home remedies while keeping your budget intact. Figs are a staple in my meal planning and I try to incorporate them into my everyday meals when we get together. They are extremely useful for people who don’t want to eat meat or are vegetarians. If you prefer tofu, tofu fries, chicken fingers or slices of bread then think about it. It can be eaten fresh which helps retain its nutrients. Most vegetables can be found in almost all supermarkets, and fruits such as apples and pears are readily available too. The best part is that you can use these veggies in salads, and soups or simply add them to your smoothies, as they are not only delicious but also nutritious. You can also make sauces out of these foods. Figs are rich in minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants. You can learn more here. Figs are an Ayurvedic herb. These herbs are known for their healing properties. Apart from treating common diseases like colds and coughs, they can help reduce abdominal constipation and constipation. For instance, fenugreek can improve digestion and eliminate indigestion and flatulence. Fenugreek leaves have been used as a treatment for ulcerative colitis for thousands of years. Some fig varieties can be harvested in the winter months, but you can harvest the ones available in autumn and summer. Its roots contain magnesium; many research studies have shown that magnesium deficiency may be responsible for stomach ulcers. Figs contain calcium, phosphorus and potassium, iron, copper, and folate. A study conducted by NutraIn ingredients found that fenugreek extract has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antimalarial properties and is thus used for curative purposes. One should avoid consuming figs during pregnancy because the enzymes present in figs may irritate babies, hence affecting their immunity system. Besides fenugreek, other medicinal plants can help treat coughs and pneumonia. Few strains of fig trees may not bear fruit during the year. This means you can save that fruit that is mature during the summer months and can be used throughout the year. Though the seedlings might be dried figs and mushy to touch the ground, they will start flowering during spring and summer, giving a big harvest to harvest later in the day. Figs are easy to grow and harvest. Once they start blooming, it will take no more than a few hours for the plant to reach its full height. Therefore, if you plan to harvest them after planting them, do so before the flowers bloom to ensure you reap maximum yield in the season. The seeds of figs are edible, but they are not good to eat raw. Instead, grind them in equal parts and keep them ready to serve. When you make any sauce or juice from fresh figs, do not overdo it. This could affect its taste and texture, which is why it should be kept in a cool and dry place. On a side note, dried figs could be stored in airtight containers in the fridge as it goes hard and chewy. Figs can also be used to replace olive oil in salad dressings, sauces, cooking oils, and even cakes, making their addition to healthy dishes without adding anything else. Add figs to Greek yogurt or Greek yogurt and its fat content makes it healthier. Moreover, you can choose those fresh figs you buy from grocery stores and use them as a garnish for dinner in the evening. Even if you are craving hot chocolate or hot tea, just add some figs to your regular cup then let it sit for 5 minutes and enjoy it with your loved ones. © 2022 I shah"

39,The Orange Crush: More Than Orange,food," Alex is a Virginia Beach local that enjoys the wondrous natural beauty of Virginia and sampling local food and drink. Prepping this was simple. 1.5 jalapeños in the plain rum and 1.5 in the pine apple rum. Refrigerate for 5-7 days and then remove the jalapeños. The original orange crush is a refreshingly tasty drink that pairs well with a wide variety of cuisine. The fresh orange juice really makes a difference. Let me tell you it is just not the same when made from orange juice bought from the store. This drink is simple and a beach classic. However, changes can be made. Nearly every place that has a crush menu will have a wide variety of flavors to choose from, however many of them are just the regular orange crush with the flavor of liquor swapped out. We can do better than that. We tried out hand at infusing rum at home. Let me tell you, its amazing. You can infuse rum or vodka with a varieties of fruits and spices. Our favorite mix so far as been pineapple rum infused with jalapeños. For this press three naval oranges, crush two trays on ice, and then have fun. If you add the crushed ice to the glasses first the glasses will be nicely chilled and keep the drink colder longer. We like to top the ice with the fresh squeezed orange juice and then a splash of sprite. Nic and I differ on what we like next. He prefers to go with the pineapple rum infused with jalapeños, while I prefer regular jalapeño infused rum with peach vodka. If you want an adventure you can top with a little chili powder. Want to take a walk on the wild side? I bet you do. Half the amount of orange juice and replace with pineapple juice. Add gold rum, coconut rum, and coconut cream. After you stir it will look a little creamy. Top with a little nutmeg. This painkiller crush is amazing. Though, they will sneak up on you. I've written about orange crushes before. They are a stable at the Virginia Beach oceanfront. I've had many a crush with fish tacos while over looking the water. At the start of the pandemic we weren't able to enjoy spring days at the beach with crushes. We decided to try our hand at making them ourselves. After all, we've sat at the bar and watched them make them many times. How hard could it be? Not at all. After a few rounds we invested in a citrus press. Just like what they have at the bars at the beach. It gets more juice out so we use less oranges, and it is way easier than hand squeezing. Not to mention I love that I can use it when I make key lime pie. We enjoy mixing different liquors and juices and figuring out what food they pair best with. We love being able to sit on the deck and enjoy a hand crafted cocktail right at home. It is also much more economical to make crushes at home than it is to get one at the beach. This is a crush at the bar, this is about $10 now. Don't get me wrong, it very good and it is fun to sit at the outside bar and watch the ocean. But, I love making my own at home. © 2022 isharkbait"
40,The Best Cream Cheese Souffle You Have to Try,food," Ryan has been an online writer for over a decade and loves to share and educate. A Cream Cheese souffle is one of the most revered types of souffle out there. The creamy, fluffy, and cheesy texture can send many first-timers into an orbit. Throw in some citrus from a fresh lemon or liqueur and you have a dessert to remember until the day you die. It's especially great for those who are also into cheesecake due to the similarities. A souffle is easy to make as long as you have the right tools and the patience to execute what is needed for this masterpiece of French cuisine. Just pay special attention to all of the tips outlined and let's begin. Katrin Gilger Souffle is pretty light but needs help when it comes to rising. That's why butter and sugar are smeared on the insides of the ramekins; these provide traction for the rise. As a tip when coating the insides of the ramekins with cold butter, it's best to use upward strokes for the sides. This provides more uniform tracks that will help to guide the souffle on its ascension. After coating the insides of the ramekins with the butter, you should chill them in the refrigerator for at least an hour. Or if you want to ensure you get the best results, chill them overnight. That means you'll have to plan the souffle party a day in advance. But it'll be worth it. The same should also apply to the filling for those ramekins. That is once the batter is finished mixing. When it comes to making a souffle rise, the star of the show is the egg whites. These are beaten until they turn stiff enough to stick to the bowl and form peaks when lifted off from the surface. In this state, the egg whites will retain some of the air incorporated. However, for this to truly work, the egg whites must remain stable at all times. This is achieved by following three steps. Firstly, the bowl and beaters used must be perfectly clean and dry before use because any unnecessary contents could destabilize them during the beating. Secondly, an actual stabilizing agent is required to ensure things go smoothly. There are a number of ingredients, most of which are acidic. Conveniently, this recipe includes lemon which not only provides the zest for the flavor but also the juice used to stabilize the whites. And thirdly, the batter must be kept cold when combined with the beaten whites. Any heat or warmth could cause the whites to deflate. That and rigirous mixing. So instead, the two must be folded gently into each other during this phase.  1 hour 15 min 12 min 1 hour 27 min 6 © 2022 Ryan Fanus"

My rice needed to cook 45 minutes. Some of my veggies needed to be fried in butter until squishy. The celery, peppers, onion tops and the three herbs I cut from my herb box. The noodles get cooked according to the box. Then, everything gets mixed together, sprinkled with shredded cheese and covered and baked 1 hour at 325 degrees. It was closer to an hour and a half before I removed the dish from the oven. I was hoping it was not overcooked. It was creamy. It was flavorful. Everything had cooked expertly. My hubby was excited. He said that a person could substitute turkey, or tuna or salmon for the chicken."
42,15 Foods You Didn't Know You Can Cook in an Air Fryer,food," Margaret Minnicks is a health-conscious person who researches the health benefits of foods and drinks. Almost every household has an air fryer. They might not all be the same make, model, or size because there are so many available that fit every need. Just because almost every household has one doesn't mean that everyone is getting all the benefits out of their air fryers. You can make almost any food in an air fryer, and whatever you make is healthier than frying food in a frying pan with grease. Look through the list below and you will be utterly surprised that you might be keeping your air fryer on unemployment instead of working it to its capacity. If you are leery about any of the foods, take the proverbial advice and ""Don't knock it until you try it."" There are many more foods that are not listed. However, the 15 foods listed below are my favorites. Number 11 tops my list of favorite foods to cook in my air fryer. Photo via the kitchen You might need to cut the slices of your bacon in half, depending on the size and shape of your air fryer basket. The air fryer will cook thin or thick strips of bacon into a crispy delight in about seven to 11 minutes. You really don't need a toaster if you have an air fryer. You could get rid of your toaster to save space on your kitchen counter. That's because everything you use your toaster for can be done in your air fryer. You can toast bread, bagels, and Pop-Tarts in just a matter of minutes. Cornbread in an air fryer Photo by Margaret Minnicks Don't you get tired of making pancakes that do not turn out round? The batter runs all over the pan when you make them in a frying pan on the stove. Mix your batter as usual and use the small tray that probably came with your air fryer. Your pancake will turn out round and will be brown on top and soft and fluffy inside. The only disadvantage about cooking pancakes in your air fryer is that can make only one at a time in the small tray that you have. If you have a larger fryer with more accessories, you might not have that problem. Use the same procedure to cook delicious golden-brown cornbread as seen in the photo above. Photo via the kitchen Who doesn't like a good grilled cheese sandwich? Simply put two slices of your favorite cheese between two slices of bread and butter each side. Air fry at 370°F for 4 minutes. Turn over and cook for another 3 minutes. Do not overcook. Your grilled cheese sandwich will be crispy, crunchy, and delicious. You will discover that making it in your air fryer is so much better than making it in a frying pan. Photo via the kitchen You can cook white potatoes and sweet potatoes in your oven or microwave, but it takes longer. It is so much quicker to cook potatoes in your air fryer. Besides, your white potatoes and sweet potatoes will be crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. You can cook chicken nuggets, chicken wings, and any part of the chicken in your small air fryer if you cut the chicken up into individual pieces. You can also cook a whole chicken if you have a large air fryer. No matter what size you have, the chicken comes out juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Photo via shutterstock Just as you can cook white potatoes and sweet potatoes in your air fryer, you can also make homemade chips in your air fryer. Don't limit your choices to plain potato chips. You can also make sweet potato chips, kale chips, beet chips, tortilla chips, and even pickle chips. All air fryer chips come out with a delicious and healthy crunch. Do you want some corn on the cob to go along with that air-fried chicken? There is no need to grill chicken, cook it on top of your stove or in the microwave. For corn that is sweet and tender, brush each ear lightly with olive oil or butter and air fry at 370°F for 10-12 minutes. Photo via taste of home You have probably seen or even eaten fried pickles at a state fair. Now you can air fry your own. Use thick pickles or pickle chips. Dip them in beaten eggs and roll them in panko, flour, or regular bread crumbs. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, oregano, or other favorite seasonings. Fry them at 400°F for 8-10 minutes. For evenly browned pickles, turn them over after about 4 minutes. Photo via taste of home You do not need to order a pizza every time you want to eat one. You can make individual pizzas in your air fryer. Use frozen bread dough, mozzarella cheese, and pizza sauce. Choose your own toppings which could be ground Italian sausage, ham, or bacon, green pepper, onions, dried oregano, and crushed red pepper flakes for a finger-licking good pizza. Photo via the kitchn You can cook a steak quickly and conveniently in your air fryer. When cooking most foods, you do not need to preheat your air fryer. However, when you are cooking a steak, set your appliance at 400°F and let it heat up for about 10 minutes before adding the steak. That will ensure that your steak will turn out to be golden brown on the outside and tender on the inside. Turn the steak over after five minutes. Keep in mind that the time of cooking depends on how thick the steak is and whether you like your steak rare, medium-rare, or well done. You can also cook other meats in your air fryer such as pork chops, lamb chops, fish, and salmon cakes. Photo via thekitchn If you have a taste for doughnuts, you don't have to run out to a doughnut shop or your local grocery store. It might surprise you to know that you can make doughnuts in your air fryer by using canned biscuit dough or crescent roll dough. Remove the centers from the biscuits with a round cookie cutter. Fry four doughnuts at 350°F for 5 minutes. Turn the doughnuts over only once.  Fry all the doughnut holes at once for 3 minutes. Lightly brush the hot doughnuts with butter and roll them in cinnamon sugar. You can also use powdered-sugar glaze and sprinkles. Photo via Taste of Home Preheat your air fryer to 325°F. Mix all your ingredients for brownies. Pour the batter into the pan that might have come with your air fryer. Insert a toothpick in the center of the brownies to determine when they are done. Remove from the air fryer and cut into squares. Keep in mind that an air fryer is a countertop oven. That means anything you can bake in an over, you can make in your air fryer. That includes doughnuts, brownies, cookies, cakes, and cupcakes. Use silicone baking cups if your air fryer didn't come with a cupcake or muffin pan.  The cupcakes will be delicious and fluffy on the inside and crispy on top. Add frosting and sprinkles, if you like. You don't have to be sitting around a campfire to enjoy s'mores.  Marshmallows toast evenly when they are air-fried. They are gooey on the inside the way they should be. However, they won't have that campfire taste when they are heated in your air fryer. 15 Surprising Things You Can Make in an Air Fryer Air Fryer Recipes "

Chef Joël Robuchon described it as ""light and slightly puffy, more or less fine, according to the proportion of butter and eggs."" The Brioche appeared in the Middle Ages in Normandy (North-West of France) and would be a derivative of a tighter bread made until then. One popular theory claims that it was invented by Norman Vikings, who settled in France in the 9th century and brought the secrets of making butter with them. Brioche is believed to have been adapted from a classic Norman recipe, but some people argue that it's of Romanian origin. This egg yolk or egg bread, milk bun or Swiss roll, is a type of sweet of French origin. Brioche bread is a lightly sweet yeast bread with a buttery and tender crumb made from enriched dough. Brioche can be used in breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack and dessert recipes, so use it whenever you get the urge to add a little taste of Paris to your day. Rich, golden-brown and decadently buttery with a hint of sweetness and lots of eggs in the dough, brioche can be used to uplift anything. Brioche has numerous uses in cuisine and can take on various forms, served plain or filled, as coulibiac, or with many other different savory fillings. "

Christopher Parker People are strange. We all know that. But what we might not know is just how weird some people can be when it comes to food. This blog post will explore some of the strange things people eat. From grasshoppers to cow brains, you won't believe some of the things that have been consumed! So, if you're feeling brave, read on and prepare to be amazed (or disgusted) by some of the weirdest thing to eat out there! One of those “weird things you can eat” is cow brains. Yes, you read that correctly. Cow brains! Apparently, this dish is quite popular in some parts of the world and is often served as a stew or curry. If you're not squeamish about eating something that was once part of an animal's brain, this might be worth trying! Another one of the strangest things that people have eaten throughout history is grasshoppers. Surprisingly, grasshoppers are not among the weird things to eat. That's right, humans have consumed those same little insects that most of us have tried to avoid for centuries. Grasshoppers are considered a delicacy in some cultures and are often served fried or roasted. So, if you're feeling adventurous and want to eat weird things, why not give grasshoppers a try? Egor Kamelev It's safe to say that most people would not be thrilled at the prospect of eating a rat. And yet, this is something that people do all over the world – and they don’t find it to be among the crazy things to eat. In some cultures, rats are considered a delicacy, and they are often cooked in a variety of ways. While this may not be everyone's cup of tea, there is no denying that rat meat can be quite delicious. Of course, the fact that rats sometimes carry disease is a bit of a turn-off for many people. But if you're feeling adventurous, why not give it a try? After all, life is too short to eat boring food! One of the grossest things people have eaten is poop. Poop is full of bacteria and can make you sick. It can also contain parasites that can cause infections. Eating poop can also transmit diseases like cholera and hepatitis. So, why do people eat poop? Maybe because it's a dare. Maybe they're trying to gross out their friends. Or maybe they just really like the taste of it. Whatever the reason, eating poop is gross and dangerous. So, don't do it! Kelly L There are few things more gross than eating dirt. It's not just the act of consuming dirt that is off-putting, but the thought of all the bacteria and germs that are living in the soil. And yet, people do it all the time. A recent study found that 10% of Americans admit to eating dirt, and even celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Miranda Kerr have admitted to being fans of ""dirt candy."" While some people may enjoy the taste of dirt, others eat it for its purported health benefits. Supporters of ""geophagy"" (the practice of eating dirt) believe that it can help to detoxify the body and provide essential minerals. However, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims, and eating dirt can actually be harmful to your health. So, next time you're feeling hungry, resist the urge to reach for a handful of dirt - it's gross, and it's not good for you! There are some truly disgusting things that people eat, but one of the grossest has got to be clay. Now, you might be thinking that there's nothing wrong with a little bit of clay. It doesn’t sound like one of those very strange things to eat, right? After all, we've all eaten a few pieces of gravel when we were kids. But eating clay is something else entirely. Clay is full of toxins and other unhealthy minerals that can actually make you sick. And it's not just kids who eat clay- adults do it too! In fact, some cultures actually believe that eating clay has health benefits. Whether or not that's true is up for debate, but one thing is for sure: eating clay is definitely gross. So, there you have it, some of the strangest things people have eaten throughout history. If you're feeling brave enough to try any of these foods, then more power to you! But if not, then maybe just stick to the grasshoppers. Either way, people eating weird stuff will always be a reality, so I hope you found this blog post interesting (and perhaps a little bit gross)! What are your thoughts? Would you be brave enough to try any of these odd things to eat? Let me know in the comments below! Before you go, check out my article about What Happens When You Eat Metal!

Fresh pasta served with good ingredients will give you a winning and really tasty dish and believe me who ever you're going to feed it to will also agree it all starts right there in what you use to put it all together. Linguine and Tomato Pasta with Goat Cheese My family has a love for pasta but to me sometimes pasta dishes with all the sauces can be on the heavy side just think about it, the pasta, the sauce alone makes it rich and hardy. So, what I want to do is change the pasta into a lighter version of a pasta dish. By making a few changes were going make this dish pop with flavor and have you coming back for more. By putting my spin on to this dish I wanted to add really bold flavors and I want it to be the Freshness ingredients I could get my hands on, fresh herb, veggies and pasta's, along with some great quality oils. I really believe food should be made simple but with lots of flavor, Let's be honest how good is a good-looking dish if it does not have flavor or any flavor at all, But to make that flavor happen you have to have good ingredients. To me good ingredients mean better tasting food. But that's just my opinion. Fresh pasta served with good ingredients will give you a winning and really tasty dish and believe me who ever you're going to feed it to will also agree it all starts right there in what you use to put it all together, And if you're using all fresh food you're in for a treat. The star of this dish is Linguine pasta and the main co-stars are the cherry tomatoes and goat cheese let me give you a little information about these great ingredients for this Linguine and Tomato Pasta with Goat Cheese. Linguine pasta, It's an Italian pasta which is called little tongue in Italy and is made from durum wheat its long like spaghetti and flat can be used for many pasta dishes and is really easy to handle when being cooked. Linguine Pasta Like I have said it's the ingredients that makes this dish really stand out in the crowd, the freshness and overall flavors is the reason it is going to be so good. What we are going to do is use the tagliatelle pasta, It's an Italian pasta that long like spaghetti and flat, its made with eggs and flour only no water added, I like it because its a firm pasta and holds it shape when cooked. We are also using cherry-tomatoes they are perfect for this dish, There a small tomato that has a shape like Bing cherries and they are juicy and have very good flavor and if you sauté them, it brings out the total sweetness that takes then up another notch, and they are also healthy as well. The other co-star of this dish is the fresh goat cheese which is made from raw goats' milk that is pasteurized goats' milk to me has a mild tart taste and when it's paired with the sweetness of the cherry tomatoes it will make this dish pop. The goat cheese I use is fresh Vermont Creamy Goat Cheese, to me it's one of the best. Cherry-tomatoes they are perfect for this dish, There a small tomato that has a shape like  Bing cherries and they are juicy and have very good flavor and if you sauté them, it brings out the total sweetness that takes then up another notch. Cherry Tomatoes Fresh goat cheese which is made from raw goats' milk that is pasteurized goats' milk to me has a mild tart taste and when it's paired with the sweetness of the cherry tomatoes it will make this dish pop. Fresh Goat Cheese My typical pasta dish starts with very simple, very fresh ingredients all blended in together to make one good tasty dish and that's what I am going to do while making this Linguine and Tomato Pasta with Goat Cheese is show you how to do just that, So come on and follow me, You're going to love it. Linguine and Tomato Pasta with Goat Cheese Ingredients1 pound of fresh Linguine pasta 8 ounces of fresh Vermont Creamy Goat Cheese 1 1/2 pints of cherry tomatoes (cut in half) 3 cloves of garlic divided (minced) (1 clove of garlic separated from the others) 1/3 teaspoon of white sugar 1/3 cup of extra virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons of butter Sea salt to taste Cracked black pepper to taste 1 cup of finely chopped basil 8 cups of chicken stock (this is for cooking your Linguine pasta) Methods Now that we have all of our ingredients let's put this recipe together, using a large heavy-duty tall pot add your chicken stock and a pinch of sea salt and follow the instructions on the package on the fresh Linguine pasta and remember to taste as you get closer to your doneness. I am using the chicken stock as my boiling liquid for my linguine so it can add more flavor to the pasta as it is cooking. While the pasta is boiling, get a heavy-duty frying skillet on medium heat add 1 tablespoon of butter made sure it covers the entire skillet not add the cherry tomatoes, The reason for this is to bring out the sweetness of the cherry tomatoes and to start the layering of flavors as we cook, sauté the cherry tomatoes 3 to 4 minutes the add the 2 cloves of minced garlic and mix in to blend with the tomatoes stirring for another minute and turn down the heat to low on the lowest setting but make sure not to burn the ingredients. Going back to your paste drain your pasta, now add the pasta to the cherry tomatoes and garlic along with the remaining tablespoon of butter, then add the rest of the ingredients the basil, fresh garlic, white sugar the sea salt and cracked pepper. Now continue to add the olive oil and toss so all of the ingredients blend in together taste to make sure it has the flavor you want, if need be, add more sea salt and cracked black pepper. Now add the pasta dish into a nice glass serving bowl then add your goat cheese crumble toss just a little to blend in then served and enjoy, This content is accurate and true to the best of the author’s knowledge and is not meant to substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional. © 2022 Chef Carlton Haynes"

51,Why I Will Never Use Uber Eats Again,food," Sarah uses the Uber app often and used Uber Eats for the first time when she was given a promotional coupon on her Uber app. Mak Uber Eats is a branch of the Uber company where instead of requesting rides, customers can request food to be delivered to them. Uber Eats was launched in 2014 and many restaurants and fast food chains are on the Uber Eats app for customers to order food. When customers order food from the app, the restaurant receives the order and starts preparing the food. Then the restaurant leaves the food in a special place just for delivery service apps like Uber Eats and waits for the driver to pick up the food. After the driver picks up the food, he or she will deliver it to the address you have for the order. Erik Mclean on Unsplash The first reason why I will never order from Uber Eats again is because it takes so long for the driver to bring your food, your food ends up being cold. If I knew it would take so long for the driver to deliver the food, I would've just ordered a normal Uber ride to pick up my food myself and then order another normal Uber ride to bring it back home. I admit that what I ordered off the Uber Eats app was pretty far from the hotel I was staying at but it took much longer for the driver to deliver my food than it should've. This was due to the driver also picking up other orders along with mine and delivering them to the other people before bringing me my food. On the app, it claimed that it would take the driver one hour to deliver my food, and as I said, I know that I ordered food that was far away from my hotel so I expected it to take a long time. However, I didn't realize that Uber Eats drivers picked up multiple orders at once and delivered in the order of what's most convenient to them and not in the order of whose food they picked up first. Therefore, the driver took almost an hour and a half to deliver my food and when I received it, everything was cold. I had to put my food in the microwave to warm it up again. I ordered food from a restaurant because I wanted hot food, not leftovers that I would have to warm up in the microwave. Therefore, this ended up being a big disappointment. I really didn't see the appeal of ordering from the Uber Eats app if you will get cold food because the driver takes a very long time to deliver your food. The one and only time I have used the Uber Eats app to order food was due to a promotion I received in the app. It claimed that I would get $25 off my first order and this sounded like a pretty good deal so I decided to try it. I was staying at a hotel and while I could've asked my husband to drive us to a restaurant to eat, we never tried the Uber Eats app before and we were lazy to leave the hotel so we decided to give it a try. However, the $25 off your first order had some fine print attached to it that they don't tell you until later. It's true that it was $25 off my first order but that didn't include the taxes, delivery fee, or tip to your driver. Also, to make full use of the $25 off, I had to order something that cost me about $30 so I had to choose something expensive. By the time I finished ordering and applying the coupon, I realized what I thought would be a nearly free meal was still costing me almost $12 with all the taxes, fees, and tips. Therefore, it wasn't worth the price in the end and I learned that Uber Eats is really expensive. If I didn't have that coupon, I would've been paying almost $40 for my food because of all the extra fees. Jon Tyson on Unsplash Also, Uber Eats is very inconsistent with their deliveries. My husband ordered separately on the app so that we could both take advantage of the $25 off your first order coupon. We had two separate accounts so it made sense to use both. My husband wasn't hungry at the time so the app allows you to request when the driver will deliver your food. He asked for the driver to come to deliver the food one hour after he placed the order. However, about 15 mins after placing the order, he received a text message from the driver saying that he is a few minutes away and the food is ready. When I placed my order, I asked for the order to be delivered as soon as possible because I was hungry. However, my order took an hour and a half to be delivered so I was not happy with the service of Uber Eats. They're very inconsistent and I learned that the drivers just deliver the orders in the order that is most convenient for them and not for the customers. © 2022 Sarah Wong"

53,Fennel & Cumin Roasted Leg of Lamb,food," Carlton Haynes is the innovative, professional chef by trade who loves to cook. Fennel & Cumin Roasted Leg of Lamb. Every flavor I wanted hit all the right notes these two paired together very well and brought out great flavors that your family and guest will enjoy, two flavors together for one tasty piece of meat. Fennel &amp; Cumin Roasted Leg of Lamb Today I came into my commissary and I saw this really nice looking piece of bone in leg of lamb, I have to tell you the lamb looked really good so It got me to thinking of several ways to make it really good favorable and tasty  so I thought about the way I wanted it to taste, a hint of spice to give it a warm feeling and earthiness and I also wanted a hint of sweetness with an Italian flair, Then it hit me Fennel & Cumin Roasted Leg of Lamb. This was flavor I was thinking of these two paired together could bring everything I wanted for this Roasted Leg of Lamb, Read on as I bring the two flavors together for one tasty piece of meat. Just so you know both fennel and cumin come from the same plant family but when it comes to their flavor profile, they are totally different although they are from the Apiaceous plant family, they are so different in looks and taste, Let's compare. In my opinion fennel is a sweet type of herb that has an anise flavor that has a sweet back ground but a spicy back ground as well with that Italian flavor I was talking about. Now when we're talking about cumin this reminds me of flavors from the Mediterranean that gives you a cayenne type of taste but also a little nuttiness also. Both of these herbs are considered very good herbs Cumin for medicinal use and fennel is a great flavor enhancer in almost every dish you're preparing and if you roast the fennel, it really gives off a great fragrance when roasting, and today they both are really going to be awesome together. Both of these herbs are considered very good herbs Cumin for medicinal use and fennel is a great flavor enhancer in almost every dish you're preparing and if you roast the fennel, it really gives off a great fragrance when roasting, and today they bo Fennel &amp; Cumin Seeds Now it's time to take these to herbs and blend them together as a marriage but to do this I am going to turn these herbs into a powder to be used as a rub, By making this a powder I feel that I get more out of my rub that I am putting together. Come on read on to see what I do just remember when we are totally done we are going to have a nice tasty Fennel & Cumin Roasted Leg of Lamb. Let's start to put together this fennel & cumin spice rub Fennel & Cumin Powdered Spice Rub Ingredients4 tablespoons of ground cumin powder 5 tablespoons of ground fennel powder 1 tablespoon of ground basil 3 tablespoons of cracked black pepper 2 tablespoons of cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons of fine grinded sea salt 2 teaspoons of granulated garlic powder Methods for the Fennel & Cumin Spice Rub To begin to bring this spice rub what I want it to be, using a heavy-duty non-stick frying pan, On a medium high heat get the pan really hot while the pan is getting hot using a large glass bowl combine all of the ingredients blend them together very well then add them to the hot non-sticking frying pan and keep moving the spices around. Now cut off your stove and keep moving the spices around until the aromatics start to fill the room at this point remove the frying pan from the stove keep moving the spices around and then add the spices into the large glass bowl. The warming of your spices will make them have a slightly darker color when its finish but it also will have a richer flavor to the leg of lamb. By making this a powder I feel that I get more out of my rub that I am putting together it give the meat a more richer flavor Fennel &amp; Cumin Powdered Spice Rub Now let's add the seasoning for the leg of lamb IngredientsFennel & Cumin Powdered Spice Rub 1/2 cup of Dijon mustard Plastic wrap Pan Juice Sauce 1 cup of vegetable stock 1 teaspoon of butter (unsalted) pinch of black pepper (to taste) Methods What we're going to do is highly season this leg of lamb then sit it in the refrigerator to marinate so all those spices and flavors can marinate into the meat for 6 to 8 hours. Now that we are done marinating, grab out your leg of lamb then I want you grad your half of cup of Dijon mustard and rub it completely all over the leg of lamb then when you have it fully covered then start to apply the fennel & cumin spice rub over the entire leg of lamb once the lamb is completely cover then I want you to massage in the Dijon mustard and fennel and cumin spice rub so it can start to penetrate the leg of lamb. Then using your plastic wrap, Wrap the leg of lamb really tight in the plastic wrap and place in your refrigerator so it can start to marinating. Slow-Roasting a leg of lamb is not an all-day thing it takes just a few hours to make a melt in your mouth tender leg of lamb and this is how I get it that way. Remove your leg of lamb from the refrigerator after marinating then remove the plastic wrap then using your hands massage your leg of lamb again just to make sure it completely covered then place the leg of lamb in a shallow roasting pan with a roasting rack then just let it get room temperature. Preheat your oven to 275 degrees when the oven reaches temperature using your roasting pan place your leg of lamb in the middle rack of your oven and let your leg of lamb start to slow roast for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours, After cooking for this time using a meat thermometer insert your leg of lamb into the thickest part of the roast to check the temperature if the temperature is between 125 to 130 degrees that is medium rare just where it should be for my taste at that moment remove from the oven then turn up your oven to broil. Now place the leg of lamb back into the broiler so the skin can brown up really well about 2 minutes on each side, then remove from the oven then let rest for 30 to 40 minutes to trap all those juices back inside of the leg of lamb. While the roast is resting in the bottom of your roasting is some nice pan juices from your leg of lamb place the roasting pan on the stove on medium heat add 1 cup of vegetable stock as the stock is heating up. Discard any grease that is on top then using a spatula get all the bits from the bottom of the roasting pan add a teaspoon of unsalted butter and a pinch of black pepper let it reduce just a little, remember it's not gravy it's a sauce, now the this pan sauce is ready and the leg of lamb has rested slice serve and enjoy.  Remember pan sauce is not a gravy it's a sauce, It serves as a enhancer to your leg of lamb, Try and enjoy Roasted Leg of Lamb Pan Sauce This content is accurate and true to the best of the author’s knowledge and is not meant to substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional. © 2022 Chef Carlton Haynes"
54,Food Too Good to Waste,food," Ethel loves to grab a bargain. As the population of the U.K face the worst cost of living crisis for decades thrift is key. Each day supermarkets, cafes and restaurants throw away tasty food which has failed to sell that day and is time sensitive. But what it if you could buy this food at a knock down price? Well now you can! Food waste is obscene when you consider how many people around the world are starving. But there are many other implications not least the loss of life, time and effort often involved in food production. That ham sandwich thrown in the trash can includes flesh from a living creature. We are all guilty of food waste sometimes but we can minimise it. There are many ways to curb food waste including more organised supermarket shopping, checking use before dates on food and stock rotation in the home. As finances tighten good food management is also good financial sense. There is a new app in the U.K which has a rapidly increasing fan-base. It is called Too Good To Go Waste and is free to download. It offers cut price “Magic Bags” of food but there is a catch, or two. So how does it work? Examples from personal use include: A local Greggs bakery cost £2.59 with an estimated full price of £8. We received a large chicken mayo seeded bun, a chicken bake, vanilla slice, chocolate chip cookie and two large yum-yums. In another “save” it was chicken mayo salad sandwich, two large sausage rolls, a box of four sweet iced bread buns, a pot of fresh fruit and a doughnut. Cafe Nero gave us a bottle of fresh orange juice plus four huge filled croissants and baguettes for £3.09 estimated cost £12. The app is very easy to use. It does include easy ‘how to use’ steps. Once you have used it a few times you tend to know the time each day your favourite ‘magic bags’ become available to reserve. You can reserve more than one bag at a time from any seller. In the few weeks we have used ‘Too Good To Go’ new food outlets have joined the scheme. If you are using the app to save some money on your food shop bear in mind any travel costs to collect the food or cell phone charges. As you have no choice in your order it is not ideal for picky eaters. Twice our order has been cancelled due to a lack of food waste. We were given a few hours notice and the cost was instantly refunded If you are flexible you can save a considerable amount of money, enjoy a really tasty variety of food and do your bit to reduce food waste.

55,5 Secrets Which Excelling Agribusiness Farmers Use to Boast Their Farming,food," Robert is an Agribusiness Consultant, who studied Agribusiness Management Crop Farming In commercial crop or livestock production, it is the expectations for any agribusiness farmers to make enough profit, which will sustain his farming activities and at the sometime motivate him to continue production. Much as this is the case, not every farmer who is in commercial production farming is able to obtain enough profits. This is the case because of several factors, which among others include; farmers' knowledge and skills, adaptability, agronomic practices, capital constraints, improper market. This article will give in details, the 5 secrets which excelling agribusiness farmers use to boast their farming production. To begin with, let's first look in detail on factors which makes majority of farmers fail to obtain the expected farming output.  In any farming business, farmers' knowledge and skills are key to obtain high yield as it makes him or her able to use available resources more efficiently which help to reduce cost of farming production. Farmers' knowledge and skills, also help farmers to be able to come up with a combination of crop varieties or animals which will give him or her higher profits and it also helps him or her to easily identify the risks involved in his farming activities, which can help him deal with risks and uncertainties through diversification among others. Different places or locations have got different climatic conditions and soil nutrient content, and this makes some farming production to give more yield in one location than the others, under similar agronomic practices. Similarly, some animals are well adapted to other locations and gives optimal results than same animals given similar care in another location, having different climatic conditions. Different farmers have got different agronomic practices, some of which makes the farming activities more efficient than others and this result in obtaining different farming output under similar climatic conditions. Some farmers are very brilliant and have good farming knowledge and skills, but they fail to produce high yield or increased livestock production, because of lack of enough capital and this makes them been seen as failed farmers, which is not necessarily the case. Some farmers obtain high yield, but are unable to make more profits than those who obtain a little yield because of the geographical nature of their location does not have good markets to sell their output. Lack of good market research may also contribute to this challenge.  Having looked at the factors which makes some farmers to obtain lower profits than others, now let's take a look at 5 secrets which excelling agribusiness farmers use to boast their farming production. Research has shown that modern farming equipments and technologies have the potential of making farming activities more efficiently which results in reduced cost of production and at the same time increased output. A majority of excelling business farmers are able to learn different latest farming techniques and technologies which help them in their farming production. Excelling agribusiness farmers are able to conduct a simple research which aims at discovering latest farming equipments which makes farming more efficient and while at the same time sustainable. Sustainability is coming in because some heavy farming equipments, have the potential to destroy soil structures which result in reduced yields in a few years or could result in increased cost of production in restoring the depleted soil. Excelling agribusiness farmers do not stay idle, almost each and every time they have a desire to learn more on farming and they could join online farming lessons or joining physical classes teaching agribusiness farming techniques, which would help them making their farming more efficient. An example here could be a poultry farmer who has desire to decrease cost of production by making his or her own feeds at home, this can make him or her able to join physical or online classes teaching how to make poultry feeds and this might help him to lower cost of production. Excelling agribusiness farmers are able to hire experts to help them with technical knowledge or solve certain farming problems. They are able to hire agribusiness managers or agriculture economists to manage their farming activities in more efficient ways, which would result in high production and lower cost of production. When it comes to livestock production, they could hire a veterinary officer to monitor the conditions of his or her animals, in case they are becoming abnormal and this result in avoiding losses he or she would incur. The majority of farmers are in commercial production, but not everyone is able to conduct successful market research or has one time conducted a research before selling his output, and also conducting a research to know if the customer or consumer are getting satisfied with the product he offers on the market. This becomes a problem as it makes some people lose loyal customers, and also result in some farmers selling their output to the wrong people or buyers who deplete their farming profits. In conclusion, this article has explained in detail the 5 secrets which excelling agribusiness farmers use in their farming production to maximize their profits."
56,Vegetable Cultivation Farming in Home Gardens,food," Vegetable Cultivation Farming Vegetable farming has a potential to reward a gardener, but it needs effort and solving a few gardening challenges. For high vegetable yields to be obtained in gardening, it needs a good fertile land to be selected, good agronomic practices, a few right amount and quantity of fertilizers to be applied, proper planing among others. Home garden vegetables can be produced any time of the year provided the soil has right moisture content and right soil temperature requirement. Garden vegetables tend to be fresh and has high nutritive value. This article will provide in detail on how to grow vegetables in your home garden and it will include all agronomic requirements. The word vegetable can mean any tender form of edible parts of fruits, shoot, leaves among others which is consumed while cooked or in raw.  Under this classification we have all leafy vegetables (cabbage, water leaf, lettuce), all fruit vegetables (cucumber, tomato, okra, eggplant, garden egg, sweet pepper), all seed vegetables (melon and Ito melon), all root vegetables (sweet potato, radish, Irish potato, carrot), all spices (onion, garlic, chilli pepper). Under this classification we have all cool weather vegetables (cabbage, garlic, onion), all warm weather vegetables (eggplant, okra, tomato, pepper, cucumber). Under this we have all genera and species. Under this we have all regularly grown vegetables (Onion, Okra; Eggplant, Tomato, among others), all occasional vegetables (Mushrooms, Basella Rubra among others). Under this we have all short growing vegetables, vegetables which needs more time to be harvested and so on.  These vegetables are commonly grown on home backyard farms and are associated with tropical Africa climate. They need hot and humid conditions, heavy rains among others. These vegetables do not need large investment capital to be grown and are done mainly for home consumption. These are vegetables known to have originated from cool temperate regions (examples are; lettuce, cabbage, radish, carrot, Irish potato among others).  All the materials, list of activities to be done, the areas you may require technical support, type of vegetables to grow, the type of soil and it's nutrient ingredients, expected places to sell your vegetables should be sketched on a paper. This will make the farming more efficient and will help you save time and money.  Selecting a good site to be used for gardening is very important for successful production. Make sure you select a site having good soil fertility, well drained soil, and most of all, select the soil which has good water holding capacity. When selecting a site, make sure it is close to your home for easy monitoring, while at the same time close to the market for easy marketing your vegetables. When choosing the type of soil for garden vegetables, sandy loam soil is considered as an ideal. How we prepare soil for home gardening is partly different to other field crops. Prepare your land by removing all unwanted materials in your garden and till the area, where applicable, prepare raised seedbed and leave it a few days before planting. It is recommended to add 1.4 kg of ammonia fertilizer per 93 square meters of soil surface. Make sure the chosen site has good water holding capacity to avoid soil moisture shock and as well as waterlogging. In case your garden has acidic soil, make sure you apply lime to neutralize it to the recommended soil pH for vegetables, which is 5.8 to 6.5. Before any application of lime and fertilizer is done to your home garden, make sure you conduct a soil analysis to know the right quantity of lime to apply as well as right type and quantity of fertilizer to apply. It is recommended to apply N-P-K fertilizer to your home vegetables after the vegetable planting. Different vegetables have got different spacing requirements, therefore, this will depend on the choice of vegetable which you want to grow, but it is advisable to have a proper row spacing and between vegetable plants for optimal performance. All cool season vegetables should be planted in the cool season when the soil has right moisture and temperature requirements, similarly, all the warm season vegetables, should also be planted in the warm season when the soil has reached its minimum requirements. Using transplants to grow your vegetables speed up maturity period. Transplant seeds can easily be done on a nursery field where monitoring becomes easier. Make sure you slow down water application to your nursery field a few days before transplanting is done. Make sure that the transplanting is done early morning or in the evening and each transplant should be watered and covered with a mulch for a few days. Always make sure your garden has right moisture content all the time. You can supply water to your home garden by means of Irrigation, but make sure the site is not waterlogged. Most vegetables require 3.8 cm of water per week for optimal yield.  Make sure you remove all the weeds in your garden to avoid them for competing nutrients, water and sunlight with your vegetables. You can remove them by hand picking or by using a hoe. Weeds in your garden can also be controlled by applying glyphosate a week before the transplanting is done.  Harvesting is done when the type of vegetable you have grown has matured. Different varieties have got different maturity index and different harvesting methods."

60,Maize Cultivation Farming and Management,food," Maize Cultivation Farming Maize is one of the food crops which is commonly grown by different people in different countries and it is one of the main food crops just like Rice in some countries. It can be grown both under rain fed and Irrigation. It requires a well distributed annual rainfall of 600 to 1000 mm and an optimum soil pH of 5.5 to 8 to give optimum yield under good agronomic practices. Maize is able to tolerate to drought and some acidic soils unlike other crops. This article will provide you in detail on how to grow maize with all the required agronomic activities.  The choice of variety depends on several factors, which among others include the following: As a farmer it is recommended to choose and use a variety which is well adapted to your area. The variety which matches climatic conditions of your area. Nowadays, it is advisable to grow hybrid maize variety which has potential to give high yields over local varieties. It is also recommended to purchase a certified seed for optimal yields. For the guidance on the choice of varieties, consult your local agriculture extension officer. It takes a range of 120 to 140 days for the early maturity maize seed to be ready for harvesting from the day of planting and it takes a range of 141 to 155 days for the medium variety maize seed to mature. However, even though this is the case, it also depends on several factors, i.e., air temperature, agronomic practices among others. It is recommended not to put all eggs in one basket, make sure you grow at least one variety on your farm. An altitude can also affect the time taken for a maize variety to mature.  The maize crop performs well in warm temperate areas having an optimal temperature range of 21 to 27 °C. In areas whose daily temperature falls as low as 19 °C and night temperature falls below 14 °C, maize does not perform well. Such areas, maize can be grown in dry season under Irrigation. Maize can be grown up to a temperature of 35 °C, however, any temperature from 28 to 35 °C, maize crop does not give optimal yield. The optimal germination temperature for maize is known to between 17 to 19 °C. The chances of germination are lowered when temperature falls below 14 °C. Maize crop requires well distributed annual rainfall of a range of 600 mm to 1000 mm, however, it can also be grown in areas which receives annual rainfall as low as 480 mm, but it has to be evenly distributed. When growing maize, it is recommended to keep on monitoring soil moisture content to avoid the moisture content shortfalls as maize crop respond negatively to any moisture stress. Similarly, monitor your maize field to make sure it does not turn waterlogged. Maize produces an optimal yield in a well drained loam soils having good soil fertility, however, maize crop can be grown in a wide range of soils. The optimum soil pH for growing maize is known to be in a range of 5.5 to 8.  Make sure you prepare your site in preparation for maize cultivation. You need to remove all the tree stumps, bush and then plough or till, and make field ridges in preparation for planting. You can also add manure to improve soil fertility for optimal yields. It is recommended to treat your maize seeds with chemicals which will protect it against soil pests, diseases, and birds attack. The following chemicals are recommended and can be applied; marshal 2% dust and Apron Star. One packet weighing 10g can be used to treat 5 kg maize seeds. It is recommended to plant maize seeds with the first rain if the amount of rain water is sufficient for planting. Plating date will depend with ecological zone, however, make sure you plant your seeds at the beginning of rainy season. It is recommended to have 36,000 to 60,000 maize plants per hectare depending on type of variety and environmental yield potential. High maize population can be established using early rain so that the maize plant can make full use of rain water in the season. High plant population can also be established using Irrigation water as management becomes easier. In dry land conditions, make sure you lower the maize population to a range of 37,000 to 40,000 per hectare. The recommended Seed rate per hectare is 25 kg per hectare. 10 kg of maize seeds is enough to plant 1 acre, similarly, 5kg can be planted on a half acre. When planting maize seeds, make sure the seeds are not placed as deep as above 5 cm. The recommended spacing for maize planting is known to be 75 × 50 cm, where each stand can have 2 plants. Maize can be planted manually using hands or mechanically. Before any application of fertilizer is done in your maize plant, make sure you conduct a soil analysis to know the right type and quantity of fertilizer to apply based on the soil test results. The recommended nutrients per hectare is ; 50 kg of muriate of potash, 50 kg of single super phosphate and 50 kg Nitrogen fertilizer. You can apply 6 bags of N-P-K 15-15-15 per hectare to your maize field for optimal yields and this should act as the first dose. The second dose should be 2 bags of Urea weighing 50kg each applied to one hectare of maize field. The first dose can be applied during planting or during the first week after planting while the second dose can be applied in 4 to 5 weeks after planting. Before a second fertilizer application is done, make sure the maize field is free from weeds.  After planting make sure you remove weeds in your field as soon as they emerge and this can be done in 2 weeks for the first weeding and in 4 to 5 weeks for the second weeding. This will make your field to be free from weeds. You can remove these weeds manually using a hoe. Weeding can also be achieved through herbicides and if you want to use this method, make sure you follow the given instructions.  From the day of planting, maize harvesting can be done in a range of 80 to 110 days depending on type of variety and other ecological factors. During harvesting, maize cob is removed from maize stalk and this can be done by hands."

65,Rice Cultivation Farming : Basic Rice Production Techniques,food," Robert is an Agribusiness Consultant, who studied Agribusiness Management Rice Cultivation Rice is considered one of the major staple foods in countries around the globe and is consumed across all socioeconomic classes. Nowadays it is becoming common to see people shifting to rice from other food alternatives like Maize (Corn Field) and this makes rice consumption to be increasing rapidly in the world. In some people as their daily income level changes, they shift their main food meal to Rice making it to have an ever increasing demand across the world. Much as this is the case, a lot of farmers are looking for various ways which would enable them to grow Rice in the most efficient way. This article will provide you in detail on how to grow Rice and it explains the agronomic requirements for optimal yields.  Rice crop performs well in areas having hot and high humidity climatic conditions and has optimum temperature requirements of 21 to 37 °C, however, it can also be grown in areas which has a temperature as high as 42 °C and still gives a better result. Rice performs better in regions having prolonged sunlight and has optimal germination temperature requirements of a range of 25 to 30℃. Rice cultivation requires well distributed rainfall having an optimal annual requirement of 1750 mm to 3000 mm. However, it can also be grown in areas having annual rainfall as low as 711.45 mm. Rice cultivation gives optimal yields when grown on clay or clay loam soils having an optimal soil pH of a range of 6 to 7 with best results be achieved in 6 which is uncommon in most soils.  For best results, make sure you select a good site which have all the rice cultivation ecological requirements. Some people grow Rice on lowland, which are areas very close to flood places) while others grow Rice in uplands, which are areas having 700 mm of rainfall annually and has good soil fertility. The key point here is that, the site where you want to select, should match all the required conditions for growing Rice as stated in adaptability section. Make sure you select good and healthy seeds with high germination percentages at least 80% to reduce the extra cost in Rice production. The best way to do this, is by buying certified Rice seeds from certified companies in your local area. Dormancy is a problem in Rice cultivation, and is defined as the inability of a seed to germinate under good conditions required for germination. Dormancy in Rice is solved by heating to a temperature around 50 °C. Alternatively, you can also break the dormancy in Rice by soaking the Rice in a concentrated nitric acid for a period of 16 to 24 hours. Concentration percentage of nitric acid should be 69% per litter of water. Three methods can be used to plant rice, namely; Drill, Broadcast and Dibble. For straight row planting and optimum plant population, make sure you use the Drilling and Dibbling methods. A time to plant depends on the place where you want to cultivate your Rice as lowland closest to flood area has moisture all the time suitable for growing Rice, while upland areas will have to wait for rain season. In case you want to grow Rice in rain period, make sure you plant your Rice at the beginning of the rainy season. Rice can be sown in a nursery bed and when all the seedlings have germinated, you can transfer them to the main field. This method works best when you want to cultivate Rice on a small piece of land, but it becomes tiresome when you want to grow more hectares of land and you want doing transplanting manually. Transplanting has a potential of ensuring uniformity of plant growth and it also protect Rice against weeds. Before any application of fertilizer is done on your Rice plant, make sure you conduct the soil analysis to be able to know the right type and quantity of fertilizer to apply to your Rice field. For lowland Rice production, it is recommended to apply 60 to 80 kg of nitrogen per hectare and 13 kg of phosphorus per hectare. It is recommended to apply 4 bags of N-P-K fertilizer per hectare of Rice to achieve required nutrients. Similarly, you can also apply similar quantity in uplands Rice cultivation.  In Rice cultivation it is recommended to weed the Rice field 2 times in 3 to 6 weeks and this can be done manually using a hoe. Herbicides can also be used to control the weeds in Rice field, but make sure you follow the required instructions.  From the time of planting, the Rice harvesting starts in a range of 125 to 136 days depending on type of varieties and other factors. Each plant is able to produce 70 to 100 grains. Harvesting is done by cutting the rice stem close to the base and this can be done using a sickle."

68,Dreaming About the Farmer's Life? 4 Things to Consider First,food," If you love the great outdoors, want to be your own boss, and have a desire to make a real difference in today's world while escaping the hustle and bustle of a 9-5 job, you may be dreaming of having your own farm. With some places offering substantial land and money for farms and homesteads, more and more people are dreaming of planting food and raising herds. While it's certainly possible to make a living as a farmer, it can be difficult at the beginning. If you are dreaming about the farmer's life, here are three things to consider before you begin your new adventure. Remember that when you are starting a farm, you are starting a very complex business that will require a business model in order to succeed. When doing so, you will need to focus on your farm's operations, finances, and marketing. In most cases, the work that you are doing on your farm now, pre-season or post-season, won’t be profitable until the following season when you are harvesting your crops or selling your cattle. Your business model should include a description of your production system, transportation and storage needs, the marketing methods you will use to reach your target market, and where you expect your farm to be financially within one year, five years, and 10 years. Starting a farm is considered to be a very risky business proposition. As a result, many new farmers like yourself often keep a day job while they are getting their farms up and running. Since you will need to acquire various pieces of farm equipment, it’s ideal to work with a company like Bane-Welker Equipment. A farm equipment company can help you acquire whatever equipment you need at the best price available while still ensuring the quality is good. Once you have the equipment purchased or leased financed, then you will have a better idea of how long you need to keep working at your day job while funding your new farm. When you start your farm, there will be plenty of things you won't know. Therefore, you will need to develop a variety of relationships along the way in order to build your farm into a successful venture. Not only will you need to get to know other farmers who are also new to the business, but also ones who have had generations of farmers in their families. Also get to know extension agents, vendors, farming veterinarians, and anyone else who can help your business. By tapping into the knowledge of experienced farmers and others, you'll likely experience far fewer sleepless nights. One of the most common pictures that people have in their mind when thinking about living on a farm is out in the open spaces and away from the hustle and bustle of city life. However, there are some things that make living off-grid challenging. For example, getting electricity and clean drinking water are among the first challenges that you need to overcome when starting an off-grid farm. For many people, off-grid living is part of the enjoyment of farming. If this is the case for you, then it may be the perfect thing for you. That is, of course, if you’re able to learn and adapt quickly enough to the land and your needs. However, if you are more interested in staying closer to town so you can stay connected to the grid with plumbing, electrical and freshwater, then you may be more limited in your location options. With the limitations in where you can set up your farm, you may want to consider finding a farm that has already been established and whose owners are interested in selling. Unfortunately, the farming industry hasn’t been declining over the last few years. This decline is not only challenging for you as a newcomer to farming but it is also an opportunity for you to purchase an already established farm at a decent price.  Now that you know a few things you will need to give serious thought to regarding a farming life, it will be easier to make the best decision on how to proceed. If you are up to the challenges that lie ahead, living the farmer's life can be satisfying and rewarding both personally and professionally."
69,Pineapple Cultivation Farming,food," Robert is an Agribusiness Consultant, who studied Agribusiness Management Pineapple Cultivation Pineapple cultivation is becoming more profitable business in different countries in the world because of it mult-use. It is a perennial plant that produces multi-fruits and it requires an optimal temperature of 15.6 °C to 32.2 °C to give optimal yield. Pineapple has Vitamin A and C, and has good flavour and taste. It grows to a height of a range of 50 to100 cm. The Pineapple performs well in different soils provided the soil has right moisture content, good drainage and aeration. The optimum soil pH for growing pineapple is known to be in a range of 5.0 to 6.0. This article will give in detail on how to grow Pineapple for optimal performance.  Pineapple cultivars are vegetatively propagated and for this reason they are called ""clone"" and these clones are classified into 4 types which are; Pernambuco, Cayenne, Queen and Spanish. Large scale farmers who are in commercial business, most of them grow Cayenne.  Pineapple performs well in tropical and subtropical areas, and has an optimal temperature requirement of 21 °C to 27 °C with a relative humidity in a range of 70 to 80%. Pineapples require well distributed annual rainfall in a range of 1200 to 1500mm and this is mostly the case in tropical and subtropical regions. Pineapples do well in acidic soils having an optimal range of 5.0 to 6.5. They do well on clay sandy soil with good drainage and aeration. You can use soil management techniques to improve your soil to match the optimal requirement.  Make sure the soil is well tilled in preparation for Pineapple planting. You can prepare the land manually using a hoe. After tillage, it is recommended to add manure to improve soil fertility for optimal performance. If the soil where you want to grow your Pineapple is prone to nematodes, make sure you fumigate the soil or treat the soil with nematicide. If the soil where you want to grow your Pineapple has poor drainage, make sure you prepare raised fieldbeds at least 20 cm in height. Make sure you use suckers and slips for planting to be able to harvest your Pineapple earlier since they produce flowers early than a crown. Each slip can be in the size range of 45 to 50 cm and each sucker can be in a range of 55 to 60 cm. The recommended plant population for Pineapples per hectare is 58,700 plants. In commercial Pineapple production, 90 centimeters wide black polyethylene mulch is used. For optimal performance, Pineapple requires application of fertilizers to supplement its nutrient requirements. You can apply fertilizer to supplement it with nitrogen (N), potassium (K), and iron (Fe), but make sure any application of fertilizer is done after soil analysis is conducted to know the right amount of fertilizer and quantity to apply. You can apply 75 kg of phosphorus fertilizer per hectare but Pineapple requires more nitrogen fertilizer than phosphorus. It is recommended to apply N-P-K fertilizer for optimal production. Make sure your soil has right required moisture when growing your Pineapple. In case of low moisture content, make sure you supplement water through Irrigation. The recommended type of Irrigation method to use is drip system, however, you can also use any other type of Irrigation system provided the soil will reach the optimal moisture content. In the absence of rainfall, make sure you Irrigation 47,000 to 94,000 litters of water in one hectare per week. During Irrigation make sure that the soil does not turn into waterlogging.  Make sure your Pineapple field is free from weeds, you can control weeds manually or mechanically, however, in most larger scale production, weeds are commonly controlled by black plastic mulch. In case you want to use herbicides to control the weeds, make sure you follow all the written instructions.  Make sure you provide supportive material to your Pineapple plant so that it can not lodged in case of heavy wind since its roots is shallow and cannot support itself.  Make sure you harvest your Pineapples in 15 to 18 months after planting day. Pineapples flowing starts at 10 to 12 months. Harvesting is done with a sharp knife by cutting matured and ripe Pineapple."

To answer your question on the type of Mushroom which is easy and good to grow under indoor management, the following is easy to grow and commonly grown Mushroom under indoors; Oyster Mushrooms, Shitake and white Mushrooms. Shitakes grow and give better yield on hardwood sawdust while Oyster Mushrooms need to be grown on straw or coffee to give the best results.The point which you must be aware is that all the three types of Mushroom Oyster Mushrooms, Shitake and white Mushrooms, can be grown on sawdust or in straw. Spawn is like plant seedlings that facilitates Mushroom growth. After choosing the type of Mushroom to grow based on your personal preferences, make sure you buy Mushroom spawn, this spawn is a type of sawdust which is permeated with Mushroom mycelia, which is the root structure of fungus. The spawn act like Mushroom plant seedlings that facilitates Mushroom growth. Some retailer sells spores, which need more time and effort to grow so make sure you buy spawn which is easy to grow.  Whether the Mushroom is grown in sawdust or straw at home, it is recommended to sterilize the mediums before inoculating it with the spawn. This process will involve killing any microorganisms that may compete with the mycelia. After buying the spawn, the next step is to sterilize the substrate and you can do this by using a microwave. Place it in a container and add a litle water, and this will make you have a sawdust or straw dump and put this in a microwave and heat it on high flame in a container. The heating can stop after the added water boil up and this could take two minutes or more and the purpose for doing this is to kill microorganisms and this will make it safe for the substrate to receive the mycelia.  After sterilizing the substrate, the next step is to heat the substrate so the mycelia is able to spread. It is recommended for the mycelia to be thoroughly spread into the substrate before the Mushrooms are produced. A warm temperature is required to accelerate the growth. After this process, place the substrate which is suitable for Mushroom in a shallow pan which has large surface area which provide enough room for Mushroom to grow. After this, make sure you add the spawn into a substrate using a sterilized utensil and then place it in a heated pan having an ideal temperature of 21 °C as required for the growing Mushroom. After this, make sure you leave it there for three weeks and you can as well place it in any dark place which is warm and this will enable the mycelia to permeate into the substrate.  After 14 days, make sure you check the substrate to see if it has been colonized fully. It is recommended to cover substrate with a white fuzzy if it is grown at home and this can be done in 14 to 28 days. After this, make sure you move the pan into a dark and cool temperature environment if the substrate is already colonized.  After 3 weeks small Mushrooms become visible, still more a dark, cool temperature place should be maintained. The place should have a right moisture content as well. Mushroom can be plucked by using hand figures."

It performs well in tropical and subtropical lowland areas and is considered as a perennial plant. Sweet potatoes are known to produce better results in unfavourable environments unlike other crops which do not give yield under unfavourable conditions. This article will provide in detail on how to grow and manage your Sweet potato for successful production.  There are two broad categories of Sweet potato and these are; staple type having a white flesh and a purple skin, and dessert type having orange skin.  Sweet potatoes perform well in warm temperate areas and they grow best in summer period and are known to be of tropic origin. Sweet potato does not do well in cold weather areas, so make sure you avoid growing Sweet potato in frost period. Sweet potatoes give better yield in a temperature range of 21 to 29 °C, however, they also give a better result in a temperature range of 18 °C to 35 ° C. Sweet potato performs well in an altitude of up to 1,700 m above sea level (m.a.s.l), however, some varieties can also grow even up to 2,500 m above sea level. Sweet potato which is grown around 2,500 m.a.s.l does not give better taste in most cases. Sweet potato performs well in an optimum annual rainfall of a range of 900mm to 1330 mm and it has to be well distribution, however, it can also be grown in areas having annual rainfall of 500mm to 1300 mm.  Sweet potato performs well on sandy loam which should be well drained. The optimum soil pH for growing Sweet potato is 5.6 to 6.5. Excessive moisture content promotes tuber root, so make sure you avoid growing Sweet potato in areas prone to flooding or waterlogging condition. Make sure you select a site which has also high soil fertility and good soil drainage. Make sure you clear your site where you want to grow your Sweet potato by removing vegetative covers and plough thoroughly. After ploughing make field ridges (30cm to 60 cm) high and 60cm to 90 cm apart.  Sweet potato is propagated from stem cuttings, which are obtained from Sweet potatoes stems, which were previously grown. Small tubers can also be grown in a nursery field to produce stems which can be propagated and planted in the actual field. Make sure the slips which you want to plant in actual field are free from diseases and pests. During planting each cutting is planted in the soil about 30 cm deep at an angle of 45°. Make sure half of the cutting is buried in the soil and has at least three nodes. Sweet potato can also be planted mechanically whenever the land is too long. The time to plant depends on the climatic conditions of your area. Make sure you plant your cuttings when the soil at least has reached a minimum soil moisture and temperature requirements for cultivation of Sweet potato, however, Sweet potato can also be grown throughout the year under Irrigation. Make sure you avoid growing Sweet potato in cold spell or frost period. It is recommended to have 40,000 Sweet potato plants per hectare and the rows can be spaced at 1 to 1.25 m apart and in row spacing of 25 to 30 centimeters. It is recommended to have a plant population of 40,000 per hectare, however, one hectare of land can also have 30,000 to 60,000 Sweet potato cuttings planted depending on type of variety and other factors. Make sure before you apply any fertilizer you conduct a soil analysis to know the right type of fertilizer as well as the amount to apply in your field. During planting, you can apply 57 to 85 grams of N-P-K fertilizer per plant and after 8 weeks you can apply 85 to 113 grams of N-P-K fertilizer per plant, this will promote growth. Sweet potato is known to be drought tolerant plants, however, it needs right moisture content all the time to give the best results. During the early days, it requires a range of 18 to 20mm of water per week and during the middle period of its growth it needs a range of 40 to 45 mm of water per week. In the later time of its growth it just need 20 mm of water per week, so you must make sure you slow down moisture content. Any soil moisture shortfall should be supplied with Irrigation water.  Make sure your field is free from weeds all the time. You can apply herbicides to take control of your weed and you can as well remove them manually with the help of a hoe.  Under good management, the expected Sweet potatoes yield per hectare is 11,363.6 to 13,636.6 kg. Sweet potato harvesting can start after 18 weeks, so make sure you check them after such period to know if they are mature enough for market purposes. You can harvest them manually by using a hoe and you can as well use a tractor drawn, the choice of method will depend on hectares of land and labour availability."
74,Turkey Production Farming and Management,food," Robert is an Agribusiness Consultant, who studied Agribusiness Management Turkey Farming Turkey production is common in rural small scale producers, but it can as well be kept on a large scale for commercial purposes. Turkeys are fast growing poultry birds and this make them to be sold at the age of 12 weeks and can be kept on a free range for small scale production. Comparing Turkey egg to chicken egg, Turkey egg weighs more than chicken egg, about 3 times more and Turkeys are known to withstand numerous diseases than chickens. This article will provide in detail on how to keep Turkey as well as management practices.  This breed has white feathers, and is neither small nor large in size. Toms (male Turkey) weighs a range of 10 to 12 kg, while the female Turkey (hens) weighs an average of 7.5 kg. This breed is common and male weighs a range of 15 to 18 kg under good management while the hen can weigh a range of 12 to 13 Kilograms and has bronze colours feathers. This breed is more common in European countries, but it can be kept in all climatic conditions. White Holland tom weighs up to 16 kg under good management and this breed is suitable for meat production. It has a medium size body and has snow white feathers. Turkeys are large in size compared to other poultry birds, so make sure you provide enough floor space to each Turkey to allow freedom of movement. They can be kept best in semi-intensive system, but can also perform better on an intensive system of large scale commercial production. Construct a simple but strong Turkey house which is able to provide shelter and provide a protection to your animal and make sure the house is easy to clean and is kept clean all the time. Make sure the Turkey house has a temperature range of 15 to 18 °C and is well ventilated all the time. In Turkey house, make sure each Turkey has a free space of not less than 0.4 to 0.5 square meters. Brooding in Turkey is similar to that of chicken or other poultry birds. Turkey should be under the brooding system for a period up to 6 to 8 weeks. Make sure the Turkey brooder has a temperature around 38 °C and this temperature can be reduced by 0.5 each day to 4 to 6th week. It is more common for a poult (a Turkey chick) to die due to starvation as in most cases, they do not start eating feeds themselves, therefore, a good care has to be given to reduce the number of mortalities. Poult has also a leg weakness problem which has to be monitored more closely. Give broiler starter ratio to poult till 8th weeks to Turkeys meant for meat and this will enable them to be eaten or sold at 16 to 20 weeks. Turkey finisher mash can be given from 16th to 20th week when possible. Provide layer feeds if the breeds are for egg production and this can be from 12th week.

76,Why El Pollo Loco Is My Favorite Fast Food Chain,food," Sarah has tried various pizza chains over the years and loves Chicago deep-dish pizza. Daniel Hooper on Unsplash El Pollo Loco is a Mexican fast-food chain specializing in grilled chicken and is located in various states around the United States. The first El Pollo Loco was opened in Mexico in 1974 and the fast-food chain came to the United States in 1980. The first El Pollo Loco in the United States was in Los Angeles and now El Pollo Loco has locations in many cities in California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, and Louisiana. There are more than 500 locations in the United States and at least 50 locations in Mexico. El Pollo Loco specializes in grilled chicken and advertises their chicken as being marinated in citrus and flame-grilled. When going to El Pollo Loco, you can order their grilled chicken as a meal with your choice of two sides plus two tortillas and a drink or you can order just a single piece of chicken. For example, there's the two-piece meal, three-piece meal, or four-piece meal. If you want to order just a single piece of chicken, you can order a breast, thigh, wing, or drumstick. There's a variety of sides that you can order with your meal which are Mexican rice, pinto beans, fire-roasted corn with bell peppers, broccoli, mac n cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy, side salad, and coleslaw. You can also order family dinners like at KFC and Popeyes where you get large portions of sides plus eight, twelve, or sixteen pieces of grilled chicken. There are also chicken burritos, tostadas, bowls, and tacos. There's a wide variety of types that you can order so you'll find something you like to eat at El Pollo Loco. If none of these seem appetizing to you, there are also limited-time items that El Pollo Loco offers depending on the time of year. Currently, there are shredded beef tacos, burritos, and quesadillas in addition to their normal grilled chicken menu. If you are on a keto diet, El Pollo Loco also offers keto-friendly burritos and salad.   Isabella and Zsa Fischer on Unsplash I love El Pollo Loco because it's a much healthier option than going to KFC or Popeyes. All of El Pollo Loco's chicken is grilled rather than fried and El Pollo Loco is constantly grilling chicken so it's very fresh. The chicken is not greasy at all and is rather lean compared to the chicken that you get at KFC or Popeyes. I enjoy KFC and Popeyes too but I like that the chicken isn't greasy at El Pollo Loco. The sides are also healthy too because none of it is greasy. Therefore, El Pollo Loco is a really good healthy option when getting fast food. Even though the chicken is grilled, it's rarely ever dry and always tastes great. The citrus marinade plus the taste of the grill makes El Pollo Loco's chicken taste very unique. Most people don't like grilled chicken because they think it doesn't have enough flavor or is dry but El Pollo Loco's chicken is nothing like that. El Pollo Loco is also cheap for all the food that you get. Most of the items are less than $10 and there's also a very cheap extras menu where most things cost less than $3. The two-piece chicken meal that I order is less than $8 without the drink and less than $10 with a drink. The prices are similar to the prices of Popeyes and can seem expensive compared to places like McDonald's or Burger King but the food is much better at El Pollo Loco. Therefore, you're definitely getting more for your money's worth and you will leave feeling happy and full. Tai's Captures on Unsplash Mexican food always fills me up so I love that El Pollo Loco is filling and satisfying. I always order the two-piece meal with two sides and two tortillas. I like dark meat when it comes to chicken so I always get the drumstick and thigh. I also like to get Mexican rice and fire-roasted corn so that I feel like I'm eating balanced. The chicken looks small but when I eat the sides and one tortilla, I'm already full. The two-piece meal also includes a drink so I'm definitely very full. Eating at El Pollo Loco is very satisfying because I feel full of real food, not just empty calories. When I eat at places like Popeyes or KFC, I feel full at first but then I get hungry after a couple of hours because I ate fries or fake powdered potatoes. These are just empty calories so I end up needing a snack later. Eating Mexican rice and corn with the chicken plus tortillas is really like eating an entire meal because there are carbs, protein, and vegetables. Therefore, I'm definitely full. © 2022 Sarah Wong"
77,Cowpeas Cultivation Farming,food," Robert is an Agribusiness Consultant, who studied Agribusiness Management Cowpeas Cultivation Cowpea is commonly grown in dry lands of different countries around the globe and is one of the most important crops and it is gaining popularity across the world. Cowpeas are able to give better results in low rainfall areas and they are known to be drought tolerant unlike other crops. Cowpeas provide excellent human nutrition and has also a good rotational benefits. It can also be grown together with Maize (intercropping) and still achieve a better yields. This article will provide in detail on how to grow cowpeas as well as it management requirements.  Make sure you select a variety that matches with agroecological conditions of your areas. This can be based on its suitability for the prevalent climatic conditions and cropping systems in your area. Different varieties have got different maturity date or required time, therefore, the choice of type of variety to grow is based on maturity period, yield potential, drought tolerance, responsiveness to daylength, pest and disease resistance among others. We have got two types of Cowpeas varieties and these are; upright, bunch types, used mainly for grain production; and spreading types, which may be used for grain, vegetable or fodder.  Cowpeas are known to perfom well in summer period. They require a base temperature of 8,5°C to germinate and for leaf growth it requires a temperature of 20°C. Cowpea is both a heat-loving and drought-tolerant crop unlike other crop types. The optimum temperature for growth and development of Cowpeas is known to occur in a temperature range of 28 to 31 °C . Cowpeas are known to be drought tolerant plants and they can be grown under rainfall ranging from 400 to 700 mm per annum. Cowpeas are also able to withstand waterlogging condition unlike other crops, however, always make sure your field is not waterlogged as this can be a source of diseases and pests. Cowpeas are able to give reasonable yield on annual rainfall of a range 400 to 750 mm. If your area has high annual rainfall, make sure Cowpeas are planted at a time to coincide with the peak period of rainfall during the vegetative phase or flowering stage so that the pod-drying could take place during dry weather to be able to get a better yield. Cowpeas performs well on sandy soils, which tend to be less restrictive on root growth, however they can also be grown on a wide range of soils. Cowpeas are able to withstand infertile and acid soils than many other crops. The optimum soil pH for growing Cowpeas falls in a range of 5,6 to 6,0. Make sure you select a well-drained sandy loam soil for growing your Cowpeas and a good site is directly related to the yields. It is known that Cowpea does not tolerate excessively wet conditions or waterlogging and should not be grown on poorly drained soil unlike other crops. Always make sure your site has right moisture content all the time. We use seed to grow Cowpeas and these seeds are directly planted or sown in the field. Make sure you clear the site of shrubs and stubble in preparation for Cowpeas cultivation. Alternatively, you can spray the field with Glyphosat at the rate of 4 L/ha and leave the field for at least 10 days for emerging weeds to die. Land can also be prepared manually with the hand-hoe, but make sure the soil is cultivated deep enough to ensure that no barrier exists to penetration of the soil by Cowpeas taproot. Cowpeas can also be grown under zero tillage technology in areas with high soil erosion. Cowpeas can be planted anytime from the first rains provided the soil has right soil moisture content. In high rainfall areas, it is recommended to plant cowpeas late to avoid diseases when the crop reaches maturity. The following are the recommended plant population and spacing; for the spreading types, make sure you plant 60 000 plants per ha (12 to 15 kg seed per ha). For the ppright, bunch types make sure you plant 120 000 plants per ha (30 to 50 kg seed per ha). Make sure you plant the Cowpeas at the start of the rain season for better yields and make sure the seed are planted to a depth of 3 to 4 centimeters. Make sure you apply low rate compound fertilizer at a rate of 100 to 200 kg per hectare for better yield. Make sure before you apply any fertilizer you conduct a soil analysis to know the soil nutrition ingredients and any application of fertilizer should depend on the soil analysis report. It is recommended to apply more single super phosphate fertilizers than nitrogen fertilizers as Cowpea needs high phosphorus than nitrogen. This phosphorus can be in the form of single super phosphate or SUPA. Apply this Phosphorus about 30 kg per hectare. Keep on checking soil moisture content and apply additional water through Irrigation when soil moisture content is low. Make sure your Cowpeas field is kept free from weeds, as this can be sources of pests and diseases which can decrease the output. The weeds can be checked through the use of herbicides, but make sure you follow the given instructions. Similarly you can also remove weeds in your Cowpeas field manually using hands. For the erect or semi-erect types or Cowpeas, it requires about 100 days from the time of planting to be ready for harvesting. For the grain type, it requires a long time about 120 days. Cowpea can be harvested using a harvester or by hand picking."
78,How to Grow Sweet Pepper: Sweet Pepper Farming and Management Techniques,food," Robert is an Agribusiness Consultant, who studied Agribusiness Management Sweet pepper Cultivation Sweet pepper is a fruit which can be grown throughout the year under a wide range of soil and is used in food dishes. Sweet Peppers are rich in the following nutrition ingredients; vitamins A, B and C, calcium, protein, and fibre. This article will give in detail on how to grow Sweet pepper as well as its management practices which can help you benefits from this rewarding business.  The following are commonly grown Sweet pepper in different countries; King Arthur, Florida Giant, Blue Star, Pacific, California Wonder among others. Sweet pepper performs well in warm weather temperate regions and requires an optimum temperature of 20 to 25 °C. Sweet pepper does not perform well in frost areas, so make sure you grow them during frost free period. When growing them in a temperature range of 5 to 16 °C, it does not give better results. The optimum temperature for Sweet pepper germination is known to be in a range of 24 to 30 °C. Lower temperatures slow down Sweet pepper growth and this may increase their time to be ready for harvesting and this may also accelerate pest damage since they can be exposed to pests for more period. The optimum temperature range for Sweet pepper during flowering is 21 to 24 °C. During flowering when the temperature is above 30 degrees, yield ability is slowed down.  Sweet peppers perform well on deep, well drained soils having a good soil fertility. Sweet pepper does not do well on waterlogged soils and high humidity areas. The optimum soil pH for growing Sweet pepper is known to be in a range of 6 to 7. Avoid growing Sweet pepper on a land or field where herbicides have been used recently, similarly avoid growing on a land where long residual corn or soya bean herbicides have been used recently. Sweet pepper responds negatively to aphid-vectored viruses which attack tobacco, so make sure your field is located away from the tobacco field to avoid the risk of transmission. Make sure you avoid growing Sweet pepper continuously as this will increase chances of depleting soil fertility and in your rotation, make sure that Sweet pepper does not follow Eggplants, tomatoes, strawberry, among others, to reduce risk of Verticillium wilt. Quantity and quality of sweet pepper depend on soil fertility as well as well as agronomic practice, so make sure you perform this well, i.e. growing your Sweet pepper on high soil fertility having right moisture content. Sweet pepper requires annual rain of 2000 mm to give optimal yield, any moisture shortfall, should be supplied with Irrigation water.  Sweet peppers perform well when they are transplanted from nursery field, but they can also he sown directly in the field and give a better result. After transplanting Sweet pepper plant, make sure you Irrigation the plant if moisture content is very low, but make sure you avoid waterlogging condition. Similarly, after sowing your seeds, make sure you Irrigation with clean water if soil moisture content is very low. 2kg of Sweet pepper is required per hectare when sowing Sweet pepper directly in your field. When pepper seeds are sown in a nursery bed, it takes 3 to 4 weeks for the seedlings to be ready for transplanting to the actual field and make sure you slow down water application one week before transplanting is done. Sweet peppers and tomatoes, eggplants e.t.c is attacked by same diseases, so make sure the site where you want to grow Sweet pepper was not recently grown any of these nor hot peppers. You can till or plough the site either through mechanical means or by hands using a hoe.  You can plant or sow directly Sweet pepper to the field any time of the year, the key is that, you should make sure the soil has required soil moisture and temperature. Make sure you transplant your Sweet pepper 3 to 4 weeks from the day they are sown and make sure you slow down water application before transplanting is done. It is recommended to do the transplanting early in the morning and in the evening to avoid direct sunlight which may affect the transplant. When transplanting, make sure the topsoil is mixed with manure if possible to improve soil fertility. After transplanting your seedlings, make sure you supply enough water to each transplant and provide a mulch surrounding each transplant. From the time transplanting is done, Sweet pepper takes a range of 60 to 90 days to be ready for harvesting. Make sure you observe a seedling spacing of 45 centimeters apart within Sweet pepper rows and 60 to 90 centimeters between rows. Whenever Sweet pepper is intercroped, make sure you observe a root room space of 0.5 square meters per Sweet pepper plant. About 100 to 200 grams of Sweet pepper seeds are required per hectare. Make sure before you apply any fertilizer you conduct a soil analysis first to know right type and as well as the amount of fertilizer to apply in your Sweet pepper field. It is recommended to apply 100 kg of NPK fertilizer per hectare and 40 kg of Nitrogen per hectare to your Sweet pepper plants, but this has to be done after soil analysis is done. Sweet pepper plant requires nitrogen for growth and reproduction while phosphorus is required by Sweet pepper for photosynthesis.  Make sure your Sweet pepper field is free from weeds all the time as these can be sources of pests and diseases. You can remove the weeds by hands using a hoe or you can use herbicides to remove or control them with the help of instructions written on the bottle.  Harvesting can be done 60 to 90 days from the time Sweet pepper transplanting is done, under good agronomic practices and a yield of 142812 kg cartoons may be obtained per hectare of land. Harvesting can be done by hand picking the mature Sweet pepper fruit."
79,Ground Turkey and Cheddar Cheese Sliders,food," Carlton Haynes is the innovative, professional chef by trade who loves to cook. my grandkids came to visit me and they went crazy about these little turkey sliders and they did not know it was ground turkey they thought it was ground beef and it really healthy. Ground Turkey and Cheddar Cheese Sliders I made these Ground Turkey and Cheese Sliders when my grandkids came to visit me and they went crazy about these little turkey sliders and they did not know it was ground turkey they thought it was ground beef and when I told them it was turkey and healthy and it was not a problem they ate more and I am sure you family. friends and kids will to so try them and let us know the outcome.

80,How to Grow Beans : Beans Cultivation Farming and Management Techniques,food," Robert is an Agribusiness Consultant, who studied Agribusiness Management Bean Cultivation Farming Beans cultivation farming, is one of profitable agribusiness which can be done on all scale basis (ranging from small scale to large scale production). Almost each and every household is able to consume Beans either a multiple of time per month or at least once in a month or after sometimes. They are known to have the following nutrition ingredients; vitamins, low calories, Carbohydrates, protein, fiber, folate, iron, potassium among others. This article will provide you in detail on how to grow Beans, both on small, medium or large scale basis.  Dry Bean performs better in warm climate areas and has an optimal temperature range of 18 °C to 24 °C. During flowering, it is advised that the temperature should not go beyond 30 °C for optimal performance. During the maturity stage, a fall in temperature below 20 °C results in reduction in maturity process and this may result in an empty Bean pod which can decrease production output. During planting, observe that the soil minimum temperature does not fall below 15 °C. For optimal yields, the Beans require annual well distributed rainfall of a range of 600 to 650mm, however, it also gives better results in areas having annual rainfall between 400 to 500 mm which is well distributed. Bean growing gives best results when grown on sandy loam or sandy clay loam soils and is known to be ideal. The optimum soil pH for growing Beans is known to be in a range of 5.8 to 6.5. During Beans growing, always ensure that the soil has right moisture content because Beans does not tolerate waterlogging condition. Beans are also known to give less yield when grown on alkaline soils. Make sure you conduct a soil analysis to know the nutrition content of your soil which will help you apply right fertilizer as well as helping to know the soil pH of your land to know if it can favour Beans growing. It is recommended to plant Bean seeds which has good qualities, which is free from diseases or any pest damage and is known to have a germination percentage of not less than 80% and this will also help you to reduce cost of supplying ungerminated Bean seeds in your field.  Beans to be planted in raising seedbeds should be prepared in a similar way to that of any crop which are mostly grown in the spring. Your seedbeds should be deep for good Bean seed establishment. Make sure any field where you want to grow your Beans is well ploughed or tilled at least 0.5 m in depth and has fine tilt. Make sure you grow your Beans in frost free period for optimal yields. You can grow your Beans in summer or spring, but make sure the soil has the right moisture when planting your Bean seed and this can be done any time in summer or spring. A range of 250 000 to 350 000 is recommended Bean seed plants per hectare. One hectare of land requires seed quantity of a range of 60 to 100 kg. One kg of Bean seeds is able to contain a range of 3500 to 4000 seeds. The recommended row spacing for growing Beans is known to be 45 centimeters between row to 90 centimeters. For good germination percentage, make sure you place your Bean seeds 10 to 15 mm deep. Beans are leguminous which respond negatively to high concentration of mineral salts, therefore, before any application of fertilizer is done, make sure the soil analysis is conducted and any fertilizer application should be based on analysis report results. You can apply 100 to 120 Kilograms of Nitrogen fertilizers and 30 to 65 Kilograms of Phosphorus fertilizer per hectare, but this should be done after soil analysis. Potassium fertilizer can also be applied in the quantity of 50 to 95 Kilograms per one hectare of land. For complete growing period, Beans requires 600 to 750 mm of water, therefore, make sure any shortfall moisture content is supplied with Irrigation water, while at the same time preventing your field from waterlogging. During flowering make sure you supply 24 to 36 mm of water every 9 or 10 days. You can grow your Beans for 3 to 4 years on the same land, but make sure after such period the land is left to fallow. Since Beans are leguminous plants, make sure in rotation they are followed by non leguminous plants and this could be cereal crops.  Always make sure the Bean Field is free from weeds all the time and this can be achieved by use of herbicides or by manual means through hand picking or weeding using a hoe.  You harvest Beans by hand picking them when their moisture content is around 15% at maturity. However, Beans can also be harvested mechanically."
81,Sugarcane Cultivation Farming Techniques For Successful Production,food," Gomani, is an Agribusiness Consultant who studied Agribusiness Management Sugarcane Cultivation Sugarcane is a perennial grass which has a potential to grow to a height of 4.3 meters and has a thickness of around 5.1 centimeters and is generally grown in tropical regions. Sugarcane is able to store Carbohydrates in the form of sucrose and this makes it to be a perennial grass of value. Its economic value comes from stalk sucrose or Carbohydrates, which it reserves and can be grown both in small scale and on large scale special for commercial purposes. The sugarcane is used as a raw material in production of sugar which is used in different countries. Most of world's sugar we use is made from sugar cane, making it a hot business. The success of sugarcane production, depends on farmers agronomic skills on can production. This article will provide in detail on how to grow sugarcane both on a small scale and commercial large scale production.  Sugarcane performs well in warm temperate areas and is mostly grown in tropical and subtropical areas. The optimum temperature for cultivating sugarcane is known to be in a range of 20 to 35 °C and during germination it requires an optimal range of 32 to 38 °C. Sugarcane plant growth and maturation depend much on weather conditions on top of good agronomic practices. Sugarcane performs well in frost free areas characterized by warm and sunny. High humidity accelerates cane elongation. For successful growth, sugarcane requires an annual rainfall range of 1,500 to 2,500mm and any moisture shortfall, should be supplied with Irrigation. The minimum annual rainfall requirement is known to be 600mm and it can be grown successfully in tropical and subtropical climate regions. Sugarcane performs well on sandy loam soils which has good soil drainage. The optimum soil pH for growing sugarcane is known to be in a range of 6 to 7.6. Make sure the soil has right moisture content and keep on checking to avoid waterlogging which might be caused through Irrigation.  Sugarcane cultivars are propagated for successful production. You stem cut 2-3 lateral buds from immature canes (known as setts). After planting the setts the buds turn into primary and secondary stalk. The average cane planting density is known to be in a range of 15,000 to 24,000 cuttings per hectare. Setts can be in 30 to 45 centimeters in length and can be planted to a depth of 15 to 30 centimeters. You can grow your setts in nursery and later transplant them to actual field and this will provide easy attention to the setts. Even though sugarcane can be propagated vegetatively, it doesn't necessarily mean it cannot be grown from seeds. Make sure your field is set and plant your cane free seeds. A 2.5 kg of cane seeds is enough for a hectare. Make sure you immerse your cane seeds in hot water having a temperature around 51 °C for 2 hours to soften the seeds for successful germination. Avoid growing your sugarcane continuously on the same piece of land, make sure you allow it to fallow. After fallowing, make sure the land is ploughed thoroughly to a depth of 50 to 75 cm. This can be best achieved through the use of a tractor, however, it can also be achieved manually by using any farm tool, i.e. hoe. The cane can be planted manually or mechanically, all what you need to do is to choose either of these which is cost effective. Make sure you place your setts in furrow together with a fertilizer for optimal growth, then you can cover with a soil and water it. Make sure setts are planted 100 cm deep. For optimal yield, make sure you plant your cane under Irrigation in autumn weather. In rainfall, it can be planted in spring. The recommended row and plant spacing for sugarcane production for optimal growth under manual planting is known to be 1.0 to 1.3 m x 0.5 m, while for mechanical is known to be 1.4 and 1.6 m. The setts are planted in a slated form (at a none 90 ° angle). Sugarcane requires application of appropriate fertilizers and the following can be applied to your cane field per hectare; 80 kg of urea and 100 kg of Single Super Phosphate. All these should be applied in the form of a spray. Decomposing fertilizer can also be applied. Sugarcane plants require more water application, so make sure you supplement additional water through Irrigation but make sure the site is kept on check from waterlogging, similarly from moisture stress.  Always make sure your cane field is free from weeds as these can be sources of pests and diseases and also they can be competing soil nutrients with your cane plants. Successful weeding can be done manually or by use of herbicides.  Make sure you harvest your cane when it has reached a height of 2 to 4.1 m and usually this is achieved in 12 to 16 months from the time planting is done. Harvesting can be done manually by using a knife and this is applicable to a small cane field, however, on large scale production, make sure you harvest your cane mechanically to make it more efficient."
82,Doughlicious and the Rise of Cookie Dough,food," Tim is a freelance journalist who has written for FourFourTwo, Cricket365 and Football365. He also specialises in health and beauty articles There are always gaps in the market for the sweet-toothed and the rise of cookie dough has been one of the standout tastes in the last few years for those looking for ways to make taste count within a ticking schedule. After all, the notion that you have to finish dinner before starting on the dessert does not always stand for busy professionals or consumers, whether they are stay at home or roaming. If you reverse your mind to just over 12 months ago, a Japanese-inspired brand gained traction on TikTok with its bite-sized balls of gelato in a layer of soft mochi dough. The scene is set for another outbreak of gooey ice cream love from an American founder who knows all about the rise of the dough globally. Meet Doughlicious. Kathryn Bricken set up her London company Doughlicious in 2014 having spent formative years making gooey American-style cookie dough across the Atlantic. This proved so popular with her friends when she came to London that the approach could surely be refined to making this premium product within minutes in the comfort of your own home.. Fast lives mean less time in the kitchen. Despite the continued popularity of programmes like Masterchef and the popularity of cooking, most mortals do not have the time and space to fuss with all the ingredients. As well as being totally gluten-free, Doughlicious offers dairy-free, organic and vegan flavour options, all made from an eco-friendly factory in London powered by renewable energy. Just as luxury gourmet chocolate makers are increasingly aware of promoting ethical fair trade and the very best premium ingredients, the West London company commits to making gourmet food in the right way with love rather than ticking boxes to look the part. As Bricken says, she is health-conscious but not obsessed. There’s nothing remotely uptight about the joy of enticement with the finished product. It’s moreish without the guilt. Doughlicious’s summer sunshine comes in the form of Dough Chi which comprises of six flavoured bite-sized balls in decadent thick, creamy ice cream and enveloped by delicious cookie dough. They are ready-to-eat from frozen and certainly present a taste that is an upgrade to standard rice flour-coated ice cream balls. The ravishing list of flavours incorporates Blueberry Frozen Yoghurt, decadent Chocolate Truffle, Coconut Dream, Birthday Cake, Dulce de Leche and Chocolate Chip. Cookie dough is also a standalone joy even without the ice cream. The deliveries of this “straight” gourmet cookie dough come with ice bags to keep them cool and can be stored away in the fridge or freezer until ready to bake for only 15 minutes. The dough is portioned carefully so that there is no waste and no mess. Ultimately, taste is king and the range of flavours are wide enough to draw consumers in, from the chocoholics to the tart Cranberry Oatmeal and the Raspberry and White Chocolate. There’s light and shade here. In the 1980s, America fell in love with gourmet ice cream brands like Ben & Jerry’s and who can forget their Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. The nostalgia is the here and now and Doughlicious is in the vanguard for the gourmet journey back to the future. It can be done without the mess of the bowl and without all the time in the world."
83,Fish and Chips Recipes for Dinner,food," Nabiilah is an author who loves writing fantasy / teen fiction novels like The Other Side of Paradise and The Infinity Coven Trilogy Fish and chips is a popular hot dish consisting of fried fish in crispy batter, served with chips. The dish originated in England. Fried fish was likely brought to the UK by Spanish and Portuguese refugees during the 16th century. A fish and chips shop was opened in London in the 1860s by Joseph Malin, who came from a family of rug weavers that needed to supplement their income.

84,Duck Production Farming,food," Duck Production Farming Duck farming is one of profitable poultry farming business due to the fact that duck breeds are known to be disease resistant and are able to lay a range of 160 to 180 eggs annually, which can be incubated or sold. Ducks can be kept under free range, semi-intensive and intensive system, depending on the purpose and capital availability, but they are able to perform better on a wide range of conditions compared to other poultry birds. Regardless of the type of system under which ducks can be kept, there are some basic management skills which a farmer who is in commercial duck production or small scale duck farming must aware or consider. This article will provide in detail on how to get started in duck farming as well as some management information.  This breed originated in England and is known due to its khaki colour. This breed performs better in tropical regions and has egg laying capacity of 250 to 300 per year and is known to be best duck egg producer. Each egg weighs an average of 75 grams. It's body weighs an average of 2.1 kg. This breed is very common in different countries for its table purpose and is known to be a fast growing Duck breed and has low feed consumption compared to other breeds. It's body weighs an average of 2.4 kg in 42 days. This breed is mainly used for meat purposes and originated from England. It weighs and average of 4.5 Kg for Drake and for Duck it weighs 4.0 Kg. This breed weighs a range of 4.5 to 6.4 kg for both duck and Drake and is known to have originated from South America. The breed has egg incubation period of 35 days.  Ducks can be kept on a free range where they can be able to search for their feeds themselves and they can be left to sleep outsides. Much as this is the case, the Ducks are able to give better results if you provide them with a simple house which is able to provide a shelter and as well as protecting it from predators. Ducks like to drink more water so make sure clean water is available all the time. It is not recommended to keep Ducks under litter system since Duck faeces contain more water and this makes them not suitable for litter system of Duck keeping. Make sure your Duck house is slated for easy cleaning and always make sure the house used for Duck keeping, is kept clean and well ventilated all the time.Incubation and hatchingDucks have an incubation period of 28 days and hatching system is similar to that of chickens. Provide supplemental feeds in the form of pellets and this can be in the category of starter, grower and finisher mash depending on the type and purpose of the breed you are keeping. The starter mash can be in a size of 0.3 to 0.5 cm and it's usually given to Ducklings. Make sure the feeds does not contain aflatoxin since Ducklings are prone to Aflatoxicosis. Ducklings require a similar brooding system of management to that of chickens and they do not require to be provided with swimming water. Ducklings can be under brooding for 3 to 4 weeks after that they may be transferred to a separate section. Make sure you maintain a temperature range of 28 to 31 °C during the first week of brooding your Ducklings and be reducing it by 3 °C each week for 4 weeks. Ducks require more water compared to other poultry birds as they release watery faeces. Make sure you provide a simple swimming pool as they prefer to swim as well. Make sure fresh water is available all the time for them to drink. During egg laying, make sure you reduces Duck swimming access.  Ducks likes to wander and peck, however, as other poultry birds, they are susceptible to same diseases which attack other poultry birds so make sure they are of good health all the time. Whenever you notice strange behaviors, call your local veterinary officer immediately."

87,How to Grow Okra: Farming and Management Practices,food," Gomani, is an Agribusiness Consultant who studied Agribusiness Management Okra Cultivation Farming Okra is a vegetable, which can be grown on large, medium and large scale commercial production and is able to grow in most soils of different countries and is known to perform well in warm weather areas. Okra can be prepared in different ways and is able to provide vitamin A to humans. It is a heat tolerant plant which is a member of mallow family, which flowers and produces fruit in summer temperatures. This article will give in detail on how to grow Okra for optimal yields.  The most commonly grown varieties are; Annie Oakley, Delight, Emerald, Green, Velvet among others.  Okra gives a better yield on a temperature range of 24 °C to 35 °C and they are not able to give optimal results in areas having frost conditions. Per acre, Okra has expected yield of 4536 kg to 5443 kg under good agronomic practices. Make sure you grow your Okra in areas which are able to receive almost full sunlight during the day. The optimum soil pH for growing Okra is known to be in a range of 6 to 6.8. Okra performs well on loam and Sandy soils, so make sure, you grow your Okra in soil type of this, but the vegetable, is also able to respond positively in heavy soils having good soil drainage. During a period of very low moisture content, make sure you supplement water through Irrigation, but always ensure that, the Okra field is not waterlogged and has right moisture content all the time.  Make sure you select a site which has good soil drainage and has also good soil fertility. In addition to this, make sure the chosen site for Okra production, is able to receive full sunlight during the day when possible. Make sure you till your site in preparation for growing Okra plants. You can make ridges manually with the help of a hoe or whenever the site is too long, you can use a tractor to cultivate your area faster. Make sure the soil tillage is done to a depth of 20 cm to 24 cm as recommended for optimal Okra production. Okra performs well when soil temperatures at planting is 21 °C, so make sure during planting period soil temperature is around that number for better results. You can plant your Okra during a frost free time in spring 2 to 3 weeks after the frost period is over. During planting, make sure you place your Okra seed 2.5 cm deep and 5 centimeters apart in rows. In Okra production, the recommended spacing for optimal results is 71 to 96 cm with 20 to 30 cm between Okra plants. Thinning in Okra plants, is done when Okra plants reach 8 cm up. One hectare of land requires 5 to 6 kg of Okra seeds and this will result in a plant population of 33,333 per hectare. To facilitate seed germination, make sure you soak your Okra seeds in water for about 5 hours before planting time. Before any application of fertilizer to your Okra field, Make sure you are able to conduct a soil analysis to know the soil nutrition of your soil and the type of fertilizer which is supposed to be applied and as well as the quantity. Thus, any application of fertilizer in Okra field will depend on soil analysis report. It is recommended to apply 13 to 22 kg per hectare of nitrogen fertilizers before planting. In Okra, phosphorus fertilizers can be applied either before or after plant and has a quantity requirement of 23 to 45 kg per hectare. If your soil has low moisture content, you can supplement moisture through Irrigation and make sure you Irrigation your Okra field in 10 days interval to avoid waterlogging, since also the Okra plant is able to withstand drought. Always observe the right moisture content all the time.  You can control weeds in the Okra field by using herbicides or by using manual (with the help of hands). Make sure a cost effective way is chosen as there are more ways to weed your Okra field. Always make sure, your Okra field is free from weeds as these can result in pests and diseases building up which can increase the cost of production and at the same time decreasing your yield. Okra pods are harvested 6 to 8 days after flowering, while they are still tender. Harvesting can be done easily by hands and you can be picking tender Okra pods every 2 to 3 weeks once the harvesting period begins."
88,Guinea Fowl Production and Management,food," Gomani, is an Agribusiness Consultant who studied Agribusiness Management Guinea Fowl Production Guinea fowl production is an emerging agribusiness which offers an opportunity for food and income in different countries. The set up capital for Guinea fowl production is very low since they can be kept under the free range system where they can be left to scavenge in searching for their feeds and a little additional feed can be provided in the form of maize grains. Comparing with other poultry birds, Guinea fowl are able to withstand adverse conditions much better and give a better results unlike other poultry birds. The three commonly kept Guinea fowl Varieties are; pearl, white and lavender. Pearl varieties are commonly raised by smallholder farmers and its feathers are used for ornamental purposes.  Guinea fowl can be kept under the three management system, namely; extensive, semi-intensive and intensive. This system uses low input capital and Guinea fowl are left to scavenge. Guinea fowl sleeps in trees. Under this system, the birds are prone to predators. Under this system, a Guinea fowl house is provided and the birds are left free during the day and water may be provided. Supplement feeds are given under this system. Under this system Guinea fowl are confined to a house and everything is provided to them, thus both feeds and water among others. The system offers full protection to Guinea fowl. Make sure you provide a house which is able to provide shelter to your Guinea fowl against cold weather conditions and some predators. Confined Guinea fowl should be given enough space to allow freedom of movement. Make sure you provide feeds to confirmed Guinea fowl. A space of 2 to 3 square feet may be provided to confined Guinea fowls per Guine. Guinea can fly to a height of 400 to 500 ft, even at their early stage so make sure you monitor their movement. Mostly Guinea fowl are able to search their feeds themselves successfully on a free range system. On free range they are able to feed weeds, insects and arachnid among others. When possible, you can provide them with supplemental feeds and clean water. The supplemental feeds can be in the form of maize grains, wheat, sorghum, just to mention a few. You do not need to provide supplemental feeds in case, you are keeping them for pest controls and this will encourage them to eat your targeted pests. If Guinea fowl are kept for marketing purposes, make sure you provide them with all required feeds and water and make sure your Guinea does not allow to go out scavenging. In Guinea fowl production, supplemental feeds in form of pellet is not recommended. Under commercial Guinea fowl production, commercial feeds given to chickens are also given to Guinea fowl. Giving Guinea fowl broiler finisher mash is also not recommended.  During first two weeks Guinea fowl are prone to dampness after hatching, therefore, make sure you provide a similar brooding system to that of chickens. After two weeks they will be able to start withstanding most of the adverse conditions themselves. One male Guinea fowl can have 4 to 5 females for breeding. Guinea fowl are known to wander off in pairs for mating, make sure you collect eggs and you can use your local chickens to hatch the fertilized eggs. You can give your local chicken about 30 eggs and this will produce at least 25 keets.  Despite their natural ability to withstand adverse conditions, Guineas are susceptible to the same diseases which attack chickens, same applies to parasites and other pests which attack poultry birds. For this reason you can provide a similar health care to those of chickens."
89,Mushroom Storage and Processing,food," Mushroom Storage Mushrooms are rich in the following nutrition; proteins, antioxidants and are known to have a low calorie source of fiber. Mushroom has zero sodium (or fats) and are also known to have zero cholesterol, which partly help a person to have lower chances of developing high blood pressure, stroke, and heart disease, which are caused by taking too much sodium and cholesterol. This article discusses mushroom storage and processing methods. Mushrooms are known to have a high respiration rate, which continues the moment you harvest your Mushroom vegetable (Botanically classified as fungi, but considered as a vegetable). For example, if we compare the respiration rate of oyster mushrooms with other fruits, we can see that it is three times greater, which agrees that Mushrooms have a higher respiratory rate. For this reason, you need to handle them with great care. What causes Mushroom spoilage when keeping or storing them are bacteria and fungi within the mushrooms. In cold storage places, the Bacteria and enzyme activities within the mushrooms continue to increase and this has a negative effect. Mushrooms have 85 to 95% and this acts as a favorable condition for bacterial growth which is bad. Mushroom also has no barriers to water loss from their surface. After harvesting, Mushroom lose much of its water through humidity and atmospheric pressure. If we compare the fresh Mushroom with other crops, we can see that mushroom has a shorter shelf life, therefore, it is very important to preserve it with a special care or market it as soon as the harvesting is done. After harvesting, mushrooms can either be stored in cold storage or other places or environments where you are able to control it from spoilage. The following are the commonly used methods to preserve your Mushrooms: This is prolonging the shelf life of fresh mushrooms by refrigerating it at a temperature of 1 to 4℃. Cooling the mushrooms at such a lower temperature, resulting in lower rates of all the physiological process within the mushrooms (also called a lower respiration rate). Mushrooms' shelf life varies from 1 day to 2 weeks. Cooling Mushroom under a temperature of 1 to 4 °C is considered as an effective short term preservation. This is done by retarding the growth of microorganisms, reducing the rate of post harvest metabolic activities of the mushroom tissues, among others. After harvesting, Mushrooms have a metabolic rate temperature of a range of 15 to 18 °C and to stop this metabolic process rapidly, make sure mushrooms are cooled to a storage temperature of 0 to 2℃ within five hours of picking. Oyster mushroom can best be kept in a temperature range of 8-10℃ in packed container wrapped in plastic film.  For long-term storage of mushrooms, the following is used; canning, pickling and drying. Take note that these long term storage processes are not always suitable for all types of mushrooms. Drying is best suitable preserving method for edible shiitake mushrooms. This method, is not necessarily used for button Mushrooms or Oyster Mushrooms, but oyster mushrooms can also be stored and marketed in dried form. After drying mushrooms are nearly 10% of total weight. Drying is used to preserve the mushrooms by removing enough water and this is important as it inactivate the enzymes and microorganisms. Dried mushrooms are good for long-term storage and transportation. The following are the commonly used methods for preserving Mushrooms through drying. a. Sun drying Under this method, you spread your mushrooms on the shelves in such way that the gills face upward and are directly exposed to sunlight for drying. Amount of time taken to dry under this method, it varies depending on weather conditions. Sun-dried Mushrooms have lower quality than thermal power drying or hot-air drying. The moisture content is also high under this method and this encourages the Mushroom to be susceptible to mold and pests. b. Thermal power drying Under this method, the process of thermal power drying, start on mushrooms at a relatively low temperature. Make sure the Mushrooms are dried during sunny days at an initial temperature of 35℃, while during damp days, mushrooms should be dried at an initial temperature of 30℃. Thereafter, you increase the temperature gradually and then kept at 40-60℃ for 12-18 hours. This method is able to preserve Mushroom appearance and flavor. c. Hot-air drying Under this method, hot air is blown into the dryer and mushrooms on the shelves are exposed to hot air for drying. The heaters and recirculation are used to control temperature and air humidity to an optimal condition. Make sure the drying chamber is heated to a temperature of 40 to 50℃ before loading the mushrooms. The size of the drying chamber depends on the production scale. Under this method, Mushroom moisture content is absorbed to 20%. You can then store your hot-air dried Mushrooms in boxes or containers having a temperature of 2 to 5°C. This method is commonly used in preserving Mushrooms. Canning process is divided into seven basic operations: cleaning, blanching, canning, sterilization, cooling, labeling, and packing. Take note that if the Mushrooms are not canned immediately, they should be refrigerated until processing starts. Batch process can be used where the cans can be placed in an autoclave and sterilized for one hour 120-130℃."

Carrots require an average of 25 mm of water per week, but under warm, dry conditions 50 mm will be required. Carrots require an optimal annual rainfall of a range of 700 and 800 mm. Carrots performs well on deep, loose and well drained loam soils. Make sure the soil where you grow your Carrots has high organic matter content for better yields. The optimum soil pH for growing Carrots ranges from 6.0 to 7.5. It is known that the temperature and soil moisture influence the shape, colour and quality of carrots so make sure your field has right moisture content and as well right temperature.  We use seeds to propagate Carrots The soil should be well tilled using a hoe or ploughed mechanically. It has to be deep ploughed and loosen at least 30 centimeters. Make sure the soil is fumigated for nematodes. Carrot seedlings are sown directly in the seedbed. Carrot is known to have a seed rate of 5kg per hectare. Make sure you sow your seedlings when soil has right moisture content. You may supplement the water through Irrigation but make sure the Carrot field is not waterlogged as this can be a source of diseases. Carrots requires a row spacing of a range of 200 to 400 mm apart. In double or triple rows, you can have the width between sets of rows range from 400 to 600 mm. Make sure you thin your Carrots which are densely sown to 5 cm spacing within the row. Thinning results in uniform and good sized roots and avoids Carrot plant from lodging. Thinning can be done from the third week. Carrots are unable to compete with weeds as it grows slowly compared to the rate at which the weeds grows. Make sure your Carrots field is free from weeds as these could be the source of diseases. Make sure you use repeated shallow cultivation to keep down weeds, especially in the early stages of growth. Before you apply any fertilizer, make sure you conduct a soil analysis to know the right type and amount of fertilizers to apply based on soil test report. It is recommended to apply nitrogen fertilizer. Carrots have low nitrogen requirements and good yields can be obtained with the application of 80 kg/ha of nitrogen. You can also apply 40 kg of phosphorus per hectare for optimal yield. Carrots which are grown during dry season should be supplied with enough water through Irrigation. Water can be applied every 5 to 7 days to field capacity depending on soil type and environment. Make sure you avoid your field from waterlogging.  Make sure any weed is removed as it could compete for soil nutrients with your Carrots plant and this can result in Inefficiencies. Weeds can be controlled manually or by using herbicides. When you use herbicides make sure you follow all the instructions.  Make sure you harvest your Carrot when it reaches a diameter of 20 mm and more. You can harvest your Carrots after 90 to 120 days from the day of sowing. Depending on the type of Variety, some may require longer days. Make sure you avoid harvesting immature and over-mature Carrot roots."

94,Citrus Cultivation  Farming and Management Techniques,food," Gomani, is an Agribusiness Consultant who studied Agribusiness Management Citrus fruits Cultivation Farming Citrus is an important fruit which can be grown for revenue generating and is able to provide some nutrients which, among others, include the following; carbohydrate, fibre, vitamin C, potassium, calcium, vitamin B6, magnesium. This article will provide in detail on how to get started in Citrus fruit cultivation. Cirrus farming needs to be taken as a lifetime investment and it requires a constant care.  Lime is one of the most cultivated Citrus fruits and is known to have originated from Malaysia. It is mostly cultivated in tropical regions and it has a shape which looks like lemons, but it's smaller and more acidic. The Oranges have a round shape with orange-coloured and its plants can grow up to a height of 10 meters. The Orange plant has a dark green shiny leaves and is thought to have originated from South and Indo China. Comparing with Oranges, Tangerines have less round shape and are smaller in sizes and are thought to have originated from Southeast Asia. Grapefruits are known with bitter yellow rind and a juicy somewhat and are thought to have originated from Asia. Grapefruits are able to give better results in subtropical regions. Lemons are rounded and slightly elongated in shape and are thought to have originated from North India or Burma.  Citrus fruits do not give optimal results in frost areas, but the fruit is able to give optimal results in subtropical regions. The optimum performance for Citrus cultivation is achieved at an optimal temperature of 12 °C to 26°C. Citrus cultivation requires annual rainfall of a range of 1250 to 1850 mm. You can also grow Citrus plants under irrigation and make sure you supply each plant with an equivalent amount of water. Make sure the soil in the Citrus fruit field has the right amount of moisture content all the time whenever there is low moisture content, supplement it with irrigation water. Citrus plants perform well in light soils with good drainage, but the Citrus fruits are able to give better results in a wide range of soils. The optimum soil pH for growing Citrus fruits is known to be in a range of 5.5 to 7.5. However, some Citrus fruits farmers are able to grow successfully in a soil pH of a range of 4 to 9 under a good management. Land for growing Citrus fruits requires to be thoroughly ploughed and levelled and this can be achieved by manually or mechanically. In hilly areas, Citrus planting is done on terraces against the slopes. One hectare of land can have 277 Citrus plants, so make sure you have a plant population of within that range and each plant should be spaced at 6 x 6 m or 5m x 5m. Make sure you dug a planting hole of a size of 1m x 1m x 1m for planting seedlings. Planting can be done anytime if the soil has a right soil moisture content and this can be achieved through Irrigation. Citrus cultivation requires annual rainfall of 1250 to 1850 mm therefore, make sure you supplement water through Irrigation in areas having a low amount of rainfall. When growing Citrus fruits, moisture stress during early spring while the tree is flowering has a negative effect as it could result in an excessive drop of flowers and this reduces the ability to bear fruits. Make sure you Irrigate your Citrus field twice a week during its first 6 weeks. Make sure you apply nitrogen fertilizer every 2 months during its first year. Citrus plants are ready for harvesting in 240 to 280 days from the day of the planting is done. You harvest by hand picking the ripe fruits and this can be done in an intervals of 10-15 days.

Make sure the site is thoroughly prepared in preparation for planting. Make sure the soil has right moisture content when growing Groundnuts and make sure you avoid too much moisture content during the harvesting period as this can reduce the quality of groundnuts if Groundnuts crop is left to dry in the field. Make sure you plant your Groundnuts as early as possible. When possible, plant your Groundnut seeds at the beginning of rainy season in your area. During planting, make sure you observe a spacing of 35 to 45 cm between rows and 5 to 10 cm between seeds in the row. Make sure you plant 100 kg of Groundnut seeds per hectare. Each seed should be planted to a depth of 5 cm. It is recommended to have a plant population of 150 000 plants per hectare for dryland production. If you want to grow your Groundnuts under irrigation, make sure you have a plants population of 300 000 per hectare. Groundnuts require a good amount of potassium for optimal growth and development. So make sure your soil has enough potassium content. You can apply 10 kg/ha of potassium for you to get better yields. Groundnuts also requires Calcium for seed development. You can apply 200 kg of Calcium per hectare. It is recommended to apply Super Phosphate as basal fertilizers. Groundnuts also respond well to manure, because manures help to ameliorate soil acidity on top of supplying nutrients to the soils. Make sure your Groundnut field is kept free from weeds, as this may be a source of diseases and pests, on top of competing for soil nutritions. You can control the weeds physically, by pulling out the weed by hands or by using a hoe in weeding.

99,Salad - Making a Mess of your Vegetables,food," Salad. In our house, it's a combination of things from our refrigerator The consideration is of no special significance. There's lettuce.

My hubby likes a more sugar based sauce."
100,Easy Baked Honey-Mustard Pork Tenderloin with Asparagus Recipe,food," Pork tenderloin is an almost magical cut of meat. It's so tender, delicate, wonderfully amenable to any sort of flavor being added to it, easy to cook - and yet also a real bargain! I've found so many recipes that you can throw it into and every time you get great results out of it. Half the time now even when I just need pork to cut up into cubes, pork tenderloin is my go to option. But it also feels a bit like sacrilege - why cut something that's always perfect up into tiny little chunks? And cutting up meat takes time too. That's one of the great advantages of this recipe, since it's simply ridiculously simple. Marinate a pork tenderloin, rubbed down with some spices, in a honey mustard sauce for a few hours to overnight, then bake in the oven, then add in some asparagus on top and layer some more honey mustard sauce on that - and while we're at it with the leftover honey mustard sauce, which to my eyes is the elixir of the gods, either boil it or microwave it a few minutes to make it a great sauce to go with the pork! The pork just brims over with flavor, rich and settling into the very fiber of it, a sort of tantalizing, almost addictive flavor that is both incredibly savory and yet also sweet. Perhaps almost unami - that orgasmic feeling that you get from things like meats or roasted tomatoes. The fact that you can make it all so easily makes it feel almost like cheating. Put it over rice or some other grain to soak up the juices and the sauce, and you're set! I don't know personally how the mustard-dill sauce that I use in this recipe is made, but I would suggest a mixture of honey, mustard, and dill. Or you can order it online: look up Larrupin's Honey Mustard Sauce. This recipe is entirely my own, although I did take some inspiration for the idea from Adam Ragusea's videos on mustard-rubbed tri tip."

103,Cabbage Cultivation Farming,food," Cabbage Farming Cabbage is a vegetable which is adaptable to a wide range of climatic conditions and it performs better in different soils and this makes it to be popular. Cabbage farming is done by both smallholder farmers and medium scale farmers, mostly in local and peri-unban areas. Cabbage has the following nutritional elements; Calcium, Iron, Vitamin A, C & E, Minerals, Riboflavin, Nicotinamine and Ascorbic Acid. This agribusiness article will give in detail on how cabbage is grown as well as its climatic conditions for good yields. Cabbage is propagated from seeds. Before planting make sure the land is cleared or cultivated eight weeks before planting. Make sure the ground is ploughed deeply, immediately before planting, with a disk harrow or other suitable implement to a depth of 450 to 600 mm. Remember also to fumigate the soil two weeks before planting time if necessary, to control nematodes which may become a threat to the cabbage plants. Cabbage can be planted in two ways, either by direct-seeding or by transplanting of seedlings. If you plant through direct seeding, use about 2 kg of seed per hectare. If you want to plant cabbage through transplanting, make sure the seedlings are transplanted as soon as they reach the desired size and only well-hardened, young, stocky plants should be used. Make sure the soil is moist before the transplanting is done. Plant populations of 40000 to 45000 per hectare is recommended for large scale farmers. For small scale farmers grow about 80 000 to 100 000 plants per hectare. If you want to plant cabbage through transplanting, make sure you sow the seeds first in a well established nursery and this will have the following advantages; more favourable and even germination, improved irrigation control and crop monitoring during the sensitive germination and seedling stage and weeds are controlled easily on the nursery beds. Take note that you can use also use flat-cell trays or in Jiffy pots to produce cabbage seedlings. Make sure the site which is used for cabbage seedlings has good moisture, good aeration and the temperatures does not exceed 30⁰C. Make sure you check the nursery bed twice daily to make sure that optimum conditions are maintained during the germination and seedling development. Soon after emergence, make sure that the seedling are exposed to adequate sunlight to support good strong growth. Cabbage seedlings are ready for transplanting in 4 weeks after sowing day. Make sure you observe the following before transplanting is done; stop fertilizer applications seven days before transplanting, make sure you reduce the amount of water applied to it two days before transplanting and make sure you transplant the seedlings in the cooler part of the morning or evening Cabbage seedlings are transplanted into a well prepared rows having a space of 40cm between plants within the rows. Make sure the roots are not disturbed during the transplanting. Cabbage requires supplemental fertilization in the form of manure or compost since it is a heavy feeder and this fertilizer has to supply the following nutritional elements; nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Make sure you test the soil to know the right fertilizer program to be applied. Cabbage requires 200 to 250 kg nitrogen per hectare. Young cabbage transplants or seedlings have a lower water requirement, but take note that the water requirement increases rapidly as the cabbage is growing. Make sure the soil has right moisture all the time. Waterlogging can cause different diseases so keep on monitoring the moisture content. Make sure you irrigate the cabbage immediately after transplanting or sowing. Any application of soluble fertilizer as fertigation should be done under a normal irrigation and make sure you continue irrigating for 5 minutes after fertigation to flush the system. Make sure you use the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) to control the pests and diseases easily. Where possible, make sure you plant pests resistant varieties and this will give your crop a natural resistance to pests and diseases which will minimize the cost. Make sure you do row covering immediately after transplanting and left up for 10 to 15 days to be able to protect your crop from numerous insect pests, such as caterpillars, aphids, leafhoppers, leaf miners, beetles and white-flies. Avoid planting cabbage repeatedly or more than once every 3 to 4 years in the same field to avoid build up of pests and diseases. Make sure you monitor cabbage plants against pests and diseases every week. Make sure you harvest the cabbage when the heads has attained their full size and become firm and hard but tender. The cabbage is harvested by hand with a knife or sickle. Large scale farmers are able to harvest cabbage mechanically and this is done once. Make sure the heads are cut off in such a way that a few of the large, open wrapper leaves are left for protection around the heads."

Make sure the site is located close to a water source and is flat and is under the shade. Make sure you sow Eggplant Seeds thinly in rows having a space of 15 cm apart. Apply 3 to 5 kg manure per square meter Make sure the site has right moisture content all the time and is not waterlogged as this can be the source of diseases. Make sure you slow down water application about 1 to 2 weeks before transplanting. Always ensure that your nursery is free from weeds. Eggplant plant population should be between 20 to 25 000 plants per hectare and should have a row spacing of 1.8 to 2.5 meters. Eggplant seedlings are transplanted in 3 to 4 weeks after sowing in a nursery at which the height of the seedling is about 10 to 15 cm. Make sure you conduct this transplanting early in the morning or in the evening. Make sure each Eggplant transplant is spaced at 60 to 75 cm between rows and the field has an Eggplant plant population of a range of 8,888 to 16,666 per acre.  It is recommended to supplement water whenever soil moisture content is low and this can be achieved through Irrigation. Make sure you irrigate your field at a right amount of clean water to prevent it from waterlogging which would also mean water wastages.  Make sure you start harvesting your Eggplant in a range of 60 to 90 days after transplanting and the harvesting can be done manually by the hand picking.

This variety is known with the following characteristics; short stern, Banana of this type does not require propping, ability of plants to be grown in higher altitude areas (2,100m), high resistance of the Banana plant to fusarium wilt among others. This variety is a cultivar of Cavendish type and is known with the following characteristics; being tolerant to environmental stress, produces good quality bunches having Banana fruits, good shelf life for mature fruits among others. This Banana variety produces large bunches with banana fruits which have excellent flavor, aroma, and good taste when ripe among others. This is a tall Banana variety and its fruits has good taste. Bananas performs well in warm subtropical climate areas and they need adequate moisture and protection from strong wind. The optimal temperature for Banana production ranges from 26 to 30°C (78-86F) with relative humidity of a range of 75 to 85%. Banana growth starts at 18ºC, reaches an optimal growth at a temperature of 27ºC. Bananas do not grow when the temperature passes 38ºC. Make sure you avoid growing your Banana plants in windy areas having a velocity wind speed exceeding 80km per hour. Make sure you pop up your Banana plant at its fruiting stage to prevent it from lodging or falling down. Bananas performs well in well-drained soil. Make sure the soil where you want to grow your Banana has enough water content or make sure you supplement water through Irrigation and drip irrigation is recommended. The optimum soil pH for Banana production is between 6-7.5.  The followings are the other optimal ecological requirements for Banana production.  Before planting your Banana plant, make sure you till the field. Banana plant requires deep soil cultivation by ploughing and harrowing. Make sure the field is free from trees which would be shading the Banana plant and it has to be free from busses and all perennial weeds. The Banana planting hole should be made having this dimension, 60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm, although this may vary depending on water availability and other factors. In dry and semi-arid areas, it is recommended to make a Banana planting hole of this dimension 90 cm x 90 cm x 90 cm. Make sure the site where you are preparing to plant your Bananas is not waterlogged. The recommended spacing for Banana short Varieties is 3 m x 3 m and this will result in 444 plants/acre. The recommended spacing for medium Banana varieties is 3 m x 4 m and this will result in 333 plants/acre. The recommended spacing for tall Banana varieties is 4 m x 4 m and this will result in 250 plants/acre. Before you apply any fertilizer to Banana plants, make sure you conduct a soil analysis to know the right fertilizer to apply based on soil test report. It is recommended to keep the top and subsoils in separate. Make sure you mix the topsoil with the manure. The recommended fertilizer on Banana plants is Triple Super Phosphate (TSP) and you may apply 200 g per Banana plant.  Banana transplanting has to be done when tissue culture seedlings are about 30 centimeters and have produced at least 5 healthy Banana leaves. Banana suckers should be placed 30 centimeters deep in the planting hole. Make sure each transplant is supplied with enough water. After transplanting, make sure you provide cover mulch on each and every transplanted Banana plant. You can use sow dust and it encourages fast growth and plant establishment. Mulching is known to conserve the soil moisture as well. Make sure you keep your mulch at least 50 cm from the plant base. Make sure your Banana field is free from weeds. You can control the weeds manually by hands or by using herbicides. Banana are shallow rooted plants so make sure you handle them with care during weeding. This is the process of supporting banana plants to prevent it from lodging. Make sure you provide a strong supportive material which will prevent it from lodging. A V shaped pole can be used."
106,How to Grow Popcorn : Techniques in Popcorn Farming,food," Gomani, is an Agribusiness Consultant who studied Agribusiness Management Popcorn Farming Popcorn is used as a snack food and is one of the profitable agribusiness crop. This article will provide in detail on popcorn production techniques for both commercial and home use purposes. When selecting Popcorn Varieties, make sure you select a good variety which matures early and while at the same time give better yields. Make sure you select the hybrid variety which matures before frost period. The following are some of commonly grown Popcorn kernels: white, small yellow, and large yellow. White Popcorn is known for its rice like shape kernel while yellow popcorn kernels are commonly known for pearl like shape. These 3 popcorn kernels are used for different needs in the industry. Make sure you prepare your land or site to be used for Popcorn production in a similar way as to how you prepare land to grow maize (field corn). Make sure you till the site and make ridges so that you can plant your Popcorn seeds in ridges. The land can also be prepared mechanically with the help of a tractor and this can make the ploughing easier, saving time. Popcorn performs well in a wide range of soils. To give the optimal yield it just needs a soil which is well-drained and the soil should be well supplied with organic matter. The optimum soil pH for growing Popcorn is known to be a range of 5.8 to 7.0. Make sure you avoid planting your Popcorn in soils with poor drainage as this will result in lodging which will decrease corn yield. Make sure the site where you grow your Popcorn has good soil moisture and has required soil nutrition. Where possible conduct soil analysis to know nutrition content. Make sure you apply manure and do soil analysis before applying any fertilizers to know the right fertilizer to apply based on soil test results. Popcorn performs well when you apply nitrogen fertilizers as nitrogen promotes stalk and result in high kernel quality. Popcorn performs well in warm weather areas having a soil temperature of 10 °C to 20 °C. Optimal germination temperature occurs in a range of 15 to 20 °C. Make sure you grow your Popcorn directly by placing your Popcorn seed into the soil as transplanting Popcorn does not do well. Make sure you sow your seed at the beginning of rainy season if it is to be grown using rain water. Popcorn performs well with under Irrigation as well. Some Popcorn growers are able to sow their corn 3 to 4 weeks before frost free date by planting under plastic mulch. Make sure you sow your Popcorn seed at s depth of 2.5 to 5 centimeters. Popcorn is grown at a row spacing of 76 to 96 cm. The required plant population for Popcorn ranges from 20,000 to 27,000 plants per acre. A lower plant population is used for dry land corn planting. Water requirements for field corn is the same for Popcorn farming. Make sure you irrigate Popcorn in the similar way to the corn field. Popcorn requires 500 to 800 mm of water per growing season and any shortfall should be supplemented with irrigation. Make sure the Popcorn field is not waterlogged as this can be the source of diseases. Make sure Popcorn field has right moisture content all the time. The weeds which attack field corn are the same which attack Popcorn. Make sure your Popcorn field is free from weeds as these can be sources of pests and diseases which can result in lower yields. You can control weeds manually or using herbicides. When using herbicides, make sure you follow the instructions given. When you grow your Popcorn on hectares of land, you can use a combined harvester to harvest your Popcorn quickly, but this result in more kernel damage which reduces the volume for your Popcorn. You can also harvest your Popcorn kernels manually by hands."
107,Goat Production Farming and Management Practices,food," Goat Farming Goat farming is one of the low cost investment profitable agribusiness farming, which probably you did not know about. Goat is commonly reared for mean and is known to be a multi-use animal. Apart from meat (Chevron), goat is also able to provide milk, wools and leathers, which for example, the milk may be used for drinking and is known to be delicious while the wools and leathers are used as raw materials in the manufacturing industries in different countries. An entrepreneur needs to utilize the low cost multi-use animal to get a reasonable profit on his/her entrepreneurial journey. This article will give in detail on how to get started with goat production.  There two types of breeds available for goat which are local or indigenous goat breeds and exotic goat breeds. This is a type of breed of the Goat which is known for low quantity meat and milk. This breed may not have to be imported from other countries. It has an average birth weight of 1.5 to 2.5 kg and may weigh up to 3kg. This type of breed is known to be well adapted to your local conditions. This breed is commonly reared by small scale rural goat farmers. The following are some of the exotic goat breeds with a few details of their characteristics. (A)Boer This breed is commonly kept in all types of climates and is known to have originated from South Africa. This breed has high immunity to diseases compared to the Indigenous type of Goat breeds. In 3 years, it can give at least 3 times birth and each birth has high chances for two kids (young goat babies). An adult Boar goat has a potential of weighing at least 100 kgs. This breed can be crossbred with your local goats to improve its performance.. (B) Barbari Barbari is known with the following characteristics; standing but short ears, robust body and red or brown patches. This breed is kept for both meat and milk production. An adult doe weighs an average of 20 to 25 Kg and buck weighs an average weight of 25 to 40 Kg. At birth a kid weighs an average of 2 Kg. (C) Saanen This breed is mainly used for milk production in different countries. Saanen is able to give at least 600 to 700 litters of milk in 150 to 180 days after parturition (the act of giving birth to kids). Generally it gives birth to a single kid in a year.  After buying goats for breeding, make sure you construct a simple but strong goat house which is well ventilated. The house has to be strong because goats are prone to predators (most common ones are hyenas). Make sure the simple house you have constructed is easy to clean. Make sure you take a good care for both does and bucks for successful goat production. Make sure the goats are vaccinated in time and dosing. Goats are ruminant animals and are able to chew fibres, make sure you give supplementary feeds on top of fibrous feed for high production to be achieved. When it comes to breeding, make sure you select the doe and buck having desirable characteristics and all the males with undesirable characteristics and will not be used for breeding purposes should be castrated in their early days after parturition (also called kidding). Goats is known to have a gestation (pregnancy period) period of 150 to 150 days (5 months). Make sure you mate mature female goat when it is on heat ready to be served and usually this heat period in goat last 24 to 26 hours. Does can be used for mating at 12 months of age. All goats having different age sizes should be kept in separate locations. Signs of heat for a doe: After successful mating, make sure you separate the pregnant doe from the flock and you monitor her conditions during her gestation period. This will ensure successful kidding. Make sure you provide high quality feeds and at the same time, make sure the pregnant doe does not gain excessive fats, as this may cause difficulties during parturition. Ensure your doe is healthy and consult your local veterinary officer immediately after noticing signs of sickness. Male goats have to be kept in separate from female does to control unnecessary mating. Make sure you prevent haemophrodism in goat production by mating a female goat with a horn buck. Haemophrodism is known to have come from hornless bucks. Make sure you cull (castrate) all bucks which will not be used for breeding purposes and have undesirable characteristics. Make sure you select does and bucks with good characteristics for breeding, so that the kid should inherit good qualities of the two. This can be anything to do with high quality meat or milk. This is mating of different breeds to produce a kid having best characteristics. And this can be high quality meat or milk. It makes use of hybrid vigour. This is mating a doe and a buck from same parents or breeds to maintain desirable traits. This can be size, colours, meat or milk. Make sure you reduces mortalities in kids through good management. Make sure the kids are able to suck colostrum milk from does soon after parturition. Make sure fresh feeds and water is available all the time. Keep on monitoring the kids' conditions and whenever you notice something unusual call a local veterinary officer to check up. Make sure you control mating in such ways that the kidding should take place when feeds are abundant. Allow the kids to be with their mother only for a few weeks (probably 4 weeks) after that keep the kids in separate with their mother. Make sure the kids' house is strong and is able to protect the kids from heat, predators, cold weather among others. Goats are ruminant animals and are able to eat feeds enrich with fibres. Make sure you provide them with fresh grasses and you provide them with fresh feeds and water. Where possible supplement them with concentrates on top of roughages. Allow the kids to suck their mother for 2 to 3 days to get colostrum milk which is good for their immunity system. After about three weeks introduce them to grasses and other supplementary feeds.  Weening period in goat is 100 days. Make sure the kids are 100 days and wean them. After weaning, make sure you keep them in separate from their mother."
108,Hot Pepper Farming: Basic Production Practices & Management Techniques,food," Hot pepper Farming The hot pepper is a herbaceous short life perennial plant which reaches the height of 0.5 to 1.5 m. They produce flowers which bear the fruits which is green when unripe and it turns red when ripe. The fruit may go through an intermediary brown or purple stages in colour. Hot pepper fruits are used as raw in salads, food garnishes and marinades. The fruit may also be used in combination with other ingredients to make or produce a hot sauce. (Also called pepper sauce). The fruits may also be turned into relishes. Hot peppers have the following ingredients; they contain water about 83%, they contain 3% protein, they contain 7% fibre, they have carbohydrates of 6%, they contain 0.6% fat and they have high vitamin C, vitamin A and B vitamin content. This article will give in detail on how to grow hot pepper. Peppers perform well in warm season and they require a similar growing conditions like other crops in Solanaceae family which among others include tomato and boulanger. Peppers requires an average rainfall of 600 to 1250 mm per annum, which is well distributed, but the plant is also able to give better results in a wide range of altitudes. They do not do well in places having flood conditions. Optimal temperature range for germination is known to be in a range of 25 to 30 °C. The best yield is obtained at a temperature range of 18 to 30 °C. Make sure you grow your peppers on a fertile loam soil or fertile medium loam and the soil has to be of drainage having a pH of a range of 5.5 to 6.8. The following are commonly grown peppers; West Indies Red, Scotch Bonnet, Caribbean Green, Caribbean Red and Habanero  Make sure you grow your hot pepper in an open area as they do not perform well in shade areas. Make sure the site you select has good soil and is not waterlogged or prone to flooding. Make sure the soil site which you are selecting has sandy loam soil or has silt loam soils to get better yields. For the good plant establishment make sure the soil is tilled or plowed about 30 centimeters in depth. Adding manure or organic matter is recommended to improve your soil nutrition content and soil structure. Make sure your field is well drained. Making ridges and planting your hot pepper on ridges or raised beds results in better performance. When it comes to planting, make sure you plant healthy seeds which are free from pests and diseases for the proper establishment of plants. This ensures a high probability of good germination. 100 grams of seeds give about 20,000 hot pepper plants and this plant population can cover a two and half acre land. Hot pepper seeds have a germination range of 8 to 12 days. You can raise your hot pepper seedlings in the following; Shaded Seed bed, Seedling Boxes under the covering, Seedling Trays among others. (i) Shaded hot pepper seed bed Make sure the seedbeds are prepared at a site having good soil content and is free from weeds. Make sure the prepared land has fine tilt. (ii) Hot pepper seedling boxes Make sure you use boxes having dimensions of 14"" x 20"". The hot pepper seeds are sown thinly ¼ inch in depth. Make sure you keep on watering for 1 to 2 weeks after hot pepper seeds has germinated. The seedlings are transplanted later. (iii)Hot pepper seedling trays This way is considered more efficient. Makes sure you sow your hot pepper seed a single seed per tray for better performance. Make sure trays have the right moisture content all the time. Make sure you consider time go harvest before planting if you are growing hot pepper for commercial purposes. For the proper establishment ensure the site has good soil and water is available. Transplanting should be done at 4 to 6 weeks when the seedlings are ready to be transplanted and and make sure you transplant the seedlings in the evening. Make sure you take care of the roots to avoid causing damage to them. Apply water to the transplanted seedlings at the base. Make sure you apply fertilizers to the transplanted seedlings for good root development. Transplant seedling should have a space of 3ft between rows and 2ft within rows. Make sure the transplanted seedlings are not very close to each other as this will give fruiting difficulties and will result in low yield. Make sure you apply 5 litters of water to your hot pepper plant everyday and this can easily be achieved through drip irrigation. Make sure the soil has right moisture all the time. Before you apply any fertilizer to your hot pepper plant, make sure you do a soil analysis to know the exact nutrition required by your soil. The following fertilizers are recommended; Urea, which needs to be applied at a rate of 66 kg per hectare; Triple Super Phosphate (TSP) which needs to be applied at a rate of 75 kg per hectare; Muriate of Potash which needs to be applied at a rate of 80 kg per hectare. Manual weed control is recommended. Make sure the hot pepper field is kept free of weeds all the time. Herbicides may be applied, but a lot of care has to be taken when using it from stay drift. Make sure you irrigate your plant early in the morning or in the evening or late afternoon. The water has to be of good quality and always make sure your site is not waterlogged. Each hot pepper plant requires 5 litters of water every day. Hot peppers are ready for harvesting two and a half to three months from the day of planting. Harvesting can be done on a weekly basis depending on market availability. The harvesting can go up to 6 to 8 months. Make sure you harvest during cool days. Harvesting can be done by picking ripe pepper fruits by hands and putting them in a container."
109,How to Grow Cucumber : Cucumber Cultivation Farming,food," Robert is Agribusiness Consultant who studied Agribusiness Management Cucumber Farming Cucumbers are usually eaten as in salads, or as accompaniments to various foods. They are known to be cultivated in greenhouses and some people grow them in an open field. It is one of profitable vegetable (while others call it both a fruit and a vegetable) crop which is commonly grown by small scale and medium size farmers. This article will take you through on how you can grow Cucumbers in detail. In large commercial Cucumber production, they may be grown under a drip irrigation in beds in a polyethylene mulch. The mulch in polyethylene helps to control weeds and make the applied water be used more efficiently. This is not all as it helps in fertilizer applied to be more efficient. Make sure you protect your Cucumbers from wind. Make sure you prepare your field to be ready for Cucumber planting. The field preparation can be done manually by using a hoe for tillage or can be done mechanically using a tractor. Apply manure if the soil has less fertility. Cucumbers perform well in soils having high organic matter content and it has to be of well drained loam to sandy loam soil. Sometimes seed germination may become a problem in Cucumbers so make sure you pellet the seed to facilitate it for planting. If you want to harvest your Cucumbers early, make sure you plant your Cucumber seeds in the following; peat pellets, peat blocks and cellular trays. Whenever you plant them make sure you protect them from cold weather. 2 plants may be planted per cell. Make sure your peat pots are well soaked and buried when transplanted. This prevents soil from excessive drying in the pots. One hectare requires 2.2 Kilograms of Cucumber seed for transplanting. As said Cucumber seeds are able to germinate at a temperature range of 25°C to 28°C. Make sure the soil has enough required moisture content and observe that it is not waterlogged as this can be the source of diseases. Transplanting of Cucumber seedlings is usually done at 3 to 4 weeks after germination. It is possible to plant Cucumber seed directly into the planting bag. Three days after transplanting, make sure you apply fertilizer, but make sure that before the fertilizer is applied you have done a soil analysis to know the required soil nutrients. Cucumbers are both transplanted and able also to be planted directly. In Cucumber farming, make sure you observe a spacing of 2.2 to 2.5 plants per square meter. This is good for good air circulation and adequate light exposure. Any applied fertilizers should be done after you have done a soil analysis to know the nutritional requirements for your soil. Cucumbers perform well with nitrate fertilizer than ammonium-N fertilizer. Make sure you apply nitrate fertilizers and this will result in high Ca, Mg, and K in the Cucumber fruit. Apply a fertilizer of a range of 1500 to 2000 Ib per acre of N-P-K fertilizer. Make sure you apply also manure in your Cucumber field for improved soil fertility. Make sure you keep your Cucumber field free from weeds as this can be sources of pests and diseases. You can control the weeds by physical means or by using herbicides. You harvest your Cucumbers at a tender stage or immature by hands. Make sure the harvesting is done in a cool day. After harvesting make sure you keep your Cucumber in a place having a temperature of 10 to 12.5ºC."
110,Cassava Cultivation Farming Management and Techniques,food," Robert is Agribusiness Consultant who studied Agribusiness Management Cassava Farming Cassava is a woody perennial plant which can grow up to 5 meters in height. During Cassava growth, the shrubs are able to produce several tuberous roots as reserves. These tuberous roots are rich in 35% starch, which may reach up to 1 meter in length and has a potential to weigh up to 40 kg if grown in a good soil with a good management. Cassava still gives a good results if it is planted with another crop or may be planted alone. The other crops which it can be planted in combination can be such as maize, plantain, vegetables or legumes. Cassava cultivation is considered labour friendly as it does not require much labour and it only take a range of 8 to 10 months to be ready for harvesting for sweet tuber Varieties whereas for the bitter varieties, it takes 12th months for harvest to start. The two commonly grown cultivars in different countries are Bitter and sweet Cultivars. Cassava is one of the crops which requires a warm, humid climate. It is considered as a tropical plant and performs well in areas having a temperature range and altitude of 15 °C North and 15 °C South. The temperature accelerates the growth and it's known that the growth stops whenever the temperature falls below 10 °C. The optimal results are obtained in areas having an average temperature of 25 °C and 29 °C and an altitude of 150 meters above the sea level. Some varieties are able to survive and still give a good result at altitudes of up to 1500 m. Cassava is a short day plant since it is a tropical crop. Cassava performs well in areas having abundant rainfall, which is well distributed, but it is able to survive in areas with a low rainfall as low as 500 mm. The Cassava plant is able to withstand the prolonged drought. Cassava plants require light, sandy loams or on loamy sands to give the best results and the soil has to be moist, fertile and deep. Make sure you select a site which has a good soil fertility for best results. Cassava does not perform well on Sandy and clay soils, but give best results in a light, deep soil having a good texture. You can know if the type of soil in your area is suitable or not through a soil analysis. Having chosen a good site which has a fertile soil, the next step is to prepare the site to be ready for Cassava cultivation. To prepare the site you clear the area and dig then make ridges wether with a hoe or mechanically. Make sure you select varieties which have, high dry matter content and has to be well adapted to your local conditions. Selection of varieties with early tuberisation may result in high yields. Cassava is propagated from cuttings. Make sure you collect the cuttings of 20 to 30 cm long from healthy stems to get high yield. Make sure you collect cuttings which are around 12 months old. It is known that when you plant Cassava together with other crops it reduces the danger of crop loss due to unfavorable weather conditions and pests and diseases unlike if the Cassava plants are left to grow alone. Make sure you alternate the cassava crop with a rest period and during this rest period you can grow a legume cover crop. Cassava achieves a plant population of 6,000 and 10,000 plants per hectare. The recommended spacing is 1.5 x 1 m to 1 x 1 m for single cultivation and 2 x 2 m with intercropping. The Cassava fertilizer application is not recommended. However, for the production of cuttings, mineral fertilizer is recommended. Make sure you apply dolomite lime at a ratio of 100 kg per hectare during soil preparation. NPK fertilizer (10, 18, 18) may be applied two weeks after planting at a rate of 300 kg per hectare. Organic fertilizer is necessary for the production of Cassava tubers. Cassava is known to be a drought tolerant and is able to survive even in prolonged drought and is rarely irrigated. You irrigate in a situation where moisture content is very low such that the cassava plant cannot survive anymore. Make sure you keep your Cassava field clean all the time by removing the grown weeds which may compete with the Cassava plant and may also be the source of pests and diseases. To harvest first cult the Cassava stem about 24 to 34 cm above the ground and dig using a hoe. After digging you remove the tuber by hands."
111,Black Australorp Chicken Farming Management,food," Robert is an Agribusiness Consultant who studied Agribusiness Management Black Australorp Chicken Farming The Black Australorp is dual purpose chicken, which is becoming more common to most smaller scale farmers due to it's ability to produce better results compared to local chickens. The Black Australorp hen weights an average weight of 2.5 kg and lays brown shell eggs. The hen has daily feed consumption requirements of 120g and is known to be docile. An adult cock weights an average weight of 3.5 kg, which is much better. As the dual breed, the Black Australorp performs better both for meat and egg production. The hen lays eggs ranging from 240 to 265 annually. Black Australorp are preferred due to its ability to withstand adverse conditions which other chickens could not survive and these adverse conditions we are talking are the high temperature, diseases, pests, parasites among others.  Three systems could be used, namely, free range system, semi intensive system and intensive system. This is a labour intensive systems and complex, as some environmental conditions cannot be easily controlled under this production system. The chickens are known to be allowed to access pasture land during the day and for this reason green feeds need to be available as well. About 250 Black Australorp chickens could be reared per hectare and you as a farmer must make sure that enough area is available to avoid stocking density. The system is used mostly in local areas. Much as this system is cheaper, the Black Australorp chickens are prone to predators and it is not easy to collect the eggs. Under this system of production the chickens are partly reared in houses and also partly on ground or range. The system is known to be common to medium scale chicken producers. Under this system the chickens could be easily be treated when they are sick and egg collection becomes easier. The system also offers protection to birds against extreme conditions. Under this management system a rural farmer could start Black Australorp chicken farming with 10 to 30 chickens and could keep 3 cock only against 30 hens as male to female ratio is 1:10. The farmer should ensure a space of 1m² is equivalent for 6.1 chickens and this means that 33 Black Australorp chickens require about 6.5m² chicken house spaces. Under this system Black Australorp chickens are totally confined to houses and is used as the most efficient way of production. The system is very common in urban areas and in rural areas where commercial Black Australorp production is practiced. This is provision of heat to newly born chickens. The farmer should separate hen and chicks when the hen has hatched and brood the chicks in a brooder A cock could be used against 10 hens. The farmer should cross breed local chickens and Black Australorp to improve the performance of local chickens, both on meat and egg production purposes. The farmer should continuously remove manures to avoid build up of diseases or pests The house should be constructed which will protect the chickens from extreme conditions and predators for better results to be obtained. The farmer should always ensure enough water is available to prevent chickens from dehydration. Water and feed intake are also known to be directly related. The Black Australorp chickens perform better with the simple feeding system. A combination of purchase or homemade feed and home wastages could be used and still achieves a better result. The farmer should ensure that the laying hens and meat chickens always have enough feed for better results. A 60 or 100 watt bulb can be used to provide enough heat to young chickens and it needs to be suspended above the chicks. A small kerosene lamp or a charcoal burner could also be used to provide brooding. The farmer should ensure the ambient house temperatures is gradually reduced by 2ºc each day per week until 18-21ºC is attained and maintained by around 35 days old. Special care to chicks needs to be given as mortality tend to be high. The Black Australorp could be put in the growers mash (pullet grower) from 6 to 8 weeks old to point of lay which start from 18 to 20 weeks old. The farmer needs to trim the upper beak of the chickens when they are 8 to 10 weeks old and repeat it at 17 to 18 weeks old. The hens need to be separated from the cocks in 8 to 10 weeks old to promote good growth rate and reduce perking and cannibalism which is common. Every chick is able to eat about 6.5 kgs to 7kgs of feeds from 6 to 8weeks old to 18 to 20 weeks old.  During the laying period the chickens should be given layers mash starting from 18 to 20 weeks old to depletion which ranges from 98 to 112 weeks old."

Sauted Yellow Onions The long handled Steel Spatula is a ideal tool for any kitchen to turn and serve food like burgers, steaks and even home fries it worked well for flipping over a cheese steak. Long Handled Spatula The cheesesteak was born and raised in South Philadelphia and over time they became a Philadelphia staple, Myself I grew up in the Germantown section of Philadelphia and me and my friends us to got to get those cheesesteaks each and every week, But today I want to share with you a healthy vegan cheesesteak that is a little spicy because I added a few chili peppers to make it spicy and really good and tasty and we used fresh mushrooms to replace the meat. So follow us so I can share with you my Philadelphia Mushroom Gouda Cheese Steak that I am sure you will love. Let's begin. Ingredients 2 tablespoons of butter, (divided) 2 medium yellow onions, (thinly sliced) ½ teaspoon sea salt 16 ounces portobello mushrooms, (sliced) 2 red chili peppers, (rough chopped), (optional spicy) 1 green bell pepper, (sliced) 1 tablespoon of tamari sauce 1/4 teaspoon of fresh garlic A pinch of fresh ginger A pinch of dill Crack black to taste Hellman's vegan mayonnaise 4 6"" hard rolls, (gutted out) 4 slices of thinly sliced gouda cheese Methods Let's start putting this vegan cheese steak together, What I want you to do is to saute the yellow onions so they can bring out all of that good sweetness that is packed inside the onions. Now using a heavy duty large skillet add 1 tablespoon of butter with the skillet on a medium heat, add the sliced onions and saute for 4 to 6 minutes until the onions are lightly brown, season the shallots with sea salt and the cracked pepper when they are lightly browned removed from the skillet on to a plate cover to keep warm until needed again. Now using a large heavy duty skillet on a medium heat add the other tablespoon of butter, add your mushrooms, let them start to sweat down so the mushrooms seem moist and juicy for about 5 minutes, maybe 6. At this most then start adding your onions, fresh garlic, dill, green pepper, ginger and tamari sauce. Let this mixture continue to saute for another 2 minutes to marry in all the flavor and then add the chili pepper. Mix in all the ingredients well using a wooden spoon, then grab your hard rolls, gut them out then add a nice coat of Hellman's vegan  mayonnaise between each roll, set aside.

117,Sensible Portions Veggie Straws: A Review,food," Fin lives in California's Central Valley and is interested in social issues. Well, these sure taste pretty good as far as most similar products go. You would think from the cover that every bite is filled with tomatoes, spinach, carrots and other healthy eating options. You might just think you can skip the vegetables all together if you consume a bag or two of these a day. But think again. If you look closely at the cover of the bag, in the lower left hand corner, you see the words ""Vegetable and Potato Snack"". I'm not kidding. It's really there. What it really should say is: a colorful potato chip designed to trick you into eating something healthy, but that would not only take up too much space, but it might shine off potential buyers altogether.  Now, if you look at the contents of the package, in other words the ingredients label, you see:  a lot of oils, some ""SPINACH POWDER"",  ""TOMATO PASTE"" and ""BEETROOT POWDER""  - for color.  I'm not even sure what beetroot powder is, but I know that beets and beetroot are not the same.  I don't think consuming a powder, or a paste actually counts as fully as the whole vegetable content. What else you will notice is that along with the names of things that sound familiar or a bunch of salts and sugars.  I don't think a healthy diet should consist of oils, salts, sugars, or spices - particularly if the spices are used for the sole purpose of color.  I could be wrong however.  I have to confess that I am not a nutritionist, but I generally think it is safe to exercise on the side of caution and say that it is a good thing to avoid anything too salty and anything too sweet.  It tastes good yes, but your body doesn't need this stuff. Most consumers do not look at the nutritional information on the food they buy. The government started making labeling for food products back in 1906 because unsavory manufacturers would sometimes use deceptive and even fraudulent practices when selling their goods. One source indicates: "" 'The Gould Amendment required all packaged foods to have the ""quantity of their contents plainly and conspicuously marked on the outside of the package in terms of weight, measure or numerical count.' "" The information label as we know it, was actually developed in 1990 the source says, however, I thought I can remember it going back much further than that. The source indicates that even in our modern era, efforts are being made to initiate adjustments to food labels that accurate provide consumers an idea of the true contents. If you look at the nutrition label above, you see that the saturated fats prevail and there are higher levels of sodium than you would expect. The nutrients are almost absent, with items such as potassium, iron and calcium not being what you would expect from a vegetable serving. Consequently, the U.S. became the first country to enact mandatory food labeling in 1913 when it passed the Gould Net Weight Amendment to the 1906 Act. The Gould Amendment required all packaged foods to have the ""quantity of their contents plainly and conspicuously marked on the outside of the package in terms of weight, measure or numerical count. — From an article ""The origins and evolution of Nutrition Facts labeling"" Of course there is a narrative on the label.  And it sounds pretty promising.  i actually, as I get older, find myself taking time to look at the label and see what the manufacturer has to say about the product.  I didn't see any warnings indicating that consuming this could cause cancer as I did on some other veggie snacks.  I do however see a comparison which says that per 1 oz serving, this product has only 7 grams of fat compared to 10 grams in a similar amount of potato chip.  That doesn't really seem that significant to me.  But they did feel the need to point this fact out. You are also encouraged not to feel guilty about eating these and that they taste good.  Now, I think that is something worth pointing out.  Most people don't really feel guilty about snacking and of course, the fact that snack items appeal to the palate is why people engage in this leisure activity in the first place. But even though this product has ""30% less fat than the leading potato chip""  (I am not sure which brand is in the lead to be honest with you), I would probably opt for the latter because it is tastier and in fact, I know exactly what I am eating. With this product, I am not sure. in the bag well, as you might guess, these look like little straws.  In fact, I think there are people out there who would be willing to stick these into a glass of soda and sip away. They're hard little, hollow pieces of colorful stuff and crunch up nicely.  They are pretty tasty, if you are partial to bland flavors.  There really isn't much to them.  I was honestly a bit frightened of these initially because I was that popping one of these into my mouth would be like licking a a tomato or a lemon.  Not so. You taste the potato, that's for sure.  They're almost like chips, with a little spice to them and little less bite.  A potato chip has a nice after taste.  These, are just kind of so so. Do I recommend these as a option for the snacker?  Sure. They aren't bad when it comes to munching between meals. Would I advise someone to eat these? Well, no.  But then again I wouldn't recommend that anyone drink a glass of gasoline - and not just because of the gas prices. Can these substitute for a meal?  Sure. You can go ahead and eat a bag of these and then go on the water only diet for a few weekends.  I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun with that. But seriously, if you were under the impression that these were actually a ""healthy"" item to chow down upon between regular meals, please give that notion some serious reconsideration. But if you want a fun snack and have your coworkers say things like ""Oh wow, veggie snacks, healthy!"" you can take them to your job and show them off - just like I did in my clear plastic snack sized baggies (they really make these).  And that really did happen. When my coworker presented that reaction to me, I politely tried to correct her by explaining that the authenticity of this advertised product is up for question.  Her eyes glazed over, and she yawned and looked at me and then started to talk about various kinds of staplers. You may not really care, but now consider yourself informed. And try and make some good choices as consumers. © 2022 Fin"
118,Air Fryer - Baked in Shell Eggs,food," My daughter taught me this trick today. Once she had them done, she and her kid were going to create colored eggs for Easter. A project, she called it. Air fryer, 250 degrees. 15 minutes minimum. Maybe even 17 or 19 or 21 minutes. The only way to know if they are done is to peel and examine one unpeeled. Once you are certain, then cool them in cool water.  I volunteered to test the first egg. It started to peel nicely, then there was a small area that was wet. The white had stopped hardening in one spot. We pondered putting them back in the air fryer. We had to wait for the second batch to finish, and we added time to the batch just to be more certain. Meanwhile, we put the first peeled egg in the microwave to firm up that last bit of white. I don't know how many seconds she put it in for, but within seconds it sounded like someone had been shot. The egg had exploded. All over the microwave. The second egg peeled a bit better, the egg fully cooked. One thing, the yolks are yellow. Not greenish. She did good cooling them down. No dry icky yolks. They are moist and flavorful."
119,Mashed Potato Pancakes - Uffda Puffda,food," I had a decision to make. Mashed potatoes and gravy leftovers, or potato pancakes Pancakes win! Note: My mashed potatoes are russets. 5 pounds. Peeled, quartered, brought to a boil. Simmered 22 minutes. Drained. Then, I add a stick of butter, a pint of sour cream, a cup of milk and mash with a potato masher. Mix together. Heat butter in pan. Add a small glop of potatoes so you can tell when to add the rest. Once sizzling, add a number of glops until the bowl of potatoes is used up. Let fry until slightly firm. Flip over. Fry for a number of minutes, then flip again. They should be turning golden brown.  The golden brown color will come, aided by the egg and flour, coupled by the butter, and finally, from the potatoes. If course, the outside will crisp up. The inside will firm up, but will remain a lighter color. Enjoy!"

121,Review of Jennie-o Turkey Breast,food," Fin lives in California's Central Valley and is interested in social issues. and creative writing. Turkey is pretty good.  Anyone who enjoys meat will probably make that confession.  And it isn't just a dish to be enjoyed at Thanksgiving.  Turkey is probably one of the more popular meats to put in sandwiches.  Some people prefer the drumstick, others like the wings. If you are one of the people who likes a breast, but doesn't want to cook up a full bird, Jeannie-o might be what you're looking for.  It seems to be a full cut breast, not pressed meat.  The gravy packet is flavorful, the seasoning just right and it cooks right up in a bag so it stays pretty moist. If you're looking for something to share with a small family, or an addition to a larger dish or feast, this might be a desirable option.  How to cook See the end for Cooking Directions What's good about this choice, is that everything is in a bag for you and you can put it right in the oven from the freezer.  No thawing.  The seasoning is right.  The bag seals in the juices.  Everything cooks pretty evenly and it looks pretty gorgeous with its golden sheen. The directions say to cook it for at least two hours - which is about what mine took.  I found one that weighed a little over two and a half pounds.  Most samples I've seen are usually close to that.  There are some much larger however. That's the other notable quality about this sample, that the portions are just right if you are looking for a meal or something to cook up and have meat for sandwiches the next day.  There isn't too much.  With my breast, I put it into one of those foil pans - which was probably much too big. I cooked it at 375 for about two hours and twenty minutes and put a little water in the bottom of the pan so any drippings wouldn't dry out and burn.  You'll be able to use the juices in the pan - and the bag - to cook the gravy. For the gravy:  the directions say to add water to the frozen starter - but you probably won't need to because they'll be enough broth left over from the cooked turkey. The bag keeps everything just right and you don't need to add any seasonings or baste while cooking. looks like a real breast - not pressed meat Serve this with a side of potatoes and stuffing.  Add a veggie, some bread and butter. The gravy is flavorful and delicious - perhaps a little salty for some - but I like it. This is a great option for anyone who has a small family or if you're looking for a couple of sides of white meat this will do. You can see from the photos that these are actual breasts.  Some of the other brands out there use pressed meat, which isn't bad, but it's just not as authentic.  If you're looking for some of the processed stuff, you're better off visiting the deli. I would recommend this dish, it's one of my favorite out there.  But then again, I don't like dark meat. You won't have the skin or the bones in case some of you are into that.  But you will have a nice meal. This content reflects the personal opinions of the author.

122,Purple Rabbit Cookies with Buttercream Frosting,food," Cookies with frosting... My downfall. There's a little shortening. A little sugar. There's some flour. Depending how ""soupy"" your mix is, makes the difference on when you quit adding flour. Mom said she added 2 cups of flour. You are still on your own. Sour milk is made by putting milk in a cup and adding vinegar to it. Those sharp, animal shaped cutters are what she used. She just happened to have a bunny shape.  The dough needs to be firm enough to flatten with a rolling pin. You can roll the dough on flour. Flour your pin as well. Steer clear of sticky. The frosting is melted butter, powdered sugar, food coloring, and a minute amount of milk. So. Mix dough. Flatten. Cut shape. Throw excess back in bowl. Squish back together. This takes a while. Bake at 375 degrees. Watch them. They don't take long to bake. Minutes. Your goal is lightly golden brown."
123,The Drink You Need in Your Fridge for Summer 2022,food," We’ve all seen the rise in popularity for craft beers. These brews were recently followed by the undeniable hard seltzer craze. That left me wondering – what’s next? Could it be a shift toward non-alcoholic drinks? Sounds awfully analogous to an awkward middle school dance with the lights on. Seriously, when did O’Douls go from being the prank beer to the trendy influencer? Don’t get me wrong. I’m a fan of any lifestyle choice that promotes health. But if you’re reaching toward a beer, glass of wine, or cocktail in the evening – the psychology behind that seems to be that most just want the buzz to unwind and disconnect from the rigors of the day. So, does the NA trend really quench that mental thirst? Enter, Floral Beverage’s THC seltzers. Before you click onward because you’re not in a recreational marijuana state – hear me out. Floral’s THC and CBD seltzers are both hemp-derived. That means the cannabis extracts they are using are not a controlled substance federally legal. I’m a THC-curious consumer. But I’m also not looking to smoke. Nor do I fully trust edibles. It just seems like a real time commitment and the inconsistent dosing isn’t ideal. COVID has made us all more cognizant of what we’re putting in our body. What’s better than a calorie-free water that provides a zero-hangover buzz? Seems to me like the handpicked desirables of alcohol without any of the bad. I’m no doctor. And I don’t need to worry about drug screening. Delta-8 is new to me – so do your own research before you buy. But surely hard seltzers aren’t the end of the road for beverage innovation. The lightly flavored cannabis drink tastes crisp and is perfect for a summer day. Take it from me and give this trend-setting beverage a try, you won’t be disappointed."
124,Pork Chops - Fried in Butter with Onion Slices,food," I used an electric skillet. Season chops. Melt butter, add pork chops. Onions. Set timer for 10 minutes. Then, flip over. Flipping them revealed a nice, golden brown caramelization. Cook to 140 degrees. Enjoy!"
125,10 Simple Ways to Become a Better Cook,food," research new recipes and tips to make cooking better, easier, and to make anyone a better cook. I like making recipes from scratch. When it comes to food, I am one of the biggest food nuts there are. I constantly research new recipes and tips to make cooking better, easier, and to make me or anyone a better cook. I like making recipes from scratch. I do a lot of homemade baking, like, Lasagna, Manicotti, and anything else I can bake as long as it's something homemade. There is still a ton of information out there and I am still learning new tips and tricks to make cooking better and a little more healthier. Here is an article I read http://www.foodnetwork.com/chefs/100-greatest-cooking-tips-of-all-time/index.html that Food Network put out. It's pretty interesting. I started thinking of ways I could help you be a better cook with my own tips. I also did some research on the subject as well. You know what they say, ""Knowledge is power"" and I wanted to gather as much of that ""power"" as I could. Here are 10 simple ways to be a better cook. 1. They say salt is your friend. It gives your food flavor but it's high in sodium, which in turn can cause heart disease if not used in moderation. Instead of using straight salt, try using sea or kosher salt, or even Accent. You still get the salt tase but, in a healthier way to season your food. And, you must season your food before cooking it to get the best flavor. 2. Leave your cookbooks on the back burner. They are helpful but, too much is not good if you want to be a better cook. A pinch of this, a dash of that, is all it takes to cook better. Use your own imagination because no cookbook is going to give you that. I have many cookbooks and now they just gather dust because I make up my own recipes. You're smart and you can do this, too. 3. Keep your knives clean and sharp. A dull knife will just make it harder to cut fresh ingredients and is time consuming. Sharpen your knives at least once or twice a month to keep them in pristine condition. 4. Use fresh fruits and vegetables. I know what you're saying, using frozen or canned veggies is quicker. That's true but, you don't get the same result. Frozen is okay but, you still taste the frozen taste. Cans have that metal taste in your food. So, take the time to cut fresh ingredients. It may be time consuming, but, it's a healthier way to feed your hungry clan at dinnertime. 5. Ditch those cutting boards made out of left over counter tops. Use wood or plastic instead. Using these keeps your knives from dulling to quickly. 6. Use fresh spices. I have used the ones from the store when I have had to make a quick dinner when I had no time to cut fresh spices and herbs, but, using fresh spices and herbs will give your food that elegant, gourmet taste. Everyone will think you're a gourmet chef using nothing but fresh ingredients. A little tip, these are easier on your waistline and keeps you heart healthy. 7. Cleanup. I find that it's better to clean up as you go. You don't want a messy kitchen after you have prepared your meal. A messy prep area can cause contamination in your food and you and your family will get sick and, you don't want that. Cleaning up as you go is a must! 8. If you are making a one pan meal like stir-fry, don't put to much in the pan where it's impossible to stir the food. Too much in your frying pan can cause spillover on your stove. Use 2 frying pans if need be to ensure a clean cooking area. 9. I try to use all flavors. I like some things sweet and sour, and some spicy and salty. Keep these flavors flowing in your meals. This balances out the flavors in your meals. 10. Texture. We want the perfect texture, especially in our noodles. Noodles should be cooked al dente at all times. Nobody likes noodles that are overcooked and soggy. Think about the texture of all your food. Textures include: crunchy, creamy, and juicy, just to name a few. You are the cook and you know what consistency your family likes their meals. So, there you have it, 10 simple and easy ways to be a better cook. Please check out the link I provided for more tips and tricks in the kitchen. If you can't find it, here it is again: http://www.foodnetwork.com/chefs/100-greatest-cooking-tips-of-all-time/index.html. Also, research, research, research. I can't stress this enough.

129,Boiling and Drinking Black Tea Daily,food," Miebakagh, a trained historian and computer geek, is interested in alternative medicine. A health enthusiast, fond of food and nutrition. A cup of black tea Unplash Tea is a complex chemical substance. It has some 30,000 molecules. It required heat to break down its components. In the first-ever natural experiment, the tea leaf falls into a pot of boiling not steaming water. Now, if you make your cup of tea with steaming or hot water, you’re a loser. Nature says to use only boiling water. That’s the thing that counts. In this article, I’ll show you how to make the most out of a teacup. Why you should drink black tea daily, what advantages d'you get from drinking a cup of tea daily, and what are the risks of drinking a cup of tea daily? And much more. Contents: Constituents of black tea. 5. A tea for a cold. 6. Types of tea. 7. Black tea. 8. Tea Blends. 9. Growing Teas. 10. Rose Breakfast Tea. 11. Cyproheptadine Complex. 12. Brewing tea in boiling water or steeping tea in hot water. 13. The lazy man’s way of brewing tea. 14. Conclusion. 15. References.  Tea is a beverage. It’s loved all over the world. Tea originated in China and is preserved as an elite drink for centuries until every person can afford certain cheap brands. Even though it's now a common drink, not every person can afford some brands like Assam tea. Though tea was an elite drink, that originates in China, not every Chinese elite considered it a valuable beverage. To the Southern Chinese, it was a privilege to drink tea daily. The Northern dynasty elites and their fellows mock tea drinking as a ‘slaves’ drink’ that is below curd milk. Nevertheless, tea drinking has now become so common that you can’t find a society that doesn’t consume the beverage. Certain persons just a minority dislike the distillation. To these, the distilled liquor impaired sleep, due to its caffeine content. Yes, but that’s normal at the first cup or two. Then pronto, it's all a sweet dream. Before or during the Ming Dynasty ‘The classics of Tea’ was written. Tea drinking culture become very popular and spread out of China and Asia to India, and all over the world. Now, the majority loves to distill a cup of warm liquor. I’m here talking about black tea. They are green tea, Oolong tea, white tea, yellow, and red tea, all of which come from the Camellia sinensis plant. Yes, black tea and green tea seem to take 74% and 23% of the tea respectively, leaving the others a mere 3%.   Black Tea Fights Diseases ‘Studies have found that some teas may help with cancer, heart diseases, and diabetes; encourage weight loss, lower cholesterol; and bring about mental alertness'.-WebMD Drinking tea regularly is a good thing. Many studies have shown that a cup of warm tea taken daily can help enhance your wellness. Here are the gains you get from helping yourself with this beverage.       Instead of using milk and sugar or sweeteners, add citrus fruit juices to your cup of warm black tea. I prefer fresh limes or lemons plus dried or fresh ginger root. For the first few days of contacting a cold, take two cups morning, afternoon, and evening before meals. Don’t add any sugar or milk, for that will accelerate the cold issue. That done, you’ll notice the cold diminishing. Then reduce your take. A cup morning and evening until the cold goes away. On the same note, you can prevent a cold by brewing one teaspoon of any black tea with ginger, green chili or cayenne pepper, garlic, cinnamon, plus spices of your choice. After brewing the tea put the minced or beaten spices into your cup of hot tea, and let simmer for 5 minutes. The tea could have reduced in temperature, and you can drink it. Take this any time morning or evening, or on the odd occasions and you help prevent a cold. You also build and develop your immune system, and ward off heart diseases. Other spices like cinnamon, cardamom, black pepper, and pepper corms can be good blends for teas. They help rejuvenate the immune system, and also improve heart health.  Tea is Life ‘Infuse your life with tea!’.-MatchaAlternative.com Tea contains Gallic acid, photo-nutrients, tannin, caffeine, theobromine, rutin, quercetin, and some other polyphenols which benefit persons to some degree. Tea has no energy. But the addition of sugar, syrups, honey, fruit juices, and milk can improve the food value of the beverage. I usually drink my black tea with brown sugar and a little milk, day or night. Adding a flavored chemical to tea can not make it better than tea in its natural state. It’s only going to harm you. You should therefore add milk and sugar, or fruit juice, or mixed spices, and I prefer lime or lemon juice, without the milk and sugar. Certainly, chili pepper, ginger, and cinnamon can be added as a flavoring. Triethanolamine(TEA) is a chemical, not tea. Let’s split the compound: Tri-Ethanol-Amine. This compound is viscous. Don’t add it to your tea. It’s harmful and lethal.  Tea proper comes from the tea plant or shrub Camellia sinensis, first identify in China its originating country. Any others apart from Camellia sinensis are herbal infusions or herbal teas. The later can be any plant leaves, flowers, stems, and roots say guava, sweet basil, rose-hip, or any other tree or shrubs. These are also called tisanes. Teas from the Camellia plant are of two types: camellia sineênsis var, which produces small leaves and is processed for the production of green tea. The other is Camellia Sinensis Assamica var, which is long, and broad leaves, and is processed to produce black tea. It’s the fresh unopened bud of the tea leaves that are processed to make white tea. Tea is a complex substance. These teas are further grouped by countries: Chinese, Japanese, and Formaso teas. And, Indian teas, exclusive of the Dar jeering.  Pixabay Original Tea Drinking ‘People began to boil tea leaves for consumption into a concentrated liquid without the addition of other leaves or herbs, thereby using tea as a bitter yet stimulating drink, rather than as a medicinal concoction’.-Wikipedia This is our topic here. This is the tea that comes from the plant Camellia Sinensis. It can be black, red, or white but has the same common name as tea. After water, comes tea. And be sure to have a class or two of water early morning. After about 30 minutes or more you can go for your cup of black tea. Add sugar, syrup, honey, stevia, and milk to increase the food value. Herbs and spices are as good as to increasing taste and flavor. The antioxidants in black tea are the weapons that fight free radicals in the bloodstream. The free radicals result from stressful living and pollution of the environment, which affects the mind and body. That’s why many studies are being based on black tea more than green tea and coffee. In fact, black tea has more antioxidants than green tea and others due to the processes of oxidation black tea goes through. Atherosclerosis is usually associated with the building up of plaque in the walls of the arteries, leading to coronary heart diseases, and then stroke. It also leads to chronic kidney diseases. This is the work of free radicals. But the antioxidants in black tea fight against the illness if you drink black tea daily.  Unplash Teas are now grown all over the world. Chinese tea, Kenya tea in Africa, and Indian Assam tea. Tea is cultivated in Ceylon, Java, South America, and ‘around the Black and Caspian Seas and many other countries’. The Big Fours are China, India, Kenya in Africa, and Sri Lanka. Another major player in tea production in Vietnam. These products from various countries after being cured were either selected and mixed to get a fine blend that improves the tea aroma and taste. Or they’re packed alone and sold. Again, pure black tea is my talk here. Different teas from four or five countries can be selected and mixed together. This is a blend. Sometimes flowers, buds, and even tender stalks of the tea plant are mixed along with the mixture. This gives the blend-tea an edge in taste, flavor, and aroma over a single entity. Mixed blends are more nutritious, and contain varieties of photo-nutrients, and flavanols or polyphenols. These blends will depend on the climate, the soil, or the environment of a country. Some teas are grown on mountains and uplands that are free from environmental pollution. Some teas are even shielded from acid rains or sunlight before harvesting. You get the picture right? Kenya teas are grown on uplands or in mountainous areas. Dar Jeerling teas are grown on the Eastern edge of the High Himalayan mountains in Asia. These teas are expensive. Here’s a specific example of a tea blend below. Enjoy Tea Drink Serenely ‘Drink your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis on which the world earth revolves-slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future.’-Nhat Hanh The following ingredients are commonly used: You concocted all these in the kettle of boiling water for five to seven minutes, depending on your taste. And you filter and take it with a little milk and sugar. You can prefer it with any other sweetener, say honey or stevia. That depends on your flavor and tastes. You can reduce the quantity to make it weak, or increase the same to make it stronger. Reduced the boiling time. Bingo, you’re on your own. You can buy three or more differing tea brands and make your blend. That’s how I did my tea blends, instead of following a set of ‘mixtures’, that contain chemicals like bleach or soda. Experiment, investigate, and taste. Whatever results you get, ask yourself how beneficial the finished product is too vital to waste on frivolities. t. Is it nice? Is it energizing and sorting? Does the broth calm fray nerves? Does the melange help in the digestion process, and help you sleep well at night? All these are serious. Tea should help you to enjoy life instead of wasting it or loading same with ill-health. Tea is health and life. Here’s a specific blend I used to make certain of my teas: Allow the tea to boil for 5 minutes. Then add the hibiscus buds and let it and the tea boil for another 5 minutes. Cool. Add milk without any sweeteners and enjoy. But you can add a little sugar as desired. The hibiscus buds contain natural sugars that sweeten the tea or make it delicious. Cool again. Ever wonder why insects and birds visit flowers? Flower buds have nectar. And what’s nectar? It’s a sort of natural sweetener. They two main types of caffeinated black tea, Chinese and Indian. The former has less caffeine than the Indian-made one. The caffeine content of the later makes the tea bitter. Rose sweetens the harsh taste of the tea.  Cyproheptadine is a brand of drug that stimulates digestive action. If you’re a poor eater and you take the medicine, your appetite will be stimulating and you’re taking to eating more. Tea is a drug, since it's medicinal and not just a healthy drink. It can act like Cyproheptadine medicines. Drinking more than two or three cups regularly in the morning can prompt a feeling of hunger. Whether you add milk and sugar to your cup of black tea, it'll make you feel hungry and eat judiciously. If you drink tea early morning without milk, it’ll make you crave more than what you normally eat and can lead to weight gain, and consequently, high blood pressure. So, use only one teaspoon of loose leaf tea to brew a cup of your drink. This is something that divides as far as the benefits of preparing tea are concerned. I said at the beginning that the tea leaf naturally falls into a pot of boiling water. That’s how we’ve got to prepare our black teas. In-fussed the tea in a pot of boiling water for 5 to 7 minutes to get the most of the caffeine, tannin, bioflavonoids, and phenols. This brings out the tea taste and flavors. The method likewise breaks down much of the beneficial complex compounds in the tea leaves.  Nevertheless, steeping the tea in hot or warm water is good. But it’s the lazy man’s method. Emperor Shennong who first discover, brewed, and drank the tea observed it boiling naturally. But how long, that we don’t know. He’s a doctor and a scientist and my reasoning tells me that you can’t outdo him, or nature, right? But from boiling and tasting teas, experienced tea drinkers know for sure that the more you brew the tea for over 5 minutes, the more the acids and tannins are released. The tea becomes slightly bitter. So if you boil tea for 5 to 7 minutes, (5 minutes is a minimum)you’ll get the right consistency. Brewing it for 2 minutes is good enough for washing your face and hair or bathing. At odd times, I boil my tea for 10 minutes. That’s when I need the brew stronger. This will keep me more alert, as more of the caffeine and tannins are released. Tea can act like a drug. A drug according to the Dictionary, is anything that has an effect on the mind, and it may be positive or negative. So, black tea when taken in excessive doses can cause: Caffeine dependence. As tea is a healthy drink, be moderate with it and you can avoid these risks. Use one teaspoon of 25 g of the blended tea for brewing a cup. One or two cups is enough for the day.  Naturally, all the dirty eating sets including tea sets are gathered together in the washing basin or tube. But it’s best that you separate the eating plates from the tea sets, to avoid oil and food flavors contaminating the teacups. Even the washing soap can pollute your tea utensils to some degree, which corrupts the tea taste. So use a little mild detergent along with ash to wash your teacups and spoons. Rinse well in fresh running water. And then, soak or rinse thoroughly in dilute lime or lemon water.  Tea is a healthy, nutritive drink. It prevents some illnesses in the body. Take a cup or two daily with or without milk. A cup of tea can be flavored with lime or lemon juice. Some add fresh green pepper, ginger, and garlic as a defense against a cold and its virus. Drink black tea daily.

131,Ricotta Pasta Recipes For Dinner,food," Nabiilah is an author who loves writing fantasy / teen fiction novels like The Other Side of Paradise and The Infinity Coven Trilogy Ricotta is an Italian whey cheese made from sheep, cow, goat, or Italian water buffalo milk whey left over from the production of other cheeses. Like other whey cheeses, it is made by coagulating the proteins that remain after the casein has been used to make cheese, notably albumin and globulin. Real ricotta cheese is made by reheating the whey left over from cheesemaking. Most of us at home don't have easy access to a large supply of whey. Traditionally, ricotta is made by heating the whey leftover from other cheese-making projects (those made by using starter cultures and rennet).

132,Can an Asian Dish Really Be the National Dish of South Africa?,food," My writing includes my personal travel experiences, destination, history, and cultural information. Hot Out of the Oven!  South Africa has a number of inhabitants from all over the world. The population includes indigenous tribes, immigrants, and those locals native to the country. The cuisine of the country reflects this same diversity. In fact, the national dish Bobotie originated in Asia. Throughout history, the indigenous tribes were considered to be ""hunters and gathers"". In other words, they lived off the wealth of the land. As Europeans began to immigrate, they brought the dishes of their own countries. As time went on, the combination of these ""foreign"" dishes and the native tribal dishes met somewhere in the middle, and South African cuisine saw a metamorphosis. After the apartheid and the country began to change, another renaissance in cuisine occurred, thus giving way to the cuisine of today. When I was in South Africa, many of the people in my group indulged in the meat of the wild game and felt like they had experienced the cuisine of the country. From the research I have done regarding the cuisine of this diverse country, there are really lots of choices and many have European roots. The closest dish to what one would refer to as a ""National Dish"" is Bobotie (ba-boor-tea). Most of the immigrants to South Africa are Dutch, French, Indians and Malaysians. Bobotie was actually introduced by the Asians. Simply put, it is similar to Moussaka of Greece but is a mixture of curried meat and fruit with a creamy golden topping. Basically, it is ground meat simmered with spices, most often curry powder, miscellaneous herbs and dried fruit. After the Bobotie is assembled, it is then topped with a mixture of egg and milk, similar to a béchamel sauce. Once topped, it is baked until set. 30 min 40 min 1 hour 10 min 6 In keeping with tradition, serve Bobotie with some yellow rice, and with slices of banana, and some pickle or chutney on the side.

134,Chocolate Turtle Cake Recipes For Dessert Time,food," Nabiilah is an author who loves writing fantasy / teen fiction novels like The Other Side of Paradise and The Infinity Coven Trilogy Turtles” are chocolate and caramel candies with pecans. The pecans tend to stick out of the sides of the candies, making them look like turtle legs. That's how turtles got their name. Desserts with chocolate, caramel and pecans often get that “turtle” name attached to them. Austria is known for their world-famous chocolate cake, which alone makes it a great destination for dessert foodies. Turtles candies are bite-sized candies made up of pecan halves, caramel, and chocolate. They are named as such because when you pile the chocolate and caramel on top of the pecans, it kind of looks like the shell of a little turtle!

Now, some things I learned. I made mistakes my first time. I can laugh about them now. The popcorn will try to jump out. It is too hot to pick them up and toss them back in. (Bird seed...) Don't tip it over. It's top heavy, and lightweight. It makes a big mess. Kernels of popped and un-popped kernels all over. Meaning, under the stove, under the toaster oven... Sigh. Yes. I did end up with a bowl of popcorn. I melted some butter in the microwave and drizzled it around. I folded the popcorn. Then, I salted it lightly. Apparently it was tasty."

139,West Coast Sourdough Sandwiches: a Review,food," Fin currently lives in California's Central Valley. He enjoys writing food reviews. Well you might ask yourself, how many new restaurants does a community need?  How many fast food places are enough? And sandwich shops?  How good are those?  Why not just another burger joint or a chicken shack?  Do we need another place to compete with Subway, Charley's, Togo's or Quiznos? Seesh you might say. But wait, this place is a little different... an interior view Well, sourdough bread, as you might have guessed, actually has a bit of a bite to it. From what I could find online it is actually healthier for you than regular bread. According to one article I found on healthline.com, sourdough bread uses a mixture of wild yeast and lactic acid - which is found in flour - as a starter in order to get it to rise. Most breads use a form of baker's yeast in order to get the dough to rise. I have read that some starters have been around for more than a century. I'm not sure about the preservation process or how this specimen is handed down. I just know that it tastes good. And of course, many of you have heard of the Francisco Brand bread which is famous for it's sourdough. I don't believe the restaurant and the bread manufacturing company are in association in any way. But we'll get to that. I just wanted to talk about the restaurant here. And mention a little about sourdough bread. For more information on the history etc, see some of the links I've included below.  The Francisco Baking company and West Coast Sourdough are not at all related. The Francisco Baking company is headquartered in Los Angeles. West Coast Sourdough was founded in San Francisco. The Bay Area is known for a variety of great foods, but the comfortable weather and other barometric conditions make it an optimum place to create the tasty bread. There was another sandwich shop called Sourdough and Co. which in a federal lawsuit claimed copyright infringement. According to one source: ""In its federal suit, Sourdough & Co. alleged that former licensees committed trademark infringement by continuing to operate after terminating their agreement with the company and using similar branding, only under a different company called West Coast Sourdough."" Not quite sure what that means and it sounds uninviting, but all I wanted was a good sandwich. I could find no associations between Francisco Bread and the West Coast sandwich shop other than the fact that they both have a likeness of the Golden Gate Bridge as their logo. a sample loaf of Francisco sourdough Well, as you can see, there are a variety of flavors to choose from. I sampled two of my favorite: The French Dip Turkey and Swiss The French Dip:  Absolutely delicious. Thin, just like I prefer, slices of premium, flavorful beef tucked under a slice of cheese. The spicy mayo is optional but with French Dips I like to keep it simple. Just meat and cheese please. The Au Jus was perfect. I was pretty certain it was instant, but by the flavor, I actually wanted to believe that they had cooked the meat in it. The bread though, was amazing. You could definitely tell it was fresh baked. The right texture - not too rough or too soft. And just the right tinge of sour. Sometimes you get sandwiches made on sourdough and are so overwhelmed by the bite that you want to wash your mouth out with gasoline. (Not a good idea with the prices of fuel these days). But the bread was so delicious. It didn't even require any wet sauces to make it consumable.  Turkey and Swiss: Well, I had mine toasted and it was warmed up just right. The meat was great and tasted like it was from one of the more spectacular delis. The cheese was fine and not that synthetic stuff some sandwich shops try to pass off. I'm not a big eater, so I opted for the smaller, four each variety, and it hit the spot. Just enough. Very filling. Perfect bread, tasty meat and a fine slice of Swiss. I am definitely going back. Turkey and Swiss It looks like this shop is pretty simple.  A great franchise.  They have salad options, a macaroni, and of course soups. It looks like there is a schedule for soups though, so if you are a fan of the basic chicken noodle, you might have to wait until Wednesday.  As you might expect, Clam Chowder is available every day.  And of course, you can get these in a bread bowl.  A sourdough bread bowl of course. I don't think they have Chili, which of course would be delicious with their bread. There are a limited variety of meats and veggies, but this is just a smaller franchise.  But they manage to be a bit creative with the Chicken (Chicken Salad, Grilled Chicken and Buffalo) and with the turkey as well (Garlic Pesto, Turkey and Salami, Cracked Pepper, Cranberry, and just plain). So I highly recommend if you are in California and you find yourself walking by this place, you check it out. Delicious.... a view of the local menu © 2022 Fin"
140,Good Health Veggie Straws,food," Fin currently lives in California's Central Valley. He enjoys writing food reviews. Pssst. yea? Guess what? wot? You heard of these things called veggie straws? Hmmm? yeah. i have Well, I have something to tell you. wot? vegetables should be eaten every day Well.  I have to let you in on something.  I know you came here because you are one of those people seeking a healthy snacking alternative.  You are someone who is hoping to find something that tastes good and is healthy for you.  Of course you are.  Everyone is looking for the fountain of youth, trying to find that city called Utopia where no one has to worry about mosquitoes and bottled water grows on trees. If you've perused the chip aisle, I know you've stumbled across these.  Colorful samples in delightful shapes  with images of carrots, onions, and spinach on the packages. Wow you think.  They have finally come up with red onions or snow peas in a form that I can not only carry with me, but enjoy eating.  These are not only tasty, but they must fulfill some of the daily nutritional requirements for humans. And, you can eat a whole bag and know that you did yourself a favor. Right? Well...I guess that depends.  Well, looking at the label, i notice that there is a measurable amount of potassium and iron in this product.I don't even really know exactly what potassium is, but I've seen it listed on many nutritional information labels and I am under the impression therefore that it is good for you. Isn't it? Aren't vegetables supposed to be a good source of potassium and iron and riboflavin and several other polysyllabic substances whose names look good on packaging and you like to repeat when you're at the Saturday evening library party? Well,  at least there isn't an overabundance of carbs, sugars, various saturated fats and kerosene in these things. So let's take a closer look..... C'mon.  Flip that bag up a little. And read some more.  the ingredients seem to be mainly potatoes Well, one thing you need to know about the ingredients labels on any product you buy at the store. The first name on the list is the main substance that goes into the product.  So when you see something like ""Potato Starch"" and ""Dehydrated potato"" you know that is what makes up most of what is inside.  Sure, there are a few vegetable powders and pastes, but those are near the end, after all  the poly-saturated fats and sunflower juices etc.  The means, they are awarded the least amount of care. So these veggie straws....are basically a potato chip. And one other thing I noticed.  There is a warning on this bag that basically says, if you eat what is inside, you can eventually develop cancer.  So, not only are these vegetable straws actually potato chips, but you are buying a carcinogen which you will unknowingly chomp down until you need another bag. Well, I have to say that I was a little disappointed when I found out that veggie straws (or chips) really do not contain a healthy dosage of fruits/vegetables.  I thought I was doing my body a favor by eating these. Are they any good?  Well, that is subjective.  They do have a slight off taste that maybe might make you think of a carrot or a tomato, but honestly, they are pretty bland. Do I feel duped. Yes of course.  I thought I could eat these everyday and get away with it. In fact, even as I write this, I am in a state of disbelief. I am still trying to figure out the color design and how to tell the carrots from the tomatoes. crunch crunch What gets me most of all, is the label about cancer... So.  I guess I'll let you decide for yourself. © 2022 Fin"

143,Why Most Restaurants are Going to Die,food," Slightly-informed political and economical observer who loves food, movies, sports and video games. Let me preface this by saying that I’ve studied economics, but I’m not an economist (much like I’ve studied engineering, but I’m not an engineer, and I’ve studied theater, but I’m not a member of the LGBTQ community). But even with my partial-at-best knowledge of global economics, I can tell you that restaurants are in for a rough road ahead, probably even rougher than they’ve already seen. Covid may have been the first rock down the mountain, but there is an avalanche hitting restaurants now, and there's a chance that most are going to be crushed. Let’s start with a little recap, for those of you who have been vacationing on the rings of Saturn or in a coma for the last 2 years. First there was Covid, and everyone decided to stay home and play Xbox and call it “Working from home”. We all ordered from Grubhub and UberEats and restaurants laid off their waitstaff, but those eateries who could figure out how to put food in boxes and bags did just fine with just a chef and someone to answer the telephones.  Then Covid took a break and restaurant owners gleefully announced to their waitstaff that they could come back and be on their feet for 9 hours a day making minimum wage and taking abuse from hungry customers who had spent the last 9 months forgetting how to interact with live human beings. Most of that waitstaff gleefully told restaurant owners where they could shove their jobs. This led to another round of restaurant closures and forced remaining restaurant owners and managers to actually interact with their customers—a situation that made them rethink their life choices. Covid came back for the sequel, Omicron, but this time there were not so many closed dining rooms. Instead, there were fights over mask rules and vaccination requirements and spacing and air flow. Customers stormed out in anger. Staff walked out in protest. Basically now people were choosing restaurants based not so much on the food or service, but rather their politics. Inevitably, some restaurants never quite found their political match in the customer base and were forced to close. Also, it's worthy of note that there wasn't much government support out there for the second wave of Covid. Restaurant owners were not invited to get free loans or grants to bolster their businesses during Omicron--they were forced to make it work. Or not. Covid began to fade again, just in time for record inflation, supply chain problems and a war in Europe. This led to the phase we’re in now; the phase I like to call “Holy shit pickles, I just paid $120 to take my family to Denny’s.” Needless to say, this economic phase is not sustainable. Restaurants cannot lower their prices because food and labor are so expensive. People cannot pay these prices because wages are not keeping pace with inflation and gas prices are making it too expense to drive to restaurants, work, or to the end of the driveway to get the mail. Something has to give. Especially since one of the next phases in this progression is ""I found this in the street--I'm pretty sure it's edible.""  What will give is the restaurants. They will give coupons, discounts, frequent diner cards, Groupons and whatever else they can to keep people coming. Some will give too much and bankrupt themselves through an upside down cash flow. Others will not give enough and never lure the customers back. The national chains with the deepest pockets will weather the storm. Fast food will probably be fine (as long as they keep their “Dollar menus”). Fine dining, family restaurants and legitimate ethnic restaurants are going to close by the thousands. The once rich landscape of food choices in America is going to look a lot more barren and homogenized.  So thank you Covid, and Putin, and whoever that loud guy is who is always shouting about stocks on TV. You've taken the joyful experience of going to that special restaurant to get that special food you're craving and replaced it with ""Would you like fries with that?"" The movie “Demolition Man” predicted a world in which every restaurant was Taco Bell…By about 2025, we may be there"
144,Review of Poppables: Southwest Ranch Flavor,food," Fin currently lives in California's Central Valley. He enjoys writing food reviews. As the label says, these are crispy potato bites which are designed to look like the net section of a lacrosse racket.  They are crunchy and flavorful.  The small holes add an airy texture to each bite which seems to increase the flavor output. Basically these are a potato chip that looks like it was poured into a special mold to give it some pop. Well, this is sort of a rhetorical statement. Snacks are beneficial because they help carry you through the day until your next meal.  They fulfill cravings. They can whet your appetite. And of course, they give you that extra boost when you're sitting around bored with not much else to do. I have read studies that have connected the boost your brain experiences with an extended life-expectancy.  Every time you snack, you add about two and a half seconds to your life is what I had read. In addition, the energy you expend lifting the morsels to your mouth and the act of chewing releases endorphins that help promote your overall cardiovascular health.  An hour of snacking is equivalent to five seconds on a treadmill! Well, these have honestly got to me my favorite of the Poppables variety that I have tried so far.  The flavor is clean and I don't get that pasty residue I did with the cheddar cheese specimen. They crunch nice and there is a bit of a creamy sensation as if these were already dipped.  Nothing overbearing and when you look at these in the right light, you can see a thin veneer of reddish gold which makes them seem almost precious. I highly recommend these These not only make a fine snack, but there are several other things they are useful for: I hope you enjoy these.  They are by far, my favorite of the Poppables snacks.

Braising (from the French word braiser) is a combination-cooking method that uses both wet and dry heats: typically, the food is first browned at a high temperature, then simmered in a covered pot in cooking liquid (such as wine, broth, coconut milk or beer). It is similar to stewing, but braising is done with less liquid and usually used for larger cuts of meat. Braising of meat is often referred to as pot roasting, though some authors make a distinction between the two methods, based on whether additional liquid is added. When you braise meat or a vegetable, you fry it quickly and then cook it slowly in a covered dish with a small amount of liquid. Basically, you braise the octopus in its own juices and then cut it into pieces and dress it with a paprika-garlic sauce while it is still warm. A successful braise intermingles the flavors of the foods being cooked with those of the cooking liquid. This cooking method dissolves the meat's collagen into gelatin, which can greatly enrich and thicken the liquid. Braising is economical (as it allows the use of tough and inexpensive cuts), and efficient.

Creamy smoothie , served in mason jar Gina Welds Any time is a great time for a smoothie, especially when you're trying to turn it into a meal replacement, and it can be a meal replacement if using the correct ingredients. I created this smoothie during a time when I was fasting, and was trying to keep caloric intake below 500 calories daily, but was trying to still get in the necessary nutrition to allow me to be productive throughout the day. This is due to the inclusion of healthy fats and proteins. Fasting is something that I routinely do.  I normally fast the first 3 days of every month, giving my digestive system a much-needed break.  Plus fasting also helps to keep inflammation low in my body.   It was a practice that I started soon after I was diagnosed with lupus.  Although I was already doing a fasting ritual at the beginning of every year ( a practice that I took part in the first 3 weeks of the year through the church that I attended),  I decided that I needed to expand it to the first 3 days of every month, as I realized the difference that it made in my health.

153,Lay's Layer's: Three Cheese Flavored,food," As it says on the packaging, these are ""layered potato bites"". Which basically sounds like a potato chip rolled up and deep fried. But these are not quite like your regular spud snacks. If you can imagine a cross between a chip and a cheese puff you will come close. Overall they are not bad. However, I think the three cheese specimen will take an acquired taste. A bit of the bite with the artificial cheese powder that isn't too intense, or flavorful for that matter. But they are crispy and airy at the same time, if that makes any sense. And they are designed so that they take up quite a bit of space in the bag. You really don't get that much snacking power because of that. These are really sort of unique. The closest thing that I've tried that is similar to these are the Bugles. These have a similar sort bite, but are a bit more light and puffy. Otherwise: Well, these are by no means perfect. And honestly, I'm not too sure about the three cheese flavor variety. I have some things you snackers might want to watch out for: The world of snacking is a precarious place.  You have so many varieties to chose from and so little time.  Even though there are many options to choose from, most people find their chip and stick with it. Will this be a keeper?  Well honestly, probably not.  The novelty will wear off soon and the flavor on the three cheese option isn't distinctive. In fact, I'm not sure which three varieties of cheese were included here.  I only detected an artificial powder which quickly faded after the dust fell off the chip on the way to my mouth. Are they worth trying again occasionally?  Well maybe.  That depends on how you define worth.  Can they add a little variety as a side to a sandwich.  Yep.  They are good there.  Are they worth the two dollars a bag you pay for a couple of dozen chips which weigh a little more than an ounce when potatoes you can get a pound for a dollar.  Nah.  No way. Of course these would be difficult to duplicate in any home.  I'm sure even the most talented chef would not be able to come close.

156,"Review of Datz In Tampa, Florida",food," Sarah has eaten at Datz many times since 2017 and always has a good experience. CL Staff Datz is an American restaurant located in Tampa and Saint Petersburg, Florida. Datz serves unique and traditional American food such as; burgers, sandwiches, omelets, pancakes etc. Datz opened in Tampa in January 2009 and the owners of Datz opened a second restaurant in Saint Petersburg in May 2019. Datz is known for its unique burgers such as the cheesy todd which consists of 2 beef burgers, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, cheese, and two buns made out of bacon jalapeno mac n cheese. The food at Datz is so amazing and unique that Datz has been featured on many shows and tv stations such as; Good Morning America, the Travel Channel, Food Network, MTV, and many others. I love coming to Datz whenever I have the chance and in this article, I will give you a review of this restaurant. I hope when you're in the Tampa or Saint Petersburg area, you will give Datz a try too. Datz serves brunch menu items on Saturdays from 8:30 am to 3 pm and from 8:30 am to 9 pm on Sundays. Datz's brunch items consist of chicken and waffles with egg benedict, normal breakfast items like eggs, sausage, ham, toast, corned beef hash, omelets, sandwiches, breakfast tacos, avocado toast, shrimp and grits, biscuits and gravy, strawberry pancakes, creme brulee french toast, monkey bread, soups and salads, nachos, chicken wings, french onion dip, and a variety of burgers. On weekdays Datz has mostly all the same brunch items for breakfast with the exception of soups, salads, nachos, chicken wings, and burgers. Breakfast is served from 7-11 am on weekdays then Datz starts serving its lunch and dinner items. There's a section of the lunch and dinner menu called house favorites which contains Datz's most popular menu items. This section consists of puff pastry pot pie, country fried steak, a huge meatball with spaghetti on the inside of the meatball, Mexican food with two eggs, butternut squash ravioli, a version of KFC's famous bowls which contains boneless chicken tends, corn, melted cheese, gravy, bacon, mashed potatoes and a biscuit with honey, shrimp and grits, stuffed meatloaf, fish and chips, chicken tenders, chicken and waffles, and biscuits and gravy. Datz also has a huge variety of sandwiches. Datz serves a Cuban sandwich, a crispy chicken tender sandwich, a pastrami sandwich, a chicken salad sandwich, grilled cheese, a mahi-mahi sandwich, a version of a class Reuben sandwich, a beef brisket sandwich, and a pulled pork sandwich. The most unique sandwich is the Nashville Chicken Doughnut sandwich which consists of fried chicken tenders tossed in a spicy Nashville sauce then drizzled with honey and topped with pickles. The buns for this sandwich are cinnamon sugar donuts. The desserts are pretty similar to Dr. BBQ's desserts which consist of a peanut butter pie, bourbon chocolate cake, and a few others. Datz's desserts are pretty much the same except Datz serves strawberry cheesecake and a brownie sundae. Datz can be a little pricey compared to other American restaurants. Most of the food items cost between $13-$20 and mostly closer to $20 so eating at Datz wouldn't be a good option if you are looking for something cheap. However, the food you will get at Datz is worth the money spent because everything is fresh and hot. Vickie McCarty from Pixabay Whenever I go to Datz, I usually always order the same thing. I order the Biscuits & Crazy which consist of buttermilk biscuits with sausage gravy, bacon, two eggs any way, and three types of potatoes: sweet potatoes, blue potatoes, and regular potatoes. This is my favorite dish at Datz because it's very hard to find good biscuits and gravy. At most restaurants, it's usually the same two issues: the biscuit isn't fresh so it's hard or the gravy isn't good. However, at Datz, the biscuit is always soft and fluffy and the sausage gravy tastes great. Also, I love Datz's tri-colored potatoes. I don't like sweet potatoes but Datz is the only place I've been able to eat blue potatoes. Before going to Datz, I never knew blue potatoes existed. Blue potatoes taste almost like regular potatoes but they seem saltier and have their own unique flavor. The bacon Datz uses is like applewood smoked bacon so it has a little sweetness and saltiness to it and I always order my eggs over hard. Datz rarely disappoints when I order this dish. I had an issue once with the Biscuits & Crazy where my sausage gravy tasted sour and I wasn't sure if it was spoiled or not but that was the only time. My friends and family love eating at Datz too and no matter what you order, the food tastes great. Rafael Tongol Datz is affiliated with Dr. BBQ so the restaurant layout is pretty similar. There is both indoor and outdoor seating as well as an upstairs and downstairs dining area. The restaurant is very big and seats a lot of people. The restaurant atmosphere is very similar to Dr. BBQ and feels very relaxed and gives off a chill vibe. Datz has beautiful outdoor seating on the patio if you want to enjoy the sunshine or modern indoor seating inside the restaurant. There is a bar in the middle of the downstairs dining area and a small section for dessert. If you want better and more varieties of dessert, you should go next door to Dough which is owned by the same people that own Datz. Dough has a lot of variety of desserts to try though they can also be very pricey. The staff at Datz are also very nice and attentive. I've only had an issue with the staff at Datz once and I go there at least two times a year. I have been eating at Datz with my family and friends since 2017 as I discussed earlier because I love the food here so much. © 2022 Sarah Wong"

Early 1800's Throughout the early 1800's the Native American tribe of the Kickapoo were the first to inhabit the land of Bloomington-Normal. Their tribe fled from Wisconsin to Illinois, and they named their land ""Keg Grove."" It wasn't until the late 1820's that the first non-native settlers came to the area. The Hendrix and Dawson family were apart of the first non-native settlers, and they renamed the area to Blooming Grove. There was some tension and hostility between the Native Americans and the new settlers at the beginning of their relationship; however, tensions subsided as time went on. Slowly, Blooming Grove became an area rich in agriculture, and downtown began to grow.1830's to Late 1800's Some time in the 1830's the town name of Bloomington came about, and several key pieces of infrastructure came up such as a police department, a jail, and a city government. A greater amount of farmers grew attracted to the area, and Bloomington found itself growing at a fairly quick pace. In 1865, Illinois State Normal University, a school for becoming a teacher, was introduced to the area, and ""North Bloomington"" became the town of Normal. 1900's Going into the early 1900's, Bloomington-Normal was growing fast, especially with the addition of many railways and highways. In 1922, State Farm was founded by George Jacob Mecherle, and this company became one of the largest employers of Bloomington-Normal. In addition to State Farm, Highway 66 was formed and brought many people through Towanda, a small town just east of us. Present Day Fast fowarding to the time we are in now, Bloomington-Normal is the home of not just Illinois State University but also Illinois Wesleyan University and Heartland Community College. Bloomington-Normal additionally hosts several business headquarters such as State Farm, Country Financial, Rivian, Growmark, and many more. It has become one of the fastest growing cities outside of the Chicago Metropolitan Area, and is on the path of continuous growth in the future. It's very important to me to understand how Bloomington-Normal came about before we dive into the food of the area because nothing influences food more than culture, and by understanding the roots of Blono, we can appreciate our food so much more!!  Uptown Normal is the hub for several restaurants, cafes, and coffee shops, and it is set in a great location, just a short walk from Illinois State's campus. Uptown has its pillar businesses that have assumed residence in this area for quite some time, but what can we expect to come in the future? Starting off with some of the construction that we have seen recently, it is rumored that a brewery is coming to the building that is under construction neighboring D.P. Dough. I believe that this will be an excellent addition to Uptown's nightlife as well as another great place for local and college students to enjoy. I also wanted to touch on the, not so recent anymore, transition from Emack & Bolio's to Theo's Microcreamery. Although I loved Emack & Bolio's, I thought that this was a great move to seek some growth in Uptown and see a change of decor/pace. I wonder if we will see more transitions similar to this in the near future. Personally, if I had to predict what was coming to Uptown Normal, I would guess maybe a bar or two as well as a quick, ""grab a bite to eat"" type of restaurant. I believe with the closeness of proximity to Illinois State's campus, businesses need to attract college students, and a quick, cheaper option will definitely draw students to their establishment. With the addition of a new bar, I think that we could generate more business Uptown compared to Downtown Bloomington, and it would be great adding another option for a night out! As I continue to spend out the rest of my college career here at Illinois State, I really hope to see more and more come to Uptown. It is such a special place, and with the right businesses, it can become an even more popular location."
160,Bloomington-Normals Best Dinner Spots,food," Epiphany Farms Epiphany tends to be one of the first options mentioned when discussing where we should go out for dinner when wanted to enjoy a night out on the town. Epiphany Farms is beautifully decorated, offers a unique, farm-to-table menu, and is located in a great spot in Downtown Bloomington. I personally enjoy that Epiphany Farms, located under its sister restaurant, Anju Above, serves both menus. I think that this allows Epiphany Farms to expand its market to a wider audience because it serves so many food options. I have spent multiple meals at Epiphany, and I would recommend it to any one coming into town. In regard to price range, Epiphany can tend to be on the pricier side, I would not describe it as a casual restaurant; however, there are definitely ways you can budget your meal while dining in and spend less than twenty dollars per person. Rosie's Pub Also located in Downtown Bloomington, Rosie's Pub is a classic bar and grill! I wanted to include Rosie's Pub on this list because I felt that it was a more casual option, but it also is a great spot to grab a couple drinks or have an intimate dinner. Their menu includes flatbreads, burgers, salmon, steak, and some other quick eats. I am a big fan of ""hole in the wall"" restaurants, and I think that Rosie's Pub is at the top of that list. It is truly a hidden gem of Downtown Bloomington! Reality Bites Ringing in the last of my favorite restaurants in Downtown Bloomington is Reality Bites! I absolutely love Reality Bites! Its location, its menu, its vibe... It is perfect! Reality Bites serves some menu items as tapas or you can enjoy traditional dining as well, and it serves several specialty cocktails. You can find tacos, burgers, pastas, skewers, and several appetizers on their menu, and their dining space shows so much character. They have a grand window at the front of their building that looks out on to Main St., and inside, it offers a very intimate area. Another cool fact about Reality Bites is that it is a part of a family of restaurants/establishments, and it works hand in hand with Elroy's Sports Bar and Daddios Nightclub! Ancho & Agave If you have read any other parts of my blog, I am sure you have gotten enough of Ancho & Agave; however, I just cannot get enough of this place! I feel obligated as the Blono Foodie to continuously recommend this restaurant. Their signature tacos... To die for! Their burritos... To die for! Their chips and salsa... To die for! I really hope that at some point you are able to find the time to make it over to Ancho & Agave. It is one of my favorite places to go with some friends or with my parents when they come into town! It has such a fun vibe to it, a large seating area, and beautiful decor! Medici Located in the heart of Uptown Normal, Medici is a huge piece of Normal's restaurant scene. It is located right off of Illinois State University's campus, and it is constantly buzzing with business. It offers a wide array of food options, and it has a stunning setup! My personal favorite aspect of Medici is the tree that is planted/rooted in the middle of the restaurant! It's a sight you have to see for yourself! In addition to its beautiful restaurant and details, Medici offers an amazing outdoor patio deck that is open in the warmer months of the year. Several private parties are hosted by Medici, and it is definitely a restaurant that attracts most of the crowd that visits Blono!"

162,Steak Breakfast Burrito with Gary's Quick Steak,food," Fin lives in California's Central Valley and is interested in social issues. and creative writing. You want to start your day off right. A nice shower, a hot cup of coffee and of course, some good eats.  You will need the energy to help you negotiate traffic and prepare for the hussle and bussle your day will bring you.  Frustrated customers, nosy coworkers, an irate boss.  A long morning without a nap.  It's not the weekend after all.  You need to make it to lunch...and then. But until then, you are going to need to make it through the morning.  And you may work in an environment where the access to the company snack bar is an inconvenient jaunt down several flights of stairs until you reach the darkened corner at the end of the hall.  Or you may have to walk across several stoplights just to get to that convenience store.  You want to make sure you get something that helps you make it through the journey.  Something that sticks to your ribs. It is estimated that anywhere between 25 and 50 percent of the population skips breakfast routinely or that anyone of us skips breakfast breakfast at least 25 to 50 percent of the time.  Those are estimates that I actually came up with myself based on guessing and personal experience so please don't ask me to cite a source because I don't have one.  Those figures however seem pretty sensible if they are not accurate. Be honest, how many days a week do you skip breakfast? Variations of this can be found on various online sources and there are two that sound pretty plausible so I will mention them here. One source reports that it was a practice of indigenous tribes to wrap foods approximately 10,000 years before a man named Jesus Christ was walking on the planet.  A more specified resource, Wikipedia states: ""An often repeated piece of folk history is the story of a man named Juan Méndez who sold tacos at a street stand in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Ciudad Juárez during the Mexican Revolution period (1910–1921), while using a donkey as a transport for himself and his food."" Obviously both versions differ greatly and in reality the truth may never be known. It is interesting to note that a similar eating vessel appears throughout many cultures:  You have your gyro, egg roll, your modern day wrap.  And in reality, the burrito is basically a sandwich.  A portable way to carry food. Simple Ingredients Flour Tortilla Eggs Hash Browns (or potatoes) Shredded Cheese Gary's Quick Steak Salt and Pepper Optional Onions Peppers Tomato Salsa Sour Cream Avacado Just a note, this is a very simple recipe and you can probably decide for yourself how you want to prepare your items.  I like mine done all separately because then I can just mix them in the way I like. Also, I can ensure that each item is to my preference.  Some people like to mix everything together - eventually, inside the burrito it will be that way - but then you have to be careful not to overdo something like the eggs and under cook the potatoes. There is a mild science to it and I don't want to make this sound any more complicated than necessary.  I live by myself and cook for one so not all my practices will appeal to everyone reading this.  Also, I keep mine pretty basic, meat, cheese , egg (1 only) and potatoes.   A basic flour tortilla as well, and there are options available for you out there as well. I cook everything on the stove top and since I am preparing the meat in the same pan I want to warm the tortilla on, I am putting my ingredients aside in small dishes.  After I transfer my food, I wash the pan I cooked the meat in and reheat it. I then heat tortilla for about a minute on each side, flipping it a little more after. Heat the meat, season lightly flip, and press Add onions and peppers (optional) mix and cook After heating up the tortilla, transfer it to a plate or flat surface. Add your ingredients. I usually start with the potatoes and then space the meat out on top.  Then I add the egg and top it with cheese. Put anything else you want in it too.  You can add ketchup or another sauce if you wish. Fold it upwards so it looks like a half moon.  Tuck in the side corner and then fold it up again. After this, I like to put it back on the griddle for a bit, to warm everything up and melt the cheese. I have come to enjoy the breakfast burrito because you can have everything you want in a small portable, consumable carrying case. You have your meat, egg, cheese and potato.  You can cook the egg(s) anyway you like actually, and putting an over easy egg into this would not be that messy if you wrap it right. You can make one for breakfast and then another to take with you.  Wrap it in foil and then you'll have another snack when you get hungry in a couple of hours."
163,Grilled Chicken Sandwich with Gary's Quick Steak Chicken,food," Who doesn't enjoy a hot sandwich?  The French Dip, a Philly Cheese-steak, hot pastrami, and even a simple grilled cheese.  There is something about heated food that is more appealing than anything non-perishable or that comes from a refrigerator.  Sandwiches are quick and easy.  They can be healthy as well.  Add some lettuce, tomato, onion, you have a side salad all packed in with your favorite meat and cheese between two slices of (your favorite) bread. It sounds almost too healthy to be true. In a day and age when prices are hitting a ceiling and many lines are long, the convenience of making at home is just too easy.  Certainly, it always tastes better when someone makes food for you, even a sandwich.  (I'm not quite sure why that is).  The convenience of not having to leave home and cooking your food to order are a few of the reasons why you might want to try this product. In order to make this product, the following are recommended.  I cooked mine on a skillet and used a bagel for the bread option.  Cook times will vary depending upon the level of heat and your elevation etc.  Recommend to cook on a flat surface or a pan (not an outdoor grill).  Use a little cooking spray, oil or butter for flavor.  Ingredients Gary's Quick Steak Chicken Cheese (I'm using provolone) Onion Salt Pepper Green Bell Pepper Bread (your choice) Optional: Other Seasonings:  Rosemary, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Paprika etc. Worcestershire sauce Mayo Mustard  Ultimately, how what you put in is up to you Heat pan or cooking surface on medium-high heat.  Glaze lightly with oil or cooking spray (if desired) Place brick of chicken on top of hot surface Season lightly - add worcestshire sauce if desired Cook about two to three minutes Flip chicken.  Repeat seasoning. Cook two mins Break chicken apart.  Add vegies Mix and cook until meat is done.  Should be pretty quick. (Recomendations for cooking poultry are that the meat is above 160 degrees) Top with cheese.  Turn off heat. Prep bread. Move the meat over.  Add toppings.  Close sandwich. Enjoy! Heat surface let cook other side I believe that all anyone in this life wants is to sit in peace and eat a sandwich. — Liz Lemon move to bread Keep in mind, this is just one of the things you can do with this product.  You can up things up and go ethnic with chicken teriyaki, go a little south of the border and make enchiladas, or grill it up plain for a salad.  I'll have to work on some more discoveries. It's a pretty good quality product and saves you the work of cutting up your own chicken.  And it cooks up pretty quick. Let me know in the comments below if you've tried this or done something on your own with Gary's.  I like their selection and it is one of the better easy prep, frozen items on the market.  At least in my opinion. Also, don't overcook the chicken or under prepare it either.  That is something I cannot provide instruction on other than to say cook out all the pink and make sure its close to 165 or so.  I think I said 160 earlier....

164,The Svalbard Vault of the End Time,food," PEDRO or POT, he’s a village boy and a grandmother's product. A man of many worlds. He’s a writer, blogger and shares his Stories Online. The Norwegian government built and launched the Vault in February 2008 to help the global community, which is run by the Global Crop Diversity Trust, a non-governmental organization headquartered in Rome. I only became aware of this incredible feat of human dimension a few weeks ago when I heard that Spain had delivered its boxes of seeds to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway. My excitement and curiosity were clear. Nonetheless, my mind wandered.  I wonder about what must have brought this noble, and yet determined effort on the part of individuals and governments to secure global food. Could they have foreseen a human tragedy not too distant in the future for having taken such a vast stride? Moreover, what kind of tragedies have we not seen lately? While I do not wish to sound pessimistic, how is this vault and others scattered around the globe helped alleviate the world food crisis in the past? What substantial part did it play in the Syrian food shortage during and after the war other than allowing them to withdraw from their safe? Or what happened in other regions of the world hit by draughts or the threat of climatic conditions as it affects crops all over the globe? Cary Fowler, the former executive director of the Crop Trust, originally conceived the concept in the 1980s, but the concept came to fruition only when the U.N.-negotiated International Seed Treaty came into force in 2001. The Seed Vault is the home of 13,000 years of farming history. This Global Seed Vault was sometimes referred to as the ""Doomsday"" Vault because it was meant to be kept in case of wildly unrestrained events or a worldwide food disaster. Seed deposits are as precious as gold. Despite their low monetary value, the boxes could hold the key to global food security in the future. However, their preciousness is in many ways different from that of gold, oil, diamonds, and many other precious minerals, but they are a guarantee of our future food needs. These small brown flecks of over 930,000 varieties of food crops, hold the world's largest collection of agricultural biodiversity and function as a kind of safety deposit box. the Global Seed Vault is found in the heart of a frozen mountain, above the Arctic Circle between Norway and the North Pole. It is a large island cradled by ice (the Global Seed Vault on Spitsbergen, in Norway's Svalbard archipelago), above Norway and the North Pole. Svalbard was selected for the vault precisely because of its remoteness. Unlike most places on earth, it's free of war and terror, everything you might fear in other places. In a nutshell, it is in a safe area. Only one repository in the world is comparable to it: the Arctic World Archive, which was opened deep in a nearby mine in March to preserve data for governments and private institutions. In 2008, the Svalbard vault was opened for the purpose of storing backups for all those varieties. And the Vault began receiving seeds from all over the world. The Arctic facility received the first big deposit since an upgrade to make the facility more resilient to climate change. Some species being saved at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault include seeds from onions grown in Brazil, beans grown in central Asia, and Prince Charles’ wildflowers gotten at his United Kingdom home. The vault is situated in a mountain cave about 746 miles from the North Pole. More than a million new seeds have been added, bringing the total to over 60,000. Unlike what is happening with Africans on the international stock market scene, with their complete absence (I hope I am mistaken), however, this time around in Svalbard, their participation is quite noticeable and encouraging. Reports have it those African countries made their contribution to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault as early as 2010. The Svalbard Vault repository of last resort for humanity's agricultural genetic resources received twenty-one boxes filled with 7,000 unique seed samples from Ibadan, Nigeria. The regional centers supported by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) in Nigeria, Benin, Ethiopia, Kenya, Colombia, India, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, and Syria began packing and shipping duplicate collections in January of that same year. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault uses small seed banks around the world to restore crop diversity after disasters such as floods, fires, conflict, and extreme weather. In 2015, wildlife advocates were able to withdraw seeds from an important seed bank that was destroyed during the civil war in Syria. Around the world, there are as many as 1,700 gene banks. Agricultural research and development are advanced through this global network that collects, preserves, and shares seeds. The goal is to find and house a copy of every unique seed that exists in the global gene banks; soon the vault will make room for its millionth variety. Also, it works in conjunction with those gene banks if their material is destroyed or lost. Even though some seeds in the deep freeze of the vault may not be useful any longer (wild seeds and old varieties), the DNA traits contained in the vault may be adequate to develop new strains to meet whatever challenges the world or a specific region will face in the future. Additionally, one of the 200,000 varieties in the vault may have the trait that allows rice to adapt to higher temperatures, for example, or develop resistance to new pests or diseases. With climate change, this is especially relevant. The gene bank in Aleppo was not the first to be threatened by war. Gene banks in Afghanistan and Iraq have been destroyed, along with the genetic material that wasn’t backed up in Svalbard. In 2008, the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) was forced to flee its headquarters outside of Aleppo because of the civil war in Syria. While the organization evacuated its international staff in 2012, some Syrian researchers stayed behind to rescue equipment and other valuables. In the end, the organization moved to Morocco and Lebanon. However, when the fighting intensified, they were forced to leave behind their gene banks. This collection of seeds, holding some of the oldest varieties of wheat and barley, is among the most valuable in the world. The threats to these valuable resources go beyond armed conflicts. There have been some disasters, such as flooding from a typhoon and later a fire at the Philippine national gene bank. A lack of resources is also probably one of the biggest threats facing gene banks around the world. Many of these organizations suffer from inadequate funding, making storage and protection of their seeds impossible. There are now 1,700 gene-bank facilities around the world, which act as guarantors of biodiversity, and the Crop Trust is raising money for an endowment fund. Technological advancements have allowed large-scale crop production over the past 50 years, changing agricultural practices significantly. Despite increased crop yields, biodiversity has decreased, to the point that today only about 30 crops supply 95 percent of human food and energy needs. In 1950, for instance, China had 10,000 rice varieties; today that number is down to 10 percent. The United States on its part has lost over 90 percent of its fruit and vegetable varieties since the 1900s. Due to this monoculture, food supplies are more vulnerable to threats such as disease and drought. With the first withdrawal of seeds from the Svalbard vault, ICARDA reestablished its headquarters in Morocco and Lebanon and restarted its gene bank in 2015. Their offspring were carefully harvested and processed to return to the vault after being planted in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley and Morocco. The ICARDA returned the seeds it had taken out late in February of the same year. According to reports, a few people eventually died of starvation as the siege continued. Despite being surrounded by seeds and plant material, they refused to consume any of it. Such was their conviction about the importance of the sources to help Russia's recovery after war and ensure the future of humanity. Dmitri Ivanov, one of the scientists, died surrounded by bags of rice. In an age of geopolitical turbulence and uncertainty, the Svalbard Vault is an unusual and hopeful demonstration of international cooperation for the benefit of humanity. Regardless of politics or diplomacy, any organization or country can send seeds there. North Korea's red wooden boxes sit next to the United States' black boxes. A row of boxes of seeds from Ukraine sits on top of a row of root vegetables from Russia. The position of the seeds is best captured by the words of Brian Lainoff (the Lead Partnerships Coordinator at the Crop Trust based in Bonn, Germany) who stated, ""The seeds do not care that there are Korean seeds next to North Korean ones."" ""They are cold and safe up there, and that is all that matters."" Finally, we can see that there is something that humans have in common, that is food. If we take a harder look, we may also discover that what unites us as humans is more than what divides us. It is all about love and understanding. Thanks for reading!

168,Reducing Wastage of Food as Chef,food," Chef Rajesh Gupta
Chef instructor
Culinary Academy Of india Food is survival. It is the backbone of life itself. Plants and animals need food, and humans are no exceptions. But unlike plants and animals, humans have tendencies like overproduction and complicated processes like supply chain management. This has led to a manufactured crisis of epic proportions- food waste. What is the food waste crisis? Well, before we get there, let’s understand what food waste means. Food waste represents consumable food that is either discarded by choice or left unattended, resulting in its spoilage. In a recent report by the Boston Consulting Group, it was projected that food waste will multiply three times over by 2030. This means approximately 2 billion tons of food will be discarded or lost. That’s 66 tonnes of food waste per second. According to the BCG report, 2.5 lakh tonnes of food waste comes from the hospitality industry alone. Now that we know what food waste is, you might wonder why there is a crisis? This is because food wastage has a much more catastrophic effect on the environment than you may be aware of. Environmental effects top this list. When food waste is discarded into landfills, it rots and produces methane- a potent greenhouse gas that is fatal to the environment. Methane is also 25 times more harmful than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. Food waste also accounts for the wastage of freshwater and groundwater resources.  Roughly three times the volume of saltwater lakes is used to produce food that is 'not eaten'. Other environmental factors include land waste by creating more landfills, waste of fossil fuels required to grow, transport, store, and cook food, and harm to local biodiversity by introducing new pollutants in the area. Since food waste happens at each stage of the global food value chain, it is our moral and ethical responsibility to develop the necessary measures to decrease it. In the hospitality industry, approximately 4-10 percent of food purchased by restaurants is wasted before reaching the consumer. Improper storage, lack of storage practices, and poor environmental hygiene can quickly deteriorate the quality of ingredients. In addition, overproduction and hotel buffets further contribute to wastage. The main drivers of food waste at restaurants include oversized serving portions, inflexibility of store management, and extensive menu choices. All said, some measures can be taken to reduce the food waste generated drastically. Food is survival. And food waste puts the planet’s survival at risk. As chefs, here are a few things we can do to go the extra mile to reduce our impact on the environment as individuals and as a collective. Creating awareness and training staff for waste management in the workplace should be a priority for any professional kitchen. Making them aware of food waste, getting the team on board with the challenges of implementing a food waste strategy, and implementing strategies that will change how things are traditionally done in the kitchen must be a regular practice. Efficient menu planning and assessing the popularity of each dish can assist in reducing the amount of stock that gets thrown away. Evaluating inventory to learn if food sits for a long time in storage and making sure that the place is not over-ordering to maximize the shelf life of perishable products can bring a considerable change. The leftover edible food that the overproduction causes can then be donated or redistributed amongst those who need it. Creating compost with the leftover food is another brilliant approach to reducing our environmental impact. As chefs, it also becomes necessary to maximize your ingredient use. Vegetable scraps like peels, stems, and tops can make a stock or broth. Seafood shells can be used to make bisques, leftover chicken bones for chicken stock, and leftover fat from cuts of meats can be turned into lard. Other easy hacks include hydrating citrus peels and turning them into candies or garnishes. Fruit pulp can also work as an ingredient in desserts and smoothies. Apart from this, processes like canning and pickling can delay spoilage by increasing shelf life. At every level of the global food chain,  there are several macro and micro-level drivers of food wastage across all industries, including hospitality, packaged food, and our homes. But awareness and adaptation of small steps in day-to-day operations by implementing food-saving practices can significantly improve the planet's situation. Remember, change happens with you.

169,Try This Breakfast Instead,food," Published food writer and blogger takes a blow torch to all things about living a healthy lifestyle and choosing better food options I've long given up on commercial breakfast cereals to be a good start to the day.  No matter what the fortified advertisements tell you some are not a healthy option at all.  Whether high in sugar or enough salt to rival a packet of crisps you may find more fibre in the packaging.  For the time it takes me to peel or chop up fresh fruit, I admit the commercial cereal consumer would have been at work for at least half an hour before I've even got a bowl on the table.  The rushed breakfast might work for some parts of our lives but I find that inadequate breakfast only leads to being ready to eat the leg off a chair by 9:30 (or the arse out of a ragdoll, as we used to say). So with breakfast in mind I'm pleased it's the beginning of apple season.  We've planted our own apple trees but they're a bit young to be filling any fruit bowl this year so we'll rely on the varieties at the farmers' markets.  The 'Guy with the Apples' as he's known around here will tell you that if you come back next week and buy the same apples, they will taste different than the ones you bought last week.  Picked a week later generates more intensity of flavour.  But be aware the variety will only only be available for a few weeks before another one kicks in ready for picking.  Apple varieties are marvellous like that. They don't all ripen at once.  So with the fridge hurling apples at us as soon as the door is opened, we continue to enjoy the crispness, flavour and watery crunch that a non warehoused, and much travelled apple provides.  That means no glue from stickers and no bag with a barcode.  No taste of long stored, pasty and spongy apple that requires furniture polish to look desirable.  I've been so tempted to ask my local big glossy supermarket when they will be getting in the Cox Pippins or Lady in the Snow.  Who knew there were more varieties than red and green!! So plate in hand I'll chop up apple matchsticks cut thin and looking stick like, and a good lump of a good plain Greek yoghurt topped with ground up pistachios.  I buy them in bulk, shell them and grind them myself.  The stuff that's already ground is never as fresh.  Now to start Monday morning.  It's still morning yeah? © 2022 Louise Bowers"

174,Make Yummy Egg Caremel Pudding And Chocolate Pudding,food,"   Pudding is the type of dessert. The creamy, rich pudding dessert we think of today is more closely related to custard. In Britain the word pudding is used as a generic term for sweet desserts.  The earliest print reference we find for chocolate pudding is 1730.

177,The World Top Unique Dishes In Pakistan,food," Ahamed has an MBA and worked in document control for years. He enjoys writing and has freelanced and blogged across the internet. In this article, we'll be looking at the top of some Mouth-watering taste foods in Pakistan. If you've never had Pakistani food before, you're in for a special treat. My favorite is one of Pakistan's most well-known and well-liked cuisines. This is a rice dish that is typically spiced and served as the main course. Mint leaves, raisins, and rose water add authenticity to the long grain rice, which can be made with ghee instead of oil if desired. When the mutton is served, the herbs and toppings, like carrots and saffron, are mixed in with the nuts. Biryani is a popular dish that is prepared in a variety of ways and served at parties and on special occasions. Hyderabadi biryani, Sindhi biryani, and Karachi biryani are some of the most popular types. Halwa Puri is a typical Pakistani breakfast that consists of a soft fried flatbread called puri halwa. And semolina pudding, or halwa. It's usually created with a combination of fried semolina and sugar syrup, then topped with nuts like pistachios and almonds. Green cardamom pods, Cara essence, and cloves are used to flavor the sweet delicacy, which is generally brightened with yellow or orange food coloring for a more brilliant appearance. Puri is a soft and fluffy fried bread prepared from flour, water, salt, and oil dough. Seekh Kabab is a succulent Pakistani kebab cooked with minced lamb, onions, garlic, coriander, lemon juice, yogurt, and garam masala. The spices used in the dish can also be changed to suit particular tastes. The meat mixture is skewered, and the kebabs are then roasted over hot coals, resulting in a delicious smokey flavor. Although Seekh kebabs can be cooked in a tandoori oven, they are generally served hot with salads, onions, fries, mint chutney, or flatbreads. We're all familiar with and fond of samosas. Samosas are a great way to get started with Pakistani cuisine because of their crispy texture and range of spices. Onions, lentils, spicy potatoes, peas, or ground meat are among the components in these deep-fried triangle patties, which can be filled with anything from veggies to meat. These savory triangles are usually served hot with chopped onions, yogurt, or fresh homemade chutneys made with ingredients like mint, coriander, or tamarind. Nihari is a famous meat-based dish made from slowly cooked cattle shanks, mutton, or chicken. In large pots sealed with dough, the meat is cooked with stock and a variety of spices such as cumin, cloves, Garam masala, and cardamom. A well-cooked nihari takes anywhere from six to eight hours to prepare, and it is generally served at breakfast. The dish's name is taken from an Arabic word that means ""morning."" Zarda, a bright yellow Pakistani rice dish made with basmati rice, milk, and sugar, is a sweet and fragrant dish. The rice is cooked with a blend of traditional spices, most typically cardamom, cinnamon, and saffron, as well as natural food colorings, which give the meal its yellow color. Raisins and chopped roasted nuts like pistachios, almonds, or walnuts are frequently included. Zarda is a rich and festive dish that is typically served on special occasions, but it also works well as a daily dessert served warm with a cup of refreshing tea. Sajji is a traditional Pakistani cuisine that originated in the Balakistan province. It's made out of marinated skewered lamb or chicken that's been grilled. The beef is usually marinated in salt, but it can also be packed with potatoes and rice or paired with green papaya paste. The meat should be crisp on the outside while staying moist and tender on the inside when correctly prepared, and consumers often squeeze lemon juice over the meat right before eating, which sounds delicious. Paratha is a sort of bread that is often eaten for breakfast and is golden brown in color, flaky, and layered. It's made of whole wheat flour and baked in ghee or clarified butter, and it's available in round, triangular, square, or heptagonal shapes. Boiled potatoes, cauliflower, garlic, ginger, chili, paneer, and radish are common fillings for parathas. Pickles, yogurt, handmade chutneys, and meat and veggie curries can also be served with them. This spicy meat patty is made with a blend of minced beef and mutton and is a Pashtun specialty. Spices like dried coriander, pomegranate seeds, green chiles, and mint give chapli kabab its distinct flavor. Its name is derived from the Pashto term Chapli, which means ""to bring together."" Despite the fact that Chapli kebab is thought to have originated in Peshawar, it is now widely consumed in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India. Traditionally, chapli kebab is served with yogurt, sauce, salads, and naan bread. Chicken Karahi is a highly popular poultry dish in Pakistan. The name ""karahi"" refers to a thick, deep cooking pot, similar to a wok, in which the dish is prepared. The recipe also includes red chili powder, cumin, garam masala, ginger, allspice, cardamom, tomatoes, and garlic, in addition to the chicken. The dish is known as Gosht karahi when made with mutton. It's usually accompanied by rice, roti, or naan. Finally, These foods must be tried. I'm not sure about you, but all this talk about food has made me hungry, and I'd like to taste some of it. Which dish from this post has piqued your interest and made you want to rush to Pakistan for some delectable cuisine?"

180,Pop Culture For Pop-Tarts,food," Born in 1986, this '80s baby and '90s kid remembers the colorful and naughty side of millennial youth. In the season 2, episode 8 of Father Ted titled Cigarettes and Alcohol and Rollerblading, Father Dougal says ""Ted, I'd love a Pop-Tart."" And this is a sentiment most people have when they're craving a breakfast treat on-the-go. These sugary pastry pockets resembling giant, fruit filled ravioli, have been a fun snack since their debut in 1964. Since then, they've been a staple in pantries, a favorite for television and movie characters, the body for the famous Nyan Cat meme, and back in the late 90s, they were the subject of a procott, when Sailor Moon fans bought cases of Pop-Tarts in a fruitful venture to convince Kellogg's to sponsor new episodes of the anime on Cartoon Network's Toonami block, resulting in the remaining episodes of Sailor Moon R making air, and opening the door for Sailor Moon S to debut in 1999. People enjoy the fruit, cream and frosting filled pastries at breakfast, between meals and sometimes as a base for ice cream and pie related dishes. And yet, Pop-Tarts have not been without their own controversies and urban legends. One source of playful controversy seems to come from a few of their flavors. While most Pop-Tarts are delicious hot or cold, some flavors, such as grape, peanut butter, P.B.J. and pretzel have divided consumers. Even more controversial flavors have been Jolly Rancher and A&W Root Beer, which angered some health groups, who never liked soda and candy being marketed as breakfast options for kids to begin with. Another controversial flavor? Pizza. Yes, pizza. In 1971, Pop-Tarts experimented with a variation called Presto Pizza, which just like regular Pop-Tarts, could be toasted, microwaved or eaten cold, but it disappeared from shelves almost as quickly as it had debuted. But the most controversial Pop-Tarts are the ones loaded with artificial flavors, food dyes and sugars, with the worst being high fructose corn syrup. These unhealthy ingredients are so terrible in fact, that most countries only sell a very limited selection of Pop-Tart flavors. In Europe, the only flavors available are Chocotastic, Apple Blast and Strawberry Sensation, all three of which are frosted, which isn't just good news for those who love the crunchy sugar shells, but also good news for dieters, because for some unexplained reason, frosted Pop-Tarts are lower in calories than frosted. A popular urban myth is that Pop-Tarts were originally marketed as dog food, and because of this rumor, many unfortunate dog owners have found themselves emergency rushing their pets to vets, after falling for the ruse and erroneously feeding their dogs the toaster pastries. Under no circumstances should you ever feed a dog a Pop-Tart, as the ingredients humans enjoy in these treats are highly toxic to dogs. The rumor comes from a conflated history of breakfast treats and packaging. In the early 1960s, Post invented a special manufacturing process, in which moist food wouldn't dry out right away if it was kept in special foil pouches. They had successfully tested the method on a brand of dog food, and then they worked on using a similar process of human food, creating a toaster pastry. Folks confuse the foil pouch dog food with Pop-Tarts because of this invention, but contrary to popular fiction, there is no Pop-Tart variety for dogs. Instead, we have toaster pastry theft. In 1963, Post produced a detailed press release about their invention, Post Country Squares toaster pastries, but the pastries were not ready for manufacture right away. Post needed more time to perfect the recipe. Kellogg's used this as a chance to steal the design, creating Pop-Tarts and getting them to market in 1964, shortly before Country Squares hit the market. A combination of Kellogg's cutthroat advertising and Country Squares lower quality taste led Post to re-branding Country Squares as Toast'em Pop Ups and changing the recipe yet again. Because of this, many people still believe that Toast'em Pop Ups is a cheap knock-off of Pop-Tarts, when in reality, it's the other way around. In 1971, Post gave up the brand to the Schultz and Burch Biscuit Company, which expanded the line by the late 90s to seven flavors and started selling the treats not only in the same stores as Pop-Tarts, but also in lower income areas across America and Canada where Pop-Tarts are not always available. While Pop-Tarts are a knock-off of Country Squares/Toast'em Pop Ups, many companies have tried to knock-off the knock-off with their own pastries. Howard Johnson tried to get into the grocery aisles in the 1970s with their Corn Toasties, a cornbread-based treat that came in plain cornbread and fruit filling varieties. Nabisco tried Sooper Kookies, a chocolate and chocolate-chip breakfast pastry that later inspired the chocolate chip flavor of Pop-Tarts. Birds-Eye took a break from vegetables to offer European cultural appropriation with Danka, a pastry that was meant to be a fusion of French, Danish and German pastries, with the blatant misspelling of ""Thank you/Danke"" in German and an ad campaign that comes across as racist and misinformed. In 1994, Pillsbury delighted with a frozen variety called Toaster Strudel, with advertising sometimes aimed at teenagers and tweens instead of just kids. To combat the frozen treats, Kellogg's tried to fight back with Pastry Swirls, but this wasn't the only time it looked as though Kellogg's was fighting with their own Pop-Tart popularity. Over the years, Kellogg's combated themselves with Danish Rings, the aforementioned Presto Pizza and Danish-Go-Rounds. Quaker Oats produced Toastables while Nature's Path produced their own, organic varieties, aimed at jaded adults who are tired of artificial flavors, bright colors and deceptive marketing practices aimed at impulsive kids. With the same colors as Hamburger Helper's Helping Hand, Milton, a white, sometimes pale silver toaster with red trim, debuted in the 1960s to help sell kids and moms on the idea that Pop-Tarts have ""a lot of good"" inside of them. Kids were told that Pop-Tarts were the coolest way to have breakfast, while moms were coaxed into making Pop-Tarts a ""wholesome"" part of their children's breakfasts, because at the time, Pop-Tarts had as many as six whole vitamins, plus iron back in 1975, while the 2020s would see varieties with 7-8 vitamins depending on the flavor, along with a touch of protein and a few minerals. Pop-Tarts on their own were so popular that Milton wasn't really needed, but while he doesn't always appear in TV ads, he never truthfully went away. Milton pops up on all kinds of memorabilia, though since the late 1980s, his merchandise is mostly aimed at adult collectors. Milton does have his own Funko Pop figure, a fitting line for such a popular breakfast treat. As for the Pop-Tarts themselves?

192,The Equipment You Need for an Efficient Food Processing Plant,food," If you're in the food processing business, you know that efficiency is key to keeping on schedule and making a quality product. To do that, you need to ensure that your production line runs smoothly and that your products are made to the highest quality standards. That's why it's important to have the right equipment available for your workers in your plant. Discussed below are essential pieces of equipment that every food processing plant should have when making a quality product. First on this list is mixers. They’re especially useful for combining dry ingredients with wet ones, and they’re especially useful when used to create dough for bread and other baked goods, along with batters for fried products, sauces, gravies, and purees. Anything that requires a smooth texture to be edible. It's important to ensure that these mixers are powerful enough for their jobs, but they also need to withhold heavy use day in and day out. After the dough is mixed, it needs to be properly proofed. Your dough will need certain amounts of heat and humidity for the proper amount of time to boost the activity of the yeast, which helps the bread to rise before you put it in the oven for baking. Without a proofer, it’s difficult to allow your bread or any other baked products the time and ability to rise before going in the oven, especially in a processing plant dedicated to food. Without a proofer, the yeast can’t release enough carbon dioxide to let the gluten inside stretch properly, resulting in a dense and less flavorful product. The separator is used for liquid-solid separation or mash-out. It's used to separate the solids from liquids, and it works for a variety of food processing needs. For example, you might use this piece of equipment to make juice out of fruits and vegetables. After being ground up, food processors also use these machines to separate fat from meat scraps to create sausages. The moulder is used to stuff sausages. It works by filling sausage casings with meat, seasonings, water, whatever you choose to create your chosen sausage. This piece of equipment needs to have proper sizing capabilities to properly stuff the casings while also securing them at just the right tightness. For example, hamburger moulder equipment will have a wider opening than sausage moulder machines. Every food processing plant needs a slicer. This is one of the most important pieces of equipment that you can have in your plant, especially if you're making processed meats like hams, lunch meats, and sausages. This piece makes sure that all of your products are sliced to perfection, and it's a must for any large-scale food processing plant.  In conclusion, if you want to run an efficient food processing plant, you must ensure that your equipment is top quality. This will ensure the best products for your consumers, and it's also what keeps your business thriving."

I keep a few thawed pasties in the refrigerator overnight, then throw them in the air fryer basket at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for about 7 minutes while I get my coffee ready. The microwave and oven are both great options as well. You can even grab a few frozen and throw them directly in your lunch back.

195,Acorn Squash - Baked and Sweet,food," I would describe the flavor as a combination of things. The flavor is slightly bland sweet. Almost nutty. The texture is string like. I baked it with butter and brown sugar, so that gives it a caramel like flavor. I was told that people either scoop out the inside, cut inside into cubes, or, eat inside with outside. I tried a bite with and without the skin. Both equally as good. Cutting in half requires a firm grip and a sharp knife. Once cut, the seeds and pulp are removed. Note: I washed my seeds, dried them. Sprinkled them with olive oil and Mrs. Dash no-salt seasoning. I baked them for 15 minutes. Wait until they pop... The seeds. 400 degrees. Aluminum foil. Olive oil. Mrs. Dash."

197,Cherry Pepper Cobbler with Spiced Streusel,food," If you, like me, are a fan of the sweet heat from pepper jelly then I have a treat for you. Pepper jelly often gets relegated to a cracker topping and not much else. But for those of us who relish the taste, here is another way to bring that flavor profile to life. This pepper jelly inspired cherry cobbler is both sweet and a little spicy, crunchy and juicy. This twist on a traditional cherry cobbler is a fantastic use for fresh seasonal cherries. It uses less overall sugar for a healthier dessert while delivering all the goodness you expect. The peppers add an unexpected flash of heat and layer of flavor. The unexpected pairing may pleasantly surprise you. Any hot or sweet pepper work in this recipe, but I prefer the excellent flavor and crispy flesh of Hungarian hot peppers. This recipe was designed for fleshier semi-sweet, semi-hot peppers, so jalapenos are also a good substitute. If you choose to use very hot and small peppers such as Thai chilis or scotch bonnets, finely dice the peppers and aim for less than ¼ cup but adjust to your own taste. Served alone or with ice cream, chili heads won’t be able to get enough. Move over chili pepper brownies, a new spicy sweet is in town. 15 min 30 min 45 min 6-8 servings © 2022 Zylo"

It is true that even the finest of recipes which are handed down in a family across generations, cannot offer the same taste as the original recipes. A part of the original recipe’s magic was the cook’s expertise and the other significant part was the cookware in which the food was prepared. Traditional Indian Utensils offer a specific taste that cannot be replicated by the Teflon and non-stick cookware that are available these days. The benefits of this Traditional Indian cookware are many. For one thing, the food tastes better when cooked in these utensils. Also, these elements do not have the harmful chemical additives of modern non-stick cookware. There is enough research that proves that traditional utensils retain the nutrition of the food prepared; thus, enhancing health benefits. Research also shows that cast iron decreases the occurrence of anemia – the biggest problem with women in India today. At the later stage of the 20th century, stainless steel was introduced to Indian kitchens. Cooking with stainless steel utensils was a lot less time-consuming as steel is extremely easy to maintain and handle. The elderly, who were accustomed to only traditional cookware, was also enamored by the feel, look, and ease of maintenance of stainless steel. After the stainless steel came Teflon-coated utensils – even easier to clean than as these utensils did not require any kind of prepping (in contrast to traditional cookware), and could be stored conveniently. But neither non-stick nor steel cookware provide the taut grip of a clay or stone pot or the heat resistance of the pure iron cookware. Modern cookware’s aesthetics and economic viability are naturally trumped by the stability, durability, and sustainability of traditional Indian utensils. For these reasons, many households in India are making a gradual switch. Moreover, people in India now understand the harmful effects that the chemical coatings of modern cookware can have on their health and also how easy it is to maintain traditional cookware. Farmer’s markets are now enabling entrepreneurs to sell their cookware directly to consumers and it is very easy to buy everything from traditional pans and pots to organic produce in one place. One search on google with the keywords “Kitchen accessories online India” or also “Kitchenware online shopping” throw up millions of search results pointing one to the right places to purchase traditional cookware from. © 2022 archana zishta"
199,"National Chili Day: What Is It, Why Should You Celebrate it?",food," Hello Everyone! I am Professional Health and Fitness Blogger.
6 Years' Experience. National Chili Day  1. What is National Chili Day? National Chili Day is celebrated every year on October 18th. The official date of National Chili Day was established in 2009 by the American Red Cross and has been observed since then. The chili originated from Mexico, where it was first served as a dish called Chololequia, or chile con carne. It's believed that this dish was created during the 16th century. The dish became popular all over America due to its great taste and how easy it is to prepare compared to other dishes. On this day, chili is usually eaten with cornbread and tortilla chips as well as beans and rice (the usual Mexican meal). Chili has also become an important part of many traditional American dishes such as lasagna, spaghetti, and chili cheese dogs! Question: What are the best vitamins for kids?

Phosphorus 27 .) Folate 28 . Tryptophan 29.). Pyridoxine 30.)Pantothenic acid 31.) Biotin 32. Zinc 33.).Cobalamin 34  There are many answers to this question. The first thing that comes to my mind is the invasion of Spanish and Mexican traders who brought chili with them when they arrived in California in 1769. The second answer I have heard is that the word ""chili"" comes from a word used by Native Americans, meaning ""hot."" I believe these two answers can be connected because it is not known what exactly made chili popular in America. However, it's important to note that chilies were introduced by Spaniards and Mexicans as early as 1697 when Captain Don Juan de San Pedro was sent out on a voyage from Veracruz, Mexico to explore for gold. Chilies became popular throughout Europe during the 18th century but did not become widespread until after the American Revolution (1775-1783). It was at this time when colonists began using various methods of preserving chilies such as drying them into powders or pickling them into sauces and other dishes. By the 1800s, a major source of food supply was dried chilies which came from India where it had been cultivated since around 2200 BC for its medicinal properties. By the 1840s, chilies had become very popular among cooks all over America because they could be easily preserved and used in stews, soups, salads, and much more!  In the early 1900s, during the time of the great depression, people in Texas were looking for ways to make money. They found chili's hot and spicy taste was a perfect addition to any meal.  The three women who are credited with creating chili powder are Mrs. Mary Etta Maxwell (née Adkins), Mrs. Ida Nene Leach (née Smith), and Mrs. Daisy Elizabeth Keeling (née Boyce). In 1924, they formed the San Antonio Chili Queens' Club and started marketing their chili products nationwide through newspaper ads that used phrases like ""chili me"" or ""this is hot stuff"". They also made special offerings for groups like sororities or fraternities which helped spread their brand further across America.  4. What are some of the different types of chili available? There are different types of chili available in the market. The most common type is red chili which is mostly used for cooking and making chutneys, pickles, and sambar. Then comes green chili which has a unique taste as compared to other types of chili. It is usually found in dried or powdered form. Red pepper flakes are also added in some foods like korma and curries to add color and flavor to them. Another type of chili that I would like to talk about here is the bird's eye chili (Capsicum annuum var alba). This type of pepper is often mistaken for bell peppers due to its resemblance with it. These peppers are commonly used in Chinese cuisine where they can be eaten raw or cooked, stuffed into tofu, etc. They have an interesting taste but aren't spicy at all! Lastly, there are green chilies that have no seeds inside them, instead, they have a black tip on the top side of their pods. These chilies have a very distinctive smell that makes you crave for more once you've tasted them! There are many different types of chili available in the market. They are: 1. Hot chilies (like Jalapeno) 2. Mild chilies (like bell pepper) 3. Sweet chilies (like banana pepper or ancho) 4. Szechuan peppers, have a very hot taste and you can't really eat them raw because they will burn your mouth! 5. Chili powder, which is also known as chili mix or chili spice mix 6. Chorizo, it's made from ground pork that has been flavored with paprika and garlic. It is cooked to give the meat a spicy flavor but not too spicy so you can still enjoy it with your meal without burning your tongue off! 7. Chile con carne, it's usually eaten with rice or potatoes and is made from pieces of beef stewed in tomato sauce until tender then served over pasta or egg noodles for breakfast lunch dinner, and supper! If you're into chile con carne then this is definitely something for you to try out! But make sure to wash your hands after eating because there may be some spiciness left on them from handling the hot peppers!  5. What ingredients are usually used in making chili? Chili is a spicy, thick soup that originated in Mexico. The ingredients used to make chili are very varied and you can find several recipes for different types of chili.  The main ingredient in most chili recipes is usually dried red chilies or ground chilies (cayenne). Chili powder is also used but it contains other spices such as cumin, oregano, coriander, garlic, and onion. This type of chili powder gives the dish its unique flavor and aroma. Ground beef or ground pork can be added to your chili as well as tomatoes and beans. Beans provide protein while tomatoes add acidity which helps balance the spiciness of the dish. Finally, onions are often added to give your chili some sweetness which balances out all the other flavors present in it.  6. Why is chili such a popular dish? People in the United States love chili and the reason is that it is a very versatile dish. It can be served hot or cold and you can add meat, beans, cheese, vegetables, or anything else to make it more flavorful. This makes chili an easy choice for all kinds of occasions such as dinner parties, lunch meetings, and social gatherings.

202,French Bean and Potato Dry Vegetable - Indian Style,food," Umesh is a freelance writer contributing his creative writings on varied subjects in various sites and portals in the internet. Dry vegetables are an integral part of our routine meals, especially in our country that is India. There are a variety of dry vegetables prepared in our country using the various vegetables as well as different techniques are undertaken in preparing them and some of these dishes are really the mouth-watering ones. French bean is one of the vegetables which is available across the globe and is liked by many people because of its unique taste and flavour. Green vegetables like this are very nutritious and useful for our health and provide many minerals and vitamins to us. French bean is not a native vegetable to India because it was brought by the Britishers when India was a colony under it but today it is one of the most abundant and easily available ones in Indian markets. We have some native varieties of beans also which are having different flavours and different tastes but out of all those, the french bean is definitely the one which most people like as the best of the lot. French beans are rich in dietary fibre and contain many vitamins and minerals like vitamin K, vitamin A, vitamin B1, vitamin B3, vitamin B5, vitamin B6, vitamin B9, calcium, vitamin C, magnesium, phosphorous, iron, zinc, potassium, copper, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, and copper. We have used the microwave as a cooking medium for this dish in this article but people who are not very comfortable and do not feel convenient with the microwave oven can resort to the conventional cooking methods for preparing this dry vegetable. The quantity of ingredients mentioned below will suffice for 3 to 4 persons when taken during the main meals along with other food items. Wash the beans and potatoes and drain them. Cut the beans in small pieces preferably not more than quarter an inch. Peel the potatoes, onion, and garlic. Cut the potatoes in wedge shaped pieces about 6 to 8 pieces each potato. Chop the onion and garlic finely. Take a microwave bowl preferably having a thick-walled glass and put chopped onion, chopped garlic, cumin seed, coriander powder, turmeric powder (optional), mango powder, carom (saunf) seed, red chilly (optional), and salt in it and pour cooking oil over it and mix all these items using a spatula. Now keep the bowl in the microwave and cook it for 3-4 minutes in high heat. Remove the bowl and add 1-2 spoons of water and stir it. Now add potato and bean pieces to it and add about 1 cup of water and cook it for 12 to 14 minutes till it is cooked and gets dried up. One precaution that we have to take at this point is to check for dryness about 4-5 minutes ahead of end-time as that would help us in observing the dryness in the dish and we can add some little water at that stage itself to avoid charring of the dry vegetable which is an often happening thing in microwave cooking. If the dish is not dried up to the desired consistency then it can be cooked for 1-2 minutes more to get the desired results. The dish is ready now and can be taken out of the microwave oven.  Self Self The dish is to be served during the main meals along with other food items and goes well with bread as well as rice. The present quantity is sufficient for 8-10 servings and can be served with a serving spoon. As this is a dry vegetable it can be served directly on the platter. One single serving of the above dish considering all the ingredients comes to about 40 to 45 calories. If we do not add oil and potato to this dish then one serving would give only 10 to 15 calories. Many people use microwaves just for heating food items. But it can be used for a variety of cooking purposes from cooking snacks to full meals easily and conveniently. The main difference between microwave cooking and other modes of cooking is that in microwave cooking we have to be very careful not to use any metallic or non-microwave bowls for cooking purposes and another caution is to use a proper and appropriate quantity of water in the dish. Please note that if we don't use a sufficient quantity of water then there are ample chances of getting the dish charred and turning into something like coal and it will be a big source of disappointment to the novice cook. When we are preparing curries in the microwave then there is no problem because we can put a sufficient amount of water in it and then there is no question of drying up of the dish. The problem comes when we prepare dry vegetables where we want the water just to evaporate or used up in cooing and the dish becomes deliciously consumable. As a rule of thumb when we prepare dry vegetables for 3-4 people then the amount of water required would be approximately from 3/4 to 1 cup and that is more than sufficient. Microwave ovens generally have 4 to 5 ranges of temperatures ranging from very high to very low and for preparing the dry vegetables we prefer to use the very high or high setting of the temperature. When we are thickening the curries, we can use medium temperatures and if we want to keep the dish simply warm for some time then we will be using very low-temperature mode. Never forget to add water to the dry vegetables before keeping them in the microwave for cooking. This is a very important point and if there is some confusion or doubt in the mind about it then it would be advisable to check the dish condition anytime by stopping the microwave and taking out the bowl and mixing some water at that stage if needed. 1. https://www.calories.info/food/cereal-products 2. https://www.netmeds.com/health-library/post/french-beans-health-benefits-nutrition-recipes-side-effects This content is accurate and true to the best of the author’s knowledge and is not meant to substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional. © 2022 Umesh Chandra Bhatt"
203,The Best Soft Keto Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe (Only 4 Ingredients!),food," I am a foodie on a keto diet who loves experimenting in my kitchen. I'm quite inventive, so you'll find recipes I have created from scratch. If you're looking for the best soft keto chocolate chip cookie recipe, you're at the right place! I have personally experimented on several chocolate chip cookie keto recipes I found around the web and sadly have never really attained anything that fully satisfied my sweet tooth. I think the biggest problem is that the sugar substitutes always gave too much of that unpleasant ""cooling"" effect that are a big turn down for me. I have never been fond of Stevia as it always gave a bitter aftertaste, so the next artificial sweetener in line was erythritol. However, as much as this sugar tastes better, that cooling effect is unforgiving in my opinion. Personally, I don't want to be eating chocolate chip cookies and feel as if I am sucking on a mint! I have never messed with xylitol because I have dogs and I have read too many scary stories of dogs ingesting things with this dangerous ingredient in it. Sure, you can store the cookies out of reach, but why risk it? I have baked many keto chocolate chip cookies in the past, but I was never able to attain that nice and soft texture that makes you want to dip your teeth into which to me is the most distinct feature of the traditional chocolate chips cookies I crave. When I used coconut oil in many mixes, the cookies would come too crunchy. I even burned some cookies as they came too thin and couldn't cope with the high temperatures. I was really just about to give up on making my own keto chocolate chip cookies. There were stores selling keto chocolate chip cookies already done after all, so I could make peace and just eat those, but they were always too crunchy for my taste. So after mixing several cookie batters with high hopes, I decided to raise a white flag and stop experimenting. I thought, why keep working so much for something so unsatisfactory? Things changed though when I stumbled upon my first keto yellow cake mix batter. I said why not give this cake a try? The fist time I baked my first keto yellow cake made out of a pre-made mix, I was like: ""Wow!"" Big companies for sure work harder to attain keto foods that taste better than anything you could ever make in the kitchen. "" For sure, they have that strong internal drive of making sales so they must have professionals experiment a whole lot until they reach that perfect concoction that makes them marketable. I had to admit that, this drive to succeed, must be stronger than my personal desire to just make a batch of cookies to satisfy my sweet tooth cravings! The first time I baked my first keto yellow cake, I knew that this would open up a whole world of new recipes to me. How cool is that? So I though to myself, why not try to make keto chocolate chip cookies from this mix and see what happens? The results were A-M-A-Z--I-N-G. I mean amazing to the point that family and friends wanted the recipe and soon my whole neighborhood was baking these beauties. And the best part was when I told them these cookies were not only sugar-free, but keto-friendly too! It was fun watching their jaws drop! I got so many ""really?"" and ""wow!"" I think the ultimate best part of it all was when I discovered that these cookies did, not only taste great, but they turned out being super soft and chewy too! I was like: ""WOW ""this is the best of both worlds! You know like when you find that perfect mix as when tinkering with genetics and your specimen starts winning the first ribbons at shows? No, I am not talking about breeding dogs or horses, I am still talking about chocolate chip cookies! So this recipe is not only to die for, when it comes to us sugar-deprived keto followers, but it is also very simple to make and you'll need only 4 (yes only four!) ingredients. This will therefore likely be the easiest chocolate chip cookie recipe you have ever made! So are you ready to have your kitchen smelling like a cookie shop? Go grab your apron, pre-heat that oven and get ready to make the best keto soft chocolate chip cookies on earth! 15 min 12 min 27 min About 20 cookies Here are some extra details on the ingredients used to make these cookies. It may be helpful to learn more about them so to stay informed! For these soft keto chocolate chip cookies, I used keto yellow cake mix by Duncan Hines. I was a little bit tentative before using this because I wasn't sure how good it would be. The mix is made of almond flour, coconut flour, chicory root fiber, erythritol, cream of tartar, baking soda, modified tapioca starch, salt, xanthan gum, stevia and natural flavor. It packs only 4g net carbs, 21g total carbs, 5 g dietary fiber and 8g sugar alcohol. Warning: As many sugar-free products it mentions that eating large amounts may have a laxative effect so to all the cookie monsters out there, beware of this! I always like to use some type of organic eggs from chickens who are free to range. I have raised chickens before and know for a fact how important it is for them to be able to scratch, peck and move around. Free-range chickens also get too idea a variety of healthy things and having more space makes them less likely to become sick. I also like to use organic olive oil. I know it may sound strange to use a strongly flavored oil such as olive oil in cookies, but the good thing is that you won't taste it once the cookies are baked. The keto world was a sad place before these chips were invented! Before Lily's sugar free chocolate chips invention, I could have forgotten about eating keto chocolate chips. It would have been virtually impossible! So I am very glad that Lily's chocolate chips were invented. Although they may seem expensive, the good news is that a pack lasts long. I am able to make several batches of chocolate chips with this so they last me about a couple of months. Lily's baking chocolate chips are made of Unsweetened Chocolate, Erythritol, Inulin, Stevia Extract, Organic Soy Lecthin, Vanilla. If you are trying to save extra money, consider that several other brand have made sugar-free chocolate chips which cost considerably less, although I haven't had the opportunity to try any of them yet. A cheap one is 365 by Whole Foods Market, Chocolate Chips Dark. You can use really any nut that you like here. I picked cashews because that was what I had at the moment, and things turned out well. I am sure macadamia nuts would be a great option too. This keto chocolate chip cookie was pleading me to be eaten! Start by pre-heating your oven at 350 degrees. It takes a while to pre-heat and you may be surprised that, by the moment your oven is ready (mine beeps when it has reached the selected temperature), you will have finished (or almost finished) preparing your cookies. All you really need as kitchen utensils is a metal bowl, a whisk and a baking sheet lined with some parchment paper. In your metal bowl, place the yellow cake mix, two whole eggs, and the 1/2 cup of olive oil. Mix with your whisk (you may need to use a spoon once the mixture is more dense) and once it's all well mixed, you would then fold in your chocolate chips and chopped cashews. Mix all together ensuring everything is well incorporated and then start making some round balls out of the dough. It doesn't matter how round they are, as they cook, they will spread out into the typical chocolate chip cookie shape. Place the cookies on your baking sheet lined with parchment paper and then place them into the oven once it has reached the temperature of 350 degrees. Baking time is 12 to 15 minutes. You will have to take a look at how they look. In my case, I took them out around 13 minutes because I noticed the bottom was started to color dark. When you take the cookie out, they may look like they aren't cooked very much, but as they're cooling down they settle and that's the secret for their soft and chewy texture! While warm, I tasted one and that's when I felt very happy about the results. I had to have another one and then another one to re-live the experience. I had to stop at three because of the possible laxative effect, but later that evening I managed to eat a fourth, but fortunately didn't have any tummy troubles! I really hoped you enjoyed this soft keto chocolate chip cookies recipe and that you'll be adding it to your keto or low carb recipe box! Pour in a bowl yellow cake mix and 2 whole eggs. Add the 1/2 cup oil Blend in the chopped cashews Blend in the chocolate chips Make balls and place on parchment paper on baking sheet Cook at 350 for 12-15 minutes Allow to cool down and enjoy!

207,No Bake Coconut Carrot Cookies,food," Certified Holistic Wellness & Nutrition Coach Specializing in Autoimmune Health So it's been a minute since my last article. Life has been weird for me over the past year. From moving, to going through a divorce, and enduring medical problems, it has been a crazy year, to say the lease.

210,Lemon Pepper: All You Need to Know,food," Lemon pepper even if you do not use this product you have probably heard of Lemon pepper.  You may have seen this herb in your kitchen cabinet as a child or on the spice rack of older relatives. You may have also heard the terms  Lemon and Pepper and or lemon pepper seasoning and wondered if these were three different spices. The truth is they are one and the same but called by different names depending on where you live. This spice is exactly what the name suggests as it is a dry rub primarily comprised of pepper and lemon. It is used as a food seasoning and is made from granulated lemon zest and cracked black peppercorns. The lemon zest and pepper are mashed together in order to allow the citrus oil from the lemon to infuse into the pepper. This mixture is then baked and dried and can be used on whatever food you like. It is utilized most often on meats and poultry to give the meal extra flavor. It has been used on pasta, in salads, soups, and I love it on snacks like potato chips and popcorn. Originally lemon pepper was used primarily on seafood and it is a staple in salmon. No matter what you call it this product will make every food it is added to taste much better.  A commercial brand of the product Lemon pepper has an inviting look and a combination taste of sweet and zesty and is available on the spice aisle in most stores and you can also purchase organic brands A small bottle can be purchased for as little as $1.00 and as much as $7.00 depending on the brand. This product can also include small amounts of other ingredients such as salt, garlic, onion, cayenne pepper, citric acid, and other spices so always read the label. Durkee and Lowry brands have 13% sodium in each gram but McCormick only has 7%. There is no nutritional value in this product and 0 calories.

These foods are easy to digest and provide energy. The liver uses the resulting fats in the process of detoxification, at the same time, glycogen stores are restored in the muscles. Relying on coconut products as the only source of fat in the diet is not worth it. You can supplement the menu with other unsaturated fats, which are found in avocados, olives, almonds or macadamia. A permanent component of the menu should be fresh or frozen blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries. At the same time, dried berries with added sugar are best avoided (as well as preserves and jams). Substances present in berries normalize the work of the heart, brain, digestive system, are a source of vitamin C, fibre and anti-inflammatory antioxidants. Together, these components help reduce muscle tension and stabilize sugar levels. In addition to using berries to add to porridge, yoghurt, they can be mashed, fruit drinks or consumed as a separate dish.

215,How Many Carbs in a Apple?,food," how many carbs in a apple Many people ask, how many carbs in an apple? The answer depends on the type of apple, as well as whether it’s fresh or cooked, and what part of the apple you’re eating. Here are some examples of carbs in an apple to help you keep track of your carb intake if you’re watching your carbohydrate intake and you want to avoid any sudden spikes. This article will show you how many carbs in an apple and explain how to choose an apple that fits within your carb limit or diet plan. The nutrition facts label is required on all packaged foods and most food manufacturers use it. This information can be found on any packaged food, but you should check to see if there are more details online or at your local library. To learn how to count carbs for weight loss, it's helpful to know exactly what is inside that particular food. If you have questions about whether or not something has carbs in it, look up its nutrition facts label. The information given here will help you get started on your journey toward knowing how many carbs are too many. Here's what it will tell you about fruit sugar content and other nutritional information about apples An apple’s nutrition facts label is similar to any other food’s. In addition to total calories, it will tell you about calories from fat, dietary fiber, and sugar content. Keep in mind that a serving size for apples is only 1 medium piece (3-1/2′′ diameter). If you want to know how many carbs are in one whole apple or ten slices of apple pie, look at the nutrition facts on your food label instead. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that all packaged foods be labeled with nutritional facts, including carbohydrates. These facts are listed in grams on labels under Total Carbohydrates or as net carbs per serving, usually per 100g of product; for instance, 6 grams of carbs is listed as 6 g net carbs or 6 g total carbs. According to MyFitnessPal, one medium apple contains 51.3 grams of carbohydrate (by definition, 4 calories per gram of carb) and only 0.0 grams of fat and protein. For those following a low-carb diet plan, that's not ideal but it's still pretty low on the carbs scale—and remember that fiber is not included in those total carb counts. The best part about apples is their fiber content—one medium apple has 6.9 grams of fiber! Fiber fills you up faster than other kinds of food, making you feel full while eating fewer calories overall. Also, because fiber isn't broken down or absorbed by your body like other carbohydrates are, it doesn't spike your blood sugar levels like other carbs do. An apple contains about 3 grams of net carbs, for a total of 105 calories. Aside from water, apples contain very few carbohydrates. Their fiber content makes up most of their total carbohydrate count. Carbohydrates are essential for our body and energy levels, but some people cut them out to lose weight or maintain it, so knowing how many carbs are in apples can help with that. When you’re trying to limit your carb intake, monitoring these numbers is important to make sure you’re getting enough nutrients while staying within your calorie budget. The simple truth is that there’s no way to accurately calculate how many carbs are in any one apple. Even apples from different locations, seasons and varieties can vary greatly, and some organic apples can be even higher in sugar than conventional apples due to a natural bacterial process (something called rapid fermentation) that occurs when you keep organic apples submerged for several days. The reason we have nutritional information on processed food is because it’s much easier to ensure consistency—all frozen french fries come from basically similar sources and are made with similar ingredients and ratios. Apples aren't like that, so please don't assume what you read online will apply exactly to your fruit bowl at home. DVs are reference numbers that define how many grams of carbohydrate you should eat every day based on your age, gender and activity level. Although there is no DV for carbs, it’s recommended that women aim for 120 grams per day and men aim for 160 grams per day. Additionally, at least half of your daily carbs should come from whole grains. As with other types of food, it’s important to know how many carbs are in specific foods to help you keep your intake under control. The DV of carbs for adults is 130 grams per day. This means you can eat 230 grams (or 130% DV) of carbs daily. If you’re hoping to shed some pounds, eat less than 200 grams (or 120% DV) and see if that results in weight loss. Your goal may be to lose weight or to maintain your current weight; either way, adjust your carb intake so that you’re eating within your calorie budget for fat loss or maintenance. In either case, track your calories and weigh yourself once a week at least; it’s important to be consistent with weight loss goals and not let them drift away from view. Looking to cut down on carbs or get more fiber? Check out how many carbs are in your favorite fruits! Carb counts can vary greatly depending on ripeness, storage, or whether it’s peeled or whole. While bananas and apples are great sources of fiber and carbohydrates, sometimes their carb count can get high if eaten often. On average, there are about 12 grams of total carbohydrates per one medium-sized apple (about 3 inches in diameter). This includes 3 grams of fiber and 5 grams of sugar. The most common type of apple is Pink Lady (which has been known to have as little as 2gms carbs). Other low-carb apples include Granny Smith and Fuji. The chart below breaks down how many carbs are in various fruits, so you can plan your meals and snacks accordingly. Your individual needs may vary depending on your health goals, lifestyle factors and daily activity level. The chart includes approximate calorie content to make it easier for you to plan healthy low-carb meals. A link is also provided to let you know what serving size (i.e., 1 cup diced) of each fruit has—but keep in mind that different fruits have different sized portions, which means calories may vary slightly between servings even if serving sizes remain consistent across all listed fruit options. Consult with your physician or dietitian if you have any questions about planning a low-carb diet that’s right for you. An apple is one of many fruits that you can easily incorporate into your diet. Eating healthy doesn’t mean that you have to give up on dessert or your favorite sweet treat. In fact, some fruits are packed with nutrients and flavor. When trying to add fruit to your diet, consider these details about some of America’s favorite fruits (and which are lowest in carbs). Choosing fresh fruit over pre-packaged options will also ensure that you get all of its nutritional benefits. Here’s a comparison chart of carbs and other nutritional data for popular fruits A medium apple has between 24 and 28 grams of carbohydrates. This comes out to roughly 15 percent of your daily intake for most people. There are also only about 50 calories in each medium apple, which is less than half of your usual recommended amount. In addition, apples provide small amounts of vitamin C and B vitamins. So if you enjoy eating apples and want to continue, feel free to do so; just make sure that you’re accounting for them in your daily caloric intake as well as keeping track of how many calories you eat each day."

222,How to Clean a Mouldy Fridge (Step by Step),food," Hugo Totty is passionate about clothing and lifestyle. I love sharing my experiences about different fashion aspects that I've picked up. Pexels For anyone with a fridge (more or less any modern household), it is easy to neglect your fridge. Most of us only look into our fridges when we are putting goods in, or we are taking something out on the other side. This is very typical because we simply see our fridge as something we use for storage and then for taking items in/out. However, if you use your fridge in this way, it is highly likely that is not being maintained properly. This means that, over time, debris and spillages can build up. This can then lead to the development of mould. Who wants to have a mouldy fridge? Nobody! That is why you need to understand how to clean a mouldy fridge.

Cleaning out that fridge and removing any signs of mould should be something that you have as a high priority.

They are everything mould needs; cold, dark, and very damp indeed. The mould that forms in your fridge runs the risk of contaminating the food products you keep within the fridge. It also stains and damages the fridge, and it can leave a lasting smell that pierces the nose every time you open the fridge. Yuck! More seriously, though, a mouldy fridge can cause some serious health issues for you down the line. The causes of mouldy fridge developments are often down to the fridge itself, and what you keep within it. For example, old food that has been covered up with new products put into the fridge could have gone mouldy. If any of that spills out of the packaging and/or onto the fridge surface, it could grow and start to spread there as well. Therefore, you need to get used to cleaning out your fridge and making sure that you are vigilant about the beginnings of a fusty, mouldy fridge. How can you clean out your mouldy fridge? To get started, you are going to need some of the most common household cleaning appliances that you will require.

Try to take thin and red carrots as it will enhance the taste of the carrot pudding because the natural sweetness of the pudding comes from the carrot.

When you are roasting the dry fruits make sure to add raisins in the last as they will not get burnt and will not give a bitter taste. Make sure you do not leave the halwa or pudding unattended as the milk will get scorched and might get burnt. Make sure to stir in between as it helps to cook and even out properly.

226,How Is It to Be a Vegetarian?,food," Photo author's own How is it to be a vegetarian? Why did you choose to be like that? Is it a complicated lifestyle? When did you choose to be a vegetarian? Those were just a few from a whole lot of more questions received. Four summers ago, I wanted to exclude meat from my menu for only two weeks because I just felt the need. This was the moment when I realized how good I felt without it. Since I started to exclude meat, I discovered multiple vegetables and seeds, and I tried recipes that I would have never eaten before.  I had to overcome the obstacles that I encountered quite often in this journey. Most of the time, many people asked me why I dropped out of meat. In the first week, I had to explain every time they asked those questions, and I had to bring arguments for every person that tried to change my mind. It was simply my opinion and my personal experience, and I didn’t want to influence anyone to do it like me. Many people didn’t want to listen to me and my explanations and continued to sustain their point of view. I can’t say that everyone reacted in the same way. Some people supported me and also asked for more information about vegetarians, regardless of their thoughts about this lifestyle. The start of this journey was difficult, and I was affected by the opinions of others. Also, I learned to stop paying attention to things that weren't good for me and began to focus on myself and my health. It would be hard for me to present to you the multitude of dishes that exist. I can assure you that the internet is full of vegetarian recipes and also full of useful insights that would help you along the way. My focus is on vegetables, fruits, and various seeds. I suggest you take a look on Pinterest as you can discover many delicious recipes. Furthermore, Yazio is also your friend as you can search for different recipes and count the calories and daily intakes. My kitchen is full of jars of seeds, such as chia, flax, pumpkin and sunflower seeds, hemp seeds, but also nuts or almonds, all used in Pinterest and Yazio recipes. As an eloquent example, I like to eat porridge for breakfast and add almonds, nuts, hemp seeds, bananas, sometimes blueberries. Just let me know if you are curious about what I daily eat because I can write another post about food and recipes. This change has been beneficial in many ways. In addition to food, I noticed other positive aspects. I learned to be more careful with what I eat and how to organize my meals accordingly. In the first two months, my skin was brighter, and I started to feel more energetic, more focused, and less tired. I do not know if it is good or bad, but since I adopted this style, I have done medical tests every year to see if my body behaves differently. To me, everything went very well, but as you may know, each body is unique and reacts peculiarly. I am not going to give you information about supplements and other drugs. I will leave that to the professionals. I have also tried to adopt the vegan style for one whole week. When the week was over, I have realized that it didn't suit me. I do not rule it out completely, and maybe I will try this lifestyle again sometime. You know what I'd like to try, but I still haven't given myself enough encouragement? I would like to be able to drink celery juice every morning. At some point, I tried to put raw celery in a salad, but I couldn't get over that taste at all. Have you tried that? I read many books, like the book of Anthony William, that it has extremely many benefits, but I still haven't found the secret of overcoming the taste impediment. Immediately after this change, I started doing more sport, and it does not pass a day without exercise, even if it means a 30-minute walk. And I also learned the importance of water: at least 2 liters a day could make miracles. Now, when I don't drink enough water, my body notifies me. Lastly, I started practicing yoga, and it works well for me. The sport, hydration, and food are all connected, and it would be ideal to have such a balance. At the end of the day, all that matters is that you are comfortable with who you are and what you did along the way. I suggest you take care of yourself and choose what fits you best. Don't listen to people that are not entitled to give you orders or who just want you to be like them and do what they do. Just be you and choose the lifestyle that suits you, not one that others would like. © 2022 Diana"
227,5 Healthy Foods That Are Not so Healthy,food," Fredda Branyon has dedicated her life to the advancement of complementary medicine. 5 Foods You Should Never Eat Our daily choices can profoundly affect our lives, and this is especially true when it comes to what we eat. There's no denying that eating pizzas, burgers, and french fries regularly is probably not the best thing to do— but what about the healthier foods?  In addition to the type of food we eat, nutritionists recommend that we examine the nutritional content of the food we consume which may be doing much more damage than expected. Here are five healthy foods you might want to take another look at.  Artificial Sweeteners The motivation to substitute natural sweeteners for artificial sweeteners can be for the right reasons, but it actually does more harm than good. The sweetness of artificial sweeteners, especially non-nutritive sweeteners, is far greater than that of sugar and high-fructose corn syrup.  Because it is considered a healthier alternative to regular table sugar, we trick ourselves into thinking we can have more of it, which overstimulates our sugar receptors and causes us to have an increased tolerance for sweetness.  You can indulge your sweet tooth by eating whole fruits. These foods tend to be highly nutritious, nutrient-dense, high in fiber, and low glycemic load.  Margarine Here is an end to the old debate between butter and margarine. For those with heart diseases, it's recommended to use margarine sparingly over butter. However, not all margarine is created equal. Some types of margarine contain trans fat, which increases blood cholesterol levels and raises the risk of heart disease, similar to saturated fat.  When looking for an alternative spread, try to limit saturated fats intake and avoid trans fats altogether. Choosing margarine that is low in saturated fats, high in unsaturated fats, and is free from trans fat is okay to consume moderately.  Soy Protein Isolate Soy protein isolates, a highly-processed form of soy, are commonly found in processed grocery items such as protein powders and nutrition bars. They may contain estrogen-like organic compounds called soy isoflavones that can cause adverse effects to your health. High estrogen levels have been linked to breast cancer, infertility, and thyroid cancer.  Tofu, edamame, and soy milk are all whole soy foods that can be consumed in moderation.  Diet Food Choosing healthier alternatives for food often involves looking for phrases such as no cholesterol, no trans fat, no added sugar, multigrain, organic, all-natural and so many more. Foods labeled as ""diet"" or ""low fat"" don't necessarily mean they're low-calorie. Experts note that even nutritious foods can often contain unhealthy components.  Many of us consume this type of food because we assume it won't harm our health since it's considered a ""healthy"" choice. Unfortunately, such foods often contain unhealthy fillers like sugar and salt to have a more appealing taste.  Processed Frozen Meals When you're pressed for time, frozen meals are a convenient way to get dinner on the table. However, processed foods contain far more sodium and fat to enhance taste and maintain longer shelf life compared to fresh foods. Moreover, low-quality ingredients can also conceal the nutritional value to a large extent, which is why it's not as good as one would expect.  Fortunately, there are still some healthy frozen options that nutritionists recommend. Just check the nutritional content to find what works best for you.  In the end, it’s good to be aware of the fact that labels on the front of the food packaging don’t necessarily mean what you think they mean. Now that you are aware of what you should look into, you can be sure to make healthy choices when shopping for your favorite foods. The next time you find yourself picking up that “healthy” low-fat yogurt, take a second to look at the nutritional contents. You may just be surprised by what you find."

234,Grocery Store Curbside Pickup Pros & Cons,food," Grocery shopping used to be done only in the store. Nowadays, you can choose to shop online and pickup your groceries or have them delivered. These services are becoming more popular. When deciding on whether or not to use a grocery store pickup service, here are a few things to consider. Pros: * You can browse online grocery store aisles online without having to push a cart. No more perusing busy aisles filled with people pushing their carts. Shopping online offers the privacy of shopping in your own home at your own pace. * There are digital coupons on most grocery store websites. These coupons will allow you to use the coupons online for discounts. * This service may be especially helpful for those who find it difficult to shop in store due to medical conditions or having small children. * You can shop for your groceries, pull your car up into a designated parking area and a grocery store associate will bring your groceries to you. Some may even help you load them into your car. * This service is usually less expensive than using grocery home delivery services. There is a fee for curbside pickup at some grocery stores but sometimes it is waived if you spend a certain amount of money on particular products. * Although you do have to wait in your car to receive your groceries, you no longer have to wait in grocery store lines to checkout. Cons: * You may have to check all of your groceries to make sure that you received your entire order. Sometimes the store associate may accidentally leave some of your groceries behind and forget to bring them out to you. If you do not check your groceries, there is a chance you could get home and discover that there are multiple items missing. * There may be a fee involved. Some grocery stores charge a fee for curbside pickup. The fee may be small but can add up if you shop for groceries frequently. * You are not physically shopping for your items, so you cannot tell how ripe a fruit or vegetable is. You can not see the items and check the expiration dates, therefore you may get items that are expired. * You may miss out on the the social aspect of shopping. If you like socializing with other shoppers and/or the cashier, then you will miss out on those social interactions. On the other hand, some people may try to avoid being around people, so in that case, this service could be helpful to them.    As I mentioned earlier, grocery store pickup may be especially helpful for those who have medical conditions that make it hard to shop in the store. There are also people who work a lot of hours and/or have small children and do not have the time to do a big shopping trip. Overall, I think that grocery store pickup can be helpful and that the pros would outweigh the cons in these situations. Here are a few questions you may have about using grocery pickup services. These are questions people have asked me and I have provided the answers. Q: How can I get free grocery store pickup without having to a pay the fee?A: Some grocery stores offer promotions, such as spend $25 on select productsand your fee will be waived. Q: What do I do when I get to the store? How will the store know that I am there?A: There will be specific parking areas that are designated for grocery pickup. There is a phone number on the sign where you parked. When you call that number, tell them which assigned number you are parked at and they will bring your groceries to your car. Q: Do I have to tip the store associate who brings me my groceries?A: Depending on store polices, that would be up to you. If you have a large order, then it would be kind to give a tip. It doesn't have to be a lot but any amount would be nice. Q: How will I get my grocery receipts? A: The store associate will usually hand you your receipt or place it in one of your bags. They might also include a paper that breaks down all out of stock items as well items that were substituted in your order. Q: Can I still use paper coupons?A: Some stores will allow you to use paper coupons but there are digital coupons online. So they may not be able to be doubled if using both paper and digital coupons. Q: Do I have to get out of the car?A: Not always, it depends on store policy. At some stores, you can just pop the trunk and the store associate will load the groceries into it."

237,"If You Want to Understand Russian Culture, Start by Trying Their Food",food," Tina is a bilingual writer of unconventional fiction, a media graduate with a special focus on human sexuality and a content writer. This is a long time ago and far from the stereotyping of potato eating and vodka drinking Russians too many associate this huge country with today. Numerous cultures have affected Russian food culture, and therefore Russian food is not strictly Russian. Everyday Russian food of today doesn’t differ much from other cultures, yet there is something distinctively different with food from this vast country. As Western culture dominates the world, we read the Russian menu as we do our own, and therefore we don’t give Russian cuisine justice. Beef Stroganoff and borsch are probably the food some people can mention when it comes to Russian cuisine, but there are much more. Russian food, which is both nourishing and tasty, hasn’t made a name for itself in the same ways as some other countries. Due to Western cultural dominance, our view of what constitutes high cuisine has become narrower. We look at other people’s food culture from the standpoint of our own instead of trying to immerse ourselves fully; we tend to judge and say yuk and ugh to the food, forgetting that we’re also saying yuk and ugh to the culture. We become what we eat, but we eat what there is to eat, and for Russians, it’s different from the Western food culture. Even if one doesn’t speak Russian, there are no language barriers at the table and when eating. Russian food during the 19th century was inspired by, amongst others, German, French and Scandinavian cooking. In 1891, a French chef won a cooking contest in St Petersburg with his dish beef Stroganov which became a sensation, both in Russia and later in China and eventually America. The Germans and Scandinavians inspired the Zakuski table, the buffet-style eating favoured by Scandinavians, and the Caucasians introduced shashlik (grilled and skewered pieces of meat, a Russian version of shish kebab, but today all of them count as traditional Russian dishes. When we look at Russian food culture at this time, we have to look at haute cuisine and the food of the serf as two separate entities. One cannot identify with the other. The Russian serfs were freed in the mid-1800s, which changed the agricultural and political landscape of Russia. Elena Molokhovets writes her classic guide for household management, Gift to Young Housewives, containing more than a thousand recipes for the Russian elite. It was the most popular book in the 19th and early 20th centuries. During the Soviet era, quantity over quality squelched the gastronomic spirit, but people had food and could meet the basic nutritional standard. Food is a central part of our lives and very powerful, not just because we can’t survive without food, but what we eat forms part of our identity. All people have at least one if not a few dishes that bring them back to either their childhood, their birth country or a nice memory. Food nourishes us, but food is also a pleasure. We use food to communicate and in Russia, eating traditional food is a sign of belonging to Russia. Russian food has undergone several stages of evolution, from the old Russia in the 9th century to old Moscow cuisine in the 17th century to the cuisine of the Tsars to St Petersburg cuisine to the Soviet era to the present day. Nikolai Gogol was a Russian dramatist who satirised the food obsession in his short stories. ”…caused him to catch also the attractive odour of something fried in fat.” “Chichikov looked up and saw that the table was spread with mushrooms, pies and other viands.” “And also a few pancakes?” suggested Madame. For an answer, Chichikov folded three together and, having dipped them in melted butter, consigned the lot to his mouth.” Even during the Soviet era’s atheism, both Christian and non-Christian people celebrated Easter as it’s considered the most sacred of holidays. The religious meaning of Easter was downplayed during the Soviet era, but state bakeries made kulich which is a traditional coffee cake type bread. Easter food also consists of eggs that are intrinsically decorated and paskha, a sweet cheese spread. The world-famous Fabergé eggs come from the Russian tradition of giving eggs as gifts at Easter. The eggs were mostly made from chocolate but also wooden, carved and painted eggs. The Fabergé eggs were made as gifts to the Tsar family from 1895 to 1916. The Easter table is also laden with meat and vegetable dishes, and a standard meal begins with zakuski, which is a Slavic term for hot and cold buffet type food, and vodka and concludes with kulich and paskha. Food is often our first introduction to a new culture and one of the most enduring aspects of culture. Russia is such a vast country, and the influences have come from both far and near but to talk about Russian food is also to speak about Eurasia. Russia has always had a special skill in adopting food and cooking methods from other cultures and incorporating them as their own. Russians eat big meals, and when they have guests, they are known for their hospitality with an abundance of food on the table. Russian food is colourful; fragrant borshch with smetana (sour cream), thin pancakes with red caviar, the ever-present pirogi, rasstegai with savoury fillings of meat, fish, mushroom, cabbage or potatoes or sweet fillings like plums, apple berries, honey and nuts. On the celebratory table, one can also find kulebyaka, which is Russian fish pie, usually salmon but other fish as well as rice, mushrooms, hardboiled eggs with onion and dill is used and baked in pastry like a loaf of bread. All this food creates a colourful table which is irresistible both to admire for the edible art that it is and for the pleasure to eat this feast in the company of family and friends. Half of Russia’s farmland is taken up by grain production. Potatoes are widely grown, and cucumber, tomatoes, cabbage and carrots are the most common vegetable. Sugar beets thrive in the fertile soil of Russia. Flax, sunflowers, and soybeans are used for oil. Russian people also harvest what’s given for free in the vast forests of this fertile land. Foraging for mushrooms and berries is a contemplative activity, almost like meditation. Picking mushrooms is an exciting discovery trip for children and adults alike. For Russians, mushroom and berry picking is deeply rooted in tradition, allowing families to supplement for the winter. Russians don’t eat so much processed food; instead, they eat what’s in season and also preserve natural food for all-year-round consumption. Of course, the food scene has changed from the Soviet era to the present time, and it’s especially notable in the wide variety of food available to Russians living in cities. Preservation of food by pickling is common, pickled cabbage, garlic, cucumbers, aubergines and tomatoes. Drying is used to preserve apples, pears, mushrooms, lemon and orange peel, cherries. Preservation of food is an all-year-round activity. The word for being hospitable is “one who gives bread and salt”. Bread and salt denotes a warm welcome and is also a sign of respect for the guest. It’s a sign that the host is happy to have guests. Salt has throughout world history been an extremely valuable commodity, and one of the earliest industries on Russian territory was salt production around the second millennium. Some cities in Russia have the Russian name for salt “sol” in their name, for example, Solvychegodsk. The three meals of the day in Russia are zavtrak, obed, and uzhin. At zavtrak (breakfast), Russian people eat kasha which is a type of porridge made from different grains, butterbrots which is a sandwich but with only one slice of bread with one topping, either butter or ham, boiled egg or tvorog, which is similar to cottage cheese. Coffee and tea are, like for so many people around the world, essential drinks for Russian people. Of course, Russians also eat toast and cereal. Some Russians eat a large breakfast which can include meat, porridge, fish, chicken and some might just have fruit while others favour coffee and a cigarette, nothing else. Meal patterns have also changed since the Soviet era; people working far from home don’t have the time to cook during the week. They bring food from home to eat at work, and while many bring homemade food like potatoes, vegetables and meat, some also bring sandwiches which is not traditionally eaten in Russia. For starters, there is soup or pancakes with caviar and herring, pickled vegetables like marinated mushrooms and even marinated cauliflower and a salad of tomatoes and cucumber with sour cream. Russians are very fond of sour cream. Sour is not a good translation; Russians would say it has a slight tang, and it’s thicker than cream and is as good for sweet things and savoury food like soup. An alternative to Smetana is to sour fresh cream with lemon juice and leave it to thicken, but this is always second best. Obed, which is the main meal, consists of baked, fried, boiled and roasted meat and fish, pies, minced meat and potatoes. The third part of a meal is the drink which is either compote, kvass or beer. The last meal, uzhin is either dinner or supper and consists of much the same as the lunch. With all three meals, Russians like to eat bread, especially rye bread. Russians have a fondness for rye bread, which is also known as black bread because it’s dark. Rye bread is a staple food and traditional food and is one of the absolute must-try of Russian cuisine. This loved rye bread is also used to make another traditional food, kvass, a fermented beverage drunk with most meals. Kvass has a very low alcohol content, only 1%, so people of all ages enjoy this drink. Kvass is a fizzy drink and is best cold. Kvass, in turn, is also used as an ingredient in a traditional yoghurt based cold soup called okroshka. Most people associate vodka with Russia, but it’s not an everyday drink; instead, it’s usually drunk on holidays and celebratory occasions with family and friends. Peter the Great brought back coffee to Russia at the beginning of the 18th century after visiting Holland, but it has never gained the same popularity as tea, but it’s widely available. One of the biggest events of the year for Russian people is the Novy God or New Year and apart from all the gifts, singing and dancing there is the food, and today a Novy God feast would definitely have at least one beet and potato salad with ham or fish and a vinegret salad (beetroot salad) as well as a variety of pickled vegetables like mushrooms, cucumbers, peppers and tomatoes. There is also pickled herring, some arranged on platters with slices of onion. Plates of cut salami and thick slices of cheese, eggplant with garlic mash, caviar piled on bread with butter, various pies puffed up for the occasion. Stuffed peppers with cream sauce, baked chicken with mash potatoes and stuffed cabbage rolls and also bowls with fresh Smetana and both dill and parsley. There is wine, vodka, berry juice and compote to drink while wishing each other to take the best from the old year into the new. For dessert, there can be a pancake cake, and also fresh fruit. Food is also widely used in Russian art because of the powerful role it has played, especially during the Soviet era but has been used since the times of Old Russia. With long periods of shortage and even starvation, food represents more than nutrition and the ability to feed oneself. Cucumbers and scallions are spring signs, bananas exotic and strawberries a seasonal food. Pineapple, oranges and other exotic fruits were associated with white-sailed dreams crossing blue seas to places that were both different and wonderful. A full fridge is more important than crystals and fine art to many Russians, and to show extraordinary hospitality, a Russian would show off top-quality food in the form of expensive caviar, smoked fish, foreign cheeses and imported sausages. Russian salad with fish and beetroot and other vegs, dressed in mayonnaise and topped with eggs. Usually eaten at celebratory events. The act of eating, of stilling hunger, is an act of pleasure, sensitivity and sensuality, but Russians also ascribe health benefits to many different foods; butter is good for eyesight and dill for dyspepsia, honey for flatulence. Respiratory infections can be treated with gogomul, which is a mixture of egg yolk, sugar, milk and baking soda. Kvass is believed to be good for digestion and is also used to cure hangovers. Flavoured vodka is used to cure anything from the common cold to stomach bugs. Full hearty meals are considered important for maintaining good health. Russian food is more than food; it’s a sign of hospitality, social status and even religious belonging. Food forms part of our identity, and it’s certainly true when it comes to Russia. Despite borrowing heavily from other cultures, Russian food is distinctively Russian due to some very characteristic features: an abundance of food at celebratory mealtimes, the diversity of starters, bread with every meal, pancakes for dessert, a large variety of fish and mushrooms and lots of sweets for afters in the form of cookies and cakes. Lack of food and starvation has given Russians an obsessive relationship with food. Russians do eat Western food too, but traditional food is more important; it’s part of their identity. To understand Russian culture, one has to like Russian culture and what better way to start than with food.

243,Ahi Tuna - Breaded and Deep Fried,food," Ok. Deep Fried. First bite. Flavorful. Not flaky like regular fish. More firm, like chicken. Or frog, or even alligator. Yummy! I use this fry magic on a lot of things. I had to shake it and get the dried chunks out. Some smashed flat. Like panning for gold, or getting chunks out of cat litter. (This is where we giggle together)  I cut the two steaks into cubes. Got them damp with some water. Put them in the fry magic. Shook the box to coat them well. Dipped them in egg. Then, recoated the coated pieces with crackers. Then, placed them in the deep fryer. Incidentally, it took 14 minutes for the fryer to reach a ready state. Same amount of time it took to fully coat the tuna. Then, 5 minutes in fryer. See how the initial frying sets (cooks) the coating around the piece of tuna?"
244,Spatulalove - I Got it Bad,food," I had a red spatula and I abused it and the end ripped off. I think I was digging the last drop from a can with that can opener razer sharp edge. Well. Sigh. That, was the end of my red spatula. The red spatula was one piece. Heat resistant. It transcooked as a wooden spoon...because it was firm enough to stir. For a while, I transitioned to a flat wooden scraper, but that snapped in half as well. Of course, when I saw this package at Walmart, I was thrilled. And tossed it in my cart. When I took the spatulas from the pack, I noticed advertising on the package. Yes. Advertising. Blatant self promotion. Curious, I started looking at the url. Facebook page. Snapchat. I don't know what the third icon meant. Round square with a circle in it, with a dot in the upper corner. (I shrug my shoulders)  I did go to their Facebook page. Scrolled down. Watched a few videos. I notice my son has been here and has liked the page. Cool. I haven't used them yet. Going to wash them first. But, my life has meaning again. Cheers!"
245,Smelt Frying - it's Little Fish,food," Years ago, there were smelt fry's. It seems like a long, long time ago, but truly, probably just five years ago. Although, smelt fry's used to be a thing. Now, I guess I have to fry my own. Fair enough.     I decided to keep them frozen. I prepared my three bowls. Bowl one contains a fry magic coating mix. Bowl two contains a raw egg with some water. Bowl three has some finely chopped oyster soup crackers. Put the frozen smelt in a container. Fill container with water. Coat wet smelt with fry coating mix, then coat with wet egg, then roll in crackers. Deep fry four minutes, frying until a dark brown color."
246,Cheaper Ways to Get the Equipment You Need for Your Restaurant's Kitchen,food," You may think that the best way to get high-quality cooking supplies is to go straight to the manufacturer and buy directly from them, or to buy from the most name-brand, top-quality manufacturers out there. This might be true in some cases, mainly for specialty equipment that other companies just simply don’t make, but for everything else there are plenty of other, cheaper, options to choose from. Here are cheaper ways to get the equipment you need for your restaurant's kitchen. The first option is to buy used restaurant equipment. You may be hesitant about buying used equipment, but keep in mind that it's often as good as new if you wipe it down and clean it thoroughly after purchase. If you don't like the idea of buying used appliances, look for second-hand equipment such as used stainless steel three door commercial freezer in local ads or online. You may be able to find a good deal on a great piece of equipment that's just been replaced by a newer model. The best way to save money on new restaurant appliances is to buy from other restaurants. Look for local restaurants that are closing down or restaurants that have been renovated and no longer need certain appliances. You might be able to get a deal if the restaurant is upgrading its equipment. If you're just starting up your new restaurant, consider renting instead of buying. While it's important to own your equipment to establish your business, you should consider the long-term. Buying new equipment means that parts may need to be replaced or repaired soon after opening. If you rent, you'll only have to worry about buying replacement parts when it's necessary. You can always buy the equipment you need later on after you’re more established. If you're planning to buy used commercial kitchen equipment, make sure it's not too old. Check the equipment carefully and ask about its history to ensure it has been well kept up because older appliances aren't always reliable. You may have better luck buying new restaurant equipment. You can find some of the best deals for commercial kitchen appliances online. Use websites, such as Craigslist or Amazon, to search for used equipment. You may have trouble shipping large items, but you should be able to find good deals on some smaller pieces of equipment. If you're planning a larger purchase, it's a good idea to check out manufacturer websites and wholesale supply sites. You may be able to get a discount for buying in bulk.  By following these tips, you should find the equipment you need for your restaurant without spending too much money. While it's important to have quality appliances in your kitchen, they don't have to be brand new or expensive. Take a look at what's available and use this guide to save money on cooking supplies."
247,7 Ways You Can Grow Your Food Truck Business,food," Mohammad Khan Yusufzai is Masters in Management, specializing in Economics, Finance and Marketing, with corporate & lectureship exp. Advanced automation software such as OnlineCheckWriter.com can help your food truck business to grow and capitalize the greatest share of industry profits. Did you know that the US mobile food industry was worth 1.24 billion during 2020? While the figure has gone down slightly from last year, food trucks continue to be the profitable and solid business model. However, you will need to strategize if you want to be as profitable as possible. It does not matter if you already own a food truck or planning to launch a new one. These tips will surely help you to get new customers and bring in more revenue for your food truck. So, let's dig-in into them one-by-one: As a food truck owner what's the most important thing for you? Making money... right?.. But equally important is the concept of your food truck. A strong unique food truck concept, not only encourages remembrance but will also increase the publicity by word of mouth. Your food truck is a brand in itself!! If you are planning to start a food truck, do look for a food truck for sale in your locality. Have it customized as per your theme. If you already own a food truck, make sure it highlights the concept of your business. So, what does it mean to have a strong concept? Your food truck ought to have a solid plan, a clever but easy-to-remember name and a well-thought menu that resonates with your brand. For instance, take ‘Grilled Cheeserie’ of Nashville, Tennessee. Their name, their truck and their tagline, all resonate with the theme of their business. Their menu has a lot of speciality offerings such as the B&B of Tennessee and the Pimento Mac & Cheese. The goal is to create a buzz and get a lot of people to talk about your truck. Food is one industry where going against the common practices might help you make more money and carve out a niche for your food truck. If your city is filled with endless carts serving hot dogs and sandwiches, then that’s the exact thing you shouldn’t be serving. This is, more or less, the story of ‘The Halal Guys’. They started with a hot dog cart in NYC. However, to them, the hot dog was not a satisfying meal. So they switched to a menu of chicken, gyro meat, rice, and pita. Currently, they are one of the most famous food trucks in the US, with their franchises in California, New Jersey, Connecticut, Virginia and other major cities. They also have an international presence in Canada, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. Mobile phones are highly relevant in the food and restaurant industry. The same is applicable for food trucks. There are a lot of things that you should keep in mind to make your food truck business mobile-friendly. Make sure your food truck is listed on popular local websites and apps. Your website should be optimized for mobile phone screens. You can even try to make an app for your food truck. Your customers should be able to place an order and pay through mobile. If you haven’t considered food delivery yet, then give considerable thought to it. Finally, to never miss on any opportunity, give a seamless payment experience to your customers. Online Check Writer is the most popular cloud-based software for small and medium businesses across the USA. It has all the features that a business needs, such as unlimited check printing, ACH payments, Accounts receivable management, Invoicing, Payroll Processing, automatic bill payment, and a lot more. 59% of customers are more likely to purchase an item if it is ‘seasonal’. Tried and tested items are good if you want to operate within your domain. But you must improvise as per the need of customers. Being seasonal is not only limited to offering dishes made out of seasonal produce. For example: your truck can offer hot cocoa during winters. Similarly, offer chilled desserts or iced drinks in the summers. Varying your menu seasonally means bringing in more customers and making more money during different seasons. Your loyal customer base would also stick to your food truck if they are craving something seasonal. Additionally, it also gives out a message that you are committed to serving your customers. Your mouth-watering servings also contain fresh and healthy produce. Having a sales funnel in place is a sure way to get steady cash flow. You can create this sales funnel by building a relationship with other businesses and offices. For implementing this idea: You should consider visiting nearby offices and dropping off your menu there.You can also try giving out free samples. Partner with these offices by offering lunchtime meals with delivery. This will help spread the word about your food truck to the locals. It will also allow you to embed yourself into the lunchtime culture of various businesses. Make sure you take advantage of the latest office catering trend. Speaking of catering, food trucks around the nation are offering services for corporate events, weddings, and parties, as an alternative to an old-fashioned buffet or sit-down catered meal. Food truck weddings are most popular! They offer a unique and less expensive alternative. Purely from a consumer standpoint, the cost per person of a food truck wedding is $25-50, as compared to the $70 average of a sit-down event. Food truck parks are the best way to directly engage with your target audience. It’s a sure way to bring money and promote your business without needing the efforts to do anything radical. Similarly, food truck festivals are a great way to make your brand visible. You will reach out to a lot of hungry diners that are enthusiastic to try new flavors and dishes. The world’s largest food truck rally in St. Petersburg gathers more than 200 food trucks from across the USA. You can also attend local festivals and fairs. This way you’ll be maximizing your visibility and positioning your food truck where crowds of hungry diners will be congregated. But don’t just barge into the festival scene without any homework. If you don’t plan thoroughly it may result in wasting your time and money. You may be required to pay a fee before selling at a fair. Make sure you know everything beforehand. There’s hardly any industry where the importance of social media is not prevalent. Social media marketing is recommended everywhere, for all businesses. It is all the more important for the food truck industry, given its fast-paced nature. Therefore you need to have a strong social media presence. Update your Instagram pages regularly with the products you are offering and the forthcoming places you are planning to visit. Always make sure you engage your audience with social media rather than trying to push your offering like a salesman!

250,Crispy Butterfly Shrimps,food," As i am a home maker, I always keep trying new snack recipes for my family & when they turn out yummy I share those recipes with my readers. Butterfly shrimps is a starter and snacks recipes. Butterfly is created by making a slit on the front or back of shrimps. Shrimp is high in protein, low in calories, carbs and fat. Shrimp is rich in selenium, choline and vitaminB12. Shrimp contain antioxidants which reduces inflammation and oxidative damage. With all these benefits, shrimp is a great food to include in our diet. 20 min 10 min 30 min Serves four people Clean and wash all the shrimps properly. Butterfly the shrimp by running a knife lengthwise more than halfway through the back or front of the shrimp. Gently open the cut to form a butterfly-like figure. Remove the veins with the help of a toothpick. Season the shrimps with salt, red chilli powder, garlic powder and lemon juice. Apply the seasoning over the shrimps gently. Prepare the flour mixture by adding salt, red chilli flakes and black pepper powder to the flour. Add some cold water to the beaten eggs. Take some breadcrumbs for coating as well. Now, dredge the shrimp in the flour mixture and then dip it in the egg mixture. Coat it with the breadcrumbs. And repeat the same to double coat. Coat all the shrimps in the same way. Keep all the coated butterfly shrimps in the freezer for minimum 30 minutes. Heat oil to deep fry the shrimps. Fry them until they turn golden brown. Once they are golden brown, remove on an absorbent paper. Serve them with tomato ketchup or mayonnaise or any of your favourite dip. You can freeze them for a month and consume whenever you wish. You can increase or decrease amount of all the seasonings as per your taste. You can skip double coating, as it is time consuming. But it you want that crispiness in your starter, then don’t omit the double coating. © 2022 Rozlin"
251,How to Eat for Free or Obscenely Cheap Year-Round,food," Jonathan has been writing since 1995 about various topics, from movie reviews, works of fiction and media commentaries to Bible sermons. Every year at certain times articles pop up everywhere about deals associated with a given date or holiday, but did you know that many of these deals are not exclusive to these days, and that there are many other ways to get savings? Let's get the rundown on how you can eat for free or incredibly cheap any time you want to. (Please keep in mind that while everything in this article is true at the time of writing, promotions can change and policies can be retracted at the discretion of the listed restaurants.) The first thing to take note of is that if you aren't using apps to order your fast food at this point in the twenty-first century, you aren't doing it right. Besides being able to take your time browsing a visual menu without rushing because someone's waiting behind you in line, and besides the convenience of saving your payment method to your account for quick checkout (which ideally should be a cash-back credit card with extra points for restaurants) the vast majority of fast food apps have a points program whereby you earn points for every dollar you spend, adding up to free food. Now that we've got that down, let's look at a few specific chains and their deals. I typically wouldn't recommend going to Dunkin Donuts on a regular basis due to their generally higher prices, but if you do prefer them then keep an eye out for bonuses to their normal points program, which can speed you along the way to free drinks, with no restrictions on size or type. Sometimes the promotion will be double points for a specific purchase, but sometimes you can buy the cheapest item on the menu such as a few munchkins and get enough for a free drink after three visits. It varies by promotion so it's always good to keep an eye on it and buy accordingly, especially if you are a regular customer anyway. Even if you aren't, it doesn't hurt to sign up for an account as you will still receive one free drink a year for your birthday. The Wendy's app has it's point redemption under the Rewards tab, and right next to it you'll find the Deals section which contains regularly updated coupons that can be used at the window or applied to your in-app order. There are buy one get one free deluxe sandwiches, as well as frequent rotating drinks, nuggets, regular fries and deluxe fries with toppings free with any purchase. That's right, any purchase with no minimum. But the deal gets sweeter. If you get a standard hamburger which is one of the cheapest items on the menu, you can customize the ingredients manually, and Wendy's is currently the only fast food restaurant that let's you add lettuce and tomato at no extra charge (besides an assortment of various sauces). That means you can get what basically is a deluxe sandwich loaded with lettuce and tomato along with a side for a little over a dollar, and if you're a senior, depending on your participating local Wendy's and their definition of senior, you can make it a whole meal by asking for a senior drink, which is a small soda or coffee free of charge. Oh and one more thing: Don't forget to add extra onions to your sandwich if you like them, because they come at no extra charge at all the hamburger chains on this list. All year round you'll find plenty of buy one get one deals as well as premium items priced at a buck or free with any purchase. Occasionally there will also be seasonal deals such as a holiday calendar that offers different items free with purchase every day. McDonald's also has the cheapest soft drinks of the bunch, offering any size for a dollar. This can be a great item to pair with a ""free with any purchase"" offer, as well as milk which is also one dollar. As many restaurants are in the process of doing, the dollar menu is largely done away with. However there is still a value menu which periodically will get revamped with, if not a dollar, still good value items. In the app you also have the option to change ingredients in your tacos, and while some add to the price, some don't but make it healthier. For instance, selecting fresco style replaces fattening toppings like cheese sauce with diced tomatoes, and ground beef can also be replaced with whole black beans, which are typically only offered in premium menu items. Besides the standard points, there are frequent promotions year-round tied in with sports events or other days that will offer free or sharply discounted premium items with any purchase. Another recent promotion Taco Bell recently offered was with the purchase of gift cards, which can be reloaded right back onto your account as a payment method. The offer gave any free combo with a twenty-five dollar gift card (and combos can cost up to around twelve dollars and include multiple premium items and a drink). When using the gift card through the app points are also earned on top of this, resulting in several free premium tacos such as the Chalupa Supreme, and combined with the original offer almost equaling the original gift card and doubling its' value. While these types of promotions will likely change each time they are offered, it's always good to keep an eye on them to see if they're worth it. Besides points the Burger King app offers rotating coupons with things such as half priced large combo meals, or even meals for two people with drinks, sandwiches and sides for five or six bucks. Whopper Wednesdays continue to offer the large sandwich for typically two or three dollars, but sometimes only one dollar, and the Whopper Jr. also frequently has a coupon to get it for only a dollar and fifty cents. There are also usually deals associated with new menu items when they become available, as well as frequent availability of large onion rings, fries, cheesy tots and drinks for a dollar. Another trend being tried recently are restaurant subscription services. For $8.99 per month, Panera Bread's Panera Plus, which has been renamed to the less-streaming-service-sounding yet quite a mouthful Panera Unlimited Sip Club Subscription, offers daily coffee or hot tea with free refills, but other premium drinks are not included. Not to be outdone, Circle K introduced Sip and Save, which for only $5.99 per month offers not only standard coffee and soda of any size but also frozen drinks, iced drinks, seasonal flavored warm drinks, hot chocolate and coffee beans ground fresh for every cup. If you sign up for their text alerts you'll also be kept up with seasonal events that give free daily or almost daily items during the promotion period. Meanwhile Taco Bell is spearheading the food variant of these plans, offering a daily soft or crunchy taco, even including costlier ones such as the Doritos Locos Supreme, for only ten dollars per month. So if eating out is something you're gonna do anyway, you might as well get with the program and take advantage of the various competing promotions that are out there. Your wallet will thank you!

Sex Drive 'Unripe plantain helps boost sexual performance, reduces impotency, unsatisfactory erection, and also increased sex drive'.-Lilori Titilayo. I grew up eating organic or natural foods, primarily fruits, and vegetables. Mangoes, oranges, carrots, dessert bananas and figs, grapes, and guavas. As a teenager, mangoes and guavas seems to be my favorite fruits. Eating mangoes helps me put on weight. But I began to notice the effects of guava on my reproductive system when I was between 13 to 15 years. The effects were significant because I would struggle between urinating and ejaculating when nature calls. I notice enormous think semen block my prepuce. But here I'll concentrate on my topic plantain enhancing sexual health. Pexels My mother a textile merchant and trader in general goods later change gear to become a trader in forest products. Plantain plus dessert bananas are a few of the tropical forest fruits she bought for sale. I had the privilege to cook, fry, or roast the green plantain for either breakfast or supper. Semi-ripe plantains I barbecue for afternoon snacks. The green plantain I cooked with mullet or sardines, and savour with sweet basil.Soon, my body began to absorb the meal well. As I regularly eat it in any form, I experienced changes in my reproductive organs in my late teens. I began to experience vital and frequent nocturnal emissions or seminal emissions during exams when time's up. Conscious of the fact that these emissions are due to the foodstuff I eat, I make notes of any special meal I ate in the day or night time. The plantain surpasses yams, potatoes, rice, bean, and bread.The wet dreams rarely occurred if I ate the above-mentioned last five foods. Should emissions happen, it was on a very small scale and insignificant. And should I eat the green stuff for two consequent days, I had my trouser or pant wet with semen. I continued to experiment with both the ripe and unripe plantains. The volume of sperms I ejaculated during my wet dreams or if I'm stressed during an exam period increased tremendously. The more I ate the plantain fruit regularly in the week, the more my semen production increased. I soon began my research into the question in later years to verify my experience with reproductive health. The plantain is a tropical, sub-tropical, Caribbean, and Asiatic food. The way each nation and locality prepared the cooking plantain varied greatly with specific names. Here's not the place for that talk. Reproductive health is my concern.I boiled my plantain for 20 minutes, thereby preserving 70% of phytonutrients including vitamins that are liable to be destroyed by much heat.In the next talk, I show you how I cooked my unripe plantain for either breakfast or launch. Here are the few ingredients you need: 1. 2 or 3 fingers matured green plantain fruit.2. 1/2 teaspoon dried chili powder.3. Red palm oil or substitute.4. Dried or smoked fish. I prefer sardines od mullets.5. Salt:1/4 teaspoon for seasoning.6. Other seasonings: sweet basil, garlic, ginger, plus onions. ⦁ Wash the plantain in fresh running water.⦁ Cut off the two edges with a knife.⦁ Peel the plantain by making a slice 3-length-wise along the body so it can be easily peeled.⦁ Put the plantain skin at the bottom of the pot, so that the starchy plantain is resting on the peels.⦁ Add some water to the pot just enough to cover the peels, but not to immerse the fruit. It should be steamed on the peels.⦁ Boil for 10 minutes.⦁ Remove the peels and let the fruit now soak in the boiling water.⦁ Put in the dried fish, pepper, a teaspoon of red palm oil, or a substitute.⦁ Boiled for 7 minutes.⦁ Add the dried seasonings and sliced onions. Boiled for 2 minutes.⦁ Add the fresh sweet basil and boil for the last one minute.⦁ It's done and removed from heat.⦁ Serves 2 persons.Now, put the cooked plantain on a plate, add some oil and enjoy it along with the pepper soup or thin soup. Enjoy the boat. I usually take the unripe plantain for breakfast or supper. On odd occasions, my snack is a semi-ripe roasted plantain with fish. A diet of unripe plantain meal 2 or 3 times in the week is a great advantage. But variety is what counts-unripe, ripen, semi-ripen. And of course, varied the meal likewise: fried, porridge, roasted, cooked, chips, and so on daily if you want a serious improvement.A person with erectile dysfunction should eat unripened plantain daily. Eat it as a breakfast meal. snack it tomorrow or eat it for supper. Variety is what counts and that's what life is. Eat it today. Eat it as a breakfast meal. snack it tomorrow or eat it for supper. Variety is what counts and that's what life is. The unripened plantain contained a higher and unique level of potassium, magnesium, and a good format of selenium. These minerals together with vitamin A, B-complex, and vitamin C are 'testeron' boosting and stimulating sperm cells.There is a natural herbal aphrodisiac that not only treats or rejuvenates sexual dysfunction but improves the sex drive and enhanced it to some degree. Reproductive Health 'Unripe Plantain is the best for male fertility and sexuality. It helps man's erection, libido, and sperm count by boosting them'.-Afolabi Adeosun I read through books and browse websites to verify my experiences. I gathered that the green plantain or the semi-ripe ones sustain sexual health. It can maintain erection and increase sperm count and volume. I found the below experiment helpful and verified my claims. A. S. Alabi et al, the effects of Musa paradisiaca on 'semen quality of adult male Wister rats' was demonstrated to prove that plantain improves the sex act.Unripe plantain flour was dissolved into 2 ml of double-distilled water for oral administration.The male Wister rats are grouped into three groups-the control group, the low dose group, and the higher dose group.The solution or medicinal nutrients from the plantain mixture were administered as follows:⦁ The control group was given 2 ml of double-distilled water.⦁ The low-dose groups were given 500 mg/kg/day of the distilled plantain mixture.⦁ The high dose group was given 1000mg/kg/day of plantain fruit flour that is dissolved in 2 ml of double-distilled water.It was observed that they were a ""significant increment in semen parameters"" in the rats that received low dose than in the rats that received high doses of the plantain mixture.The study helps to conclude that Musa paradisiaca should be eaten regularly in moderate quality so that it can boost and enhance libido in both males and females. It's a pity that the research findings did not extend to human beings like the Professor Hopkins experiment with rats on milled rice, and then on the unmilled rice.We do know that when the rats began to recover from being given unmilled rice stuff, it was extended to the sick persons in the military hospital to verify the claim and pass the test, which benefits mankind to date. Critically, the size of the rats was not comparable to humans. Weigh for weighing, a person weighing 60 kg will need more than 500 mg/kg/day of the distilled plantain flour mixture.Seriously, a moderate size of 180 g of cooked plantain is enough to serve two persons. Boost Your Libido 'Unripe plantain cooked or roasted has been proven over the years to induce, sustain and maintain erection. It also helps to make semen thick and increases sperm volume. “Roasted plantain fruit is good for men with weak erection and low sperm count. Make a habit of eating one or two roasted plantain daily'.-Chukuma Muanyas The plantain or cooked banana is a unique fruit. Some have not realized that it can be treated as an aphrodisiac remedy. It's because it's only noted as a portion of ordinary common food.A meal of unripe plantain clothed with local spices like cloves, onions, garlic, and ginger, could be the answer to erectile dysfunction, and low sperm count.Now that you have the tips at hand, go treat a plantain for a meal at home. And be sure to coat the meal with some aphrodisiac spices as well.

254,Scallops - Wrapped in Bacon in Oven,food," The scallops were frozen. The bacon sliced in half, the long way. A piece around each scallop. Butter melted on poured on each scallop. Oven 425 degrees F. 16 minutes to start. Then, I flipped them the temperature seemed good, but I felt the bacon needed to be done more. I flipped all of the scallops over and cooked them another 10 minutes. Satisfied that there was a little golden coloring due to the butter, I served them. Melt the butter in the microwave then drip on each scallop. "
255,Easy Chicken Parmesan Casserole,food," Chicken parmesan is one of my favourite dinners and it's actually one of the first real meals I ever learned to cook. I've been making chicken parmesan for many years and I still love it every time. Whether it's on a bun or served with pasta, you really can't go wrong. This time I decided to try something different and make chicken parmesan as a casserole. It's really easy to make and it only takes about 30 minutes to prepare. Another 20 minutes in the oven and you will have dinner in less than an hour! You can even make this ahead and heat it later or freeze it for another day. This casserole also makes a great one-pot dish to bring to a potluck dinner party. Just make it ahead in a baking dish, cover it, and heat it when you arrive. Or, to make it even easier, make it in a slow cooker and keep it warm until you are ready to serve.  For this recipe, I used two chicken breasts, half of a 900g package of penne pasta, one jar of marinara sauce, and about one cup each of parmesan and mozzarella cheese. This made enough casserole to serve four people with leftovers. You can adjust these amounts to fit the needs of your family or gathering. For example, If you are making this for only two people, you could use one chicken breast, about 200g to 250g of pasta, and about 1/2 cup each of parmesan and mozzarella cheese.

257,Lost Foods Nobody Remembers But You,food," Born in 1986, this '80s baby and '90s kid remembers the colorful and naughty side of millennial youth. Somewhere in the back of your mind, you can just about taste these products, the type you never see on those ""Lost foods"" videos on YouTube, the kind nobody else seems to remember, and yet you can vividly recall not being able to get from Monday to Tuesday without them. Foods starting with Borden's indulgently sized slices, The Big Cheese. First appearing in 1996, The Big Cheese came in a size that stretched from one side of your favorite sandwich bread to the other, covering the entire slice with almost no crust leftover. Initially, The Big Cheese only came in American Cheese flavor, but it proved to be so popular that it was soon followed by a new flavor, Nacho. Yes, for the first time ever, you could have slices of nacho, no messy dips to worry about. Just slice after slice of peppery cheese to stretch and melt all over your grilled cheese sandwiches. The ads featured a crudely drawn cartoon cheese block, eating the ads and even eating his own cheese kind, excited for more and making the Millennial kids at home kind of uncomfortable with cheese cannibalism. But despite the creepy cartoon, kids clamored for The Big Cheese and wanted every lunchbox to be gifted its indulgent nacho goodness, complimenting a side of Doritos. ... And then in the blink of an eye, The Big Cheese vanished. No explanation was given, The Big Cheese doesn't even pop up on Wikipedia. Very few ads seem to exist of it, and nobody can explain why you can't have sliced nacho cheese anymore. Kraft from time to time has their own large cheese slices in a variety of flavors, but so far, no competitor has been able to match what Borden's delivered with sliced nacho cheese. While the website seems to be somewhat active, and a few shopping listings have popped up at unreasonable prices for what is now expired coffee, Bob Marley's One Drop coffee has long since vanished from Circle K's and Amaco stations. Smooth, creamy, not too bitter and not too sweet, the mellow coffee came in dreamy flavors of vanilla, mocha, coffee, banana split and chocolate-vanilla swirl in tall cans and in easy-to-carry bottles briefly in 2013 and 2014. The balance of caffeine was light and pleasant, so you wouldn't have a jittery feeling or a rapid heartbeat like you would if you tried their competitors. In fact, people felt so calm and relaxed while drinking it, a rumor had started that CBD oil was being used, though this was never confirmed. The coffee was thoughtfully processed with naturally sourced ingredients that were rainforest safe, and every sale went to charity. Stores constantly sold out of the beverage across the United States with happy coffee drinkers blogging about its irresistible aroma. And then by mid-2014, One Drop vanished. No explanation seems to exist, though the Bob Marley name is used on other coffee and tea products, but these products while decent, are nothing like the early day pep offered by One Drop. It was marketed as a ""lean"" product, and yet was 37% fat. It was still high in cholesterol. It was still loaded in preservatives. And yet if you were lucky enough to have any of the Sizzlean products between the 1970's and the early 2000's, you probably didn't care, because it was absolutely delicious and every bit as versatile as traditional bacon. Initially sold by Swift & Co. before being sold again by ConAgra Foods, Sizzlean at first was only bacon made with leaner cuts of pork, but soon expanded to include ground turkey, occasional flecks of chicken, and eventually, beef. Beef Sizzlean had a smokey taste that only became more mouthwatering the closer to burnt it was, making it a very hard food to ruin. Dry, overcooked beef Sizzlean tasted like pepperoni while properly cooked beef Sizzlean tasted devilishly decadent, and just like regular bacon, could be used in a variety of sweet and savory dishes. The beef Sizzlean had a slightly higher protein count, not by much, but enough to count at breakfast, and was a perfect addition to any plate with eggs and toast. And yet despite its culinary perfection, it vanished very suddenly. While regular pork Sizzlean endured in the background of supermarkets until 2005, the beef and turkey varieties quietly faded away with no explanation, no protest, not even a blog by an angry vegan or parental advisor mad about childhood obesity. Absolutely no reason was ever given, leaving beef bacon fans feeling very empty at the breakfast table for years to come.

259,"Marmite, Do You Love It or Hate It?",food," Well, marmite is a very thick yeast extract savoury spread. It's black in colour and it is by product of brewing beer. The whole marmite range is vegetarian and vegan and is also classes as halal. It can be used in recipes, and also suitable for sandwiches and spreading on toast. It's made from yeast extract, vegetable juice concentrate, salt and natural flavourings. It also contains celery.  Love it or hate it, marmite has been around for more than 100 years. It's definitely one of those spreads that you will either really love or really hate eating. Where did the name marmite come from? Well, it actually derived from a small earthenware pot called a marmite. It's pronounced MARMEET. This is what marmite originally came in. And an interesting fact is that on modern day marmite glass jars, you can still see a picture of that pot on the front. It was launched back in 1902 by The Marmite Food Company in Burton-on-Trent, England. The company was later rebranded as Marmite Ltd. It was in 1857 thought that a French Microbiologist called Louis Pasteur learned that alcoholic fermentations were conducted by living yeasts. And a German Scientist by the name of Justus Freiherr accidentally found out that waste product from yeast which was made in brewing beer could be made into a meaty, vegetarian concentrate. Justus lived from 1903 - 1973. He was the first person to make bouillon, which was the meat extract, or the process of it. That eventually got trademarked as OXO, which are stock cubes you put in your meat dishes. Marmite is an acquired taste, and right from the very start vegetarians liked it. And by 1907 the product had become so popular they had to open another factory in London. An interesting note is that during World War 1 it was all part of the rations for the troops. The reason behind this is because it is packed with vitamins and minerals like B1. It also helped to combat diseases such as Beriberi. Marmite is currently owned by a company called Unilever, which took over in 2000 when it merged with Best Foods. This is the earthenware jar it originally came in. The earthenware marmite jar Well personally, I love it. I know a lot of people don't. And when I bring the subject up with people, most of them tell me they hate it lol. It's always an interesting topic of conversation. But there must be a lot of people who like it too, as it's been around for all these years.  Marmite comes in other names across the world like Vegemite.  Bovril is also another form of marmite, but Bovril is more one you drink rather than eat by adding hot water to it.  Bovril is very nice too. © 2022 Louise Powles"

262,How to Make Mashed Potatoes,food," What Are They Going To Do To Us? Mashed potatoes are the most requested side dish and make a classic pairing with steaks and holiday dinners. They are simple yet enhance the flavors of the meals they are served with. They are also one of my favorite foods at dinner, or anytime! But there is something surprising, more satisfying, about mashed potatoes if you look at it as an individual component. The creaminess from the starch in the potatoes mashed into perfect consistency, and the addition of cream, butter, or milk to make it extra unique so it melts in your mouth and makes you drool just thinking about it. Surprisingly, mashed potatoes itself is a complete dish that requires no more than salt and pepper, but at the same time, there is so much potential in it that you can customize it according to your personal preference and likings. In this article, we will talk about making perfect mashed potatoes and how adding a few delicious ingredients bring your mashed spuds up a notch on the flavor chart. One of these additional recipes will give you more ideas of what flavors to pair with your meal and let those mashed potatoes be a star on the dinner table! The most commonly used potatoes in mashed potatoes are Russet potatoes. The russet potatoes have a starchy texture, and they are effortless to cook in a short time whether you are baking them or boiling them. The texture makes them fluffy, but taste-wise, russets are like kind of plain. Then we have Golden Yukon Potatoes, which are fluffier and full of that potato flavor. Yukon is ideal for mashed potatoes, but the taste development process can be tricky, especially when adding butter and milk or cream. In my opinion it's best to mix both Russet and Golden Yukon potatoes. Russet helps build a delicious flavor profile while Golden Yukon potatoes maintain the creaminess.  The recipe I have below will include both potatoes in it, but you (of course), can use any kind of potato you like. Different Variations of Mashed potatoes Love potatoes? Here are some ways to make those spuds the best, most flavorful, ever. And here are a few of our favorite variations to elevate your mashed potato game: My Grandmother always made smashed potatoes.

And, when sicknesses and diseases strike, provides a remedy for healing.In this article, I’ll show you that using natural organic spices and herbs benefits heart health. Our daily use of herbs and spices can significantly prevent many diseases of the heart. Contents: Did you know that herbs and spices are foods? It’ll come to some as a surprise. Food provides energy that nourishes the body. This energy also helps the body in fighting and preventing diseases. Garlic bulbs, ginger roots, cayenne or chili pepper, and onions can be combined to make a light snack. It’s an herb and spices recipe for weight loss.They provide an essential level of energy or remedy for health. Are you really taking note of that? While they seem to release immediate energy, even in the long run, and so should be used with great caution.Critically, you were aware of the heat or energy in a bit of raw ginger, garlic, or chili. You feel the heat at once. Isn’t it? That heat is energy. They’re too much heat in 0.1 g of ginger or cayenne pepper, that if you had to eat 5 g of the herb or spice at once, without a combination of your regular carb or cereals, you’ll go nuts or crazy. That said, you need a cooling-down effort.Scientists have made a special study and measure the heat in 'Scoville' heat units(SHU), in honor of Wilbur Scoville, a pharmacist. Herbs are Foods ‘I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed, so it shall be for food'.-Bible Genesis1:29. Sprinkle your fruit salads with a little mixed herb and spices for a kick Miebakagh Fiberesima pictures Herbs and spices have been used to treat sicknesses and diseases from time immemorial. Some books of ancient scriptures point to searchlights on these 2Kings 20:7. For example, garlic, ginger, turmeric, and cinnamon are regularly used in homemade remedies or Ayurveda medicine.The below 10 herbs and spices should be handy always with you. These 10 seasonings are good for heart health should be our talk later. The difference between herbs and spices is not confusing. simply put, herbs come from the green parts or leaves of shrubs. For example, sweet basil, parsley, and thyme. On the other hand, spices are the roots, stem, bark, bulb, and seeds of the same shrub or others, for example, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and pepper. You either use fresh or dried items. Or you can combine a mixture of dried and fresh herbs and spices. The dried form has more potency than the fresh ones. The active ingredients in the herbs and spices are medicinal. They possess curative and preventive properties. I’m amazed that herbs and spices are more than foods or superfoods. According to Monica Aulander Moreno, ‘Herbs and spices fight inflation and reduce damage to your body cells. That’s because each one is rich in phytochemicals, which are healthful plant chemicals’.They’re ‘antiseptics, antibiotics, and antioxygenic and antiviral'. They make foods tastier while boosting your health. ‘You should be cooking with herbs and spices regularly and if possible, using several at a time’, Moreno says further. Likewise, they’re antioxidants and full of flavonoids. You should know what all these means.Now, let’s get on our talk on the 10 herbs and spices. Shall we? Yes. Pixabay ‘Cayenne pepper’, writes Ryan Ramam, a registered dietician, may ‘help boost the stomach’s defense against infections, increased digestive fluid production and help deliver enzymes to the stomach, aiding digestion'.Have you ever thought that you can’t eat a soup, stew, or porridge that has no pepper in it? Not only pepper gives the soup or stew flavor or savory. It enhanced the eating process. Pepper stimulated the circulatory system. The capsaicin, the active ingredient in the pepper does the job, while you eat it in your teas, avocado, or fresh coconut meat. And of course, any food can go with the pepper. Chili pepper benefits your heart health.Dr. Edward said that capsaicin triggers nitric oxide production in the body. So your arteries relax to carry blood to the heart and keep the blood pumping round through the very tiny vessels, to the skin, heart, and reproductive organs. Capsiate is another compound found in the pepper that tasks sugars and bad fats. It de-clog the arteries and preventing heart diseases, for example, high blood pressure. Pixabay Garlic is reputed to be first among herbs and spices. Its scientific name is Allium Satisvum. It’s a species of the onions family. For thousands of years, it’s been used in traditional medicine, in treating cardiovascular diseases. If you eat garlic regularly, you’re welcoming a 'lowered cholesterol and blood pressure', according to Victoria Taylor, a dietician. This means you’re preventing or retarding heart disease.Allicin is the active force in spiced garlic. To retain this compound in your cooking pot, mince or chop them, and boil for only 30 to 60 seconds to prevent Allicin from evaporating. Google Scholar had it that ‘garlic is most commonly used for conditions related to the heart and blood system’.And, according to Tim Newman, garlic is linked to the blood system and heart, including atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), high cholesterol, heart attack, coronary heart disease, and hypertension.It’s not good to let these conditions occur and then treat them. But preventing them is sane and wise. Garlic antioxidant Allicin is really heart-friendly. Use it regularly in your stews, soups, and other dishes, and you're on your way to prevent any heart-related diseases. Heart disease is still number one on the list of sickness causing death.

I regularly spiced my stews with turmeric, in addition to adding garlic, ginger, chili, clove, and cinnamon. Remember that putting a single spice or herb in a cooking pot will not do you much good. You’ve to combine more at least three to get the maximum benefit. Turmeric is a heart-friendly spice.The flowering part of the shrub-seeds, leaf, tender system is the herb. The root informs the spices. Turmeric, like ginger, is a root. It’s anti-inflammatory. Turmeric is one of the heart-friendly herbs that has been sung about for thousands of years, in Africa, Asia, and Europe. It’s a respected herb all over the world.As a heart-friendly herb, it can protect the heart. And it can prevent many heart-related illnesses. A peanut size of the herb is all that is needed to flavor a pot of soup or stew. Too much I think would be detrimental to the taste of the food. Turmeric is a medicine. In African or Chinese traditional medicine or Ayurveda, it’s used to treat circulatory diseases. However, modern medicine has not provided any evidence-based treatment in the application of spice. There're many varieties. But the true or Ceylon(cassia) cinnamon is the most popular. Cinnamon is a spice sprinkled on toast and lattes. That's what it practically is. Otherwise, you'll lose many of its many health benefits, if you boil it in your soups and stews. The shrub leaves, fruits, roots, and flowers are also useful medicinal ingredients. It has been used in traditional medicine for thousands of years all over the world. Its use in baking and cooking will depend on how long you heat it.Cinnamaldehyde, the chemical in the spices impart flavor to the diet and contain health benefits for the heart. A half teaspoon or 2 grams. or less in powder form is all that you need to sprinkle on your diet or salad green. Above this benchmark is toxic.Don't use it if you're allergic or had a liver problem. Breastfeeding mothers, pregnant women, and children should be very cautious. It's a potential drug. Coumarin is another active ingredient in spices. This agent thin the blood. So, smaller amounts contribute to the health of the heart and the cardiovascular system. Cardamom is one of the spices that are evidence-based or backed up by science in its many heart-related properties.It's a spice that will make the eyes red or pop up with its 'expensive' budget. It comes after saffron and vanilla in terms of cost.Its antioxidant, diuretic, and inflammatory properties make the spice heart-friendly.According to Lizzie Streit, a registered dietician, 'The seeds, oils, and extracts of cardamom have impressive medicinal and have been used in traditional medicine for centuries'.Its heart-healthy functions include lowering blood pressure. You can ground the seeds and ponds into powder, and use the products in curries, desserts, and meat dishes. Add a little of the powder into your teas and coffee as you add powder chili into a cup of black tea.Any metabolic syndrome can lead to heart diseases-high blood pressure, hypertension, and high cholesterol, which are signs that your heart is not in a good state of health. If you take 1/2 gram of cardamom daily, it'll prevent these conditions. And if you had the challenge, the spice will checkmate or retard them. A study that was done on rats, and later volunteering humans was reputed to improve the blood cholesterol, lower cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. So, whatever your diet is, garnish or flavor it with a little cardamom as you did with common salt.Cardamom is a good source of iron, magnesium, selenium, zinc, and manganese. Plus calcium, potassium, and vitamin C, and a B-complex unit. (These nutrients are likely to combat the coronavirus disease that is endemic these days). This spice is also associated with the ginger family. It's a bright-oranges-yellow plant product. It's used mainly as a food flavor and coloring.It's a complex chemical and evidence of medicinal use has not been confirmed in the laboratories and research work.It's yellow coloring matter or pigment is found in turmeric.Although it has its use in Ayurveda or alternative medicine, it's significant to note why the United State government gave a grant of $150 million for research into its many health benefit.It has the potential of enhancing heart health.It's reasonable that turmeric derived its potential from curcumin. The chemical curcuminoids contain curcumin. It's the main active ingredient in turmeric. And so, curcumin is a species for heart-related disease. But its bioavailability in the body makes it to be consumed along with black pepper. Eating a single herb is of no avail at least. Three or four combination is best. Bioavailability is the rate of absorbing nutrients by the body. Our digestive system is a poor indicator of this. Black pepper contains a chemical called piperine. It enhanced the absorption rate of curcumin by 2000% according to clinical trials by humans.Curcumin has the potentials to lower heart disease.The endothelium is the lining of the blood vessels. when it dis-function, it can't regulate your blood pressure and blood clotting. Curcumin helps the heart to improve. Oregano, Oreganum Vulgare or wild marjoram, or sweet marjoram, meaning 'brightness of the mountain', or 'joy of the mountain'. It's most commonly used as a flavoring in meats, barbecues, salads, and fish dishes.It's even used as a supplement and as an aromatic oil.More than five antioxidants including thymol and limonene give the herb its aromatic flavor and scent. The herb is mostly associated with Mediterranean cuisine. But people all over the world now used it as a supplement to the diet or dishes 'to boost overall health' according to Yvette Brazier.They're evidence that it could fight inflammation and regulate blood sugar, a disease that is circulatory and can lead to heart degeneration. Free radicals as we all know are toxin substances. They should not be in the bloodstream. Dietary oregano helps the body fight free radicals. This is the tender stem, buds, and flowers of the Myrfaceean Syzygium aromaticum shrub. It originates in Indonesia, according to Britannica and Wikipedia, and it's a spice that's good for heart health.It's an evergreen shrub blossoms throughout the seasons in different countries. It's used as spices in Africa, Asia, Mediterranea, and many the Middle East and Latin American countries.It leads flavor to meats, curries, and marinades. Cloves may be used as spices for fruits-apples, pears, teas, and coffees. You can add the grounded powder to your lemon drinks or sweet beverages. The chemical eugenol is the main active compound in the spice. Others are eugenol accetate, and gallic acid. Paired it with 'cinnamon, allspices, vanilla, red wine, basil, onion, citrus peel, star anise, and peppercorns' says Wikipedia. That has got much to do with your circulatory system. And so your health always improves.Although the Food and Drug Administration has not approved its use as a medicine, traditionally, it has a long history of alternative medicine in treating heart diseases. 'Cloves are full of antioxidants. These compounds help your body to fight free radicals, which damage your cells and can lead to diseases. By removing free radicals from your systems, the antioxidants found in cloves can help reduce your risks of developing heart disease' according to the WebMD. Antioxidants will reduce oxidative stress in the body system.In a recent study to determine the content of polyphenol and antioxidants of plant-based 100 spice nutrients, cloves of all spices took the upper hand.In another work, the main phenolic compounds in 26 spices were studied. chromatography performance plus in vitro antioxidant activity analysis shows that clove presents the highest antioxidant and polyphenol content. That makes clove a 'radical scavenger' in the bloodstream. Black pepper or piper nigrum of the Piperaceae family is the 'King of Spices'.It can act synergically with other drugs and many nutrients.The main active ingredient in black pepper is pepperine. It's an important antioxidant.Black pepper has anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, it factors in combating circulatory diseases, specifically heart disease.So use 1/2 teaspoon to season your pot of soup or stew. Use only a pinch to flavor your prepared salads, meat, fish, poultry, and pasta dishes. Black pepper is a very powerful compound and a big use can result in negative side effects, for example, headache.You can add it to fruits, vegetables, scrambled eggs, avocado, and much to give it a kick. The spice goes well when paired with turmeric, garlic, onion, cumin, cardamom, and chili pepper.Also known as peppercorn, a test-tube study shows that the king of spices resisted at most 93% of free radicals damages stimulated in a fat experiment. Free radicals will almost result in a poor or unbalanced diet. Exposing your skin to extra sunshine after 11.30 AM to 4.30 PM will result in free radicals being form in the body cells. Smoking and much exposure to pollutants are other factors. So keep your lifestyle very healthy, to contain free radicals in the bloodstream.But unlike other herbs and spices, black pepper will help the absorption of drugs into the stomach walls. But not much than1/4 of a teaspoon should be taken in your salad greens. And if you can't stand the vim, lessen it. The spice was an important ingredient in traditional medicine. Though laboratory studies have proved its benefits in rats and test-tube studies. Is basil good for the heart? Yes. The herb is an evergreen shrub, that grows throughout the Tropics and sub-tropics.Three well-known types used in everyday life are basil, sweet basil, and cinnamon basil. All these three deliver good nutrition and health impact.But it should be noted that the herb has 150 varieties. Basil is good for cooking. It blends well with garlic. It goes well in the cooking pot with fish, goat meat, poultry, grains and cereals like white beans and rice, root tubers like potatoes and African yams, cocoyam, and eggs. You can add it to soups and stews. You can chew a single tender leaf of the herb to keep your mouth and breath fresh. It leaves, flowers. seeds, tender stalks are used as foods. Cultivated for over 5,000 years, it impacts the heart with its many health benefits.Its anti-inflammatory properties due to its powerful chemical-eugenol, citronellol, and linalool help fight heart diseases. Furthermore, the herb has a very low Glycemic Load(GL) and helps to cut down on triglycerides and cholesterols which are heart-related diseases. Just add half a teaspoon fresh or dried to your salad greens for a kick. Some spices and herbs can be made into a blend. This synergistically maximized its potency and flavor. The best known is the Indian blend of garam masala. It consists of more than 6 spices and herbs combined. Here are some of the ingredients: nutmeg, cumin seeds, black cardamom, green cardamom, curcumin pod, bay leaves, black and white peppercorns, mace, green or red chili, and coriander seeds. There's also the wet form in which coconut milk, vinegar, or water is mixed with 'nuts, onions, garlic' and blended with the above items. You can make yours's and go beyond and above. Spices and herbs were used primarily for medicine or medical use for 'holy oils, unguent, and aphrodisiacs'. Later, records were made in ancient herbals (documents) that identify plants in preparing medicines or remedies for diseases. The herbs cure or prevent coughs, colds, fever, flu, headache, and many more. But here in this article, I have shown that circulatory diseases, specific heart diseases were not left out in the treatise. Use the spice and herb regularly in small doses and keep your heart safe and healthy.

274,Holiday Peppermint Bark,food," Maria is a master gardener and master of public health. She & her husband, known online as The Gardener & The Cook, live in coastal Alabama. Our homemade peppermint bark Maria Logan-Montgomery Bo and I love our peppermint bark, and always make sure to have some at our house every year throughout the holidays. Years ago, we bought it, either at Williams-Sonoma, or the bags of little squares by Ghirardelli at the grocery store — and both brands are delicious. Then one year, on the night before Christmas Eve, we had run out of the supply we bought, and we decided to try making our own. It was easy and fun — so much so, we never bought it again. We now make enough to share it with friends and relatives. This year we changed the process we use to make this delicious candy. First, I'll share the older way, then the new way. Both work fine, but Bo thought of a method he wanted to try, so we did. We used two bags of chocolate chips, one of dark chocolate, and one of white chocolate, plus a large stick of peppermint candy. Bo melted the dark chocolate in a double boiler and poured it onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. I used an extra-wide cookie spatula to spread the chocolate until it was a thin, smooth layer, but it was never a completely even thickness. We then put it into the fridge to harden. Be sure to take the dark chocolate out of the fridge a few minutes before the white chocolate is completely melted. We learned the hard way that, if the dark chocolate is too cold, it causes the white chocolate to begin cooling immediately. Then it cannot be spread smoothly or completely. That resulted in a chocolate mess — lesson learned. While the dark chocolate chilled, we put the peppermint stick into a zip-close bag, and crushed it with a meat cleaver. That was a good way to take out any frustrations you may have, and it's kind of fun. After the peppermint is crushed, set it aside while waiting for the white chocolate to be ready to receive it. We can't find those large peppermint sticks anymore, but a couple of years ago, we found this reusable little jar of crushed peppermint. Using it saved us time for both crushing and cleaning the mess those little pieces of peppermint that, somehow, go everywhere. For a few years we used this pre-crushed peppermint that came in these cute little jars. For 2021, the jars were smaller and not cute -- just ordinary jars with a screw on lid. They also cost more. So we found a different source of peppermint. Maria Logan Montgomery This is the peppermint we used this year (2021). The package contains more peppermint, and cost less than the little jars. The only downside is that it’s a single-use plastic bag. Maria Logan Montgomery When the white chocolate in the double boiler has  melted, pour it over the dark chocolate, spreading it to a smooth, even, top layer. Immediately, while it is still warm and soft, begin sprinkling crushed peppermint over the white chocolate, and patting it in place so it won't fall off when the chocolate hardened. When we made this candy in the past, the bottom (dark chocolate) layer was never even. It always had high and low places, causing the white chocolate top layer to be thicker in places where it had settled into the low spots below. It quickly became clear that my engineer husband had been thinking about this, and here's what he did: Instead of putting the parchment paper on a large cookie sheet, then putting it into an already over-crowded fridge, Bo decided to try making it on the counter top. First, he put down four yardsticks, stacked two-deep and parallel to each other. The distance between them was a little less than the length of our rolling pin, so the ends of rolling pin could ""ride"" on the yardsticks to roll out the thickness of the chocolate. (See next photo.) Maria Logan Montgomery Next, he put a sheet of parchment paper over the yardsticks (because they are not sterile; and also to keep sticky chocolate off of them), and poured the chocolate onto it. He then put a 2nd sheet of parchment paper over the chocolate. Next, we used the rolling pin to spread the chocolate between the 2 rows of yardsticks, making the chocolate an even thickness throughout. Well, there were a few air bubbles that left small ""pot holes"" in the chocolate. You can see them through the parchment in the photo below. No worries — the white chocolate will fill those. Maria Logan Montgomery When using the countertop method instead of a cookie sheet that can be put in the fridge, it will take longer for the first layer of chocolate to cool and harden enough to add the top layer, so be prepared to wait a while before adding the white chocolate and the peppermint. The wait is well worth it. When the candy is completely hardened, it can be broken into pieces of any size. We made some medium-sized pieces and some tiny bite-size pieces. The finished product, ready to be broken into small pieces and enjoyed. Maria Logan Montgomery Yep! We've already thought of another change we want to make next time we make this recipe. Again, the engineer had a better idea for the crushed peppermint. He suggested stirring it into the melted white chocolate, and spreading both over the dark chocolate at once. The reason?  If the tiny pieces of peppermint are embedded in the top layer of chocolate, they shouldn’t break loose, and fall off when you take a bite. Sounds like a great idea to me. Maybe we won't wait a year to try it…. © 2021 MariaMontgomery"

276,Potato Balls - a What if You Mix Such and Such Together,food," Using leftover mashed potatoes, mix together diced ham, onion, cheese,and an egg. Mix well. Add cracker crumbs to make less sticky. Use melon baller to make small balls. Dip the baller in ground up stovetop sage stuffing in between. Place rounded ball on parchment paper. Freeze. Then, deep fry. Just start mixing together. I started with one egg. Then, I added a second one. Cracker crumbs. Saltines, through food processor. Fine crumbs. I used an entire package by the time I was done. The first batch, I diced my cheese. The second time, I used my salad shooter and grated the cheese. Since I had leftover ham, I diced up a few slices. Onion. We like lots of onion. Old Bay seasoned salt. Stovetop stuffing, sage flavor. Don't tell anyone, but I did put some of the chopped stuffing crumbs in the mixture. The rest, I dipped the melon baller in so it wouldn't stick. I started with cooking spray to keep the mixture from sticking. I soon decided that using the baller dipped in stuffing crumbs worked better. It also worked out that the melon baller coated each potato ball with stuffing mix. When I deep fried them from frozen, in about  3 to 5 minutes, they were deep fried to a golden brown."
277,Mystery Meat Pie,food," Mystery Meat Pie, 2021 Hmmm...mystery meat pie? I hate to disappoint, but the mystery here is that this pie has no meat at all! When I became a vegetarian, I learned to cook meatless versions of my favorite dishes; and, one of the meals I missed most was the chicken pot pie. It was like chicken soup for the soul, only better. It has all of the same wonderful ingredients of a chicken soup, but with a creamy broth in a flaky pie crust. I missed the chicken pot pie so much, I created my own vegetarian version of the traditional recipe. I'm a busy gal, so I opted to use frozen pie crusts; but to the Southern debutant, feel free to make your own pie crust. The first step is to make the thick, creamy vegetable stock for the filling. Begin by melting two tablespoons of butter over medium heat in a medium saucepan. Add one chopped onion, one chopped celery stalk, two teaspoons of sea salt, and one teaspoon of parsley; then, saute until onions and celery are translucent. Add one cup of cream and three tablespoons of flour, one tablespoon at a time, while stirring until smooth. Next, add your vegetables of choice. I like the good ol' peas, carrots, potatoes, and corn combination traditionally found in the chicken pot pie. I add one diced potato, one diced carrot, half a cup of frozen peas, and half a cup of frozen corn. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low heat. Cover and simmer for eleven minutes until vegetables are tender, then remove from heat and add fresh ground pepper to taste. For my recipe, I use two deep dish, nine inch frozen pie crusts. You may like to make your own pie crust, so follow your heart wherever it may go! If going the frozen pie crust route: remove the pie crusts from their packaging, place one crust in its aluminum pan centered on a baking sheet, and pour the filling from the saucepan into the pie crust on the baking sheet. Next, moisten the edges of both pie crusts with water, and cover the filled pie with the second pie crust. Remove the aluminum pan from the top pie crust, and crimp the two crusts sealed. Cut two to three slots on the top crust for steam to escape, and place in pre-heated oven to bake on the middle rack at 375°F for one hour until pie crust is golden brown and center is bubbly. Cool completely and enjoy, I promise you won't even notice the mystery meat! © 2021 Marilyn Prado"
278,Classic German Side Dish for Christmas,food," Creative Commons Side dishes often get less love than the main dish, but this classic German side dish is popular throughout Germany. Savory, somewhat sweet and full of flavor, red cabbage has been a mainstay in German kitchens for generations. A simple side dish that pairs well with hearty meats, Rotkohl is often served next to Sauerbraten, Haxe, Schnitzel, and certain sausages. This is a classic recipe handed down from generations of German families. Prep Time: 10 minutes Cook Time: ca. 1 hour Photo by Author Ingredient List: 2 pounds of red cabbage. 1 large sweet onion. 1 pound of apples. We used one Gala and one Fuji. Don't get the super sweetest, a little sour helps. Some Germans use Granny Smith but for my taste, that's too tart. 1 cup of red wine. 1 cup vegetable broth. Avoid chicken and beef broth as they will impart a meaty flavor. 1 tablespoon vinegar. We used apple cider vinegar. Tablespoon of butter. 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg 5-10 cloves, depending on taste. Sugar, if needed. Salt and pepper. Begin by prepping all your fruits and veggies. Quarter and core everything. Be sure to remove the outside leaves of the cabbage. Photo by Author Using a food processor, or a grater, grate all of the cabbage, apples, and onion into a large bowl. Amateur tip: Go back and forth between the apples, cabbage, and onion to make it easier to stir them all into one large mixture. Combine all the shredded goodness together in the bowl. Photo by Author Photo by Author Begin by placing about one tablespoon of butter on the bottom of a large pot. Sautee the onions. We did not do this because we used a large Texas sweet onion. We just threw all of the shredded mixture into the pot at once. Sautee for about two to five minutes, just until it starts to soften. Stir often. Photo by Author Photo by Author Add salt and pepper (to taste). Add about 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and the cloves. Stir to combine. Photo by Author Stir and sautee for about five minutes. Add the red wine, sugar, and vegetable broth. Stir to combine. Put the lid on and cook for about one hour. Turn the heat down to medium low and stir occasionally as the red cabbage simmers. (In the one hour we cooked the red cabbage, we stirred twice. Photo by Author Serve a healthy portion along with your favorite meat dish. This year we had pork roast. But ham, goose, turkey, chicken ... well pretty much anything goes well with Rotkohl! © 2021 gmarquardt"

282,Easy Beef Rump or Tip Roast Cooked in an Instant Pot-Easy Filling Dinner,food," Mike has always loved to cook. His mother made sure he could cook when he was a child. These recipes or menus are old family favorites. Lately, even in these times of high priced meat, our local store has had lots of rump and tip roasts on sale for about a dollar less a pound than hamburger. While this method is fairly quick, it produces a good meal, especially when paired with a vegetable or two. Instant Pot Rump Roast www.lmmeats.ca Easy Instant Pot Beef Roast Recipe This roast can be a tip or rump roast, and you can cook your favorite pot roast veggies in it, just wait till the end of the cooking time. I realize a lot of people think of rump roast as a roast served rare to medium rare. This one will be different, since we are cooking with pressure to get it tender if will be close to falling apart.  First things first. You want 2-4 lbs of meat to cook. Obviously a smaller piece will need less time, and a larger one will take more. I use a 6qt Instant pot and it accommodates 2-4 pounds of roast just fine. If the roasts are smaller I just put 2 in the pot at a time. I put the trivet in the bottom of the pot and then the meat on top of that. I then add 2 cups of liquid(You can use broth, juice or water or any liquid for that matter, never leave the bottom of the pot dry. A dry pot will lead to burning and the unit will never come up to pressure. Don't Forget To Add Liquid To The Pot You can add almost any edible liquid to your roast. Some people use broth, some people are partial to beer or wine. A lady I talked to last week liked tomato juice and coffee in hers. You can use plain old tap water if you like. The most important thing is that the liquid converts to steam and creates pressure to cook the meat. As long as you have the liquid and the meat in the instant pot pressure cooker, you will likely end up with something good. One thing I like to add to my meat is Instant Onion Soup Mix, whether it is Lipton's or store brand, it doesn't seem to matter. If you don't have it, nothing is ruined. You can add onion powder or garlic powder to flavor. You can also add salt and pepper. I usually try not to lean too hard on the salt till the meat is cooked. Once your roast is in the pot, the liquid added then set the lid to sealed. Plug in the instant pot, and set it for roast or manual cook for 1hour 30 minutes. It will start the countdown when the pot is up to pressure.  While this is cooking, you can select and prep the veggies for your meal. You can peel potatoes, or just cut them to size if you prefer them with skin on. I add a bag of baby carrots to the mix or you can peel and cut carrots into uniform pieces. You can peel and quarter onions if you like. To make your gravy extra tasty, you can purchase au jus mix or brown gravy makings at the store. When your countdown hits zero on the cooker, use safe techniques to release pressure. This means wear mitts and preferably use a utensil of some kind to move the knob to vent. And do not put your face down near the pressure vent. We like you just as you are. Once the pressure has vented, and the lock on the lid has released, put your veggies in to cook. Depending on their size, you want to go as little as 5 minutes to 10, The bigger the potato, the longer the cook. Go too far and you will have mashed potatoes in your gravy. Add the Au Jus packet or liquid brown gravy flavor . While your veggies are cooking, take a quarter cup of cold water and make a paste with two tablespoons of Wondra flour or cornstarch. Either will work, but you have to make sure the flour cooks as it thickens. When the veggies are cooked, let the pressure naturally release till -15:00 shows on the timer. Then release pressure and again remove the lid safely.  Hit cancel on the controls, then select saute. Add your slurry to the juices and stir continuously. I like to use a whisk for this but a spoon works okay too. After the gravy bubbles good your gravy will start to thicken. Unplug the pot and your gravy will continue to thicken. Serve One thing I like to do with the leftovers is to make something similar to an open face Roast Beef Sandwich with it. If I don't have potatoes left over, I might either make some whipped potatoes to serve with the Roast Beef and Gravy, or just ladle on gravy over the Roast Beef and bread. Both to me are pretty good. My mother used to take the roast and cut it into small bite sized pieces and fry it up with potatoes to make a roast beef hash.

283,Meatloaf Burgers Under the Broiler,food," The ground beef was raw. The onions were raw. The fresh mushrooms and peppers were raw, but frozen, so I microwaved them to thaw quickly. Then I followed the package details. I had chopped up some saltine crackers and the package called for some. I added the saltines last, after I mixed up all the other ingredients. Then, I formed burgers with my burger squisher. I only had six buns, so I only used enough burger to make six burgers. I put the rest in a zip lock bag for later use. Under the broiler until the top of the burgers were browned. Then, flip over for a few minutes until the top is browned. They were juicy and delicious. saltine cracker crumbs chopped, thawed, raw fresh mushrooms 2 eggs 1/2 cup milk peppers, onions, burger, mushrooms, eggs meatloaf mix stir add cracker crumbs stir"
284,Tian with Rosemary Pork Tenderloin Recipe,food," Most famous of any of France's dishes, other than croissants, escargot, or baguettes, is probably ratatouille. It is impossible to mention the name without thinking of the Disney movie, with its cooking rat and blithe disregard for public health standards. But the ratatouille shown in the movie is actually the tian of Southern France - a sort of vegetable gratin, of caramelized onions forming a bed on which is laid an intricate spiral circle pattern of tomatoes, eggplant, and zucchini, and not a ratatouille, which is a sort of stewed vegetable medley. It's a beautiful dish, and wonderful to eat. There is a feeling of springtime it, whatever time of the year you eat. Freshness, green, the mad excess of vegetables with their delightfully different notes. It is hard to improve on perfection, and I don't so much think of this as an improvement on a tian as a different version of it: another one of my favorite, simple but delightful, recipes is pork tenderloin. Pork tenderloin is cheap, but very, well - tender - and easy to prepare, and it simply soaks up flavor. It goes wonderfully with rosemary, thyme, garlic, which perfume it with a superb freshness and verdant feeling of a garden. So why not match the two together? By having the pork tenderloin on top of the tian, and making the tian in the pan which the pork tenderloin is cooked in, it gives it the helpings of pork drippings as the pork cook, and the two combine together into a full meal. Simple, easy, and elegant. I adopted the recipe from the tian from Rachel Khoo's My Little French Kitchen: Over 100 Recipes from the Mountains, Market Squares, and Gardens of France, which I quite enjoy for its diverse variety of recipes from the provinces of France. I didn't include the traditional eggplant in my tian since not everyone in my family likes it, but otherwise the base tian is quite similar."

Its delicious taste of chocolate and hazelnuts has conquered entire generations of people. This product and the company behind it, Ferrero, are one of the most known excellence here in Italy.

There’s nothing that may prevent you from keeping Nutella in the fridge if there is a reason why you want to do it. Still, it may not be recommendable as the spread tends to become more solid at cold temperatures.

This a popular use of the spread and especially in Italy in can find these croissants in many cafes. The most common reason why do some people ask if they can keep Nutella in the fridge or not is because when they see jars stored at room temperature at the supermarket, they are still closed and sealed, so they may think the situation may change after having opened the jar. At the fact Nutella is not a highly perishable product and so you can store it at room temperature even after having opened the jar. After having opened it, you can eat it safely until the expiration date. Of course, in order to ensure you enjoy the best tasting experience, it is still recommended not to keep Nutella at direct contact with sources of light or hot surfaces.

Another recommendation is to put the jar away from direct sources of lighting: the best place where you can keep Nutella is within your kitchen cabinet. Can you still keep Nutella in the fridge? Yes if you prefer a more compact spread: especially if you are used to eat it with a spoon, having it more solid makes the experience similar to eating a chocolate.

292,Creating New Culinary Trends & Inventive Menus: French Chef Margot Amzallag Continues to Innovate,food," Entertainment News Today-- bringing you the latest articles and interviews from Hollywood's most established filmmakers & industry leaders. Margot Amzallag at Salon Du Panthéon With an ability to catalyze new dining experiences and awaken the palettes of discriminating diners, innovative fusion foods are the latest phenomenon within the international culinary landscape. A talented culinary expert who experiments and blends unique flavors and unusual ingredients into traditional recipes can bring an overwhelming sense of joy to those with a curious taste for trending culinary cuisines. One culinary connoisseur who has spearheaded new food trends is French development chef Margot Amzallag, whose avant-garde menus and ability to predict dining trends continues to bring innovation to the international industry. From the Parisian-inspired duck poke bowl to quail deviled eggs in a sesame nest, Margot Amzallag understands that every detail of a dish that is being served needs to complement the other ingredients in a way that is somewhat surprising yet delectable to the senses. ”I would say that curiosity is the drive for creativity,” explains Margot Amzallag. “In order to be able to create certain food pairings, you need to be curious about discovering new tastes, associations and textures.” Raised in the Pâtisserie-filled streets of Paris, Margot Amzallag always felt a special connection to all things food. From the preparation stage to the hours spent around the table after the meal is over, her chemistry in the kitchen has been the top-tier recipe behind her profound success. “I believe that creativity and innovation comes from curiosity and travel,” explains Margot Amzallag. “My roots are far from common--my mom is from Madagascar and my dad’s side are from Spain and Morocco, which definitely played a key role in me bringing innovation to the industry.” Inspired by travel and seduced by the signature flavors of Hawaii, Margot Amzallag launched Ono Poké in 2016, when she was just 23 years old. As France’s first ever poké restaurant, Ono Poké continues to invite local patrons to explore Hawaii’s native ingredients all without having to board a plane. Pairing tropical exotic fillings with French ingredients and technique, alongside charming European ambience, the trendsetting restaurant is set in the heart of Paris; a city that is known internationally for welcoming diners who yearn for unique culinary experiences. Margot Amzallag shares, “Our customers are very loyal and return to us on a daily basis as they like to vary the combinations of possible ingredients and flavors and taste all the pokés.” Tuna Poké created by Margot Amazallag (photo by The Social Food) Catering towards a health conscious clientele, Margot Amzallag has infused her menu with vitality. Some of the signature dishes which alert the senses of many Parisians are the Huli Huli Poké, the decadent Sweet Poké Choco and the unique French Confit Duck bowl, which cannot be found anywhere else in the world. “My goal was to bring a fresh new concept to the people of Paris,” says Margot Amzallag. “When I discovered poké bowls I fell in love with the concept. It’s fresh, healthy and exotic, and most importantly, it was new on the French market.” Looking at the multitude of options for eating out in 2016, Margot Amzallag understood that the landscape of modern dining was beginning to undergo a healthy renovation. This observation, combined with her instincts for evolving food trends and consumer culture caused her to craft an innovative menu that epitomized what diners were craving--offering them food that was better for them, better for the environment, and a better selection of fresh and local ingredients. Margot Amzallag’s innovative French-tropical fusions did not go unnoticed. In fact, her achievements even landed her an appearance on France’s hit national cooking show, “Très Très Bon,” where she produced a selection of mouth-watering poké bowls that enticed the taste buds of those watching from home. In many respects, Margot Amzallag’s success lies in the fact that her restaurant and its menu was ahead of the game. Indeed, beyond her unique fusion concept, healthy bowls have become extremely popular over the years, and for good reason. They’re easy to eat on the go and are often customizable to suit various dietary needs and preferences. Her insane creativity and amazing execution of incredible ingredients paved the foundations for what has become an accomplished career. With Ono Poké, Margot left her mark on the Parisien dining landscape, while also creating a great community space where locals and visitors could gather around a table and enjoy new culinary experiences together. Along with gaining national recognition from “Très Très Bon,” which led to countless franchise offers and a successful collaboration with the influential restaurant guide Gault & Millau, Ono Poké has also received critical industry praise from trendsetting magazines such as Vanity Fair, Numéro and L’Express, as well as the billion dollar airline, Air France. “Starting a business in any industry is a very big challenge, but when you’re passionate about what you do, the hard work pays off and you succeed,” Margot Amzallag explains. “I’m really proud that I overcame all the challenges that come with opening a new business.” Director Michel Hazanavicius, Margot Amzallag and actress Berenice Bejo Throughout her illustrious career as a development chef, Margot Amzallag has also been in high demand as a private chef to many celebrities, including the Oscar-winning French director Michel Hazanavicius (“The Artist'') and award-winning actor Mathieu Amalric (“Quantum of Solace,” “The French Dispatch”). In addition to being labeled a gastronomy expert, a food trendsetter and a communication expert, she has also become known as an international catering extraordinaire for the entertainment industry. Earlier this year, following in the culinary footsteps of her mother, Margot Amzallag became the co-owner and majority shareholder of Grenata, a catering company that services the likes of entertainment giants Warner Bros., Netflix and Orange Cinéma Series--the French equivalent of HBO. Margot Amzallag cooking with chef Nathan Santana at an event in Downtown LA Given her elite client base, Amzallag frequently caters prolific events for over 800 guests at a time, which requires her expert leadership skills to not only develop the event’s happenings, but oversee the flawless production of up to 5,000 petits fours (appetizers) for every sitting. Commenting on the ingredients to her success, Amzallag says, “Attention to detail is essential. I have such prestigious clients so everything always needs to be perfect.” Approaching each catering gig with the utmost precision and care, Margot Amzallag’s management style and mouth-watering menus not only drives the event’s success, but has many other industry leaders clamoring to collaborate with her and praising her notable industry contributions. “Margot has a resume that rivals some of the best chefs in Paris or Los Angeles. With her creativity, she was able to craft menus and execute dishes that were beyond amazing. The difficulty in this industry is finding key people that have creative talent as well as an understanding of scale and cost, which Margot possesses,” explains Farm Cup Coffee owner Emerson Haro, who collaborated with Amzallag on several large scale events in the city. “Few other people could design such inventive menus and large-scale dining experiences, while simultaneously possessing the skills to direct employees, purchase all the produce, rent all the equipment and set up a line for us to use for the event in a quick turnaround time, as Margot did. Without her we would have lost out on a tremendous amount of money from these events.” Margot Amzallag's food at Le Salon Du Panthéon There’s no question that Amzallag’s innovative food operations are revolutionizing the catering industry. Most recently, she was offered the exclusive caterer’s position at “Le Salon du Panthéon,” a renowned French restaurant owned by the Oscar-nominated French actress Catherine Deneuve (“Indochine”). She also curated a health conscious menu which featured a salmon poké bowl and aloe tea for ELLE Magazine’s prestigious two day wellness event “Elle Zen Days,” which prompted the organizers to hire Amzallag to cater many more events. Much like the craze of the cronut or cauliflower pizza crust, innovative fusion food is here to stay--and just like the delicate French camembert, it will only get better over time. With her European roots and curiosity for creating new culinary experiences, Margot Amzallag continues to pioneer new, mouthwatering dishes and ever-expanding culinary operations, meaning us foodies get to look forward to many more exciting and innovative à la carte items to come. © 2021 EntertainmentNewsToday"
293,Instant Pot Pumpkin Soup,food," With 50 years around the sun, Kimberly enjoys sharing a variety of her personal life experiences with others. ""Photo author's own"" Who doesn't enjoy the cozy comforts that a homemade bowl of creamy soup brings to the table once the seasons change to brilliant colors of orange, yellow, and gold? I'll share a generalized recipe I tossed together one autumn afternoon, creating delicious creamy pumpkin soup. If you need a specific formula to follow, then this may not be for you. I like to use wholesome natural ingredients to make tasty seasonal meals; however, my cooking is done by random measurements and tossing a little of this and little of that into a pot and seasoning to taste. ""Photo author's own"" Good soup is one of the prime ingredients of good living. — Loius P. De Gouy Twas the season to visit my local pumpkin patch for some fresh pumpkins. Since childhood, I have enjoyed making roasted pumpkin seeds during the Autumn Pumpkin Harvest. During my ten years of living off-grid, I enjoyed fire-roasted pumpkin seeds cooked to perfection over my homestead firepit. This year, since moving back on-grid, I acquired a few electrical appliances; the Air Fryer is one of them; that roasted my pumpkin seeds to a superbly delicious golden brown in a fraction of the time and effort it used to take over the open flame. ""Photo owner's own"" ""Photo author's own"" As the old proverbial saying goes, ""Waste Not, Want Not"" I couldn't toss my pumpkins out after using them for their seeds, which brings us to speed on the need to make creamy pumpkin soup on the fly! ""Disclosure: Some of the links below are affiliate links. This means that, at zero cost to you, I will earn an affiliate commission if you click through the link and finalize a purchase."" ""Photo author's own"" Worries go down better with soup — Jewish Proverb I cut away the thick outer skin from my leftover pumpkins, leaving the inner orange flesh and cubed into small chunks. I wasn't worried about measurements; I just tossed in what I had. Next, I washed and peeled a few carrots before cutting them into similar-sized chunks as the pumpkin pieces. I proceeded by adding celery, onion, and several cloves of crushed garlic to my one-pot meal. I added about 3 cups of vegetable broth and a cup of water to the ingredients before cooking for mere minutes. ""Photo author's own"" Once all my desired ingredients were in the pot, I placed my lid on correctly and pressure cooked for 5-8 minutes. Mine was quite full, so pressure cooked for 8 minutes. I used the quick release on the instant pot after cooking. Once my ingredients were pressure-cooked, I allowed the mixture to cool down a little before transferring the soup to my blender. I added a can of full-fat coconut milk to my soup to give it a more creamy smooth finish. One could also use an immersion blender or stick blender for a chunkier texture. It's all about personal preference at this point. Happiness is owning an Instant Pot and making hot soup on a cold day! I blended my ingredients to my desired consistency; I seasoned my creamy pumpkin soup to taste with herbs, peppercorn, and a Pink Himalayan Garlic and Onion Salt blend. The longest part of this soup-making process was prepping my pumpkin pieces, but in the end, it was well worth it. If you are in the mood for pumpkin soup and don't have fresh pumpkins or the time to commit to fleshing out the fresh ones, you could use canned pumpkin puree and still enjoy the same delicious satisfaction of homecooked soup.

294,Persimmons  - an Acquired Taste for Me,food," After reading the reviews, I'm not convinced I wanted to try it..mom sent some home with me, and they sat there for a few days. Then my kid called and said that she and her kid tried one. She said they were a cross between a papaya and a peach. So, I cut one of mine open and took a bite. It was ok. Not super good, just kind of ok. My hubby tried a piece as well. At least we can say we tried it.  So, I have 2 left if anyone wants to try them. Perhaps I will bring them tomorrow."
295,Say “Cheese” for the Holidays: A Quick and Easy Guide to a Savory Cheese Board,food," As the holidays roll around, entertaining family and friends takes center stage. For many of us the holiday cheese board is a star player in the food festivities, yet with the plethora of choices available at local markets, assembling it can prove a bit daunting. We've taken some of the guesswork out of it for you by providing several tips listed below to help ease in the process. For presentation purposes, select cheeses that differ in color, shape, and size. Next, when calculating the amount of cheese to purchase, three ounces per guest is a solid guideline. Thus, if you’re serving three types of cheese and entertaining twelve guests, you should buy at least twelve ounces of each type. If other appetizers will be served, the amount of cheese per guest can be reduced to two ounces. In general, three different types of cheese—a hard, a semi-hard, and a soft—will provide ample variety for most events. AGED GOUDA This Dutch cheese is always a strong player on any cheese board. If you prefer a sharper, nuttier flavor with those delicious salty bits, opt for a Gouda aged at least 10 months. Many of the premier Goudas will be aged up to 18 months or more. Top brands include Beemster, Parrano, and Rembrandt. MANCHEGO A full-bodied cheese made from sheep’s milk, this Spanish cheese from the La Mancha region is creamy yet nutty with toasty nuances. Aged Manchego has a wonderful granular texture much like aged Gouda, and will be a superb compliment to fruit, and meats such as prosciutto, salami, and capicola. CHEDDAR A good aged cheddar is always a welcome member of any cheese board. American, English, and Irish cheddars are all fantastic choices providing slightly different characteristics. In general, the longer cheddar is aged the sharper the flavor. Tillamook, Kerrygold, and Cabot are all fine choices. FONTINA Originally from Italy, this versatile cheese features a sweet and pungent character nuanced with tones of butter and roasted nuts. It is rich and creamy with an intensity of flavor that increases with age. Sartori, Stella, and Boar’s Head are all excellent brands. COMPTÉ One of the most popular French cheeses, this creamy, mild cheese is a pleasing addition to any cheese board as it blends well with bolder flavored meats and preserves while adding a luxurious undertone. Jura Flore, Fort Rousses, and St. Antoine are all quality brands. Trader Joe’s Comté is also an excellent value. BRIE Soft, creamy, with a musky complexion, this French cheese is spreadable and delicious slathered on bread or crackers. Try it warmed and melted. Excellent brands are President, La Bonne Vie, Dietz and Watson. Marin French is a quality domestic brand. CAMEMBERT Another soft spreadable cheese that hails from the Normandy region of France, is Camembert. Not quite as creamy as Brie, it is less pungent, and pale yellow in color. Often celebrated as the most popular cheese of France. For festive additions consider cranberry cheeses such as Wensleydale or Celebrity. Crave truffles? Explore the many varieties of truffled cheeses on the market. Murray’s offers a selection of truffled specialties which include a truffled Brie, and truffled Gouda. Many manned cheese counters have helpful customer service representatives that are happy to offer samples and suggestions. Take advantage of the opportunity to expand your culinary knowledge."
296,The Reasons Why Fast Food Restaurants Are So Popular,food," Fast food restaurants are everywhere. In the USA they are surely popular, as most of the iconic international chains come from here, but at the fact they are successful in several parts of the world. Even here in Italy it is not uncommon to find long queues at  some branches of famouses American burger brands and less people inside other kinds of places. The success of fast food is undoubtedly high and several reasons are at the basis of the popularity of these restaurants. Some products exposed at the counter of a fast food restaurant. In the USA it is not uncommon to find fast food products at a very cheap price while, at the opposite, healthy and organic items are generally very expensive. This is even true at the supermarket, and at the fact the USA even feature different chains of markets, some of them more targeted to low-budget fast food items and some others for people who prefer to spend more in order to get healthy food. In Italy we don’t have this big gap between healthy and junk food and even supermarkets tend not to be particularly targeted: here healthy food is not a luxury and almost everyone can afford to buy fruits, vegetables and biological stuff, still, when it comes to restaurants, we still have fast food chains selling stuff at very low prices compared to those of traditional restaurants with table-service. There are several reasons behind these low prices, including a strong bargaining power towards the suppliers (thanks to the great popularity of the fast food brand) and the big volume of customers that makes it possible to lower the mark up on the single items. Most people love the taste of fast food. Sandwiches are often caloric and loaded of sauces, while side dishes like French fries or nuggets meet the taste of several people. There is a general love for the taste of fried stuff and of caloric food. This is added to the love for pastries, and in fact fast food restaurants often feature also a wide selection of ice creams, donuts, croissants, cakes and other sugary stuff. Some pastries exposed in a fast food restaurant. The biggest fast food chains are generally very aggressive when it comes to invest in marketing. They put much money into TV commercials, internet ads, social media marketing and promotions inside food delivery apps. There are several reasons behind this huge investment in marketing: Nuggets are another very popular item at fast food restaurants. They are usually vegetarian or with chicken meat. In general, the success of fast food restaurants lays in a mix of strong marketing techniques, ability to keep the prices low and the fact their food is loved by most people. Plus, they are usually family friendly and also good for students, workers and people who want to eat something without spending too much. And you, do you like going to fast food restaurants or do you prefer other kinds of places? © 2021 Alessio Ganci"
297,Delicious Soya Chunk Curry - Indian Style,food," Umesh is a freelance writer contributing his creative writings on varied subjects in various sites and portals in the internet. Self Soybean is a very good source of protein and obviously, soya chunks also provide the same to us. In fact, soya chunks are made by removing the oil from the soybean by a defatting process. They are not only a very good source of protein but also have good dietary fibre. As oil is removed the soya chunks appear rough and dry but become soft and spongy as soon as they are put in water. Soya chunks are used in various dishes like dry vegetables, vegetable curries, vegetable salads, sauteed snacks etc. They have got numerous health benefits and are effective in lowering the bad cholesterol in our bodies. In this article, we would be learning to prepare Indian style soya chunk curry which is a main meal item and can be taken during the main meals along with other accompaniments like bread and rice. We have used a microwave oven to prepare this dish but one can cook it in a conventional manner using a hot plate or stove. The quantity of the ingredients for this recipe is mentioned below and the quantity of this dish prepared by using these would suffice for 4-5 persons when taken along with other food items during the main meals. Soak the soya chunks in 1 to 2 cups of water for about 1 hour so that they become fluffy and soft. Peel onions, potato, ginger, and garlic cloves and cut them into small pieces and keep them separately. In place of cutting, onions can be chopped fine also. Cut tomatoes also into small pieces or chop them. Break the cloves each into 2-3 parts. Break the red chilly into 2-3 parts. Cut the green coriander leaves finely or chop them. Take a microwave bowl (generally we use the glass one) of medium to large size depending on how big a bowl, the microwave oven, you are having in your house, can accommodate conveniently. If you want to prepare less amount of this dish then take a small to medium bowl and reduce the quantity of ingredients proportionately. Pour cooking oil in the bowl and add the chopped or finely cut onions, garlic, ginger, gram flour, cumin seeds, coriander powder, turmeric powder (optional), carom seeds, mango powder, fennel seeds, Indian Sabji masala (optional), red chilly (optional), cloves, salt to taste, and half quantity of the chopped green coriander leaves. Mix them and keep the bowl in the microwave and cook for 3 to 4 minutes in the first or second heat range. Take the bowl out and at this instant, it would look like picture-1 and now add soya chunks and potato pieces to it. Keep the bowl back and cook for a period of 3 to 4 minutes. Now take out the bowl and the dish so far will look like picture-2. Now add tomato pieces and water to about 3 to 4 cups and keep back the bowl in the oven and cook for another 8 to 10 minutes. Take the bowl out and the dish is ready (Picture-3). Sprinkle the remaining chopped green coriander leaves on the dish for presentation before serving (picture-4). Self Self Self Self Soya curry can be served in small and deep bowls or medium-sized flat bowls. It goes well with boiled rice or bread. It is relished well when it is hot. Based on the calorific values of the individual items used in this dish the calorie value of a single serving comes to about 48 calories/serving. The oilless version will have about 32 calories/serving. Further, adding cream and tomato sauce will slightly increase the calories. Adding mashed boiled potatoes to the curry for thickening it will further increase the calories. Microwave ovens usually have 4 to 5 heat ranges available from very high to very low and one can use a particular range for a particular purpose. For curries and dry vegetables 'very high' or 'high' setting is preferred. I generally use the 'high' setting and find it more convenient than the 'very high' one. Water present in the vegetables and water added from outside before keeping the bowl in the microwave is a crucial factor in microwave cooking and one has to be very careful in this aspect. As a rule of thumb when one is making a dry vegetable for 3-4 persons then one cup of water is sufficient and of course, for curries, there is no problem and one can add more water. The problem comes only in the cases of dry vegetables when water is less and the heat of the microwave starts charring the vegetables sometimes even burning them with heat to make them almost like coal. So it is highly advisable that when water is added in less quantity say half a cup or 3/4 cup then one must pause the oven just 3-4 minutes before the end time and see if there is too much dryness and then add some more water (say 1/4 cup or so) at that point of time. It would save the dish from accidental charring.

299,Kaszka Breakfast Recipe,food," I used to work in my family's restaurant and helped run it. I love good food, and I've cooked family meals for over 60 years. We are blessed with lots of international food shops where I live in Lodon and can buy a huge variety of international foods. There is a grocery nearby which specialises in Polish food and among other thngs I noticed some kaszka. I recognized the name--it is a cereal powder based on rice. I didn't know what it was like, but as I enjoy experimenting with food, I bought a packet.  Even though the only instructions were in Polish, there were illustrations on the packaging so I was not completely in the dark, and, of course, one can find information about most things on the internet, so it was only a minor risk.  I had also recently bought a carton of Alpro coconut milk for the first time, so I decided to combine them. I ladled a couple of tablespoons of kaszka into a cereal bowl and added some warm milk and combined the two ingredients to produce a smooth paste, which tasted quite nice. It was unexpectedly sweet, and was very similar to my usual rice pudding, but quite a bit smoother. You can buy kaszka from local Polish or International stores. It costs about £3 a kilogram and consists of rice based cereal powder. Using a bit more of the packet, I tried out making the kaszka base into a nice cereal instead of a pudding, so I so I repeated the quantity of kaszka but added Alpro coconut milk together with some dried fruit (consisting of chopped dates raisins and Cranberries) mixed in with some flaked coconut. I then microwaved the mixture for one minute to warm it. It was a success and definitely worth having again for a quick and easy breakfast. 5 min 1 min 6 min Serves 1 person The final version of a very tasty breakfast--Bon Appetit! Diana Grant"

Use oil first time, then you can choose to use oil or not on your second cooking. No cooking sprays!! Wash with soap and water. Metal utensils, but no sharp pointed objects. Don't cook and leave your pan alone. If you burn your pan, leave it on the burner, shut off burner and allow pan to cool with burner.  Okay. Now to cook something. Maybe tomorrow."

303,Essential Wines for Your Holiday Table,food," Have you ever stood in the wine aisle of your local grocers during the holidays baffled as to the appropriate wine for meals featuring poultry, beef, pork, or seafood—not to mention the array of appetizers and side dishes? Six wines listed below are flexible enough to compliment your holiday cuisine for any item on the menu. Also referred to as “Sancerre” in France, this medium-light bodied white wine is a winner. It features a crisp, herbal profile perfect for turkey, goose, chicken, or seafood. A more full-bodied white, Chardonnay is an excellent partner to roast poultry, or fish. Likewise, Chardonnay pairs beautifully with beef, should you have guests who prefer to drink only white. In this case, opt for an oak-forward Chardonnay, as it will enhance the robust flavors of the beef. Not as well-known as other whites, Viognier is a fantastic partner to roast turkey and other poultry dishes. Rounded in body with undertones of honey and spice, some of the best Viognier comes from the Rhone region of France, as well as Australia, and South Africa. Like Chardonnay, Viognier can also play well with beef. With its bright acidity and versatile nature, Pinot Noir is one of the best choices for the holidays. It excels across the board with poultry, pork, and hearty beef dishes. The Pacific Northwest and California offer many solid choices with fruit-forward characteristics sure to please even the most discriminating palates. Red Zinfandel has long been considered a great Thanksgiving wine for its ability to compliment turkey while also blending well with cranberry sauce and other sides. Its fruit-forward profile, along with notes of cinnamon, clove, and vanilla evoke the holiday season. Zinfandel also performs admirably with beef and pork, should your holiday dinner include a roast or baked ham. Another fabulous red wine with beef is Syrah (known as Shiraz in Australia). This luscious red bursts with complex flavors from pepper to cherry, smoky to floral. In general, Syrah, made in France’s Rhone Valley is known more for its elegance and complexity, while Shiraz is bolder and more fruit-driven. If beef is on the menu, you can’t go wrong with Syrah. Cabernet Sauvignon, the “King of Reds,” is the ultimate pairing for beef. Cabernet’s dark, full-bodied character, often reminiscent of currants and black cherry, enhances the hearty flavors of such entrees as prime rib or crown roast. Let’s say you’ve been invited to a holiday event and wish to bring a bottle of wine, but you’re uncertain of the menu. The safest choices might be Pinot Noir or Chardonnay. Both wines have versatility across a broad spectrum of entrees, and will be welcome additions to the holiday table. All of these featured wines are readily available at your local markets where helpful staff can assist you in determining the best selections and values based on your individual tastes and budget."

The burger started off as two thousand pounds of ground beef and then was cooked down to a lean 1774, before having 300 pounds of onions, pickles lettuce, and cheese piled. then wedged in between a 250-pound bun, Maui had to custom make an oven large enough to handle the hunk of meat.

314,How to Make the Perfect Cup of Ramen,food," Ramen may not be the healthiest snack around, but with a few simple steps and tasty additions, it can be both quick and pretty good! Ramen is a very simple snack to prepare, right? You just put it in a pot with a couple of cups of water, toss in the flavor packet and boil it for three minutes! Right? Well, you could do it that way if you wanted cloudy broth filled with the waxy coating that holds the noodles in that classic square shape in the packaging. You could do it that way if you wanted the noodles to soak up the salt in the broth causing them to be salty and the broth to be bland.  To avoid these problems, I use two pots when cooking ramen. I cook the noodles in one pot for 2 minutes, strain and rinse them and then add them to the second pot to finish cooking for one minute. Remove the pot from the heat and then stir in the flavor packet for one minute. This results in cleaner, clearer, more flavorful broth and tastier noodles.  That's the simple iteration of this cooking method. To make it better, I also add some dehydrated veggies, a bit of sesame oil to the broth and a pat of butter to the noodles and veggies. In the photos below, I show you how! You'll need 2 pots with lids, 2 strainers, medium and small, a packet of ramen noodles and some dehydrated veggies. Suzanne Bennett Put two cups of water in each pot and turn the burners on high. Put a lid on the pot you intend to use for noodles. Suzanne Bennett Add dehydrated veggies to your liking to the second pot. I'm using a large pinch each of celery, bell peppers and carrots. Suzanne Bennett Bell Peppers Suzanne Bennett Carrots Suzanne Bennett Put the lid on the second pot and wait (if necessary) for both pots to boil. Suzanne Bennett When the water in the noodle pot comes to a boil, add the noodles and set a timer for two minutes. Suzanne Bennett After you've placed the noodles in the water, reduce the heat under both pots to medium just to allow it to simmer down a bit. You want a gentle simmer at this point, not a rolling boil. Suzanne Bennett When your two minute timer goes off, strain the noodles and rinse them with hot water. Suzanne Bennett Add the noodles to the simmering veggies, cover the pot and let the veggies and noodles cook together. Set a timer for one minute. Suzanne Bennett Put a couple of drops of sesame oil in large (2 cup) mug. Suzanne Bennett When your one minute timer goes off, turn off the heat under the noodles and veggies and add the flavor packet. Suzanne Bennett Stir the flavor packet into the mix for a full minute. Set a timer. Suzanne Bennett Strain the broth into your mug. Suzanne Bennett Put the noodles and veggies into a bowl and add a pat of butter. Eat your noodles with a fork and drink your broth!

315,7 Vegetables With Vitamins and Minerals That Will Increase Your Energy,food," I am Muhammad Anjum — the writer, and the promoter. My words have touched millions over the past two decades through my diverse audience vegetables Share Alike 4.0 ,wikimedia There are many reasons to include more vegetables in your diet. You can get vitamins and minerals, protein, fiber, and so much more. Vegetables also come with low-calorie counts, making them an easy addition to any weight loss plan without feeling deprived. Here are 7 vegetables that you should be including in your diet if you want to increase your energy levels. If you're trying to improve your energy levels, these are some of the main vegetables that can help. Greens like spinach, kale, and broccoli are low in calories and high in nutrients and minerals. If you're not sure which greens you like, try boiling them until tender for a simple way to cut down on calories Green vegetable Maggie Hoffman,CC BY 2.0,creativecommon Mushrooms are high in protein and fiber, making them a great source of amino acids. A study found that mushrooms can help improve blood sugar control in people with diabetes. Green and purple leaves are packed with vitamin C, potassium, fiber, and folate. Also, spinach can help protect against several types of cancer. This prolific bulb helps stimulate the production of digestive enzymes 1. Kale Kale is high in vitamin A, C, folate, manganese, and beta carotene. It also has moderate levels of vitamin C, vitamin K, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and vitamin E. A study by the USDA found that cruciferous vegetables such as kale, collard greens, mustard greens, broccoli, and cabbage protect against some cancers and heart disease. Kale contains phytochemicals that are anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer, and reduce inflammation in the body. People who ate 30 grams of raw kale per day had much lower levels of cortisol in their blood and lower levels of insulin. The phytochemicals in kale can reduce inflammation and also benefit your body's insulin sensitivity, which is one of the contributing factors to weight gain. The key to getting the most from your vegetables is to choose the right ones. Most vegetables contain a significant amount of carbohydrates, so to improve your energy levels you need to choose those that are high in protein. A good example is an asparagus. This vegetable contains 8 grams of protein per serving and boasts high levels of lysine and glutamine. Sliced Vegetables by polina,pexel If you choose to eat fewer carbs, you will feel fuller faster and have fewer cravings. Plant-based diets also tend to be lower in fat, making vegetables a good choice if you are trying to control your weight. The dark green asparagus spear is a great food choice when it comes to increasing energy levels. The unique shape of the spear is what makes asparagus an excellent source of protein. Everyone knows about iron. It's what carries oxygen throughout our body. It's a key component to a healthy blood system. It's also a key nutrient for keeping our energy levels steady throughout the day. Why? Because a high amount of iron can actually make us feel tired. The good news is that when we talk about high iron foods, we're talking about foods like beef, pork, chicken, and wild game. Most of the grains are also higher in iron. For example, oatmeal is a great source, but it's also high in fiber. We need fiber to be full, and we need it to stay full. A small amount is fine, but too much will actually make us feel fatigued. Quinoa is a very popular grain that's high in iron. It's also high in fiber, so it's filling and keeps us full for a long time. Eating the right variety of fruits and vegetables is important, but it's especially important to make sure you are getting enough of vitamin A. Vitamin A is an important nutrient for skin and eyes, as well as maintaining your brain health. Eating a diet rich in vitamin A can help boost your energy, improve your mood, and even improve your sleep, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Although most of us don't consume enough vitamin A in our daily diet, it's a nutrient we can include as a superfood for managing a cold. Get more vitamin A by eating these foods in the form of supplements. Although you should always take a multivitamin to ensure your body is getting all of the nutrients it needs, adding kale to your diet is another good way to get more of vitamin A.

316,Marriage of Western Dessert with Indian Sweet,food," N.Srikanth is a Lecturer,Pastry & Bakery and 
Advance European Confectionery
working at Culinary Academy Of india. Marriage – is an official name for a bond of love between two people which lasts a lifetime. Marriage brings together individuals with different personalities in terms of thoughts, physical appearance, mental ability, culture, country, region, etc. Together, both become more than their selves. This is not limited to just people; food and cultures often become interlocked in a marriage-like relationship. This has resulted in technological culinary advancements, new recipes being discovered, and fresh food pairings. This evolution in food can largely be attributed to globalization, overlapping cultures, and social media trends. One such culinary marriage is that of Western desserts with Indian sweets—the best part—foodies the world over love this marriage. And true to the spirit of any celebration, sweets and desserts are part of the occasion. But before we explore the culinary delicacies that have emerged from this fusion, let’s understand what each culture brought to the dining table. In India, sweets, commonly referred to as mithai, are a traditional part of the culture and are synonymous with celebrations. A characteristic feature of Indian cuisine is its unique flavor and adventurous cooking methods - sweets are no different. Many of these confections have interesting stories associated with them, and some date back to periods before written literature was made famous. The Halwai or sweet-maker has been a reputed part of the Indian kitchen, and these professionals spend years mastering their craft.  What’s more, Indian sweets vary significantly by region, religion, celebration, and occasion. Each region has its specialty, and every festival has a companion sweet. That said, Indian sweets typically consist of milk or flour as the primary ingredient, along with sugar and ghee. Most Indian sweets are served either hot or at room temperature, although the cold sweet range is expansive in itself. Dry fruits and silver warq perform the role of garnishes in Indian sweets. On the other hand, Western desserts arose as the last meal course and became an integral part of celebrations. The desserts that are traditionally celebratory are usually large or consisting of detailed work. Western desserts typically also consist of flour, milk, butter, cream, and chocolate as essential ingredients, but their use is entirely different from Indian sweets. It’s also hard to narrow down the geography or origin of Western desserts as this term includes French, British, German, and American desserts.  Western desserts also usually require many types of equipment, thermometers, and other culinary equipment to get the recipe right. This equipment is hard to find in typical households in India and is usually reserved for quality restaurants and hotels. Due to this equipment availability, local sweet makers have adopted Western techniques and processes and infused them with Indian flavors. As a result, we now see both these cultures coming together in one unique dish. The fundamental difference between Indian sweets and Western desserts lies in their primary function and product size, usually large. Also, Indian sweets are sweeter and texturally minimal. They also typically are made with readily available ingredients that aren’t extremely costly. Additionally, traditional Indian sweets don’t require restaurant-grade machinery or any sophisticated equipment. That said, the results of the cross-cultural exposure have given rise to an entirely new array of desserts in India. Creativity and flavor pairings are evolving in a less-traveled direction and creating one-of-a-kind culinary experiences like piping whipped malai on top of chamcham or gateaux with the Indian flavors of Gulab Jamun or Rasmalai. This simple marriage of Western desserts and Indian sweets has yielded a wide variety of dishes. Although most underlying techniques are Western, Indian methods are essential for obtaining results too. Ingredients are chosen either from India or the Western world depending on the suitability and availability of substitutes. Examples of such dishes include the Till-Gud Cake, Gulab-nut (doughnut-shaped gulab jamun), Gajarhalwa Swiss Roll. However, this is not just a non-sensical fusion. As mentioned previously, Indian sweets are usually extremely sweet and heavy. By incorporating flavors, elements, and techniques from the West, contemporary Indian cuisine restaurants lighten the actual sweets while satisfying the Indian flavor palate. This has resulted in some genuinely scrumptious recipes like chocolate chikki bars, coffee rasagullas, and soft caramel patissas. The pinnacle of such fusion can be seen in elevating traditional Indian sweets with techniques aptly used from either the Indian or the Western repertoire to create textural variation, visual appeal, and old and new flavors. This is particularly evident in dishes like Misti Doi Cannelles, Glazed Kalakand, Hazelnut Bouches, Layered Barfis, and many more.  Both Indian sweets and Western desserts are highly skillful areas that require expertise, and bonding them together (if appropriately executed) will lead to a myriad of new textures and flavors.

318,Thinking About Going Vegan? Here's a Vegan Beginner's Guide,food," Did you know the term ""veganism"" was coined less than 60 years ago?
However, it has been a cultural practice for thousands of years. Did you know the term ""veganism"" was coined less than 60 years ago? However, it has been a cultural practice for thousands of years. It's only become a life-shift for people in recent times -- and for a good reason. Keep reading to find out more about making the transition in this vegan beginner's guide. What Does ""Vegan"" Mean? Being vegetarian is the practice of not eating meat. Veganism is a step further, excluding all animal-based products from your diet. This includes fish, eggs, dairy, milk, cheese, and more. Some vegans take this to the furthest extent, refraining from eating honey because it's a bee byproduct. Additionally, veganism is often adopted as a lifestyle. Some people choose to avoid animal products all-together by staying away from leather and cruelty-free cosmetics. The degree to which a person takes their veganism mostly depends on the reason they're doing it. Why Go Vegan? Aside from cultural norms, there are several reasons as to why people choose to become vegan. It typically centers around health, compassion, or environmental factors. However, it could be a combination of these things or none at all -- it can vary from person to person. Health Benefits Many people refrain from eating animal byproducts in hopes to better their health. Red meat, for example, is thought to increase your risk of getting various preventable diseases if you eat it too frequently. On the flip side, veganism may potentially protect our bodies against diseases like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and type-2 diabetes. Compassion Another reason people choose to go vegan is to avoid participating in the livestock industry. It's not hard to find videos online of the dark underbelly of massive farms that raise chickens, cows, and pigs for consumption. Unless you buy from a local, organic farm, the chances are that you are buying animal products from a place that hosts animals in horrific conditions. So, many people choose to go vegan out of compassion so that they aren't supporting an industry that treats animals poorly. Environmental Reasons Finally, some people choose to go vegan due to the negative impacts of the livestock industry on the environment. The production of livestock for meat and animal byproducts accounts for 14.5 percent of the harmful greenhouse gas emissions added to the atmosphere. This is more than the transportation industry alone. Therefore, many people choose to go vegan to avoid supporting adding harmful emissions to our world. The thought is that using land for vegetables takes up less space, less water, and less harm to the planet compared to livestock. You may resonate with some of the ideas or you may simply be curious about trying a new dietary lifestyle. Either way, keep reading to get a breakdown of how you can make the transition -- no matter what your reason is. A Vegan Beginner's Guide Now that you know the what and the why behind choosing a vegan diet, all that's left is to describe how you can do it. These suggestions are not definitive but help a wide variety of people making the transition, so they are worth trying. In addition to these tips, try to learn as much as you can from various resources. Check out this vegan diet plan for additional pointers. Think About Adding Rather Than Subtracting Instead of focusing on what you aren't eating, focus on what you will be eating more of. The following foods will be your sources of nutrition: Include a variety of these foods in your day-to-day diet so that you get a well-rounded source of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. During your transition, you may also want to take a nutrition supplement to ensure your dietary needs are being met while you adjust. Do a Little Research Get excited about your new diet habits by researching new recipes and ideas to try out. It's helpful to save a vegan substitution guide so that you can turn non-vegan meals into animal-free ones simply by substituting a few ingredients. That way, you aren't limited to researching vegan-only recipes. Depending on the extent you wish to become vegan, you may also want to do research into the hidden animal ingredients in processed products. You can find a comprehensive list of common ingredients to look out for in sauces, candies, and various other products you may think are already ""vegan"" but aren't. It's important to note that you don't have to go to this extent unless you want to. You can avoid the obvious animal products and still eat things like gummy candies if you so please. It's all up to you. Prepare Ahead of Time While you're making the transition into becoming a vegan, it's helpful to start simple and give yourself plenty of snacks throughout the day. Start by making simple stir-fry, salad, soups, and sandwiches for your main meals. Over time, you can progress to recreating non-vegan meals with vegan substitutes. You can also keep easy snacks handy wherever you go, like nuts and fruit, so that you stay on track and have options on hand. Decide Where You Want to Fall On the Spectrum By defining why and how you're making the transition, you can decide for yourself where you want to fall on the spectrum of being vegan. This will give you an idea of what to expect and how to prepare. Even if you go off track or accidentally eat animal products (or intentionally do it every once in a while), try not to give yourself a hard time. It's not a one-day switch—it's a lifestyle transformation that will continue to develop, normalize, and become more exciting over time. Make It Your Own With this vegan beginner's guide, you can make a smooth transition into a new lifestyle. Considering we are all unique people with unique bodies, how you transition into becoming a vegan is all up to you. Take tips and advice from various places and find the ways that work best for you.

328,Go Nuts for Nuts as a Healthy Snack,food," Margaret Minnicks is a health-conscious person who researches the health benefits of foods and drinks. (Photo designed by Canva) Nuts are very healthy, but different nuts have different health benefits. With such a wide variety of nuts available, you have many choices. Therefore, you should keep nuts on hand for times when you want to eat a low-calorie snack that is not loaded with sugar or salt. Nuts are a convenient snack to keep on hand for all family members. They are also easy to take with you when you go out. You can keep them in your desk drawer at work to snack on during the day. According to theMayo Clinic, nuts are cholesterol-free and are packed with protein and fiber. That way you feel full for a long time, and you are less likely to fill up on other snacks that are not as healthy. Nuts also contain vitamins, minerals, and unsaturated fats. Those are the good fats that will help lower bad cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Nuts also contain healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Don't expect nuts to provide health benefits if they are covered with salt, sugar, or chocolate. Check out the alphabetical list of nuts below to find some interesting information about nuts as well as which type of nuts you should eat for your particular health needs. Even though almonds are nuts, they are related to peaches and apricots which are fruits. According to the USDA, almonds contain more fiber than any of the other nuts. Four grams of fiber in a one-ounce serving are enough to lower the risk of some types of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. They also have properties that keep good bacteria in the gut. If you are trying to lose weight, snack on almonds. The fiber in them makes you feel full and causes you to eat less. Brazil nuts out of the shells (Photo via Pixabay( Brazil nuts are delicious and healthy to eat. They are large and meaty with a good source of vitamin E, minerals, and selenium. In fact, Brazil nuts have the highest amount of selenium of any of the nuts. That's good news for the one billion people worldwide who have a selenium deficiency. Just one ounce of Brazil nuts provides antioxidants to the body. That means people are just six Brazil nuts away from getting rid of their deficiency. Then they will have more energy and be in a much better mood. By the way, you don't have to be Brazilian to love the nuts. By definition, cashews are seeds and not nuts even though people refer to them and eat them as nuts. The crescent-shaped seeds can be eaten as they are, or they can be put in salads and added to dishes for a crunchy taste. Some people love them because they are delicious and contain healthy fiber, protein, fats, magnesium, iron, and zinc. Cashews may lower LDL, the bad cholesterol in people with high levels. You might have noticed that hazelnuts look like acorns. They are known to improve cardiovascular health and help to manage type 2 diabetes because of their high levels of monounsaturated fats and several antioxidants. They can help protect against certain types of cancer, heart disease, and inflammatory diseases. Like cashews, one ounce of hazelnuts can lower LDL, which may also protect your heart. Macadamia nuts are so rich in flavor that it is hard to think of them as nuts rather than as a dessert. They are used as an ingredient in cookies and other desserts. As seen in the chart below, macadamia nuts contain more calories than any of the other nuts. They also contain the highest counts of heart-healthy monounsaturated fat per serving. Macadamia nuts are the third type of nuts on this list that help lower LDL, the bad cholesterol. They also help lower blood pressure. Pecans are good to eat just as they are, but about 78 pecans are usually baked in the average pecan pie. Those nuts have antioxidants that may help prevent plaque from forming in the arteries for a healthier heart. If the rich and buttery nut is eaten every day for just four weeks, they can help diabetics maintain a healthy blood glucose level. Pecans also can help prevent the risk of high blood pressure and some cancers. Just one ounce of pecans contains more than 19 vitamins and minerals and about 20 grams of monounsaturated fats that are good for the heart. A true nut comes from trees and not from the ground. Therefore, peanuts are not nuts because they come from the ground. They actually belong to the legume family. They are listed with nuts because people think of them and eat them as nuts. In fact, peanuts have similar nutrient and health benefits just as tree nuts. Peanuts may improve heart disease and lower the risk of type 2 diabetes, especially if the peanuts are plain, unflavored, and unsalted. Pistachios are one of the most popular nuts to snack on. They are high in potassium with a green color because of chlorophyll. They are low in calories but packed with lots of healthy ingredients, including vitamin B, vitamin K, copper, manganese, and folate. Pistachios can lower the risk of cancer and heart disease. Walnuts were considered to be good for intelligence in ancient times. An article published in the journal Nutrients says that eating a daily serving of walnuts can improve intelligence because they are loaded with omega-3 fatty acids that help to improve brain health. Walnuts also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, depression, and type 2 diabetes. The nuts also have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties which are healthy for the body. Walnuts contain the highest antioxidant content of any of the nuts. Also, they fight inflammation because they have the most omega-3 fatty acids.

331,Pork Cutlets - Battered and Fried,food," Before I begin gushing about how delicious they are, let me admit something. They didn't work out quite like I dreamed. But, that being said, they were good.. The line up. Gluten free seasoned rice flour. Egg wash: egg with 1/4 cup water. Chopped rice. Dip pork cutlet in the rice. Then, moisten on both sides with the egg wash. Then, generously coat with the chopped, [raw] rice. Meanwhile, I decided to use buffet fryer because it has a temperature dial. Put a little canola oil and a chunk of butter in the pan. Kept changing my mind about the temperature. The coating fries ok, but the rice needs water to soften. Started frying at 350 degrees. Place coated cutlets into oil. Let them remain frying for about 10 minutes. Check for color. I wanted mine to be a golden brown. I tested the temperature at this point, and the temperature was ""in the range"", so, I took a bite. Rice not done. Sigh. So, I added two cups of water to boil the rice. Set timer for 10 minutes. Tasted another piece, needed more time. Flipped cutlets over and set timer for another 10 minutes. This is when I read the rice package and discovered that the rice needed to be cooked for 20 minutes. Rice is done. Time to eat. The pork chop is still moist and tender. Yum!"

334,Cabbage Carrots and Corn Combine - a Dry Vegetable Recipe,food," Umesh is a freelance writer contributing his creative writings on varied subjects in various sites and portals in the internet. Dry vegetable dishes are an integral part of the food in most households across the globe as well as the food served at parties, functions, and get-to-gather. These dishes can be made in a variety of ways and can be customised as per the taste and interest of the people of a particular area. The different ingredients will give different tastes but the taste also depends on the spices used and the method of cooking followed to prepare a particular dish. There are subtle variations in the same dish from place to place depending upon the spices used. In this recipe, we would be learning the method for a dry vegetable dish prepared using three main vegetable ingredients that are cabbage, carrots, and corn (or sweet corn). We have used common Indian spices in preparing it. These spices are well known for their aromatic flavours. In this recipe, we have used a microwave oven for cooking the vegetables but those who are not well aware of microwave cooking may use the conventional method of cooking by keeping a pan on a gas stove or hot plate and cooking the dish in the traditional way. Using carrots and corn (or sweet corn) with cabbage provides a slightly sweet taste to this dry vegetable dish and the spices used help in giving it a delicious flavour. The vegetables used in this dish are very nutritive and contain many nutrients, antioxidants, vitamins etc. These are very beneficial for health and also help in increasing the resistance of the body to various ailments. The present dish prepared using these vegetables naturally carries all these beneficial properties in it. Let us one by one go through the individual beneficial properties of these vegetables - Cabbage (green cabbage) is high in fibre and contains good quantities of nutrients, antioxidants, and vitamins like Protein, Vitamin-K, Vitamin-C, Folate, Manganese, Vitamin-B6, Calcium, Potassium, Magnesium etc. It also contains, albeit in small quantities, some micronutrients like Iron, Vitamin-A, and Riboflavin. Many of these constituent items are necessary for the body to keep it healthy and fit. Cabbage provides them to us. Carrots are a good source of Vitamin-A which is of course very beneficial for eye health. In addition to that, it contains many other useful items like Fibre, Protein, Vitamin-K, Potassium, Vitamin-C, Iron etc. Because of their beneficial properties, medical experts suggest including carrots regularly in our diet. Corn contains a good amount of sugar and carbohydrate and hence are to be consumed in moderation. But they also contain many useful items like Vitamin-C and some little quantity of Vitamin-B, Vitamin-E, Vitamin-K, Magnesium, and Potassium. Corn is considered a useful food item from the aspect of keeping good gut health. The quantity shown below will suffice for about 3 to 4 persons when taken with other food items during the main meals. However, the quantity of the ingredients can be increased or decreased depending upon the number of persons. Wash all the vegetables and drain them. Peel the potato, onions, and garlic. If carrots are fresh and tender do not peel them otherwise they would also require peeling. Chop onions, garlic, green coriander leaves, and tomato and keep them separately. Cut potato, carrots, cabbage, and capsicum in small pieces and keep aside. Break each of the clove in 2 to 3 smaller parts. Take a microwave bowl preferably a glass one and pour cooking oil in it. Now add cumin seeds, coriander powder, turmeric powder (optional), black pepper powder, kasuri methi, red chilli powder (optional), clove pieces, Sabji masala (optional), chopped onion, garlic, and green coriander leaves to it. Add salt to taste. Now keep this in the microwave and cook it in the first or second heat range for 3 to 4 minutes. Pause or stop the microwave and take out the bowl and add chopped tomatoes, carrot pieces, potato pieces, cabbage pieces, corn, and capsicum pieces. Now add about 3/4 quarter of a cup of water to it and mix the whole thing with a spatula and put the bowl back into the microwave and cook for 10 to 12 minutes in the first or second heat range. Take out the bowl and now add mango powder to it. At this stage, we have to make an important observation about the dryness of the dish. If we find that it has become too dry or is having a tendency for getting charred then we have to add a little water (say 1 to 2 tbsp) so that the dish does not get too dry. Now keep the bowl in the microwave and cook for 2-3 minutes. One alternative here could be to add 1 cup of water in place of 3/4 cup at the beginning itself so that the dish doesn't become too dry. One thing which is to be noted at this point of the procedure is that adding this water (3/4 cup or 1 cup) at that stage is a very crucial thing in microwave cooking because if we forget to add the water due to our absent-mindedness then the dish will become too dry and in all probability will get charred and get partially black like coal and will also stick to the bowl. So, this will be very inconvenient and embarrassing and that is why I am emphasizing and insisting that adding the required quantity of water to the dish is a crucial element in microwave cooking. One has to take care of it. Dish is ready Self The quantity mentioned in this particular recipe will yield about 5 to 6 servings. The quantity would be sufficient for about 3 to 4 persons when taken along with other food items during main meals. The dish can be served directly on the platter. Tomato sauce can also be added to this dish to enhance its flavour. Those having a sweet tooth can add a little amount of sugar or cream also. But all those additions would be adding to the calories only so one has to be cautious on that front. Based on the calorific values of the ingredients used in this dish the calculated calorie value per serving comes in the range of 80 to 85 calories per serving. If the dish is prepared without using the cooking oil then the calorie value would be only 65 to 70 calories per serving. Many people use microwave oven just for heating the food and nothing more than that. But microwave ovens can be effectively used for cooking various types of dishes just by keeping some safety precautions and care in the mind. Generally, microwave ovens have four heat ranges - 'very high', 'high', 'low', and 'very low'. One can use the 'very high' or 'high' range for dry vegetable dishes and curries. The main caution in microwave cooking is to have always some amount of water or moisture in the dish so that it does not dry up and get charred. Another care to be taken is using only microwave compatible bowls for cooking. With little practice and some experience, it is possible to prepare a large range of dishes in a microwave oven. I will like to share one tip about microwave cooking that in any preparation it is always better to pause the oven and take the bowl out and check the dish 2-3 minutes before the end time to see its consistency and add a little water if so needed. This action helps immensely in microwave cooking. It is always advisable to check the dish at any time by pausing the microwave if there is a doubt about the quantity of the water added earlier.

338,"Coffee Is a Luxury, Not a Staple",food," Coffee is a luxury, not a staple Nathan Dumlao Coffee connects the world. Humans consume over 2 billion cups of coffee every day. Coffee is the black gold of the world, and it’s the second most traded commodity in the world. The first is also black gold, oil. The whole world joins in the daily morning ritual of drinking coffee. This ritual is seen as basic and not at all the luxury it is. Coffee drinkers sip the drink as a wine connoisseur would, and when one looks closer, a coffee drinker is also a connoisseur. Like anything in life, what is good also has a dark side, and coffee has often been produced by slaves, even to this day, but today we call them underpaid workers rather than slaves. Many are indentured labourers. Children in coffee producing countries slave for our caffeine addiction instead of going to school. Even animals are exploited in the production of coffee. The practice of feeding coffee beans to animals and then using the excreted beans for consumption is a disturbing and growing trend. Coffee is excellent and tasty if you live in the northern hemisphere and are part of the everyday ritual drinkers. Coffee is bitter if you grow the beans.Coffee is the second largest asset in the world, and it is also the second most popular drink after water. Coffee is a relatively new commodity in the history of the world. Coffee was born in the Ethiopian mountains or at least discovered. A goat herder saw that the goats got giddy and happy when eating the fruit of a tree; he brought some fruits to a monk in a nearby monastery. The monk didn’t appreciate his discovery and threw them in the fire, and a lovely aroma soon spread, and other monks entered the room enticed by the aroma. They saved the beans from the fire, crushed them, mixed them with warm water and thereby brewed the first cup of coffee. This story is one of many legends about the origin of coffee. The first literary mention of coffee was in the year 1000, when physician and philosopher Avicenna Bukhara wrote about the medicinal properties of coffee.Arab traders brought coffee from their travels to Ethiopia, home to what is Yemen today. They cultivated the plant and created a drink they called qahwa, or that which prevents sleep. Qahwa, also written as kahwah, is one of many words Arabs use for wine. The process of making coffee could also make a potent alcoholic drink, but the Koran forbids wine and any alcohol, but not coffee.Muslim pilgrims smuggled coffee plants back home. Indian people did the same. Ottoman Turks introduced coffee to Constantinople in the mid-1400s, adding clove, cardamom, cinnamon and anise for an even more energising drink. Coffee was a controversial drink. In1511, coffee was banned by orthodox imams at a court in Mecca due to its stimulating effects. A similar law was passed in Cairo, Egypt, in 1532, but the Sultan of Cairo intervened. He declared coffee sacred and had the Governor executed.Coffee arrived in Venice in 1570 and was first only a drink for the wealthy.When coffee had reached the port of Venice, it did not take long before the British Ostindian Company and the Dutch East Indian Company spread the merchandise to other port cities in Europe. In 1675 there were over 3,000 coffee houses in England, and these coffee houses soon became an essential forum for policy, trade and religious discussions.Coffee houses became hubs of conversations and gatherings throughout Egypt, Syria, and Ethiopia in the 17th and 18th centuries. They also became institutions of equality as people shared information regardless of social class or political power and people called them penny universities as you could learn anything for the price of a cup of coffee. Historians trace the beginnings of revolutions to the coffee houses. The Netherlands played an important and often forgotten role in the emergence of coffee. In 1616, Dutch trader Pieter van der Broecke succeeded in acquiring a pair of coffee trees from Mocka. The coffee trees were thrown in Amsterdam’s botanical garden, eventually developing into a species of Coffea, known as Coffea Arabica.The offspring of Pieter van der Broeckes Coffea Arabica trees were transported within a few years to the Dutch colonies of Java and Suriname, which soon became the main suppliers of coffee to Europe. The few coffee trees that Pieter van der Broecke brought from Mocka are ancestors to almost 80 % of the coffee produced today. The Dutch broke the Muslims’ world monopoly on coffee in 1696. Some say the Dutch stole the seedlings, while others claim they were legally exported.In 1669 the Turkish Ambassador to Paris introduced coffee to the Court of Louis the XIV, and soon all of Paris was talking about coffee.In the early 1700s, the French created a new way to make coffee, enclosing the coffee in linen bags immersed in hot water, omitting coffee grinds.By 1715, there were more than 2000 coffee houses in and around London.In 1727, Brazil acquired fertile coffee seedlings through a secret liaison between the French Governor’s wife and a handsome Brazilian Colonel and from this secret deal grew the largest coffee empire in the world.In 1757, the British left the coffee trade to the Dutch and French. Tea becomes England’s drink instead of coffee. When coffee first reached America, it was not for consumption but for production. The colonies had not grown enough to constitute a big market, but the climate in South America and the Caribbean Islands was well suited for the coffee tree.Almost all coffee plantations in the American colonies relied on African labour slaves. Together with the sugar plant, the cocoa bean and the cotton plant, the coffee tree was a contributing factor to the massive slavery in America — slavery that continued until the late 1800s.Coffee consumption gained its major impact in North America as a direct consequence of the Boston Tea Party in 1773. After this, it was considered unpatriotic to drink British tea, and during the American War of Liberation (1775–1783), US soldiers instead began to drink coffee cultivated in South America and on the Caribbean islands. By the early 19th century, coffee was an established beverage in almost the whole world, and its growth continued steadily in the 20th century — mostly thanks to new technology. In 1900, the American roaster Hills Brother’s invented the vacuum pack of coffee. The technology, still used today, made it possible to send roasted beans from coast to coast without stiffening. The invention marked the beginning of the end of the local coffee roasters. In 1900, the Japanese chemist Satori Kato patented the technology of creating instant coffee. The following year, 1901, Italian Luigi Bezzera received the first patent on an espresso machine. Two years later, German Ludwig Roselius invented decaf coffee.Despite a few contributions from Europe and Asia to the history of coffee in the 20th century, the United States is the giant of the international coffee market.In 1920, the United States Congress voted through the ban on alcohol, and the sale of coffee exploded. Twenty years later, the United States imports 70 % of the world’s coffee. When the American soldiers went off to war in Europe, Maxwell House instant coffee was among their supplies, and after the war, consumption increased further. During the 1950s, the coffee brands competed almost exclusively for prices, and the quality of the coffee suffered.At the same time, the sale of soft drinks in the United States exploded. A whole generation of young people chose Coca-Cola instead of black gold, and coffee saw a downward trend in the United States for the first time in food history. The trend lasted until the 70’s when Starbucks came on to the coffee scene.Starbucks started as a retailer of roasted coffee beans. When Starbucks employed sales and marketing manager Howard Schultz in 1982, he tried to convince the owner to begin selling espresso drinks, but the owners refused. He left in frustration in 1985, launched the cafe chain Il Giornale which was a huge success. Two years later, he bought Starbucks for less than $ 4 million.Schultz replaced the Giornale chain logo with the Starbucks logo and began an unprecedented expansion. Throughout the 1990s, Starbucks opened a new cafe every business day, and the brand was soon established on the international market. Starbuck’s expansion made coffee trendy again, and more and more people started to drink coffee. Coffee is today the world’s most popular drink; some countries drink more than others, 45% of the world’s daily coffee consumption takes place in the USA.We really should start treating coffee as a luxury. From an environmental perspective, coffee is the most heavily sprayed crop in the world and uses massive amounts of water as well as wasteful packaging. From a compassionate perspective, we can’t claim to be ignorant of the slave-like conditions of the workers producing this luxury drink we see as just a regular part of an everyday ritual several times a day.

339,Cooking Indian Food in Clay Pots,food," I am a home/lifestyle/fitness enthusiate who loves information and research on a variety of different topics Indian food is the best. I love to cook Indian dishes in clay pots. When you are cooking an Indian meal, it's clotted cream or butter chicken that you want to eat at the end of the day. But there are other delicious Indian foods out there that are not made with dairy making them perfect for anyone following a vegan diet. If you have chosen to follow a vegan lifestyle, you should become familiar with how to cook these foods in clay pots. Here are some suggestions on what kind of dishes can be cooked in clay pots. Keep reading because this might just change your life! I'm going to start off by saying that anything can be cooked in a clay pot if you do it properly and use enough spices, but here are a few vegan dishes that I think really shine when prepared in clay pots: Besan Aloo is a traditional Indian dish. It is a simple recipe of mashed potatoes and chickpeas served with fried onions and garlic. This meal can be made from scratch easily without using any dairy products at all, however, it's even better if you add some things to the mix. One trick I like to use when making this dish in a clay pot is to add fresh green peas about 25 minutes before it is finished cooking for added flavor and color. Another thing I sometimes do is replace the oil used for frying with melted ghee or butter - simply melt it right in the clay pot before adding the potatoes and cook as normal. Butter Aloo Methi is a variation of the traditional Besan Aloo. It calls for adding fresh fenugreek leaves to the potatoes and chickpeas and using butter instead of oil. Tikka Masala is a creamy tomato sauce that's great on just about anything - but I especially like it served over rice with some naan bread. The best thing about this dish is how easy it is to make! Simply add water, diced tomatoes, green chili peppers, coriander powder, garam masala (a mixture of other spices), ginger paste, and salt to taste in your clay pot and cook until it has reduced into a nice thick paste. Add either tofu or tempeh (or both!) and let everything simmer together until the protein is cooked. Season to taste and serve with rice or naan bread. Chana Masala is a staple dish for those following a vegan diet. Chickpeas, onions, and tomatoes make up the base of this recipe and it can be easily customized for spiciness by adding green chili peppers instead of red. This one also needs to cook until the chickpeas are tender - about an hour on medium heat should do the trick nicely. You can either use canned chickpeas (drained) or prepare dried ones yourself (usually takes about 3 hours). Just like most Indian dishes though, this tastes better the next day! Okra Masala is another traditional favorite that I think becomes even more delicious when prepared in clay pots. It's the perfect summer dish and it may surprise you how easy okra can be to cook if you do it right! In this recipe, use ghee instead of oil to fry the onions and spices at the beginning for a richer flavor. The tomatoes should be added much sooner so they don't burn before everything else is cooked through - about 10 minutes before removing from heat is enough time for them to cook. If you have ever been curious about trying Indian food, I would recommend starting with simple recipes like those above because they are easier to prepare in clay pots. If you're not sure where to find these ingredients, just visit your local Indian grocery store or international market. This might take a little extra effort, but trust me it is more than worth it! If you're worried about the cost of cooking in clay pots, don't be! These items can often be purchased very affordably and used over and over again. Just follow the proper care instructions so that your pot lasts as long as possible and doesn't crack or break during use. If you accidentally break one though, worry not because they are easy to replace at any local thrift store. The vegan diet has come a long way since its early days but always remember: there is no reason why we cannot enjoy traditional Indian cuisine on this kind of eating plan too!

342,Delicious Makhana Curry - Indian Style - Microwave Version,food," Umesh is a freelance writer contributing his creative writings on varied subjects in various sites and portals in the internet. Makhana (also known as Talmakhana or Phoolmakhana or Lotus Seeds or Fox Nuts) is a very nutritious food item providing protein and fibres and is consumed in various ways like sweet puddings or fried snacks or dry vegetables or vegetable curries. In India, it is easily available and is eaten by people in a variety of dishes. This is also consumed during the fasting days as well as during the festival times. Makhana is actually a type of seed derived from the plant known as Euryale Ferox. It is also used in various forms in traditional medicines. Makhana is rich in calcium, magnesium, iron, and phosphorus which are very useful for our body in strengthening the bones, reducing blood pressure, improving nerve functions etc. Makhana also contains some antioxidants like gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, and epicatechin which play a crucial role in keeping the body healthy. We have prepared this dish using a microwave oven. However, it can be made using the conventional heating mode also like keeping a pan on the stove. Before we use a microwave for preparing this dish it would be a good idea to know about the fundamentals of microwave cooking so that we can use the microwave in the correct way and our dish is not spoilt. Microwave cooking is different from conventional cooking in many ways and one of the main differences is that in microwave cooking the amount of water and time of cooking are the two main factors that we have to keep in mind. Microwave ovens generally have four heat ranges for cooking - 'very high', 'high', 'low', and 'very low'. For making vegetables we generally use very high or high options though personally, I prefer to use 'high' setting as it is safer and convenient and helps in avoiding or delaying the accidental charring of the dish in case the water amount added is less than the required amount. From that aspect, the preparation of dry vegetables is slightly more difficult than curries as curries generally will have sufficient water for cooking and drying up or charing of the dish phenomenon would not take place. One caution that we have to take in microwave cooking is that in the end phase of the cooking that is just 3-4 minutes before the end time we must stop and open the microwave oven and check the dish for consistency. In case we find that it is drying up and there are chances of it getting charred or burnt then we must put some water at that point in time. It is not a difficult thing to learn because with experience this becomes a routine type of thing. In general, dry vegetables or curries take about 13 to 16 minutes in getting prepared in microwave cooking. The following quantity of the ingredients is sufficient for 2-3 persons when taken during the main meals along with other food items and the quantity of ingredients can be increased or decreased depending upon the number of persons. Peel the onions and also peel the garlic cloves and chop them and keep them aside. Crush 1/4 cup of Makhana in smaller pieces and keep separately. Split the big cardamom and take out the seeds and keep the seeds and peeling on one side. Break the cloves into smaller pieces and keep with the big cardamom parts. Chop the tomatoes and keep them separately. Take a microwave bowl preferably a glass one and pour the cooking oil in it. Add chopped onion, garlic, crushed Makhana, green coriander leaves, and gramflour or wheat flour to it. Now add remaining Makhana, coriander powder, turmeric powder, cumin seeds, fennel seeds, whole black pepper, black pepper powder, red chilli powder (optional), broken cloves, broken big cardamom, star anise petals, and salt to taste. Mix all the items with a spoon or spatula. Now keep the bowl in the microwave and cook it in the 1st or 2nd heat range for about 3 to 4 minutes. Take the bowl out. By this time the onion, garlic, and various spices will start giving their yummy smells. Now add chopped tomatoes, mango powder, cream, tomato sauce, sugar (optional), and also add about 2 to 3 cups of water and put back the bowl in the microwave and cook for 9 to 12 minutes. Do not forget to add this water as that is a critical element in microwave cooking. Please note that when we are preparing a dry vegetable this amount of water is significantly reduced from 2-3 cups to only 1/2 or 1 cup of water. Remove the bowl from the microwave and now the dish is ready. At this stage, if one feels that the curry is appearing thicker then the required consistency then just add half a cup of water and cook it in the same heat range for another 1 to 2 minutes. Dish is ready Self The curry is generally taken with bread or boiled rice or dry oats etc. The above quantity will yield about 6 servings. It can be served in small bowls or can be directly poured on the rice preparation or sugarless puddings etc. Based on the individual calorific values of the ingredients, one serving of this curry is about 65 calories and if the dish is prepared without oil then it would be only around 45 calories.

343,Chocolate Expresso Macaron,food," Hi guys! Now that I have explained what a macaron is, I would like to share one of my favorite recipes, and a tutorial on how to make them -- chocolate expresso macarons! To start, gather all your ingredients for the shells and filling:Shells: 70 grams almond flour116 grams confectioners sugar (powdered sugar)1.5 tablespoons cocoa powder2 large egg whites52 grams granulated sugar( Most macaron measurements are made by weight, like grams. This is so that the measurements are more exact!)Filling:2 sticks of softened butter4 cups of confectioners sugar (powdered sugar)1 teaspoon vanilla extract2 tablespoons expresso paste dissolved in a bit of water. For the shells:1. Put both your almond flour and confectioners sugar through a sifter and combine in a large bowl. Let sit for now. 2. Start by adding your egg whites into your stand mixer, or a bowl with a handheld mixer. I prefer a stand mixer because it will be quicker, and you arm will not get tired! Start whipping the egg whites on medium high setting. Once frothy and bubbly, add in your granulated sugar slowly. You want your egg whites to turn thick, white, and fluffy. You want them to have stiff peaks, so you can put a spoon in and do a quick dip, and if the meringue stands up like a mountain, then it is done! 3. Pour a third of your almond flour confectioners sugar mixture into the meringue. Now, you have to mix a certain way, and it is called macaronage. You fold the batter in on itself with a spatula instead of just mixing in circles like you would a brownie batter. Once it looks mixed, add in another third of your dry mixture and mix, and so on until all is added and looks thoroughly mixed. To tell when you are done mixing, it should have the movement of lava -- slow moving. You can also lift up your spatula, let the batter run off, and see if it slowly falls off together. 4. Now it is time to pipe! Line your baking sheets with either parchment paper, or silicone mats. Next, add your batter to a piping bag and pipe your batter into circles, all you have to do is hover your bag right above your tray and squeeze your piping bag until the batter is the size of circle you want! Once all your batter is piped into circles, you need to get all the air out of them. To do this, you are going to bang your trays on your countertop really hard! I know, this is kind of scary, but it is actually fun! This gets all the air that is trapped inside the batter out and smooths the top of the batter. 5. Set your oven to 325 degrees. Now the shells have to sit on the tray for at least 45 minutes so that they stiffen up. You should be able to lightly brush your finger over the top without any getting on you. The times they have to sit may very. Once they are ready to go in, put them in for 15 minutes.6. Once the time is up, take them out and let them sit for a couple minutes before removing from tray. They should pop off easily and not stick to the pan. For the filling:1. Add your butter to your mixer and cream until light and fluffy. Then gradually add your powdered sugar until all is combined in.2. Next, add in your vanilla and expresso paste. Mix until thoroughly combined. Time to combine:Grab two shells that are the same size. Pipe a bit of frosting onto the one shell, then place the other shell on top, like a sandwich. The amount of frosting you would like to put in is up to you! Once you have filled all your macarons, it is time to eat! These macarons are great if you need to bring a desert to a party or function. All of your friends will be in love with them! They are too good to not love"
344,Yummy Chocolate Brownie Recipe!,food," This recipe uses different kinds of chocolate in order to make the most amazingly chocolate taste. These brownies also have the best texture. They are super thick and are super moist without being undercooked, and they have a cracked top, which really ties the whole dessert together! These brownies are also super easy to make, so even beginner bakers will be able to make these amazing brownies. To start: Gather all your ingredients! 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips5 ounces of unsweetened chocolate, chopped up1 ½ sticks of unsalted butter, cut up1 ½ cups of granulated sugar3 large eggs plus one egg yolk1 ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract¼ teaspoon sea salt¾ cup all-purpose flour Now let's start baking! You can start by preheating your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line an eight-by-eight metal pan with parchment paper and spray with a non-stick cooking spray. Make sure you use a metal pan and not glass -- the metal helps bake the brownies perfectly and will help make the brownies cook all the way through!Next, we are going to melt the chocolate! Grab a large microwave safe bowl. Add in your chocolate chips, unsweetened chocolate chips and your butter. Microwave for 45 seconds then stir. Heat again for 30 seconds and stir. Continue this until everything is silky smooth. Be careful not to overheat it. If this happens, then you must start all over with new ingredients. Grab a large bowl. Add in your eggs, egg yolk, and sugar. Grab an electric mixer and mix everything until it is light in color and has a thin smooth ribbony texture. Next add in your vanilla and mix together.Now for the fun part, grab your chocolate mixture and slowly and gently stir it into your egg sugar mixture. Next, slowly fold in your flour and salt until everything is thoroughly combined and smooth. Grab your metal pan and pour your batter into it. (If you're not scared of a little raw egg, this batter is great to eat straight too)! Put the pan in the oven and bake it! It will take around 35-40 minutes to finish completely. You can test when it's done by inserting a toothpick in the middle of the pan and pulling the toothpick out. It the batter still contains liquid, and the toothpick is covered with batter when removed, then the brownies are not done. If there are moist crumbs on the toothpick, then your brownies are done! Once the brownies are done and out of the oven, they will continue to bake, so be careful to not overbake them. That's why I recommend checking the brownies frequently when they are close to being done so that they do not dry out. You should let the brownies cool completely before cutting to prevent them from falling apart, and they'll stay moister this way too. I know this can be hard because they look so delicious and smell so delicious when they come out!"
345,"Good Friends, Hot Wings, and Football: What a Great Mix",food," I was born in the south. I live in the south and will die in the south. This is only a small part of the memories I share. With or without hot sauce, hot wings are so delicious. Writer's note: the brand names of the products used in this recipe are used only for editorial purposes and not used to urge you to buy or endorse them. Thanks.K.A. You've tried dips and chips, popcorn, nuts mixed with cereals, but you can always know that there is something missing from your last get-together. You've searched books, magazines, and even called your best friend to get her idea, then out of the blue, the idea hit you: Why not prepare a feast for your family and friends for that next football fest with a combination of hot wings with real hot sauce, dip, and regular hot wings for the less brave. And really, there is not that much to do with making hot wings. You can bake. fry them in a fryer with peanut oil, or put them into an air fryer and any way you choose, you are bound to harvest the best tasting hot wings that ever passed over your lips. It's funny. Personally speaking, sometimes a new dish will be on the menu of my favorite restaurant or couple might spring a new creation for my wife and me, but the very first time that I ate hot wings, I loved them. I even had my good friend, Chad Clark, of Guin, Ala., who owns (along with his wife, Lisa) Frosty Front Restaurant, so he knows his way around a kitchen, stop in with my first Wing-fest and he brought a sauce named, Nuclear, that he got from some major restaurant chain the mid-south. The sauce made the hot wings even more delicious. So if you will notice the various sections of this recipe, remember, it can always be modified. My recipe is named: ""Heyy--Deez--R--Hot--Wings. Equipment Needed: An oil fryer (those that fry three pounds of hot wings). Or if you like, place the hot wings onto a cookie sheet covered with aluminum foil. Then you can time the frying and baking time pretty close, but a minute here or there will not hurt. But keep a watch on the wings and you can take a peek into the oil fryer or oven and if they are not cooking, you may have to start over. Your oven temperature should be set at 350 degrees and there is no temperature gauge on the oil fryer. And even with this vehicle, you do not have to fill the fryer to the rim. Fill to cover the wings. Preferably a bag at the time. This will produce 36 tasty wings. Preparation Before Cooking or Baking: Take the bag(s) of wings and let them thaw and then dry them until they are dry enough to cook. You can fry or cook the wings and apply your hot sauce when you or your guests use how much of your special sauce to use--or if you bake the wings, I have applied my hot wing sauce before I place them in my oven for 25 minutes and I will test them a few times by eating (a) wing or two and if the meat is white and hot to the mouth, they are ready to eat. Recipe For My Hot Wings: 1 or 2 Bags of Chicken Wings (in a plastic bag) in your meat(s) department. They are not that expensive. 2 Bottles of Frank's Red Hot Wing Sauce. 2 Habanero Peppers Ground and Put in The Sauce. 1 Whole White Onion Also Ground Finely to Mix in The Sauce. 1/2 Can of Cayette Pepper 1/2 Cup of Honey 6 to 10 Drops of Dave's Insanity Sauce. Note: I ask you seriously, DO NOT use a large amount of this sauce. It is produced from the peppers that are used in police pepper spray. Be careful. Thanks. K.A.Preparation: You may brush this sauce on the wings before you place them into an oven, and this way of cooking will solidify the sauce into each wing giving a sweet, but hot flavor. And you can put as much of this sauce as you want when the wings are brought from the oil cooker. There is not (one) way to measure sauce for everyone.Either way that you cook the wings, you can have the dishes, forks, and napkins, plenty of napkins, for your wing fest. All that is left for you and your guests is to ENJOY. Friends always love a party when hot wings are mentioned.

346,Eggs - Deviled and Darn Delicious,food," Yes. They are sloppy. Although, the yolk mixture does firm up as they sit. I did not wait for that before I gobbled some up. Cooling boiled eggs quickly keeps yolks yellow. Mash yolks with a fork. I start with a good glop of miracle whip and stir it in. If it's not creamy enough, I add more whip until it is. Mustard gets added after you get your whip right. Once everything is mixed together, it will thicken as the finished eggs sit. Use spoon to scoop Miracle Whip. Use fork to stir yolks. Do not get yolk in your Miracle Whip. We like ours tangy, so I use extra mustard. Sprinkle Seasoned salt on top and eat. Historically, people used paprika on top of their deviled eggs. We no longer do that. It did make them pretty, but I think there is some in the season salt. Enjoy!"

Spiced Mocha Latte Original photo by David A. Porter This is very quick and easy to put together. It combines the complimentary flavors of coffee, cocoa, and warm spices, and can be prepared in less than five minutes. It is a healthy start to the day, which will provide protein from the milk, a cognitive boost from the caffeine, and a variety of antioxidants from the cocoa (To'ak, 2021) and coffee (Noonan, 2018). Cinnamon can also help with blood glucose regulation (Mandal, et al, 2021). Honey to taste. Gently heat milk in a heavy bottomed pan over low heat. You can also make this quicker by microwaving the milk for three minutes. My favorite high quality cocoa mixes are Land O' Lakes Chocolate Supreme, Stephan's Dark chocolate or Milk Chocolate.

348,3 Weird Dishes in China That Are Actually Delicious,food," A street of an Italian Chinatown China features a rich variety of food. Chinese cuisine is maybe one of the most misunderstood in the world, as generally the majority of people who refer to it are used to think about the dishes they can commonly find in the Chinese restaurants in their local neighborhoods or - even worse - are used to think about dogs, bats or other animals that only very few minorities of the whole Chinese population actually eat, mostly in rural areas. Chinese food is actually sharing many similarities with Italian food when it comes to being misunderstood by many people or when it comes to similarities like the richness of pasta recipes, the variety among different regions or the attitude of Italian & Chinese people towards food, considered as something very important and even symbolizing conviviality. Still, there is another big similarity between Italian & Chinese food: we both have certain kinds of dishes that may be considered ‘weird’, even if they are actually delicious. This article will focus on some of the Chinese dishes that are actually delicious but still not considered by people who are afraid to eat them. When it comes to certain kinds of food that smell but are delicious, people who don’t know them get eventually scary when it comes to try them. Some typical examples of smelly but tasty food are certain kinds of cheeses like blue cheese. Italy features ‘gorgonzola’, which is a very smelly blue cheese. When it comes to China, a very famous example of smelly food is stinky tofu, which is a popular street food made of fermented tofu you can find in several cities like Changsha, the capital of Hunan province in China. Stinky tofu is something most Westerners are afraid to eat due to its strong smell: the fact is that it is really delicious and, actually, is one of the dishes I mostly miss when I’m not in China (even if luckily I can still find it packed at some Chinese groceries, it’s not as spicy as the one prepared at the moment on the streets of Changsha but I still enjoy it). The funny fact is that not only most Westerners would be afraid to eat stinky tofu: also many Chinese people are afraid to eat Italian cheeses and especially blue cheeses like ‘gorgonzola’ (some of them believe it is rotten and cannot be eaten). The fact is that when it comes to this particular kind of smelly but good food, most people are afraid to eat those they don’t know, so we can say both Italy and China share another thing in common when it comes to food. A piece of stinky tofu Try to preserve eggs (especially quail eggs are popular) in a mixture of ingredients like clay, salt and ash for some months and you get the so called century eggs, characterized by a black and creamy yolk. Many Westerners are totally scared when it comes to even mention these eggs, despite this it is totally safe to eat them and I add the fact they are also really delicious, especially when served with fresh tofu and sage like in the picture below. Chinese century eggs with fresh tofu This is maybe my favorite dish of the whole Chinese cuisine, even it is not really a dish, but more a way of cooking. Hotpot is a sort of fondue: a broth is put a the centre and then raw ingredients are disposed around the table: these ingredients may feature meat, fish, vegetables like lotus root, mushrooms and tofu. This way of eating is funny and enhances conviviality, as there is not only the experience of eating together, but also of cooking together before eating: eating hotpot requires more time than eating already cooked dishes and this results in more time also spent at the table with friends or family. A Chinese Hotpot Still, this way of eating is considered weird by some Westerners, despite hotpot is maybe one of the most typical protagonist of the Chinese food scenery.

349,History of Bread,food," Before the processing of plant substances into bread developed, man's primate ancestors ate grass and grass seeds along with other wild plant foods. Primate teeth and digestive organs, however, are not well suited to a steady diet of unprocessed grass seeds, and the adoption of a successful grain diet required several technical innovations. These included the use of milling stones (originally simple flattish stones), control of fire, and the discovery that meal mixed with water and subjected to heat produces a palatable food.Primitive ""bread"" made from various ground plant substances was probably being prepared well before the emergence of agriculture, the systematic cultivation of useful plants under human management. Several recent non-farming peoples make unleavened cakes, or bannocks, from seeds, nuts, roots, or tubers ground on stones and baked in ashes or earth ovens. Such a development presumably took place in many parts of the world before the changeover from hunting to farming and the systematic raising of plants occurred. But for full utilization of the abundant cereal grasses, the development of true agriculture was a necessary further step.The advance toward regular grain agriculture and the use of bread as a staple food seems to have been made first in regions with wild plants botanically well suited for domestication and selective improvement. Palestine, where the wild forms of wheat and barley were present, is an example. Acorns from wild oak trees were used for mush or unleavened bread in areas of the Middle East, but oak trees cannot compete with wheat or barley as cultivated plants.One simple and probably very ancient method of producing bread products is parching or popping grains on a hot surface or in a tray or basket filled with hot rocks. Although often mentioned as the earliest way of making hard grass seeds more edible, this method may not have originated any earlier than the pounding or mashing of seeds, roots, or tubers that were mixed with water and baked into crude cakes. Leavening was at first probably an accidental and repeated occurrence. Spores of wild yeast (a fungus) are fairly common in dusty air and will readily contaminate mush, porridge, wet dough or suspensions of meal in water, leading to fermentation. Contamination by wild yeast spores was necessary to leaven wheat and rye dough, which contain enough gluten in the grain to make high-rising leavened loaves. The really essential discovery of making leavened bread, however, derives from the use of some fermented or sour dough left over from a previous batch. The procedure can be carried on indefinitely.Evidence for the earliest use of seed grains as archetypal bread products is partly direct. Archaeological sites in both the Old and New worlds have yielded carbonized cereal grains or impressions of grains in clay. Corncobs and impressions of corncobs have been unearthed from sites in the Americas.Upper Paleolithic and later sites also yield milling slabs that could have been used to grind grains. More conclusive evidence of early bread making are finds of ovens indicating the existence of bread baking.The first ovens, probably for baking flatbread of wheat or barley, were in use in the Middle East around 7000 B.C., at sites such as Jericho in the Jordan valley and Hacilar in Turkey. At Hacilar ovens dating from about 5600 B.C. were found next to grain bins and grinding slabs.At Catal Hiiyiik in southern Turkey bread was almost certainly baked and beer brewed between 6500 and 5500 B. c. As the cultivation of wheat and barley expanded into southeastern Europe, the Nile Valley, and eastward across the Iranian Plateau to western Turkestan and the Indian subcontinent, bread baking presumably spread also. Considerably later Swiss lakeshore settlements of late Neolithic times have yielded remains of flatbreads and traces of ovens.Documents and abundant pictorial art illustrating daily life in ancient times are even more precise evidence of bread making than finds of ovens. Scenes of milling, kneading, and baking, and documents relating to breadstuffs, baking, or the use of bread in religious ceremonies have been found in ancient Egyptian sites. Actual specimens of ancient bread were unearthed from Egyptian tombs, and bread was found preserved in volcanic ash-filled rooms in the ruins of Pompeii. A papyrus dating from about 1200 B.C. lists 30 kinds of bread known in Egypt. A loaf found in a tomb at Deirel Bahri (built about 1500 B.C.) is roughly triangular in shape. Loaves shown in other tomb paintings include some of conical shape placed on altars. Some bread was shaped in fish, bird, or mammal forms, and other bread was colored with earth pigments or sprinkled with seeds.From the archaeological evidence, it has been determined that in Egypt royal court bread was prepared from finely sifted flour, but the commoners suffered much dental wear from grit from the grinding slabs and the omnipresent desert sand that remained in the coarse flour they used. Large ovens were built on the estates of nobles, and detailed wooden models found in tombs illustrate the steps in preparing bread. Since they had no coined money until the late Iron Age the ancient Egyptians paid workmen and officials in grain, loaves, and beer.From early documents and pictorial representations archaeologists conclude that bread acquired religious significance as it became a major food and was offered to the gods as a sacrifice just as earlier hunting peoples had offered game or wild fruits. The growing dependence on bread of the early Copper Age civilizations in Mesopotamia and Egypt was in part intensified by the power and influence of the priests and the temple. Both were supported by tithes of grain.The early city-states and theocratic kingdoms in these areas maintained storage granaries from which they distributed grain in times of famine, thus creating a great dependence on the religious establishments for food."

351,How to Cook Frozen Hamburger Patties on the George Foreman Grill,food," Charles loves to cook and enjoys trying new recipes every day. He specializes in recreating gourmet comfort food. From Frozen to Gourmet With the Foreman Grill Photography by Charles Kikas How many times have you found yourself craving a hamburger or cheeseburger and just not feeling like you want to leave the house? The patties are frozen or you really don't feel like sticking your hands in a big bowl of meat. Back in 1994, a guy named George Foreman had that same craving and problemwith his meat. He decided to do something about it. With a little help from a company called Salton and a whole bunch of infomercials, the George Foreman Grill was introduced to millions of customers faced with exactly the same dilemma as George. The ability to make juicy hamburgers at home, grilled on your countertop in just a few minutes is possible and easy. If you're not familiar with this revolutionary machine and the delicious meals that can be made with it, then you have come to the right place. Follow along and start cooking frozen hamburger patties in three easy steps. Preheat your Foreman Grill. Always start with a clean grill and make sure you have access to a flat, open area on your counter to place your grill. Plug in the grill. Most Foreman Grills will have a red and green indicator light. When the light turns green, you are all set to start grilling. For grills without an indicator light, I recommend waiting about five minutes before grilling to allow the grill to reach the optimal temperature.  Frozen Burgers on the George Foreman Grill Photography by Charles Kikas Grab your frozen hamburger patties and place them on the Foreman Grill. You should hear a nice sizzle as they make contact with the grill surface. Close the lid. After 2 minutes, lift the lid and season the patties with your favorite seasoning, and close the lid. (It's best to apply the seasoning after the burgers have defrosted a little to prevent whatever spices you are using from falling off the frozen patty.) I'm particularly fond of just basic salt and pepper. Feel free to apply your favorite seasonings at this time. Toppings for the Burger Photography by Charles Kikas I currently use the 2 Serving Copper Infused George Foreman Grill. Cooking times may vary slightly depending on the size and weight of your frozen hamburger patties. The particular George Foreman Grill you are using could also affect the cooking time. I will provide the cook times that work for me. You might have to adjust your cooking times a tiny bit to suit your particular Foreman Grill and the size of your hamburger patties. For a typical 4-ounce frozen burger patty, I find that for a medium burger (pink in the center), cook for 6 minutes. For well done, I try to not go past 8 minutes. I find that cooking any longer than that the burgers will tend to dry out. If you have an instant-read thermometer, you will be looking for a temperature of 160 degrees for well done. The juices should run clear when the burgers are fully cooked. Remember to allow some time for melting the cheese if you opt for cheese. I usually wait to put the cheese on at the end of the cooking process. I generally unplug the grill while the cheese melts, this gives me time to set up my plate, toppings, and buns without overcooking the burgers. Continue reading below for reviews of some of my favorite frozen hamburger patties.  This 16-ounce package of four 100% beef patties can often be found on sale for only $4.49. Regularly $6.99.

352,Coffee Beans: Harvesting and Processing,food," A drink made from the roasted ground beans of several species of the genus Coffea, drunk by at least one-third of the world's population. It is a leading tropical commercial crop. The plant is a relatively low evergreen shrub usually associated with tropical rain forests where it thrives as a constituent of the shrubby ground vegetation. The shrub bears round cherries (bright red when ripe), each of which contains two seeds or coffee beans.Africa is the original home of many of the present-day economic coffee species which were originally found growing wild. The commercial cultivation of coffee started in Arabia Felix (modern Yemen), where one of the most popular species (Coffea arabica) was apparently introduced from the Ethiopian province of Kaffa (Kefa). The cherries may be allowed to ripen until they shrivel and begin to dry. They are then shaken off onto large canvasses. However, the higher grades of coffee are selectively picked by hand when the cherries are properly ripe.Two processes are used for drying and depulping the cherries. The dry process (the older of the two) is common in many producing countries, especially those with adequate water. The fresh cherries are spread up to 2 in deep on a drying floor and are stirred several times a day and covered for protection against rain at night. After 10 to 21 days the dried cherries are milled to extract the coffee beans. When open-air drying conditions are unfavorable, mechanical drying is used.The wet process differs in that the cherries are soaked in water and then depulped by machine, thereby extracting the beans. The latter are fermented in large tanks for 12 to 16 hours and are then washed and dried. The beans are milled to remove the parchment husk and the silvery covering. The wet-process coffee beans are preferred in world trade.Coffee beans must be roasted and ground before use. The flavor depends on the ripeness of the berries, the physical environment, the variety of plant and the curing, drying and roasting processes employed. Roasting gives the product its brown color and transforms the natural coffee elements into those responsible for the splendid aromatic qualities which are so pleasant to taste.There are important differences of type, kind and grade of coffee. The two principal world coffee categories are the Brazils and the milds. The milds, produced in countries other than Brazil, are generally (but not always) superior in quality to the Brazils. Coffees may also be hard or soft."
353,Cookies - Chocolate Chip Infused,food," The recipe is located on the back of the chocolate chips. I followed the recipe to the letter, sort of. I did make one change. I used brown sugar exclusively instead of a combination of white and dark. Cookies are made in several stages. It is important to mix the butter and sugar together first. The vanilla is added at this step. Then, the eggs are stirred in. Then, the flour mixture is stirred in. Then, the chocolate chips are folded in. This is the stage to add corn syrup and nuts if you are going to. Now, its time to take the dry ingredients that you have and add them to the wet mixture. It will take a combination of stirring and folding to get all the ingredients mixed together. Start your oven.350 degrees. Select a flat baking sheet. Do not add any grease to pan. The cookie dough has enough butter in it to caramelize the bottom of your cookies. Take a spoon or fork and scoop some into a ball. Place the ball onto the cookie sheet. Arrange in even rows, leaving at least a ball sized space between cookies. I usually do four rows of five or so. The individual cookies will usually cook upwards, so the sideways spread is minimal. [Of course, if you have not added enough flour, the sideways spread will be quite noticeable and you will end up with one huge cookie Place filled sheet in the oven and set timer for 10 minutes. You will be able to smell the cookies baking after a while. Done-ness is subjective. The range is 10 - 12 minutes for baking time. [Raw, Light brown, golden brown, browned, dark brown, burnt.] Use a pair of oven mitts to remove from oven. The pan will be hot. Let rest for about 15 seconds after coming out of oven, then loosen cookies with cookie spatula. Remove cookies to cooling rack, or suitable cooling surface. [cutting board, paper bag, parchment paper - to name a few surfaces] Let pan cool slightly, then load up with another batch of cookie batter. Depending on how many cookie pans you are using, if you have multiple pans, you can bake more at a time. The cooling procedure is still the same. Bake for a minimum of 10 minutes. Then, remove pan from oven using oven mitts. Let cookies cool slightly, then dislodge from pan. This stops the baking process and allows the bottoms to set. Then, slide the cookies onto a cooling surface so they can cool and harden. When cookies are room temperature, then stack them in a storage box or cookie jar. Feel free to sample the cookies at any point. Many people find they enjoy the batter at any stage. Just be aware that your mouth will hurt if you bite one too soon, since the chocolate retains a lot of heat."
354,What is cork made of?,food," Photo by Hudson C. S. de Souza Cork, tissue or layer of the bark of the cork oak (Quercus suber) which grows in Spain, Portugal, and some areas of Europe bordering the Mediterranean. A tree first yields a supply when it is about twenty years old, and supplies are obtained about every ten years. The first production is of little value, but each successive supply increases in value.The cork is stripped from the tree by means of incisions made in longitudinal and transverse directions. The pieces thus detached are soaked in water, scraped, washed, pressed flat, and dried. They are then placed over a coal fire which conceals blemishes, and blackens and smooths the surface. The elasticity of cork makes it useful for stopping bottles and casks; its lightness enables it to be used for lifebelts, artificial legs, and the floats of nets; and its impermeability to water makes it suitable for the soles of shoes. The uses of cork were known to the ancients. Pliny mentions them. Plutarch says that Pontius Cominius swam the Tiber with the help of pieces of cork, and the ancient Egyptians made coffins from it. The use of cork, however, for stopping glass bottles was not known until the 15th century. Spanish black is made by burning the parings of cork, and cork waste is employed in the manufacture of linoleum."
355,Pecans,food," The Pecan is a species of hickory. My neighbour has one. It's an absolutely massive tree, quite possibly 30 or more metres in height. And almost as wide in diameter.In season it is dripping in nuts. One day in the space of twenty minutes we filled four shopping bags from what we picked up off the ground. We had to stop because 1) the bags were about to burst and 2) so were our backs. There were plenty more still left on the ground. When got home we weighed them, 10 kilos of nuts!Shelled they look a little like walnuts, but not so bitter. They are a tasty nut, almost sweet. Some say it has a rich, buttery flavor. The shells are thinner than a hazelnut or walnut, but thicker than a peanut. They don't crack easily, but I find if you put two or three in your hand and make a fist and squeeze hard at least one of them will give and crack. Though trying to break one on it's own without a utensil or any other kind of implement is almost mission impossible.They can be used in cooking. No doubt you've heard of pecan pie. Though I've never had pecan pie. My wife said that she'd make me one but we got so carried away eating the nuts as is and also giving them out to friends and family that the plan of cooking up a pie never eventuated.Pecans are also a major ingredient in praline."

357,The Importance of Good Nutrition,food," Nutrition is one of the world's most important health problems. Accurate estimates indicate that from one-half to two-thirds of the world's population suffers from malnutrition.Much of this malnourished population is concentrated in developing countries. The malnutrition may consist of a chronic insufficiency of total food or inadequate amounts of the so-called protective foods, which contain protein, minerals, and vitamins. A combination of both situations may also exist for varying periods of time.The effects of nutrition are far-reaching throughout the life cycle. Infants born of malnourished mothers may start life with handicaps that mayor may not be overcome. Many die in the first year or two due to malnutrition alone or due to malnutrition intensified by gastrointestinal and respiratory infections, to which they are particularly susceptible. Those who survive and are inadequately fed through childhood and adolescence show ill effects as adults. Resistance to infection is also related to nutrition.In malnourished populations, death rates and the severity of infectious disorders are sometimes 30 times greater than in healthy well-nourished populations.The intake of essential nutrients may be inadequate for years before possible diseases and symptoms may appear, and often their onset is insidious. However, such illnesses can occur even in lands of plenty because of ignorance of basic dietary patterns and because of a lack of desire to eat for health's sake."
358,TABLE ETIQUETTES,food," KAUSHIK SARKAR                                                                                      
F&B lecturer
Culinary Academy of Indi Guests in the hospitality business, especially those who dine in fine dining restaurants or other dining establishments, must be well versed in table etiquettes. After all, knowledge of table manners reflects social status and standards. Whether it’s a formal or informal restaurant, table etiquettes and manners play an essential role during public dining events. Now the question may arise “What is the purpose of learning table manners? What is its use in day-to-day life? How is it beneficial?” Personally, I believe table manners are important at any age, stage, or income level for two reasons: i) to make others feel comfortable, and, ii) to prevent us from embarrassing ourselves or the hosts All of us should feel confident and comfortable when we dine in public. And both, confidence and comfort come with knowledge and practice. This is the main reason that knowing table etiquettes, learning, and put them into practice is valuable and worth it. Another point that I would like to mention as vital concerns mobile phones. The use of mobile phones should either be minimized or eliminated unless there is an emergency. Using mobiles during dining hours implies that one is more interested in their device than their surrounding. If it's urgent and essential that one cannot miss a call, the phone should be turned on silent mode and call takers should excuse themselves to receive the call away from earshot of the table. That said, table etiquette differs depending on the type of service, cuisine style, and area where the outlet is located. However, most etiquettes are more or less similar among different cuisine styles. To start with etiquette or manners, one should first know about napkin etiquette. Whether formal or informal meals, after sitting on a chair, one should always open the napkin. The napkin is generally kept folded on one's lap. If you’re unsure about how this is done, please allow the steward/stewardess to do this for you. If anyone is temporarily leaving the table during the meal, the napkin is put on the chair. At the end of the meal, the napkin is folded and placed on the quarter plate placed on the left-hand side of the table setup. Next up, how to handle cutlery. There are many styles or etiquettes to follow, but two are more prevalent than others: the Continental or European style and the American style. The continental style generally prevails at all meals, whether formal or informal, as it is a natural and non-disruptive way to eat. Forks are placed on the left-hand side of the setup. They are held with the left hand, facing downward and the knife is held with the right hand, approximately two inches above the plate. Now when holding both the fork and the knife, the index fingers of both hands should be placed at the neck of the fork and knife respectively. This allows one to hold the food down with a fork and cut the food with the knife. After cutting the food the fork is used to spear and lift the food to the mouth. Likewise, In the American manner, the fork and knife are held the same way as the continental style, i.e, in the left and right hand, respectively. But after cutting the food with the knife in the right hand, the knife is kept aside on the plate, and then the fork is shifted from the left hand to the right hand. The fork is then used with the right hand to lift food to the mouth. After shifting the fork to the right, the left hand is allowed to rest on the lap and not on the table. One must also know how a table is set up at fine dining restaurants or any dining outlet along with knowledge about which cutlery to use during the meal. In general, each set up with its required cutlery, crockery, and glassware is known as a 'cover'. Standard cover dimensions are 15 inches to 24 inches. Now in the cover, the main plate is laid in the middle directly in front of the chair. The left and right-hand side of the plate is where cutlery is placed. This is done following an outside-to-inside pattern, always according to the items in the menu.  To simplify, if there is soup on the menu, the soup spoon is kept at the outer edge of the cover away from the plate. This is followed by cutlery required for salad on the left of the soup spoon. Similarly, the fork from the left edge is kept following the course of the menu sequence, gradually proceeding towards the main course plate. Glasses are always kept at the tip of the knife on the right-hand side of the cover. Deciding which fork or spoon to use is made easier by outside – inside rule. If there is a dessert on the menu, then the dessert spoon and knife will always be placed at the top of the cover horizontally parallel facing the opposite direction. Now that you know the technical details of cutlery and its use, let’s take a look at some of the non-technical aspects of table etiquettes. Firstly, how does one know when to start eating? It’s simple really. At a small table of only two to four people, wait until everyone has been served before beginning to eat. But in the formal or business meal, one should either wait till everyone is served or start having the meal once the hosts approve of doing so. There are resting etiquettes too, which one should know. When there is a need to pause to take a sip of a beverage or to speak with someone, there are two styles for resting the cutleries on the plate: the Continental and the American. In the continental style, the knife and fork are placed near the center on the plate, slightly angled in an inverted V and with the tips of the knife and the fork pointing towards each other. And in the American style knife is kept resting on the top right of the plate (diagonally) with the fork nearby with tines facing up. At the end of the course, in both styles, keep the knife and fork parallel with the handles in the four o'clock position on the right rim of the plate. Lastly, during the meal, if salt and pepper are passed to any guest, both are always given together.

359,Jelly - Mixed Berry,food," I'm using my Jack La Lanne juicer. I have eight boxes of various berries sent home with me by mom, some picked in my yard, some bought at my local store.  Jars. I'm going to use a variety of different sizes jars. Most smaller jars. Nicer to grab small jars so it takes less time to be able to open the next jar. Yes. There is a method to the madness. Basically, you need clean jars. Lids. The produce. The processing to seal the jars. Lastly, a place to store the produce. I'm using the Jack La Lanne juicer. It's on a cutting board so the measuring cup fits under the spout. The berries will go in the top, get separated into pulp and seeds, and juice. The funnel fits in the opening of the juicer. It has a large hole in the bottom and a large port on the top. Perfect for dumping a box of berries into. I used a wooden spoon to press the berries through. Initially used the stick end, but then decided the spoon end worked better, plus it didn't fall through the bottom. Plus, plus! Fruit in the hopper. Juice in the reservoir. Seeds and useless slop in the tub. Ok. All my fruit is processed except the grape vine grapes. Those I want to do separate in case my idea was stupid. Wild grapes still on bunches Bring fruit, sugar and butter to boil. Then, once it's really boiling, add liquid sure jell and boil that for at least a minute. Then, start putting in jars. Wipe slop and drips from jar. Add lid and ring. Tighten. Once the jars are all filled, the metal carrier goes into the water bath canner. 10 minutes or so. Once they are taken out of the water, the cooling causes a vacuum effect and the lids seal."
360,What is Cheese?,food," There may be as many as 1000 different names of cheese throughout the world, but many of them vary in name only and they all belong to about 20 groups varying from the very soft, freshly made cheese to the fully matured, strong-flavored hard cheese. The different varieties are due not only to the different type of milk used in their manufacture but also to the skill and technique of the cheesemaker and to ripening. The origin of cheese will never be known with certainty, but we know that it was esteemed by the Greeks and the Romans, is mentioned several times in the Bible, and appears almost without exception in all the world's best known classics of literature.The process of cheesemaking varies to quite a large extent. However, in all cheese, no matter where it is made and the method of making employed, certain fundamental steps must be followed: (1) fresh milk is placed in vats and the first stage is begun by 'setting' the milk; then (2) cutting the curd, (3) cooking the curd, (4) draining the whey, (5) salting, (6) pressing, and finally (7) maturing.One of the most important considerations during manufacture is the acidity, and this is tested throughout the operation by an acidimeter. Considerable experience and skill are needed by the cheesemaker to interpret the acidities given, and to allow him to apply the correct degree of emphasis at the subsequent stages. Salt is added to the curd to stop certain bacterial action and to give the cheese more flavor. The period of ripening can vary from one day for fresh cream cheese to several years in the case of the hard Italian parmesan. In the Middle East and Asia the type of cheese made is usually small, round and heavily salted. In Europe there are many types of soft mould ripened and hard cheese but in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and North America, where the factory system prevails, Cheddar type cheese is overwhelmingly popular although there are many other varieties available. Current trends in cheese-making tend to make the industry much more mechanical and it is only a matter of time before the large creameries become fully automated as the new continuous #cheese-making# plants are perfected.The chief hard cheeses are Cheddar, Emmental and Parmesan; semi-hard, Cheshire, Port Salut, Edam, and Gouda. The best known soft cheeses are: (surface ripened), Brie, Camembert and Limburg, and (mould ripened), blue vein, Stilton, Gorgonzola and Roquefort. Cheese is of world-wide importance and a rich source of protein and calcium. There is hardly any carbohydrate in cheese, this being lost in the whey."
361,Taco in a Bag,food," I like to start by crumpling my chips. Open the bag. Squeeze the bag and making little crunching noises. The doritoes know what to do. Then, start spooning in the ingredients. I like 2 scoops of burger, then a spoonful of everything else. Eat with a fork. I can always come back and get another bag. "

364,History of the Bean,food," Beans were one of the earliest food crops raised by man, and several varieties were probably cultivated by prehistoric men. Broad beans were raised for food and forage in ancient Greece and Rome. They were also used as ballots in voting. Broad beans were probably introduced into western Europe by invading Romans. Lima beans and several varieties of kidney beans, which are native to South America, were cultivated by North and South American Indians.Phaseolus vulgaris is the common or kidney bean, the best known of all beans, with up to 100 named varieties being grown commercially or in the home garden. The lima bean, Phaseolus limensis, and the dwarf lima have been cultivated in South America since prehistoric times. The pods are harvested and shelled like peas before being dried or canned. The soybean, Glycine max, originated in China and was introduced into the United States in around 1800. It is now a leading crop and is processed into protein meal and oil. Runner beans, Phaseolus multiflorus, are mostly grown as ornamental plants except in Great Britain, where they are eaten as a vegetable. They are tall, climbing plants with scarlet or white flowers.Bean plants are valuable soil enrichers because of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria that live in nodules on their roots. Some bean plants are raised for pasturing animals or for silage. Several species are raised as ornamental plants. A few species, including the navy bean and the soybean, provide industrial raw materials, including bases for paints, inks, and soaps.Except for the broad bean, which thrives in a cool, moist climate, most beans need a warm, dry climate and are easily killed by frost.Beans are attacked by a number of fungus diseases, of which the most common are anthracnose, root rot, and rust. The most common insect pest is the Mexican bean beetle (Epilachna varivestis)."
365,Fried Potatoes - from Duck Fat Infused Potatoes,food," Since I am using the potatoes that absorbed the duck fat, soy sauce, butter, pepper and better burger seasoning from roasting the duck, I'm not putting anything but potatoes in the pan. Place a single layer of potatoes in the electric frying pan. I started the pan on 300 degrees, and later my hubby turned it up to 350. You have to stand there with the higher heat and flip the potatoes over more often to avoid burning."

367,Cultivating Coffee Beans,food," Photo by Hafid Wj The coffee tree grows to a height of 4 to 5 meters but, when cultivated, is usually pruned to about 2 meters. It has shiny, ovate leaves and bears sweet-smelling, white flowers that fall after a few days. The cherry-like fruit, which develops over the next 6 to 7 months contains two beans in a covering of sweet pulp. When ripe for picking, the fruit is a deep crimson color.The coffee tree is cultivated in the cooler regions of the Tropical Zone. It prefers a rich, well drained, volcanic soil, a warm, humid climate, and it grows at altitudes from sea level to 1800 meters. The trees can be planted direct in the soil but are usually propagated in special nurseries and then transplanted into the field. Coffee trees take about 5 years to produce their first full crop; they then continue to bear for up to 30 years and produce an annual yield of about 0.5 kg.The crop is harvested in two ways: selective picking and wholesale stripping of the tree, both methods usually being carried out by hand. After being picked, the beans are removed from the outer covering of pulp and dried. The resultant product, called 'green coffee', is then sorted and graded. Different varieties of green coffee are blended and roasted to produce a flavor suited to the public taste.Coffee is grown from seed or more usually from seedlings but may also be propagated by layering. The seeds are first grown in seedbeds, from which the seedlings are later transplanted. One hectare may have from 750 to 1,500 trees (300-600 per acre) and these start bearing after three to five years. The economic life of coffee trees is usually 25-30 years but to maintain high quality and greater yields they are often replaced after 12-15 years.Coffee does not normally grow outside the tropics because it cannot survive frosty conditions. Ideal coffee temperatures range between 16°C and 27°C.The crop requires high annual rainfall of about 1,800 mm.Being sensitive to strong sunlight, coffee plants need some shading and they do best on rolling lands with good drainage, particularly on fertile mountain slopes facing tropical seas."
368,How Is Chocolate Made?,food," Photo by Shizhao Chocolate is a solid or semisolid food prepared by the fine grinding of roasted, shelled beans of the cacao, or cocoa, tree.As the beans are ground, a free-flowing liquid is produced. This liquid, called chocolate liquor, is the basis for all chocolate products.Chocolate liquor consists largely of fat called cocoa butter, which makes up slightly more than half its weight. It also contains carbohydrates, protein, a small amount of mineral matter, and about 1% residual moisture. Its rich brown color is derived from the natural bean pigments and its unique aroma is due to the bean's various essential oils.Although chocolate and cocoa are commonly regarded as very different foods, they differ only in the amount of cocoa butter they contain. Then chocolate liquor is subjected to hydraulic pressure until its cocoa butter content is reduced from about 54% to 24% or less, the residue forms a solid mass called press cake. This cake is broken, pulverized, cooled, and Sifted, producing commercial cocoa powder. Chocolate is made with chocolate liquor whose fat content has not been reduced. In the chocolate factory the three products-chocolate liquor, cocoa powder, and cocoa butter-are converted into an almost endless variety of consumer products. Most chocolate manufacturers closely guard their formulas and procedures for blending the beans and their methods of processing added ingredients. However, according to the Definitions and Standards of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law of 1944, all forms of chocolate sold in the United States must be manufactured within the limits of the regulations set forth.Milk chocolate is by far the most popular kind of chocolate. As defined by law, several types of dairy products may be used in making milk chocolate, but fluid and powdered whole milk are the traditional and most widely used products. Similarly, a variety of sweeteners may be used, since unsweetened chocolate is too concentrated in flavor to be eaten as such and would have little appeal if made into a sugarless product. By law, milk chocolate must contain not less than 12% milk solids and not less than 10% chocolate liquor.Certain optional ingredients are permissible, but they must all conform to the prescribed standards.Sweet chocolate differs from milk chocolate in that it contains no milk solids, but it must contain not less than 15% chocolate liquor. Bittersweet chocolate is sweet chocolate that contains not less than 35% chocolate liquor. Baking chocolate, or bitter chocolate, contains no milk solids or sweeteners. The manufacture of chocolate begins with the delivery of dried, fermented cocoa beans to the factory. The beans arrive in large burlap bags weighing an average of about 140 pounds (64 kg). The first step in the manufacturing process is cleaning the beans, by using screens and air currents to remove extraneous material. The different kinds of cocoa beans may then be blended, although this step sometimes occurs after roasting. During roasting, the beans are placed in rotating cylinders through which air, heated by gas or oil, is forced. The temperature of the air exceeds 5000 F (2600 C) , and the entire process, in which the moisture of the beans is reduced from 7% or 8% to about 1%, is completed in about one half to three quarters of an hour.After cooling, the beans a re cracked or shattered and the shell, which is lighter than the inner mate rial, is removed from the cracked bean by air currents. The remaining particles, called nibs, are then ground by one of several processes to obtain the chocolate liquor.Once the chocolate liquor is collected, a portion of it is sent to the hydraulic presses, not only to produce cocoa powder but to obtain cocoa butter, which is later used in making milk chocolate and sweet chocolate. The remaining portion of the chocolate liquor is added to various mixtures to make different kinds of chocolate.For milk chocolate, the chocolate liquor is combined with either powdered milk mixed with pulverized sugar, or with a mixture of fluid milk and dissolved sugar that has been reduced to a powder by boiling under high vacuum at low temperatures to prevent caramelization. For sweet chocolate, the chocolate liquor is mixed with pulverized sugar.After the various mixtures are blended, they are usually subjected to their first fine grinding by steel roll refiners. After this initial grinding, the cocoa butter obtained in the hydraulic presses is added to convert the fine powders into pastes of desired consistency. Spices and flavorings are usually added at this stage, and further grinding and flavoring procedures are carried out with or without the application of heat. The only processes that remain are those of viscosity standardization, tempering, molding into bars, blocks, or cakes, and the wrapping, packaging, and shipping of the chocolate. All these procedures are conducted under strict controls because of the perishable nature of most chocolate products when subjected to exposure and particularly to heat. The words ""cacao"" and ""chocolate"" stem directly from the languages of the Maya and Aztec Indians of Central America. It is not known exactly when cacao trees were first cultivated, but it is known that cacao beans played an important role in these Indians' lives as a form of currency and as the chief ingredient of a cold sugarless beverage that they called cacahuatl, enjoyed by members of the upper class. In the early 1500's Spanish explorers in Central America noted the popularity of the drink but were not attracted to it because of its bitterness.Being familiar with sugar, they sweetened the drink to produce a new kind of beverage, served hot. Named chocolatl by the Indians to distinguish it from cacahuatl, it was brought back to Spain by Heman Cortes.During the next two centuries, as the popularity of the drink spread from the Spanish court to the courts of other European countries, it became the fashion to serve chocolate to royal guests. In 1720 the Swedish botanist and taxonomist Carolus Linnaeus gave the cacao tree the scientific name Theobroma cacao, derived from Greek words meaning ""cacao, the food of the gods."" The food value of the drink, however, had been recognized two centuries earlier by Cortes who, in a letter to his emperor, Charles V, wrote that chocolatl is ""the divine drink that builds up resistance and fights fatigue.""In the late 18th century, French and Dutch processors began experimenting with methods of defatting chocolate liquor, leading to the manufacture of chocolate powder. The idea of adding finely ground sugar to the residual cocoa butter followed, and it is believed that the first solid eating chocolate was sold in England in the mid-1800's. The food value of the solid chocolate was soon recognized. Chocolate bars were included as standard rations items for troops in the South African War and World Wars I and II."
369,Why Is Coffee so Amazing?,food," Photo by Julius Schorzman Coffee, introduced to Europe by the Arabs in the sixteenth century, is the most widely drunk beverage in the world.It is enjoyed not only for its rich flavor and aroma, which come from an oil called caffeol produced in roasting, but also for the caffeine it contains, which has a stimulating effect on the nervous and blood systems. Leading coffee drinking countries include the United States, Germany, France, Italy and Australia. Great coffee plantations are found in Latin America, southern Asia, and Africa. The common coffee plants are Coffea arabica (grown mostly in Latin America) and Coffea robusta (cultivated mainly in Africa). Coffee plants reach maturity after four years and remain productive for about 30 years more, but there is usuallya drop in quality in about the 15th year, after which the trees are usually replaced. After the ripe berries are picked, the coffee seeds, or beans, are extracted by machine and the residual pulpy mass left over is used for fertilizer. The seeds are cleaned and then sun- or machine-dried, after which they are hulled, sorted by quality and size, graded, and shipped to market.Most coffee beans are roasted before being sold; this gives them a dry, brittle texture and a deep brown color. They alsoacquire their typically rich coffee aroma during roasting by undergoing a complex chemical change. The freshly roasted coffee is cooled and ground, although some customers prefer to grind and even roast the beans themselves. Instant coffee may be powdered or freeze-dried. Both types are made in two stages-brewing and moisture-removal.More than 100 different kinds of coffee beans are marketed, each with its own flavor. The differences arise mainly from the climate and soil types in the various growing regions."
370,Where Does Coffee Come From?,food," Photo taken by moi Although usually referred to as a tree, coffee is actually an evergreen shrub. If left unpruned, it would reach a height of 14 to 30 feet (3-9 meters). Its leaves are dark green and glossy on top and a lighter, duller green underneath. They are 3 to 6 inches (7-15 cm) long and grow opposite each other along the branches. At the points where the pairs of leaves join the branches, many small white blossoms appear at the time of flowering and give the coffee plantation the appearance of being covered with light snow.The fragrant blossoms fall within a few days and small berries develop that change from dark green to deep crimson as they ripen. The berries ripen about 6 to 7 months after the tree has flowered. Beneath the skin of the berry is a fleshy pulp and within the pulp is a parchment-like covering that encloses the green beans— usually 2 in each berry. The green beans have a delicate, tight-fitting, almost transparent skin.Coffee trees usually bloom once a year, although they may bloom more often in very rainy climates. The trees often have flowers, green berries, and ripe berries on their branches at the same time.Coffee trees normally begin to bear within 5 years of their initial seeding, and yield good commercial quantities of beans within 8 years. The trees produce at an optimum level for 15 to20 years, but may continue to bear commercial amounts for many more years where soil conditions are favorable. Annual yields of 1 to 1 1/2 pounds (0.5-0.7 kg) of green beans per tree are considered adequate, but they are frequently higher.While there are 20 or more commercial species of the genus Coffea, only 2 coffee trees, C. arabica and C, robusta, are raised in quantity for beans. Very few C. liberica are raised because of the poorer taste qualities of the bean. Arabica generally is preferred to other types of coffee because of its mild, rich flavor. Until the middle of the 19th century it was the only variety cultivated. But because arabica is subject to attacks by insects and disease, the more resistant robusta and liberica species were subsequently developed."
371,Coffee Roasting and Grinding,food," Photo by Mark Sweep Most coffee is roasted in the country where it will be consumed. Most processors blend different types of green beans before roasting. Roasting is performed in revolving, perforated, metal cylinders that are heated by gas or light fuel oil. The older batch roasters operate at about 400° F (200° C) for 16 to 17 minutes. The modern, continuous-process roasters operate at 500° F (260° C) for 5 minutes. A large roaster can turn out 5,000 to 10,000 pounds (2,300 to 4,500 kg) of roasted coffee per hour.Medium roasts are preferred in the United States. French and Italian roasts are much darker, and Turkish roasts are darkest of all.The roasted coffee is cooled before grinding. Grinding machines break the whole beans into particles with a series of rollers that produce from 1 to 10 grind sizes at rates up to 4,000 (1,800 kg) pounds per hour. The ground coffee is then packaged in vacuum cans or paper bags in sizes from 1/2 to 3 pounds (0.2 to 1.3 kg).Soluble (Instant) and Decaffeinated CoffeeThe possibility of preparing an extract from coffee was considered as early as 1838, when the United States Congress substituted coffee for rum in the rations of soldiers and sailors. Probably the first powdered instant coffee was invented by Sartori Kato, a Japanese chemist living in Chicago. He first sold his soluble coffee at the Pan American Exposition in Buffalo in 1901. Soluble coffee was first marketed on a broad scale in the United ^tates by the American chemist G. Washington i 1909. However, the demand for the product remained small until World War I when the entire output of all soluble coffee in the United States was purchased by the War Department for troops in the field. During World War II the government bought almost 260 million pounds (118 million kg) of instant coffee. By 1953 one cup of coffee in 10 was instant; a more recent estimate is one cup in five.Soluble coffee is produced by brewing coffee in a series of giant coffee pots. The extract moves from pot to pot until it reaches optimum strength. Then the water is removed, usually by drying. A spray nozzle atomizes the liquid in a current of hot air. The hollow spherical particles known as ""beads"" then are packaged.Decaffeinated coffee is made by several methods; each treats the green coffee to remove the caffeine. The decaffeinization processes provide a major source of caffeine for the chemical and drug industries. Each brand of coffee represents a different blend of coffee beans. A brand should be selected for its flavor, and the grind for the type of coffee maker used. For a percolator, use regular grind; for a drip pot, drip or all-purpose grind; for a vacuum style coffee maker, fine grind.Regardless of the brand, grind, or personal preference as to whether coffee should be full-bodied or light, coffee must be made full strength to obtain optimum flavor. For less than full-bodied brew, dilute the coffee with hot water after making it with the recommended coffee-to-water ratio.For each serving, use 1 coffee measure or 2 level measuring tablespoons of coffee and 6 ounces of water. Both the coffee and the water should be fresh. Coffee should be purchased in amounts that can be used within a week and should be stored in a tightly closed container in a cool, dry place. Freshly drawn cold water is desirable because the flavor of coffee is sometimes affected by mineral deposits in hot water pipes.The coffee maker should be clean and should not be used at less than three' fourths of its capacity. If a percolator is used, perk gently for 6 to 8 minutes. If a drip or cone type coffee maker is used, dripping is usually completed in 4 to 6 minutes. In vacuum pots, boiling water that rises into the upper bowl should be allowed"
372,Facts About Coffee,food," Photo by Mark Sweep. The coffee bean is the roasted fruit of a shrub of the genus Criffea.After being separated from the pods by maceration, the beans are allowed to undergo a spontaneous fermentation in tanks, and then washed and dried either in the sun or in hot air rotary machines.The chief coffee producing areas are: South America (Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador); West Indies (St. Domingo and Haiti); East Indies (Ceylon, Java, Mysore); Mexico; Arabia.The coffee from each of these countries possesses individual characteristics in addition to the general dietetic and physiological properties that are common to all coffees.The South American coffees are somewhat lacking in the volatile oils that give rise to aroma and flavor, but contain a full content of the stimulating principle caffeine and a high percentage of the soluble organic constituents giving body.Arabian coffee (Mocha) is very rich in the aromatic oils, and produces the best infusion for flavor and aroma. In the same way that different teas are blended to give specific gustatory characteristics, so coffees from different areas are mixed to secure the same result.The coffee beans are prepared for infusion by roasting and grinding. The roasting operation has a most important influence on the quality of the coffee, especially in relation to aroma and flavor. If the chemical action is carried too far the resulting coffee Jacks flavor by loss of the volatile constituents. Under-roasted coffee also lacks flavor on account of restriction in the development of the aromatic oils.The proportion of caffeine in coffee is less than that found in tea, but the infusion contains usually more on account of the greater weight used in proportion to water.The best infusion is prepared from freshly roasted and ground coffee, as the aromatic and flavoring bodies are then fresh and at their maximum. Failing freshly roasted coffee, the next best is freshly ground coffee from the coffee nibs.This operation may be easily carried out in the home by the use of an ordinary hand coffee grinding machine.The infusion of coffee contains the following constituents in solution: Chicory is the ground, dried, roasted root of a species of endive and is largely used in combination with genuine coffee to form blends. Roasted chicory yields among other constituents, caramel, inulin and invert sugar. Caffeine, fat, aromatic oils and caffeo-tannic acid are absent, so that it has no stimulating properties and does not give the aroma or flavor which characterizes pure coffee. The addition of chicory to coffees lowers the value of the beverage as a nervine stimulant, reduces the aroma and masks the flavor. It, however, adds color, body and sweetness to the infusion and cheapens the product.Coffee, when properly made and taken at suitable times in moderation, is a valuable and exhilarating, harmless beverage, fragrant, and most welcome to the palate. It is best taken with milk or cream, black coffee being reserved for after dinner. It is suitable for breakfast, and as an after meal stimulant, and at those times when a fillip is needed for the nervous system after strenuous mental effort."
373,Cornbread: The Universal Table Dish,food," I was born in the south. I live in the south and will die in the south. This is only a small part of the memories I share. This is the good stuff. The ages-long love of cornbread is not an isolated item. Most southerners love cornbread. There is not one thing wrong about eating cornbread. Fact: cornbread can be considered a universal table dish that everyone can enjoy--from the youngest to the eldest person. No one turns down a good slice of hot cornbread. I know. I have enjoyed countless pieces of this manna from Heaven. You can enjoy cornbread with almost any table food. White beans, pinto beans, blackeye peas, garden beans, yellow corn, boiled corn, fried okra, tomato gravy and the list continues to grow. Cornbread is that good. Simple to make (see recipe, preparation below), and before long, you can have yourself a feast with cornbread by itself. Personally, my dad, rest his soul, taught me the pleasure of eating cornbread mixed with buttermilk (in a drinking glass) with cup-up shallots mixed together and I have to tell you. I was in Heaven by myself by each delicious bite of this creation that I took. The truth be told, I ust had to have myself another helping of my dad's homemade cornbread, buttermilk, and shallots recipe. And enjoyed this recipe throughout my teen life and on into adulthood. There are many in 2021 who still love to drink cold buttermilk out of the refrigerator on a hot day. Even without any mixings, the buttermilk tastes delicious. So copy down the cornbread recipe below and have youself a dish that you and your family and neighbors can enjoy the year around. Samuel Clemens aka Mark Twain. What this American icon said about cornbread: “The North thinks it know how to make corn bread, but this is a gross superstition. Perhaps no bread in the world is quite as good as Southern corn bread, and perhaps no bread in the world is quite as bad as the Northern imitation of it.” — Mark Twain Ingredients1/4 cup butter (1/2 stick)1 cup milk1 large egg1 1/4 cups yellow, white or blue cornmeal1 cup Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour1/2 cup granulated sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/2 teaspoon salt Preparation: 1) Make sure that you heat the oven to 400°F. Spray bottom completely and the sides of an 8-inch square pan or 9-inch round cake pan with cooking spray. 2) Heat In a 1-quart saucepan butter over low heat until melted. 3) In a large bowl, beat melted butter, milk and egg with a fork or wire whisk until well mixed. Add cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder and salt at one time; stir just until the flour is moistened (batter will be lumpy). Pour batter in the pan; then use a rubber spatula to scrape batter from bowl. Spread batter evenly in pan and smooth top of batter. 4) Bake 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown and put a toothpick in the center so it comes out clean. Serve warm.

My mother would tell you that putting sugar in cornbread is sacrilegious. I also don't like a lot of flour in it, and her recipe called for adding baking soda also. My husband likes the sugar, so I developed my own recipe. No baking soda just baking powder, only one tablespoon sugar, and a ratio of one part flour to four parts cornmeal. I never liked buttermilk, but it's delicious in cornbread. Your recipe sounds like it's easy to make. Peggy Woods from Houston, Texas on October 24, 2021: I enjoy eating cornbread once in a while.  Thanks for the reminder.  I'll have to make some soon.  Yes to buttermilk! Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on October 24, 2021: Cornbread is not easy to make well...especially for some of us Yankees. :-)  However, I never thought of the buttermilk.  What a great idea.  I look forwad to trying this.  Thank you. Kyler J Falk from California on October 23, 2021: I have not read this piece, but I did read the title and the description. Just came to say that I do not like cornbread. It is too sweet, too many people are unable to make a decent homemade cornbread, and overall it is near-last on my list of go-to culinary dishes. Nonetheless, despite my distaste for cornbread you can have a hefty cheers from me. Tonight is good ole John on ice, and may whatever you're having treat you just as tender."

375,4 Different Types of Equipment That Are Essential to Have On the Farm,food," Photo by Julia Koblitz on Unsplash One of the keys to having a successful farm is to have the right equipment. You may be overwhelmed with all of the different tools involved with running a farm, but you don't necessarily have to buy everything. Instead, focus first on tools like the ones suggested below as a start to figuring out what you actually need. There are several different types of tractors out there, but they’re all mainly used to complete tasks around the farm and operate farming equipment by pulling it along. This can be anything from plows, trailers, manure spreaders, or hay balers. Depending on the size of your farm and the task at hand, you should choose the right size tractor for you. For smaller things, you can choose a compact tractor. This is a small type of tractor that can help you perform the basic things that you need to do on the farm. Wheeled tractors are another option that you have. This is a type of general-purpose tractor. They can be used for a variety of things, such as pulling equipment, tilling, and handling various types of equipment. Track tractors do not come with tires. They have rubber tracks. You can use this tractor to plow your field. An orchard tractor is something else that you can use. They are specifically designed to be used in the orchards. Every farmer needs a pickup truck, or at the very least some form of a heavy-duty vehicle, for several reasons. They’re generally one of the best options for hauling farming supplies and various equipment around the property, are very durable when driving off-road, and can handle heavy loads, whether that be from the bed of the truck or from a trailer you can hitch to the back. You need fertilizer to provide your plants with the nutrients that they need in order to grow bigger and stronger than they would without. It also helps your crops grow faster and in greater abundance, meaning a bigger yield come harvesting time. It will be easier for you to spread your fertilizer across the field if you use a spreader, which is designed to cover a wider area than you on your own ever could. There are three types of spreaders that you can use, which are the broadcast spreader, manure spreader, and slurry spreader. The broadcast spreader uses gravity to disperse the fertilizer. Meanwhile, the manure spreader takes the manure straight from the animals and spreads it across the field. The slurry spreader is designed to spread liquid manure. Keep in mind that there are some spreaders that are designed to be attached to UTVs and ATVs instead of tractors. If you’re unable to obtain a manure spreader, a plow is also an option for getting organic matter introduced to your soil. A plow is necessary to aerate the soil and break it up further, breaking down large clumps or blocky patches that wouldn’t be very useful otherwise. It’s also useful in churning organic matter, such as manure, further into the soil and removing weeds that might have invaded. A plow breaks up the soil enough that root growth and drainage become easier, meaning you can plant more plentiful crops. Plows, in general, are useful in that they prepare your fields for incoming crops, making seeding the soil much easier. Like a spreader or most large farming equipment, you can attach a plow to either your truck or a tractor. It’s best to plow maybe once a year, reversing the directions every year to further mix the soil and allow for new organic growth. Having a farm is a lot of hard work, and it comes with a lot of specialized equipment. However, focusing on the right equipment means you can spend more time working on your crops and less time fretting over if you even have the ability. The main pieces of equipment to worry over are owning a tractor, a truck, a plow, and a fertilizer spreader.

376,Traditional Indian Sweets For Festivals: Thekua or Khajur Recipe,food," Chitrangada has nutrition in mind when cooking for her family. Making tasty nutritious food is a skill she has perfected over the years. Thekua in Bihar, Khajur in Uttar Pradesh— Traditional Indian Recipe Chitrangada Sharan Images The traditional recipes of India are rich in flavour, and a delight to all the senses.The traditional Indian food is influenced by many factors, such as the seasons, culture and region, to which they belong. In other words, the food and spices which grow, in that particular region of India, are included as ingredients in the delicious recipes. The food choices also keep on changing, according to the seasons. So, you have those agricultural products and thus recipes in winter season, which keep you warm, and protect you from winter related health issues. Similarly, in summer season, you have agricultural produce and recipes, which keep you cool, and protect you from summer related health issues. There are so many rich sweets and snacks, prepared on specific festivals and special occasions, which we have seen our mothers, and grandmothers preparing, with so much love and passion. It’s important to maintain the traditions and also pass it on to the next generations. Thekua is a centuries old, dry and sweet snack, which is prepared on festivals like, Teej puja, Chath puja, Vat Savitri Puja, weddings and special occasions in the Northern states of India, such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and others. Thekua is also known as, Khajuria, Khasta Khajur, Thikari and some other names.The main ingredients used to prepare Thekua is, whole wheat flour, sugar or jaggery, pure ghee (clarified butter), dry coconut, fennel seed. Some people combine other flours, like rice flour, maida (self raising flour), semolina etc. But, traditionally the Thekua is made of wheat flour, and it tastes best with this.

377,"Pineapple – Healthy, Nutritious & Delicious!",food," Fredda Branyon has dedicated her life to the advancement of complementary medicine. The pineapple is a fantastic tropical fruit that is exceptionally juicy and has a distinctly tropical flavor. Pineapple is more than a delectable tropical fruit; it also has a range of significant health benefits and has been used in traditional folk medicine for many years. The English term pineapple (or pina in Spanish) refers to the fruit’s resemblance to a pinecone. Pineapple (Ananus comosus, Bromeliaceae) is a 90- to 100-cm-tall herbaceous perennial with rosette-like spreading leaves. Individual berries form the fruit, which grows in clusters around a central core, with each pineapple scale representing a single flower or berry. It originated in the Americas and is grown throughout the world in tropical climates. Pineapple – a nutritional powerhouse Sweet but low in calories, pineapples are rich in vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and antioxidants. Vitamins ·        Vitamin C - Pineapple is notably high in vitamin C, an anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting antioxidant. The U.S. Department of Agriculture calculates that one cup of pineapple has 78.9 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C. That is greater than the recommended daily intake of 75 mg for adult women and close to 90 mg for males. Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is required to grow and repair all bodily tissues. It contributes to various body functions, including collagen synthesis, iron absorption, wound healing, and cartilage, bone, and tooth preservation. As a powerful immune system booster, it is a vitamin everyone should have amply nowadays. ·        Vitamin B1 and B6. In addition to Vitamin C, pineapples have vitamins B1 (thiamine) and B6 (pyridoxine), which, together with B12 (cobalamin), are necessary for the neurological system’s correct functioning. ·        Minerals - Pineapple juice contains large amounts of calcium, potassium, and manganese. Enzymes Bromelain - is a complex mixture of substances present in the pineapple plant’s fruit and stem. Among the many components are a group of protein-digesting enzymes called cysteine proteinases. Pineapples are members of the bromeliad family, thus the scientific name - Ananus Comosus, Bromeliaceae. Pineapples are the only bromeliad that produces edible fruit. Bromelain cancer benefits - According to the American Cancer Society, pineapple has a high concentration of bromelain, which may aid in digestion and the treatment of osteoarthritis. Cancer is frequently connected with chronic inflammation, and bromelain and other proteolytic enzymes have improved the lifespan of animals with different malignancies. According to research done in 2010, bromelain may be useful in the fight against cancer by impacting cancer cell growth and controlling the key pathways supporting malignancy. Other health benefits of Ananus comosus, Bromeliaceae Natural fresh pineapple is best Pineapples are a good way of getting some essential vitamins and minerals and bromelain, and dietary fiber. However, canned pineapple has fewer of these benefits. The canned variety is also higher in calories and sugar. If you will purchase the canned variety, choose the one with no added sugar or syrup. Umesh Chandra Bhatt from Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, India on October 19, 2021: Very informative. Thanks"

379,How to start a Food Truck Business,food," Johnathan Muller is a very inquisitive Capetonian who takes an interest in everything around him. Follow his journey of lifelong learning Unbranded Trailer Unbranded Trailer Server Side WHY DO YOU WANT THIS? Owning a food truck can be very rewarding and a lot of fun. If you love cooking then this is an opportunity to explore your creative side. The success, i have have found, lay is finding your niche. It pays to be different. No two food trucks are the same and never ever see another food truck as competition. Always remember that you are your own limitation or success. This is a place for out-of-the-box thinking. Sometimes it becomes a strain to get up every morning, hook up your trailer to get to your site on time. On days when this happens it pays to reflect on why you do what you do. In other words your Vision will be your driving force when things get tough. This is of great importance.  At the time of writing this article, the City of Cape Town (CoCT) had no legislation regarding food Trucks. Click on this link to get and idea of what is required before you can trade. They were in the process of putting some in place. It is a requirement to have the required permits and licenses in place no matter where you trade. These include: Places to trade... here are some suggestions  Please note that at all of these places you still need to have all the permits in place.   Which Food Truck or Trailer to buy In South Africa Food Trucks and Food Trailers and Mobile Kitchens are known by one name, Food Trucks. When you apply for a Trading License the authorities talk about a Food Truck. Know what you want to do produce before investing in a trailer. It is an expensive investment and you don't want to get it wrong. There are 2 types of trailer construction. They are: PANELED TRAILERSA Paneled Trailer is a metal frame built on a chassis and the frame is covered in metal sheeting. Usually this is galvanized sheeting or some type of rust resistant material such as Chromadek. These trailers are usually lighter in weight than the insulated trailers. They're easier to tow around but they become very hot inside when you're working outside in the sun. They are cheaper in price than the Insulated Trailers. The body of the Trailer usually becomes buckled and appears dented after a few months from being towed around. INSULATED TRAILERS The insulated trailers are made from the same material used to make blast freezers. Its insulation material sandwiched between two sheets of Chromadek. Its rust proof and the insulation keeps the trailer cool inside when working in the sun. The trailers made of this material is usually heavier. They are more expensive that paneled trailers but they display a lot more professionally and they look very neat. FOOD TRUCKS and OTHER TYPES OF TRAILERS Food trucks Strictly speaking, a Food Truck is a suitable motorised vehicle that has been converted into a Food Vendor entity. The advantage here is when you have a situation where there is a race for space situation and you have to get on the road and to the venue very quickly. You don't have to worry about hooking up a trailer. On arrival you don't have the hassle of unhooking the trailer and having to level it with the dropdown stabalisers. Other trailers I've seen trailers that are made from various other material such as wood but theses are not ideal for many reasons. For one, they are not easy to maintain and they do not display or maintain their integrity very well. IMPORTANT ASPECTS TO CONSIDER When considering any trailer: This too is of utmost importance and can cost a lot of money and time. It is essentially important to have good branding. Advertising your business and what it does needs to be hugely displayed. If you are not well displayed you will not attract curiosity and you will not become well known. If you're intending to trade at various markets, you will become well know very quickly by your vehicle branding. This means that a combination of your Colour scheme, Logo, Specialty (what you're known for) and description and price of your foods must be well displayed. Regards this to be as important as the food you sell. Coca Cola and a few other Food and Beverage offer free branding of their products on your vehicle and in turn they print the name of your business and pictures of your menu. You will need to negotiate vwery clearly about what it is you want displayed and how.  Do not have a menu with too many items. It seldom works. It looks impressive but it also means you have to carry more stock. You don't have a huge space to work in and you don't have lots of space to store things. The menu also determines how many people you need inside the trailer, and the less people the better. Choosing the right equipment... Gas or electricity This will depend on what it is you intend to sell and where you intend to trade. I have Gas operated equipment only and it has served me well. I can trade just about anywhere. I don't have the convenience of a Fridge but I get along well with an Ice box. Yes, it does limit me a little bit with how much stock I can carry but I overcome that with careful planning. Gas Chip Fryers pose a huge danger if you don't have temperature control because if your oil reaches dangerously high temperatures, it could ignite and cause a fire inside your trailer. This is where having an electric fryer is an advantage because you have better control over your heat.             "
380,The Shocking Truths About Italian Food Explained by an Italian,food," A dish of Italian tortelli with butter & sage Think about Italy and one thing will surely come to your mind: food. Italian food always fascinates people from every part of the world. Pasta & pizza are among the most popular dishes one think about when talking about Italy, even if, of course, these represent only a small percentage of the vast food scenery in the country. Every Italian region has their own specialties and diversity is the word that best represents food in Italy: it’s the same for China, and in fact Italy may be considered the ‘China of Europe’, as both countries share the same love for food and the same variety among different regions. The fact that Italian food is so famous everywhere is surely good for our country, but also represents a risk, as many people end up eating dishes that they believe to be Italian, without knowing they don’t even exist in Italy. In alternative, they may be paying very much for the real value of what they are eating, just because some people are willing to pay a premium charged by some restaurants, believing Italian food to be so expensive, while at the fact they are not eating expensive dishes. In general, when something becomes so valued and appreciated, there is always somebody ready to exploit this, that’s why this article is going to give you an advice for when you are planning to eat Italian food in your country or even on a trip to Italy (yes, Italy features many of the so called ‘tourist traps’ you should be aware of). This is not uncommon if you travel around the world: food from other countries always tends to be readapted to local tastes, sometimes ending with inventing completely new dishes that don’t even exist in the home country. We see this with Chinese food, as many people who go out for a Chinese dinner don’t even realize they are mostly eating Westernized dishes that have nothing to do with the real dishes you can find if you travel to China, otherwise, they may eat real Chinese dishes, but still made in a different way so that they are adapted to Western taste (for example, restaurants in China generally propose spicier dishes than those proposed in the Western countries). Italian food is nothing different and share another destiny with Chinese food: it is completely adapted to other countries tastes. We see this with pizza, as pizza proposed by American chains of pizzerias are so different than Italian pizzas that we commonly refers to them by calling them ‘American pizzas’ and not simply ‘pizzas’. We see this with pasta, as you won’t find dishes like ‘Fettuccine Alfredo’ or ‘spaghetti with meatballs’, or - again - ‘pasta with chicken’ in a restaurant in Italy. We see this also with some cheeses that are sold in Italy and that are totally different in other countries (for example ‘mozzarella’, which is a fresh, white and soft cheese sold in ‘balls’ and that also features liquid, until you discover that in most supermarkets of the USA, ‘mozzarella‘ is a name used for a kind of dried cheese that has nothing to do with the Italian mozzarella). The reality is that, if you have ever eaten Italian food outside Italy, in most cases you would have eaten at least once in your life a dish that has nothing to do with Italy. That is not necessarily negative, as maybe that dish was good for the taste of the specific country in which you have eaten Italian food (and maybe for your taste too): it’s just a matter of being aware of this. Small mozzarella balls served with tomatoes Mozzarella slices served with tomatoes This is a truth even some locals here in Italy refuse to accept. Italian food is, sometimes, overpriced. In the USA it is overpriced because of costs of importation. A buffalo milk mozzarella cheese in Italy would cost more or less $3.5, while in the USA the same mozzarella ball would cost $12 or more. Still, when the general opinion values something too much, that is an excuse to rise the prices. To make it more simple: if people are willing to pay a premium for Italian food, Italian food will be sold at a high price. As written before, this happens in the same Italy. Let’s take in example a common restaurant you would be likely to find in a city centre of any Italian town. Here you would generally be charged just for sitting at the table: a tax known as ‘coperto’, which we could refer to as ‘cover charge’. If the restaurant in question is using tablecloth, the ‘coperto’ is justified in order to cover the costs of the laundry. Still, many restaurants apply this fee (that is hated also by most Italians), even if they use simple paper placemats, like those used in fast food restaurants. When you are charged with a ‘coperto’ and you are not given a tablecloth, some bread and maybe a welcome dish, you are simply paying a premium that will mostly end in a pure profit for the restaurant. In any case, a reasonable ‘coperto’ should not exceed €1.5/€2. Another thing you should pay attention to when eating in a restaurant in Italy is the so called ‘distorted perception of value’ that is mostly applied to pasta dishes, for example. In Italy pasta is a primary asset and it is very cheap: you should be wondered and a little shocked when you see some pasta dishes in a restaurant menu sold at prices that can even touch $13-$15 for even small portions. This ‘premium price’ is accepted even in Italy and not only for special pasta recipes that involve the use of expensive ingredients, but also for apparently simple pasta recipes you could even easily make at home. How is this possible? The trick is very simple: just give the pasta dish a long name by remarking all the ingredients employed in a way that makes the customer believe these are expensive ingredients. So it is easy to propose a ‘pasta with vegetables’, that in any small eatery near universities or workplaces (eateries that are generally the best deal if you want to eat good food at a fair price) would be sold at a third the price you would pay in a premium restaurant, at a high price by simply calling it ‘pasta 100% Italian whole grain salted with biological zucchini - special selection of the garden‘. This is just an example of the way many premium restaurants make you believe you are eating something special and exclusive, while at the fact you are eating something very easy to make at home and with not much expensive ingredients. A delicious pasta with tomatoes and eggplants served in an Italo-Chinese restaurant If we add other well known psychological tricks premium restaurants apply in order to make you spend more, like using dim lighting everywhere (dim lighting leading to more food ordering because of the particular relaxed mood you are trying to replicate is not much different to putting high volume music in a shop in order to increase sales) or avoiding to write the currency symbol near the price on the menu (this may lighten the attention on the real price we are paying for a dish), here we come to the real reason why in many Italian restaurants you are overpaying for the food and silently accepting this with no problem (as written before, this happens with Italian people too). Of course pandemic doesn’t help and the high taxes we have in Italy contribute even more to the awareness that restaurants are paying a lot in order to run the business: still, the inflation of price it happens to see in some Italian restaurants is something to be aware of, especially if a pasta dish sold in an eatery near the university or a workplace, or again, in many Italian restaurants run by foreigners (in Italy it is not uncommon to even find Italo-Chinese restaurants, making two menus and with excellent Italian food too), costs much less than the same dish sold in a premium high level restaurant. If Italian restaurants used to cost less, also the profit the restaurant makes on the single customer would be lower (even if still more than enough to run the business): at the opposite, more people would eat more often at the restaurant and stop seeing this as an ‘expensive activity to do only in special occasions‘. In addition, some restaurants that decide to make excessive expenses in marketing and customized packages (it costs more than you may believe) in order to ’look cool at any cost’ may choose to cut these expenses and exploit this opportunity in order to lower prices of the dishes: at the end, if the same dish costs more in the restaurant that pretends to be cool and less in a restaurant that doesn’t bend itself to the logics of the modern excessive research of the appearance, why should I pay a premium in the first restaurant, when in the second I get quality food for a much lower price? It’s the same for products we buy at the supermarket: why should I pay a premium for the highly advertised product if the alternative product costs less and is maybe of better quality? Even if my point of view is a little critic towards some Italian restaurants that make you pay a premium for what you eat, that point of view changes from ‘critic’ to ‘totally disgusted‘ if we come to restaurants that literally fool tourists by making them pay exaggerated prices, sometimes by even serving them frozen dishes. You should be especially aware if you decide to stop in a cafe or a restaurant located in a touristic area like the city center of a famous Italian city. If you enter a cafe, always pay attention to the written menu (if there’s not a written menu go away, as it is mandatory for public places in Italy to expose prices): does the cappuccino cost €1.4? If yes, that’s is the price you have to pay. So why some tourists end up being charged even €5 for a coffee or cappuccino? Because they are not aware they are being fooled. A good way to avoid these scams is surely to read Google Maps reviews before entering a place. With restaurants, this is even worse, as it may happen to pay €12-€18 for a frozen pizza in some city centers (while a good genuine - and not frozen - pizza in Italy can be generally eaten for €4 - €6) . Again, reading the reviews before entering will save you from being literally robbed by unlawful business owners that make profit on tourists that only want to enjoy their trip to a country they believe to be 100% beautiful and happy, only to find that we have also our problems and - first of all - people who dishonor Italian hospitality by robbing tourists or - even worse - insulting them in Italian language if they are even racists. Luckily, in the era of internet, reviews may save a tourist from a bad experience, still, not many are used to read them, that’s why unfair business owners are still robbing tourists every day. © 2021 Alessio Ganci"

384,'Why Is Bubble Tea Expensive?' & Other Trivial Facts Explained by a Bubble Tea Shop Manager,food," Long queues outside, a cashier who takes orders, various baristas that are rushing to serve everyone as quickly as possible. This may be the scenario of your favorite coffee shop in the city centre, maybe before the COVID-19 pandemic: it is also what usually happens outside a bubble tea shop. Don't you know exactly what we are talking about? Don't worry: bubble tea is a beverage which is very popular in China, still it is a new trend in the Western countries. Some people still don't know what is a bubble tea, some others have maybe tried it for the first time a hour ago, other ones are literally addicted to this delicious and refreshening drink that both looks good and tastes good too. Still, what is bubble tea? The inside of a bubble tea shop in Italy Bubble tea is, of course, made of tea. This tea is flavored with syrups or specific powders. Also other elements like fresh, condensed or powder milk (or coffee creamers as an alternative to milk) may be added in order to get a final beverage which is generally sweet and delicious, but not only: it has also a specific color, which makes it also very good looking and nice to order if you love to share food pictures on Instagram. Finally, there is the special thing that makes bubble tea also a very funny drink, especially loved by young people: the so called ""boba"", also known as ""bubbles"", sort of jellies added to the bottom of the cup and that are filled with syrups inside: they are meant to literally pop in your mouth when you pull them up with a big straw, so that you are literally drinking and eating at the same time. Because of the fact you have to combine a flavor of bubble tea with one or more flavors of bobas, this kind of beverage is considered funny to be ordered, because you can always experiment with different combinations. As you can guess, bubble tea is a trend that has mostly conquered young people, who every day spend their money in something that makes them happy to drink and share with their friends. Despite bubble tea is now a very popular trend, there are still many questions that people have about this beverage. At the end, people don't generally know the process that lays behind the entire production of bubble tea: unless you have worked in a bubble tea shop, it is probable you don't know some aspects of how does a bubble tea shop work. That is the reason of this article: not only I drink bubble tea often and I have even tried it directly in China, but I also run a bubble tea shop in my country. Being directly someone who knows firsthand what does it really mean making and selling one of the most loved drinks of the last years by young people, here I am in order to answer some of the most popular questions about bubble tea. Let's admit it: most people get shocked about the price of a bubble tea, especially in the USA, but also in Europe (even if in my country, Italy, for example, a bubble tea is surely cheaper than in the USA). In China it is a different story, as in the country where bubble tea is drunk everywhere and it is something as common as coffee in Italy, you end up paying few bucks for a bubble tea (in a place where the materials to make bubble tea are generally local). At the end, it's the same if we consider Italian food (which is very expensive in the USA and definitely cheaper in Italy) or coffee (in Italy coffee is very cheap, while in China it is very expensive). In the country of bubble tea you are generally not going to pay more than in any other bubble tea shop of the globe. Turning to the question 'why is bubble tea so expensive?' some people may think it is because of the fact we are talking about a trend. I admit I was thinking the same before running my own bubble tea shop. The reality is that, even if trends surely make prices go high, there is much more behind. The fact is that materials employed in order to make a bubble tea are very expensive. The disposable cups make part of the cost (especially if you are choosing to use biodegradable cups, that are generally more expensive but at least help to reduce dispersion of plastic in the environment), but then we come to the materials that are used in order to make a bubble tea. Bobas and syrups are generally imported from Chinese companies. Companies in the Mainland China are generally selling bubble tea materials within the country, while the factories that produce the vast majority of the materials used by bubble tea shop in the Western countries are mostly located in Taiwan. We can say that a relatively small area is literally providing all the stuff that makes the whole business of bubble tea possible in every part of the world. All the materials produced in these factories are then labelled and exported to distributors that generally buy them in bulk and then sell them to other local distributors in the various countries. The bubble tea shop is then going to buy all the stuff from the local distributor of his choice. As there is a long commercial chain that starts from the factory and then arrive to the final beverage sold in your local bubble tea shop, this is the real reason of why bubble tea is an expensive beverage. It is expensive just like an Italian DOP product would be expensive in the USA: costs of importation and a long commercial chain contribute surely more to the price of a bubble tea than the fact it is a trend among young people. Surely there are bubble tea shops that are even more expensive than others: if your favorite shop spends a lot of money in commercials, TikTok videos, has many baristas and it is located in a very central area, you should expect to pay more than in an independent shop not belonging to a chain, not so central and not investing much money in ads: still you are not going to pay for a bubble tea the same you would pay if you were in China, where bubble tea is local and where you can drink it in many places, even in restaurants and to the Karaoke. A drinking corner inside a Chinese internet cafe, where you can order a bubble tea to drink while using the computers To sum up, the fact bubble tea is a trend is surely adding to the price of your drink. The fact that bubble tea is mostly drunk by specific people who are in love with this trend (especially young people) surely adds to the price (we are not talking about a product sold in a supermarket and bought literally by everyone, we are instead talking about something that has still a niche). Almost everyone goes to the supermarket, not everyone goes to the bubble tea shop: this adds surely to the price. The long chain of distribution of materials employed to make bubble tea is still what mostly makes the price of a bubble tea. A milk tea with brown fructose ordered in China Nowadays it seems trendy to demonize food and drinks with no appeal. It is enough to search for ""is pizza unhealthy"" in order to get articles that are going to convince you pizza is something you have to avoid at every cost, even if it is a healthy Italian margherita pizza with just tomato and mozzarella cheese. No different story for bubble tea: of course this beverage is sweet and caloric, this does not mean you are going to sell your soul to the Devil if you sometimes drink a bubble tea. This is even more true if we consider there are various kinds of bubble tea drinks: if you are ordering a super sweet milk tea with addition of cream, toppings and maybe double portion of bobas you are surely drinking something that may be considered as a weekly cheat to the diet. If you are instead drinking a simple flavored green tea with bobas, you are having something sweet (with the addition of bobas that is not helping at all), but maybe even less caloric than other beverages or pastries you may love. Bubble tea is sweet and contains also some food coloring: nothing more than many sweet food and drinks you may find at your local grocery, so why demonizing bubble tea like some online articles do? Drinking a bubble tea is not better or worse than drinking a soda or eating an ice cream, just get it when you want it and drink it without worrying too much (unless you are drinking 5 bubble tea drinks a day). Have you ever watched carefully your bubble tea shop barista when he/she was making your beverage? It seems so easy to make a bubble tea, isn't it? Just add some syrup, some tea, shake it, add bobas and nothing more, yeah? Well, even tons of online videos show you how to make a bubble tea, you can actually make it even at home. Of course, 'making a bubble tea' and 'making a good bubble tea' are two completely different things. Before opening the bubble tea shop to the public we do many things, like, of course, preparing the boilers of tea. Every bubble tea shop has their own recipe in order to make the tea and to balance syrups with other ingredients. Before opening my shop I have tried many times every beverage I was going to sell, studying what was the best proportion of quantities of the different ingredients I was going to add to the specific beverage. I could in no way think to open a bubble tea shop after having watched an online video or after having simply looked at the barista of another shop. If making a bubble tea was so easy as the statement 'just put some tea, syrup, and shake it' may suggest, that would mean taste of bubble tea has to be 100% the same in every place. The reality is that making bubble tea is no way different than preparing food. Pizza is not the same in every place and making pizza is not an easy task, unless you believe making pizza is just 'rolling out some dough, topping it with tomato sauce and cheese, baking it and serving it'. The same applies to bubble tea, even if someone may wonder how much complexity and effort lays behind what it may look at a first glance as a 'simple beverage'. Many people believe bubble tea should be mostly drunk in summer as a refreshening beverage. The reality is that many drinks can be made hot too, so that you can drink a bubble tea in every period of the year. Summer is still the period where a bubble tea shop generally earns more in absolute, while in the winter you have to try to increase earnings by expanding your offer: still bubble tea is drunk in winter too and there is nothing weird in doing it, even if, of course, you would prefer to drink it sitting at the table or by ordering it at home, rather than drinking it while walking through the streets like you would do in summer. Has this article helped you to understand better some of the most trivial things regarding bubble tea? Have you other curiosities about one of the most loved beverages of the last years?"
385,Nettle Beer Recipe,food," I have been a chef for the last 10 years but I enjoy writing as a hobby. I really enjoy writing for Hubpages because it is fun! Stinging nettles are considered among most people to be weeds and are often torn out of people's gardens and thrown onto the compost heap. Most gardeners will tell you about how great nettles are for making amazing, organic compost that helps to grow beautiful flowers and tasty fruit and vegetables. There are those among the population who know that nettles are edible and are very tasty. There are many recipes out there containing nettles. Nettles can be used instead of spinach in most recipes. Also, you can make a really tasty pesto out of stinging nettles. ""How can you eat stinging nettles?"", you may ask. They sting you. ""Wouldn't they hurt you?"". They could hurt you if you eat them raw (although some people do eat them raw and there are places where they eat stinging nettles in a contest. The one who eats the largest number of raw nettles wins a trophy). If you dip your nettles into a pan of boiling water for a minute or two it destroys the hypodermic needles all down the nettle plant meaning that they cannot sting you any longer. Stinging nettles contain quite a few medicinal properties and are great for increasing blood flow and have anti-inflammatory properties. Few people know that nettles can be used to make a delicious beer, it is light, citrusy, and refreshing. Nettle beer has been around for a long time in Britain. The ancient Brits used nettles in beer brews as a bittering agent before hops were discovered. The recipe below uses simple, cheap, easy to get ingredients.

To view a copy of this license, visit https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/ Stinging Nettles (Urtica dioica) If you do not want to make an alcoholic drink from the nettles that you painstakingly collected you could always make a nettle tea. Nettles are filled with a huge amount of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that are good for you. Making tea from nettle leaves will help transfer those vitamins and minerals to you and will assist in keeping you in good health. Nettles have been used for their medicinal properties for many years and have been used to aid several conditions including, inflammation and joint and muscle pain, blood sugar levels, and some bacterial infections. Making nettle tea is easy. All you need is: 1/2 cup of fresh nettle leaves 1 cup water In a small saucepan place the nettle leaves and the water. Bring to the boil and steep the leaves for 5 to 6 minutes. Strain the leaves out of the tea. The tea will taste similar to a vegetable broth (which is another way to use nettles that you have on hand, add them to a vegetable broth for even more flavor). Drink the tea as you would any other tea.

387,Peanut Butter Oreo Stacks Recipe,food," I’m the Content Writer for My Blog; this is what I do for work. I've constantly been a candy enamel junkie. in truth, I assume that most of my high school life i lived on junk. everything turned into in a bag, box, box or got here from McDonald's (our open campus lunch didn’t supply us many selections till after we ought to pressure). I never worried about it due to the fact at 5 foot 9 inches I weighed 130 kilos dripping moist. I ate something I wanted and never won a pound (why can’t this be the case now!). now children later I'm heavier than I really need to be and actively dropping weight. for the most part, I am easy consuming and doing nicely, but that’s no fun to speak approximately! let’s get to it! Now someplace inside me, there's that child that desires to divulge on cookies, desserts, tarts, and cupcakes. so.. I’d visible a recipe for some cookie/brownie matters and I concept it was genius. of the path, it wasn’t my preferred cookies and didn’t incorporate peanut butter. if I'm baking in my residence eight out of 10 instances there's peanut butter (and chocolate) involved. there's no manner round it. they're the favorites of my circle of relatives and irrespective of what takes place, i emerge as adding certainly one of each of them to my creation. in this example, i introduced both! rating!    To get started out you are going to take 2 Oreos and sandwich them with peanut butter. then add a bit of peanut butter to the pinnacle simply to make certain we've got the peanut butter location covered. Yup! that’s the appearance we are going for. i extensively utilized double-crammed Oreos because we will get sufficient of that creamy filling either. you can do all your cookies with the peanut butter internal and set them apart or you could set them proper interior your cupcake pan (in a liner – don’t skip the lining, you won’t get them out of the pan).  With one package deal of Oreos, I was able to make 12 of those delicious treats. there will be a handful of Oreos left, but you'll probably want the ones to nibble on while baking. when you consider that this surely only makes 12 treats, plan to double up if you need more of them. put together your brownie mix according to the directions on the package. it simply doesn’t matter what sort of brownie mix you operate. i used a double fudge brownie blend. preheat your oven (in line with your brownie blend).  After the brownie is cooked, pop them out of the oven. those can be served cooled down or enjoy heat after the oven! I promise you they'll pass fast. my own family of four ate them fascinated with a dessert that same night I made them. due to the fact, we eat smooth and typically don’t bask in this style.. but howdy, every so often we simply need to stay in touch, proper? Cross ahead and use a tablespoon to cover the tops of your oreo sandwiches. it's going to fall over the perimeters on its very own so don’t worry too much about trying to spread it out. one box of brownie blend blanketed the 12 of these. so again, plan to double up in case you want more of them. i ensure they're all included after which I go back and fill in with whatever brownie blend is left so that they're protected properly. pop those inside the oven and prepare dinner them in line with the brownie blend package deal. mine stated 20-24 minutes for pancakes. I cooked those for about sixteen minutes. you want to reduce the time by just a piece. check to ensure your brownie region is cooked thru. once that happens they're carried out. the peanut butter gets gentle pretty short so you won’t fear the rest of the dessert. And there you have got it. a deal with this is delicious and mouth-watering. it’s brief to make, with about 15 mins prep time and approximately 15-20 mins cook time. they are perfect for a summer deal with, lecture room deal with, or anytime dessert. right here’s a printable version in order to tuck away: 15 mins 15 mins 30 mins This content is accurate and true to the best of the author’s knowledge and is not meant to substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional. © 2021 Rover McJamie"

389,Lemon Grass - Chopping and Storing for Later Use,food," This lemon grass was grown by my sister in law in the garden.

She says as she makes sweeping motions downward. She pulled a goodly amount and we brought it home. My hubby put it in water, but retained two to plant in one of the houseplants. Of course, he used some the next day in a stir fry. She had grown some strange looking squash. (Apparently you can eat young louffa) She gave him a recipe to try and he made it the next day. It was a tasty combination, with the rice, chicken, lemon grass and louffa. Different. The small chopper was overworked and got a little warm.

394,Ways to Make Great Tasting Coffee at Home,food," With the prices of certain agricultural commodities such as coffee going through the roof in 2021, you may have noticed that the price of a nice cup prepared by a barista at your favorite java spot has also gone up. The good news is that you don't have to go broke at your local cafe in order to enjoy amazing coffee; you can get the same effect, and in some cases even better, by staying home. The key is in selecting the right beans for brewing methods that do not involve a coffeemaker kitchen appliance. Here are four ideas: To make this rich and foamy coffee at home, you will need the most finely ground Arabica blend. Robusta beans will work as well, but it needs to be ground into powder. For best results, invest in a Turkish cezve pot, but just about any small cooking pot will work as well. Start by brewing water; you will want to add sugar once it is warm enough for the crystals to dissolve. Add the coffee at the boiling point and begin stirring until you get foam. Let the coffee sit for about four minutes before pouring it into the cup. Don't worry about straining because the fine grounds will stay at the bottom. After gaining popularity in Europe, Keurig brewing machines finally made it to the North American market, and they are the best and most efficient method of enjoying things like Starbucks coffee at home. You can order items like Starbucks K Cup Pods or flavored Keurig Pods online for home delivery with flavors ranging from Veranda to French Roast and from Verona to Breakfast Blend. Depending on the pods you select, you may not even need to add spices or sweets such as caramel. This simple and affordable kitchen device is actually an Italian invention, but it can deliver amazing coffee without bitterness or excessive caffeine levels. Any kind of ground beans will work with a French Press, and the flavor will always be fresh as long as you do not let the boiling water sit for more than four minutes once the plunger is pushed all the way down. Coffee cloth filters are the only means for brewing coffee in Costa Rica and other Central American nations known for their excellent beans. The difference between cloth filters and coffeemakers is that the drip is a lot faster, thus cutting down on acidic taste and higher caffeine levels. The result is a cup of coffee that tastes extremely fresh.  In the end, you do not have to stop going to your favorite cafe if what attracts you is the ambiance. Nonetheless, the brewing methods mentioned above will give you all the flavor you should expect from a great cup of coffee. "
395,Rice Flour - Fine Cut Rice,food," It was a dirty job, loud, and in some ways, unsatisfying.  The more you chop, the more gets chopped. However, the motor on the chopper does start to get warm. It's almost easier to just buy a bag of rice flour. Of course, there is rice flour readily available at our store at this time, but, someday, it may not be as readily available. So, that's why I chopped some in my small food processor. I did flip the blade over for fine chopping. I think a coffee grinder would work better, but I think I sent mine home with my son for sausage spice grinding. Ah, well... Char Milbrett (author) from Minnesota on October 14, 2021: Peggy Woods, thank you for your comment. Peggy Woods from Houston, Texas on October 10, 2021: After reading the comments, I'll bet that instant rice would be pulverized more quickly into rice flour.  That is a good idea if one cannot get to the store to buy rice flour. Char Milbrett (author) from Minnesota on October 10, 2021: Denise McGill, thank you for your comment. Sorry it took so long to acknowledge...[ I could see it, but couldn't get there from here.. smile.] I'm going to try instant rice and see if it chops easier... I have also chopped peanuts fine, but then I added oil and made peanut butter... I digress... Denise McGill from Fresno CA on October 08, 2021: There are times when you just can't jump in the car and go get something like rice flour.  I can see where this could be a good way to go.  Sometimes I come across a recipe that calls for oat flour and I have rolled oats but not oat flour.  The same thing will work by putting the rolled oats into a food processor and chopping for a while.  Good information and nice pictures. Blessings, Denise Char Milbrett (author) from Minnesota on October 08, 2021: Liz Westwood, thank you for your comment. I did this yesterday, so haven't used it yet. Have been using rice flour for first step in coating deep fried foods. For the flour, egg wash and cracker crumb foods... Liz Westwood from UK on October 08, 2021: Thanks for sharing tge process and the results in this well-illustrated article. What did you make with the rice flour?"

397,Jason Arnold’s List of Missouri’s Best Wineries,food," Jason is the author of The Beginner's Guide to Wine, a book that introduces people to the world's wine regions and varieties. Growing up in Missouri has given me the unique opportunity of experiencing wines from an up-and-coming wine region. I also lived in Napa Valley for some time, so I can recognize a quality wine when I see one. (Or, rather, when I taste one.) I thought it might be fun to share some of the wisdom I’ve gathered over the years and compile a list of some of the must-see Missouri Wineries with others. These are the wineries that consistently put out a variety of high-quality wines, so they deserve some recognition. This is a state that might be more famous for its most famous brewery, but there is more to the Show-Me State’s adult beverage scene than Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser. In some ways, Missouri’s wine producers are related. Both the beer and wine industries of Missouri were largely crafted by German immigrants in the mid-1800s. Later, Italian immigrants would join in. But the state’s grape-growing region would come to be known as the Missouri “Rhineland,” after the famous German wine region.  Prior to Prohibition, in the early 1900s, Missouri was considered the country’s top wine-producing state. (Take that California!) Today, it remains one of the top ten winemaking areas in the United States, challenging not only Napa Valley but also New York’s Finger Lakes. Missouri is a beautiful state, full of caves and rivers, mountains, and grasslands. Its fertile soil and relatively mild climate make it just right for growing certain grapes. Trying to compile a top ten list, is difficult because there are just so many skilled winemakers producing wine at so many picturesque landscapes. But, I narrowed it down, and here are my favorites. This winery has called Hermann home for more than 170 years. It is located in a setting reminiscent of a German village, right in the heart of Missouri’s “Rhineland,” Stone Hill is the state’s top-producing winery. As with nearly every wine producer, Prohibition destroyed Stone Hill’s business. Before then they were the second-largest winery in the United States, shipping more than a million gallons of wine all around the world. The Held family took over operations in 1965 and has spent the last five decades rebuilding one of the country’s best wineries and vineyards. Today 200 acres of vines produce award-winning wines. Located in an old church in the small town of Weston, about twenty minutes north of Kansas City, Pirtle Winery produces some of the State’s best grapes. People flock to the winery daily to enjoy a tasting and take home a bottle or two. Calling the historic town of Weston home since 1978, Pirtle Winery offers choices ranging from whites made from Riesling to reds like Alhambra, aged for 18 months in French Oak. After enjoying a bottle on their patio, you should explore the downtown charm of boutiques featuring old west architecture. Because the area was ripe for winemaking, Italian immigrants settled in Missouri’s Meramec Highlands region. Prior to Prohibition, the St. James area was home to around 200 wineries. It took years afterward to rebuild the wine business. In the 1960s, however, Missouri’s wine industry started to bounce back. The Hofherr family took over the St James Winery, producing 8,000 gallons of wine, its first year. They are known for using sweet Concord grapes, becoming known for brands such as Velvet Red and Velvet White. For those who want to see more of the process from vine to glass, they offer tours of the beautiful property. Nestled among scenic hills and woods less than an hour west of St. Louis, Montelle Winery is located in the country’s first viticultural area, due to its soil, microclimate, and history. Clayton Byers opened the winery in 1970 leading the rebirth of Missouri wineries. Renowned winemaker Tony Koojumjian has owned Montelle for the last few decades, offering daily tastings of the winery’s five best wines. They host music acts on the weekends, so if you like your wine served with a side of entertainment this might be the place for you. Located in Rocheport, just West of Columbia Les Bourgeois overlooks the Missouri River. You can enjoy fine dining or go down to the A-Frame for casual entertainment. There, you can watch the sunset as bands play. Sweet wines like Riverboat Red or White and dry ones such as the famed Norton are all available to wet your Palate. The blufftop views are absolutely incredible. While this list, shows off only my top five picks, there are so many more to explore. Missouri has more than 400 vineyards supporting more than 120 wineries. This equals more than 1,600 acres planted in grapes producing more than 888,000 gallons of Missouri wine. © 2021 Jason M Arnold"
398,Missouri Wine Tasting For Beginners,food," Jason is the author of The Beginner's Guide to Wine, a book that introduces people to the world's wine regions and varieties. Attending wine tasting events is a great way to experience new wines. They are also a lot of fun. But if you have never been to one before, you might not know what to expect. You might also not realize that Missouri is full of incredible wines to taste. It isn't just California that has vineyards worth visiting. So, if it's your first time at a tasting, what can you expect? Well, even though there are no mysteries to wine tasting, there are some things that you should always remember. During many wine tasting events, the ladies will be served before the men. Some tastings will serve water so that you can clean your palate between tasting different wines. It's worth noting that wine is always served at particular temperatures, so when handling a glass of wine, you should hold it by the stem to avoid heating the wine with your hands. There will also often be crackers or other snacks on hand to help reset your mouth between tastings as well. You might already be familiar with the names of many common grapes, such as Chardonnay or Riesling. But Missouri, as a wine region, does things a bit differently. Certain grapes are better adapted to Missouri's soil and climate, which means you can taste wines that are not common elsewhere. A few of the varieties you might want to try are Norton, Chardonel, and Concord. Keeping this information in mind as you taste the wine, see if you can pick up on flavor profiles that are unique to the region. It helps if you swirl the wine around in the glass before tasting it. This helps bring out some of the aromas and flavors. You should take time to observe the wine as your swirl it. You'll want to smell the wine before actually tasting it. Smell, believe it or not, plays an integral part of the process. After allowing yourself a few moments to take in whatever information you can before tasting the wine. Lastly, you'll want to know how to properly taste the wine. Tasting wine in Missouri, of course, is no different than tasting wine anywhere else, but the state does offer some unique new options. Your tongue has taste buds in various areas, which helps to detect the flavors. So, when you put the wine in your mouth you should always swish it around for a few seconds before swallowing to allow the flavors plenty of time to dance on your palate. After swallowing the wine, what remains should give you even more of an idea as to the type and flavor of the wine. While this article is a good primer, before you attend a wine tasting, you should always learn as much as you can about the many different flavors and varieties of wine. This way, you’ll have a better understanding of what you should look for in both taste and flavor. Exploring the world through wine, allows us to experience the world in a way that connects us to local culture and environment, so don't pass up such an opportunity. © 2021 Jason M Arnold"

403,Shortcut to Making Tasty Low-calorie Pizza Using Indian Flat Bread,food," Brian loves food and enjoys exploring various cuisines. He is a keen experimenter in the kitchen and finds cooking therapeutic. Yummy bites! Athena Emes If you are a pizza lover then this recipe will just be right up your alley. As the title implies, this will be a simple and easy to follow recipe that you can make without even breaking a sweat. You do not need to be a good cook to make a decent pizza because this is a fail proof guide that will get you the crispy and crunchy pizza crust with the basic toppings that everyone loves! 10 min 35 min 45 min 2-4 pax However, just a little disclaimer before I proceed with the instructions; if you have pure Italian blood coursing through your veins, I would recommend steering away now because this method here is for no authentic pizza. Nevertheless, there are no pineapples involved in the making of this pizza. This recipe here is a simplified version that caters to busy people with not much of a cooking skill but willing to do minimal work in the kitchen for a slice of goodness. There is no need to make your own base because I will reveal to you my store-bought alternative that works well to give you that thin crust pizza experience. So here goes all or nothing! A low-calorie option - Indian flat bread for a crunchy and flaky pizza crust Slightly cook the mushrooms and capsicums with dried rosemary herb to bring out the flavor before assembling it on the pizza Fancy cheesy towers for the cheese lovers! Athena Emes On the other hand, a single piece of whole wheat Indian flat bread only has 126 calories. This will give you ample space to play around with your toppings and sauces. Even so, we try to keep it simple with this recipe by having minimal processed meats and more fresh vegetables instead. Apart from being a great movie time munchie, this simple pizza recipe could as serve as a lunch or dinner treat for fussy little eaters as it is tasty and healthier than feeding them store-bought pizzas laden with too much flavorings and preservatives. Before you go ahead and start making this pizza at home, be sure to get the right type of Indian flat bread. There are actually numerous types of Indian flat bread, but the one that I find makes the best pizza crust is the paratha. The paratha has a minimal amount of oil and several thin layers of dough which results in a flaky pastry when baked or pan –fried. You are now ready to go ahead and make yourself a scrumptious treat to enjoy. Who knows, you may even serve this to your guests when you are ready to have company over once the pandemic scare subsides. This unconventional method of pizza-making yields crispy and crunchy bites that is delicious and addictive at the same time. It may seem peculiar to be using Indian flat bread as a pizza base, but the texture is just spot on if you like a thin flaky crust. Aside from saving time to make the crust, this shortcut approach offers lesser calories compared to store- bought pizza crust. A standard pizza dough is typically made from refined flour which offers little to no nutrition yet clocks in a high caloric count of approximately 280 calories on its own. Imagine what the calories would come to if you had all the toppings and sauces together? If you love cheese on your pizza, you may use low calorie cheese like mozzarella for your toppings. Alternatively, you may roll the mozzarella into a piece of Indian flat bread and assemble it around the edges of the pizza as cheese towers. Bon appétit!

Thank you for recognizing and appreciating the simplicity of this recipe. Well, it was an experiment in my part and I just pretty much threw together some ingredients and voila the 'lazy man' pizza is born. >_0 I guess I'm as adventurous as your father in the kitchen. ;) I'm always open to trying out different food combinations to see how they turn out and most of the time, am glad to say I'm pleased with the results. I'd be honored if your father is willing to try this recipe and maybe customize it according to his cooking style for the family to try. As for the chilies on pizza suggestion, I may just give it a try. Am thinking of spicy tuna pizza next. Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts, Misbah. You have a blessed weekend with your family and loved ones. Take care! :) Misbah Sheikh from The World of Rebels. on October 01, 2021: Hi Brian, This is a fantastic recipe. I'd never think about making pizza with paratha. But this looks delicious. If you don't mind, I'd like to take a slice from here. ;) This seems to be an experiment similar to the ones my father enjoys doing. My father is a foodie. He enjoys cooking on occasions. He usually makes and bakes ""the breaking news"", but we adore it when he does. Anything he prepares is labeled as ""Papa's Special,"" for example, if he cooks pasta for us, it is named as ""Papa's Special Pasta."" He always use  ingredients off the list. The funny thing is that whatever he makes is always approved by all of us as we always love to see a smile on his face. I'd like to share your recipe with my father. I'm sure he'd like to give it a shot. We may also add some green chilies and crushed red chilies to it because we enjoy spicy food, even if it's a pizza. An Asian would be an Asian no matter what. Lol!! ;) Thank you for sharing this :) Have a blissful weekend. Blessings to you and your family!!"
404,Egg - Poached in Water,food," I brought my water and salt to a boil, then turned it down a bit. I had cracked my eggs onto a paper plate and sat them aside.

407,National Coffee Day,food," As an independent writer, she worked as an editor in a number of Alexandria websites, and her novel Rathways of Gods won the Prize On International Coffee Day, here are the five most expensive in the world.  Coffee has quickly become one of the most popular drinks in the world, even as the second most traded commodity in the world after crude oil. The ancestors of the Oromo tribe of Ethiopia are said to have been the first to discover traces of the stimulant coffee plant. However, the Arabs were the first in its agriculture and trade. During the 15th century, evidence of its prevalence was found in Sufi monasteries in Yemen, and in the 16th century in Egypt, Persia, Turkey, and Syria. From the Arab world, there has been an increase in coffee lovers and coffee growers in Italy, followed by the rest of Europe, Indonesia, and the Americas, with Brazil now the world's largest coffee exporter. What is the most expensive coffee in the world? Number 1 Black Ivory Coffee No doubt many would be surprised to learn that the most expensive coffee in the world is derived from elephant faeces. Black ivory coffee depends on coffee availability and the elephant's appetite. The coffee, produced by Black Ivory Coffee in northern Thailand, is extracted from the Arabica coffee beans, consumed by the elephants, to influence their taste by digesting enzymes in the elephants' stomach, one of the main factors of coffee bitterness. Not to forget the other components of elephants' stomachs, which also reflect on the taste, making the coffee less bitter. The price of this coffee, which can be as high as $1880 per kilogram, is due to the large amount of coffee beans that must be extracted from elephant droppings. It requires 33 kilograms of raw coffee to produce 1 kilogram of black ivory coffee. These grains are often impossible to extract, as they are chewed and cut by elephants. For all animal rights advocates, the exporting company answers that it is saving street elephants and collaborating with organizations for their protection. Number 2 Kopi Luwak The technique for preparing this coffee is similar to black ivory coffee, in terms of the process of its extraction. However, a different animal, Civet cats, which live in East Asia, gave Indonesian coffee its name. Civet cats used to pick and eat coffee beans from trees, so that enzymes in their stomach fermented the beans and dismantled the proteins. When grain is excreted in cat feces, farmers in Indonesia and the Philippines collect, wash and roast it for up to $1,100 per kilogram.  However, the coffee has lost some of its charm and quality with increasing demand in Southeast Asia, and the frequent news of caged cats being locked up and starving to double productivity.  Number 3 Hacienda La Esmeralda  This coffee, made in the western mountains of Panama, is known for its rich and powerful flavor. It is the fruit of cold climate and precision harvesting, by farmers of coffee beans. It costs about $200 per kilogram, but many varieties are available, and has won more than 13 awards since 2004. In 2013, at Panama's best auction of natural materials, the price per kilogram was $770.  Number 4 Molokai Coffee If you are looking for fruit - and flower-flavored coffee, taste organic Molokai coffee, which is made in Hawaii, the only county in the United States, and is said to have an ideal climate and soil quality for planting high-quality coffee trees. When you drink this coffee, the smell of flowers, berries, caramels, and herbs blends in your mouths. The coffee, made only by Coffee Hawaii on 500 acres, competes with the most famous coffee in the world, thanks to its diverse flavour. It can be bought online for $112 per kilogram.  Number 5Blue Mountain The coffee bears the name of the area where it is manufactured, the Blue Mountains of Jamaica. It gained its international reputation for its mild taste and lack of bitterness, which often characterizes coffee beans. It is a registered trademark and is manufactured, controlled and supervised by the Coffee Industry Board of Jamaica. Over 80% of the coffee crop Blue Mountain is exported to Japan, where it is gaining popularity.in addition to being used to make coffee, coffee beans are used to create the spiritual drink Tia Maria, which combines coffee beans, Rome. If you like coffee, tell me what kind of coffee you prefer.  Bill Holland from Olympia, WA on September 29, 2021: I write for a coffee company, so I was very aware of today's importance. :)  Nice article!"

412,Nutritional Cooking,food," Web/Graphic designer & Web developer, Blogger with experience in graphic design, animations, websites building, online stores, writing.  Nutritional cooking is an approach to cooking that is based on nutrition, with an emphasis on using ingredients that are nutritious, whole, and natural.Nutrition is the food that your body needs to function and grow. It is not a measurement of whether you are healthy or not. A diet that is high in dietary fiber, and lower in fat and sugars can be very useful to the digestive system and the metabolism, making you feel more energetic. Nutritionists say that a diet high in vegetables and fruits, and low in saturated fat can help the body's hormone functions (hormone release) because fruits and vegetables are sources of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, dietary fiber, and have complex carbohydrates, such as starch and dietary fiber, which our bodies need. In general, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are the preferred food groups. Food with a high glycemic index (GI) should be eaten in moderation and never replace nutrient-dense foods with high fiber and anti-oxidants.Nutritional cooking is a cooking style that uses only foods and ingredients that are healthy, whole, and natural. Using whole foods and ingredients is an excellent way to make healthy meals, and to get the most out of your food. In this approach, food is not made unhealthy through the addition of excess salt, butter, high-fat cooking fats, refined carbohydrates, refined sugars, hydrogenated fats, and other forms of processed, unnatural ingredients. It also means that more vitamins and nutrients get into your body.Nutritional cooking is the opposite of the standard American way of cooking, which is to add fat and salt to make food taste better but to ignore the quality of the food. This is also the opposite of many Asian, Mexican, and Mediterranean cuisines.Nutritional cooking may differ from region to region, but some general rules apply:Most fruits and vegetables should be eaten raw or lightly steamed, but not cooked in water.Foods like potatoes and starchy root vegetables should be boiled or baked for the best nutritional value.Grains such as brown rice and whole grains should be thoroughly cooked or soaked overnight and then cooked.Lean meat can be used more often, as they contain more protein and less fat. Fatty cuts of meat can be substituted with low-fat meats, like chicken, turkey, and lean cuts of beef, such as flank steak. The nutritional cooking movement is based on eating foods that are more nutrient-dense, but at the same time have no added unhealthy fats or harmful ingredients. The foods that are the most nutritious, from a nutritional standpoint, include grains and beans. - Grains The whole grains, such as brown rice and whole-wheat pasta, are more nutritious than refined grains like white rice and white pasta. Whole grains are the entire grain, including the germ and the bran, and can have anywhere from one-fourth to three-fourths of the entire grain. Some whole grains can have up to 75 percent of the entire grain. These types of whole grains also tend to have a higher water content, since the germ and the bran are the wateriest parts.Soy is a good source of plant-based protein that is often considered an alternative to meat. - BeansBeans, which are rich in plant-based protein, are a source of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, fiber, and other vitamins. They are also a source of iron and can contain high levels of beneficial minerals such as phosphorus. They are a good source of vegetable protein that is free of saturated fat. Many bean varieties, including black beans, adzuki beans, kidney beans, lima beans, and navy beans can be cooked in a variety of ways for different nutritional benefits. - LentilsLentils are nutritious protein-rich legumes that are often used in dishes such as Indian dal, and other dishes that can be served as a healthy side dish. Lentils are a good source of plant-based protein that is high in fiber and is free of saturated fat and cholesterol. Many different diseases affect the gastrointestinal tract and some can be prevented by eating a healthy diet, which includes sufficient fruits and vegetables. For instance, a disease called ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease is often difficult to manage and affects the whole body. According to the Harvard Nurses' Health Study, people who consume higher levels of fiber-rich foods, such as fruit and vegetables, are more likely to avoid these diseases. The fiber in fruits and vegetables is believed to assist in fighting inflammation and colon cancer. A healthy diet that is rich in vegetables and fruit can help to prevent these diseases as well. The fiber in fruits and vegetables also helps in the absorption of calcium and potassium, which helps maintain the health of the body. © 2021 Olimpia Bilaniuc"
413,The Culinary History of Gourmet Lobster,food," Ravi loves writing within the realm of relationships, history, and the bizarre—where boundaries are blurred and possibilities are immense. The story of how the ubiquitous lobster once called with disdain as the “cockroach of the ocean” went from a poor man’s food to an expensive, gourmet delicacy. lobster-pexels-arthouse-studio-4344431 You know the situation perfectly if you are a lobster lover. A 'reasonable’ lobster dinner in a big city is one of the most expensive menu items, ranging from $30 to $50 for a mid-sized lobster. The price can run even higher depending on where you are dining. And unlike other fisheries or farms, lobster farming is difficult as the crustaceans grow slowly, eat a lot, and are susceptible to a very contagious lobster disease. That is the reason that lobsters are synonymous with luxury. It is a status symbol and an indulgent delicacy for most families to be eaten only on very special occasions. As Greg Elwell, the food critic writes. ""Lobster is fancy. If you imagine a lobster talking, it probably has a British accent. Draw an animated lobster and I bet you’ll include a top hat, a monocle, and an opera cape."" But it was not always like that. Back in the 1700s, the lobsters were considered trashy and repellent food and called the ‘cockroaches of the sea’. Only the less fortunate people namely widows, orphans, prison inmates, and servants consumed it. Lobster shells lying around a house’s front yard was considered a sign of poverty and moral degradation. Sometimes its shells were ground up and used as manure but beyond that, lobsters were considered dirt food not fit for ‘normal’ human beings. But little could anybody guess that within less than 100 years, the invention of the railways would usher in a golden era for the ubiquitous lobster. Within less than 100 years, the invention of the railways would usher in a golden era for the ubiquitous lobster. Lobster1 Indeed, lobsters were so abundant in the early days of the American Massachusetts Bay Colony that the governor of the colony William Bradford, was embarrassed to admit to newly-arrived colonists that the only food they ‘could present their friends with was a lobster ,without bread or anything else but a cup of water’. Later, there were also rumors that the servants revolted against serving the lobsters and finally won an injunction that they would be served lobsters a maximum of three times a week and no more. This hatred for lobsters took a complete U-turn less than a hundred years later when railways began to spread across America. As the railways connected the length and breadth of the American continent, railway managers found that the ‘inland’ customers do not know what a lobster is and they could serve it as a rare sea delicacy. Inland passengers were intrigued. The lobster was delicious. They asked for more, unknown to the fact the coastal people considered them as trash. By the 1950s lobsters became the uncrowned king of seafood delicacy. lobster-pexels-roman-odintsov-4553374 By the 1880s the chefs began to cook lobsters in better ways. They cooked it live, spiked it with butter and garlic, and made it a lot more appetizing to look at. Soon restaurants started to serve lobster in the salad section, like bread and butter pickles or cottage cheese. Americans started to love lobster and refrigeration and ice packing further allowed lobstermen to ship their product inland, spreading its fame. Demand overtook the supply and soon lobster prices hit the roof in the 1920s. But came the great depression and lobsters became unaffordable for most people. The lobster was again demoted to provide a cheap source of protein for the American soldiers. But this lobster slowdown did not last for long. By the 1950s lobsters had regained their position as of the uncrowned king of seafood delicacy. Lobsters were firmly established as a gastronomic delight across the world and eating it became a status symbol for all classes, from newly minted rich families to the Rockefellers. Movie stars were photographed dining out on the delicacy. Restaurants began serving it as an exotic treat. Prices rose and have remained like that till this day. Thus, by a strange twist of fate and the imagination of a visionary railway manager who first thought of serving lobsters in a railway dining car, the ubiquitous lobster attained legendary fame. Just imagine what would have happened if the dining cars had continued serving liver or processed ham. Was it a turning point in culinary history? The next time you savior a sweet lobster, do think about it. © 2021 Ravi Rajan Ravi Rajan (author) from Mumbai on September 28, 2021: Thanks Sankhajit Sankhajit Bhattacharjee from MILWAUKEE on September 28, 2021: really a relishing item...

If you are like me and you love your Starbucks Coffee(once in a while) then you are probably a fan of vanilla syrup. It's so delicious and you can add it to your favourite copycat  Starbucks recipes.  You can purchase vanilla syrup from the store but it's much cheaper to make it yourself. Especially if you want to make your own Starbucks copycat recipes. Sometimes I add vanilla syrup to my my espresso shots, or to my no-milk dark cocoa drinks. You can try drinking dark cocoa drinks if you want to give up coffee, or you want to try something new. Anyway, you came here for the vanilla syrup recipe so, here you go.  Ingredients 2 cups white sugar 2 cups water 2 tablespoons vanilla Extract  Directions Add sugar to the 2 cups water in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk and keep stirring until the sugar dissolves. Set aside to cool.  When the syrup cools to room temperature, add the vanilla extract and stir until well combined.  Tip: You can also place a vanilla pod into a glass jar with your simple syrup. Let it sit overnight and remove once you are happy with the flavour. Do this if you don't want to use vanilla extract.  Also, if you don't want to make your own simple syrup, just add vanilla extract to your store bought syrup, that's if you can't find vanilla syrup at the store. You can purchase vanilla syrup from Starbucks and from grocery stores however, it is quite expensive. Save money by making your own, store it in a glass bottle with a pump attachment to make it easier to dispense."

419,Peach Crisp - Nom de Nom Nom,food," The bowl of peaches was in the refrigerator. Hubby had peeled them, but they weren't as ripe as he would have liked, so they sat there in the refrigerator. Uneaten. Then, he asked if I could cook them in sugar and then make an apple crisp style dessert so that he could stand to eat them. It wasn't too difficult. The peaches went into a pot with lid. I added some brown sugar, heavy whipping cream, a little water and a pat of butter. This mixture was brought to a boil and boiled for a few minutes until I could easily poke a fork through one of the peaches. The peaches had been peeled previously, so I was able to just dump the bowl of them into the pan. I wanted them to come to a boil, so the heavy whipping cream and the water was added for moisture. The peaches did exude a little moisture as they softened up. I brought them to a boil on medium heat, stirring occasionally, tilting the pan occasionally as well. Once the peaches were simmered for a few minutes, I mixed up some flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger and some melted butter. It formed a crumbly dough. I had a microwaveable glass dish that I put the cooked peaches into. I then dumped my flour mixture across the top of the peaches. I smoothed the top and placed the dish in the microwave. Initially, I set the timer for ten minutes on high. It bubbled away and the top started to firm up. The brown sugar and the peaches made sort of a jam under the topping. I removed the dish and placed it in a spot where it could cool. Once it was somewhat cool, I put aluminum foil over the top and placed it in the refrigerator. We will try it tomorrow."
420,Gluten Free: Chicken Lasagne From Scratch!,food," Karin is an award-winning writer, editor and publisher of Christian and secular works in Europe and the USA. The cost of meat and everything else is horrendous at the moment. Right now chicken is holding it's own and is better value (hope I haven't spoken too soon!). If like us we have to eat gluten free as three out of 4 of us are gluten-intolerant, like everyone else I have had to learn to diversify in these high-inflation times. I kinda discovered gluten-free chicken by accident last week! I had no mince and only chicken - everyone loves it now! The Barilla gluten-free Lasagne is probably one of the easiest to cook. You do NOT have to boil the pasta prior. I follow their instructions with a variation. You can add a little oregano also to the dish if you like herbs. Garnish with tomatoes or cress and served with a lovely green salad and it will last at least two dinners for 4 adults.

I use Ragu for handiness and the fact it's gluten free also...however...making your own sauce would be awesome! Totally agree! Liza from USA on September 24, 2021: My husband and I were talking about what to have for dinner. We love Italian food, and we thought of pasta or lasagna. Usually, my husband takes turns cooking when we agree on pasta. I'm not being biased, but, he made delicious sauce from scratch. I love lasagna without meat in it, but, chicken sounds good. Thanks for your recipe. I don't mind trying gluten-free chicken!"
421,Review of Farmers Fridge,food," Justine works and writes from her home in Michigan. She loves to encourage others through her writing. The meals come already prepared in a recyclable container. Author Without sacrificing taste and time, Farmers Fridge was the best delivery meal service out of the three that I’ve tried. Here are just some of the reasons why Goldbelly and Hello Fresh can’t compare to Farmers fridge. Just click on the items to fill your cart and the website automatically tells you when your box is full. Also, the price is far less than other delivery services and it has reasonable shipping costs. The food is healthy and tasty, with flavor out of this world. Do you ever just open your fridge and stare? Wishing there was just something good in there? No… just me? Some of the items I’ve personally tried off their website are…. Food often came warm in the summer heat. My Shaq’s Chicken came with no dry ice so it was warm. (No thank you food poisoning.) Automatically renews and picks meals for you. (Often meals we would not enjoy, ended up wasting money and throwing them away.)  $25 shipping is non refundable, so if you have a problem with your order they only give you credits and do not refund you the shipping cost. So in order to use your credit, you have to pay an additional $25 shipping. (Ridiculous). You need to follow the directions provided and have to prepare the food yourself.  After using my credit and having to shell out an additional $25 for shipping, my second order is from the Pita Co. came with the wrong things and the containers not sealed properly leaking garlicky hummus sauce over everything in the box. Also arrived a day late and barely up to temperature. Not fast, I was still spending tons of time in the kitchen, cooking food that I really didn’t even like. Being a busy Mom, I wanted something fast that I could grab and go.  Not so fast, I was still spending tons of time in the kitchen preparing food that I didn’t even really like. That’s when I decided to try Farmers Fridge. The website allows you to pick your own items and doesn’t automatically renew unlike other services. So no surprise charges to your account. You simply order when your ready, and you get to pick what day you would like it delivered. Look below for $10 off by clicking on the referral link. My husband and usually split the salads for lunch. The salads come packed in a container and are enough for two. We love the convenience of having something healthy and flavorful ready in the fridge to just grab and go. It saves us from afternoon trips to a fast food place or sandwich shop. Our favorite salad is the Buffalo Chicken Salad. Let me tell you why. The Chicken is not too Spicy and comes with other ingredients including carrots, corn, celery, sugar snap peas, white cheddar cheese and a Greek yogurt ranch style dressing. The ingredients mix so well together it’s unlike anything I’ve ever tasted. Even though I’m not a big fan of celery, it gives it that nice little crunch. Feeling happy about my body and food choices is another positive thing I’m experiencing. In the morning I used to skip breakfast than feel really hungry in the afternoon because there is nothing healthy or fast in my fridge. Now, grabbing a container of Apple Cinnamon Oats, or some Berries and Gronola Yogurt has became my morning routine. Not to mention also my favorite late night snack. Knowing I won’t be consuming tons of calories while doing so also makes me feel good. Justine Nalbach (author) from Michigan on September 26, 2021: Thanks TheShadowSpectar, We just moved to the country from the city and the grocery stores are beginning to become more empty. Yesterday the shelves were nearly bare in some spots. I enjoy the food delivery because I don’t have to beat the crowds of people wandering around the store wondering why they are out of certain things. Going to the grocery store takes up too much time too. Hope you are doing well! Jason B Truth from United States of America on September 25, 2021: Justine?  I remember back when I was living in New York City so many years ago, I absolutely hated to go grocery shopping inasmuch as this task always seemed to creep up on me whenever I was extremely tired and had just gotten off work.  After I moved out to Southern California, finding out about the availability of grocery delivery services in my immediate locality was a godsend.  I then mainly ordered food items from Pavilion's and The Pink Dot.  Moving back to the East Coast was a culture shock for me once I realized that there were no grocery or food delivery services in my locality.  Luckily, such services popped up little by little as time moved on, and now I have a regular grocery delivery service that I order from.  Who has time to go shopping for food nowadays?  I'm so glad that you found something online where you could order food and have it delivered to your home.  It saves so much time.  By the way, I liked your article."

In a celebratory mood – My wife decided to ‘fancify’ the dish by shaping it as a cake, which we then demolished in order to enjoy it Athena Emes I have called Malaysia my home for the longest time and have certainly gotten very comfortable with the people, culture, and especially the food. The country is a melting pot of culture comprising different customs and traditions featuring a multi-racial population. If you ever find yourself in Malaysia, you will never be hungry because there is just so much delicious food to sample and savor. One very significant dish that the locals are really proud of is ‘nasi lemak’. The dish is usually consumed for breakfast, although some people do consume it for lunch or even dinner because it makes quite a filling meal when paired with extra side dishes. Just last week, my family celebrated Malaysia Day with a small feast to mark the momentous occasion. For those who are not familiar with the celebration, Malaysia Day is celebrated on 16th Sept every year to commemorate the ‘birth’ of Malaysia. It was the historical day the Malaysian federation was formed. Considering how important a day it was for the nation, the family wanted to celebrate with a special meal. We unanimously decided on ‘nasi lemak’, which is a popular local food loved by all Malaysians. The ‘nasi lemak’ comprised several components put together to give us a fragrant and satisfying dish. It does require quite some effort and a lot of time to prepare but I promise you that all the hard work will be worth it once you have your first bite of the ‘nasi lemak’. Here is the recipe with a step-by-step preparation guide for you to attempt. 30 min 1 hour 1 hour 30 min 5 - 6 pax Roasted peanuts tastes better and compliments the 'nasi lemak' well You may add-on your favorite side dishes to pair with the ‘nasi lemak’. We actually added cereal prawn fritters and ‘ayam penyet’ to the ensemble. We shall share the recipe for the cereal prawn fritters and ‘ayam penyet’ in the next round. As mentioned in the opening, the ‘nasi lemak’ is a dish that requires time and some patience to prepare. However, I hope it will not deter you from trying it. The satisfaction from savoring the meal will all be worth it. You will be amazed by the interesting blend of flavors and textures; the rich coconut milk infused rice pairs really well with the spicy ‘sambal’ sauce and the crispy anchovies and roasted peanuts just gives that extra crunch and bite in every mouthful you take. It is a meal that you must take the time to savor to truly enjoy and derive satisfaction from the mingling flavors and sensation. Bon appétit! A plate of wholesome goodness that will get you going for seconds!

424,Rich and Nourishing Cookies,food," Sadhana Mahato is a fervent enthusiast for cooking innovative recipes that do not compromise on neither taste nor health. It's always difficult and worrisome for parents to provide the best possible nutritional sources of food in a delicious form to their kids. As a parent or a guardian you want your loved one to have a healthy growth and a healthy life and children do not want to compromise on their taste buds as they love enjoying life. While both the sides are right in their own perspectives and in their persistence of choice, I have always learnt to come up with an answer that is not a compromise but which justifies both the essential debates - HEALTH & TASTE. Rich & nourishing cookies Rich yet healthy and nourishing cookies Delicious cookies for kids without compromising on health Exotic and unique flavorful cookies Persian cookies Royal cookies for health and taste Dutch cookies Surti Nankhatai Exotic Indian cookies The recipe I'm about to share with you is called 'Nankhatai' in India which was introduced here in the 16th century by a Dutch couple in Surat to meet the needs of the Dutch residents. When the Dutch left India, a Persian took over the bakery they worked in and he invented this crunchy cookie and named it 'Nankhatai'. Later, the Gujarati (a caste belonging to the state of Gujarat, India) continued the tradition of making Nankhatai with their own personal touch and hence, since then, the cookies known as 'Surti Nankhatai' for originating in Surat, a city in Gujarat, is famous not only in India but is also exported worldwide due to its rich and exotic taste. One basic recipe, different origins Dutch cookies Persian cookies Surti cookies Surti Nankhatai Indian royal cookies Whole Wheat flour 1 cup Use finely grounded one Gram flour 1/4th cup You can use this 1/2 cup if you like a more nutty and protein packed cookie Ghee 1/2 cup + 1tbsp If you are more health and calorie conscious, use cow ghee Milk 2 to 3 tbsp cow milk will make these cookies healthier and use full-fat milk at room temperature Sugar 2 to 3 tbsp You can add more if you prefer more sweetness.

425,Telangana’s most popular tribal carnival,food," Chef  Praveen Abraham
Chef Instructor 
Culinary Academy Of India Festivals and religious gatherings with a huge number of people are common in India. However, huge festivals with no Vedic or Brahminic influences, not so much. This is what sets the Sammakka Saralmma Jatra apart. Touted as Telangana’s Kumbh Mela, this festival celebrates two popular tribal goddesses, Sammakka and Saralamma, and recalls stories of their brave spirit. The Samakka Saralmma (commonly abbreviated as ‘Sarakka’) is the largest repeating tribal goddesses congregation in the world. The Jatra is held every two years over a four-day period in the village of Medaram. Located 90 km from the city of Warangal, Medaram is the epicenter of the Sarakka Jatra. The Jatra hosts 13 million (1.3 crores) people biennially and is classified as a state festival of Telangana. Tribal devotees from different states of India including Karnataka, Jharkhand, M.P, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, and Maharastra partake in this tribal confluence. The Legend Behind Sarakka Jathra  The story of the Sarakka Jatra celebrates the fight of the mother and daughter pair, Samakka and Saralamma respectively. According to legends, a tribal hunting party in the 13th century found a newborn girl, Samakka, in the forest emitting light while playing with tigers. The party took the baby back to the tribe where after being adopted by the head of the tribe and groomed as a chief. Later, she was married to the tribal chief of the neighboring tribe, the Koyas, eventually giving birth to two daughters and one son. The region where the Koyas resided was ruled by the Kakatiyas who imposed taxes on the Koya tribe. The Koyas were unable to pay these taxes, resulting in the Kakatiyas declaring on the small tribe. As a huge organized army battalion fought a small tribe where members had turned into warriors overnight, victory was certain. As the tribe fought back valiantly, Sammakka had almost won when Saralamma died in her battle. After her loss, a lonely Samakka is said to have gone to a hill named Chilakalagutta where she manifested into a vermillion casket (Kumkum Bharani). Samakka’s son, Jampanna, was also felled in the attack where his body tumbled into the Sampagni vaagu(stream). The place was renamed the Jampanna vaagu and devotees believe that Sammakka and Saralamma were manifestations of the Adi Parashakti trying to protect them. The Jatra is held at a time when it is believed that these goddesses visit the tribe. How Sarakka Jatra is Celebrated Spread over four days, the Sarakka Jatra starts with the arrival of the goddesses to Medaram forest and ends with their exit into the forest. During the first day, Sarakka’s and her husband, Pagididda Raju, idols are carried into Medaram from Kannepalli and Ponnugondla respectively. The second day involves carrying Sammakka’s idol and the kumkum casket to Medrama after long and secretive pujas by the Koya tribe on the hill where the casket is kept. Govind Raju, Sammakka’s husband, has his idol carried from Kondai to Medaram. The third day is the day where Adi Parashakti and his manifestations are worshipped. Sammakka and Saralmma, along with their consorts are worshipped. Devotees also dip themselves in the Jampanna vaagu. The most common offering of this festival is jaggery. Devotees call this bangaram (gold) and offer a jaggery amount equal to their own weight as thanksgiving in fulfillment of their vows. Money, sari, bagels, gold, and coconuts are also offered at the altar. Some members also offer country liquor and meat to the deities. On the final day, the kumkum casket is carried back to Chilakalagutta hill in the forest where it stays until the next Jatra. Tribal Food During Sarakka Jatra  The food cooked and served during the Jatra feature the culinary heritage of the Adivasi tribes. All food is natural, safe, and nutritious. Animal sacrifice is part of the tradition and consuming non-vegetarian food is commonplace in the Jatra. Kodo (cow grass millet) and Kutki (little millet) are the most common grains during the Jatra. These are either boiled to a broth or cooked as a dry cereal. For the first two meals, the broth is preferred whereas dry cereal is eaten for dinner along with vegetables. Most of the non-vegetarian meats feature meats hard to find in the city. Deer, goat, wild rabbit, fowls, pigeons, and peacocks, are consumed during the Jatra and these are usually cooked in a very easy way using simple marinations of spices in either curd or lime juice. Overall, the food is extremely tasty and the use of fewer ingredients means there’s no overly complex battle involving different flavor profiles and textures. This simple, harmonious deserves the spotlight, and this is why I chose the Sarakka Jatra for my portfolio project.

428,Tamales - Steamed Stuffed Corn Dumplings,food," Two tamales. One in the wrapping and one out of the wrapping The dough is mixed together with a mixer. The baking powder and salt is added to the chicken broth, then since I had just cooked up some pork sausage, I retained the grease from the sausage and used that for my lard in my tamales. Apparently, if I had not had the sausage grease, I could have used butter, or shortening. At any rate, I used the sausage grease. Then, after it was mixed together, it sat until the rest of my ingredients were cooked through. The broth is heated with the microwave for 40 seconds and then the baking powder and salt is added. The corn flour is added and I used the mixer for 2 minutes. Then, you add the lard mixture and after it is mixed well, it is left to sit while you prepare the meat/vegetable/spice mixture. The meat filling starts out as some butter and some minced onion and sweet pepper. After the butter browns the vegetables, a cup of water with spices is added and the mixture is brought to a boil, then simmered until it is merged and softened. Then, a can of chicken breast is added and then the tamale filling process commences. Since I live within 50 feet of a cornfield, I walked out to a few cornstalks and picked some corn stalk fronds, or leaves. One recipe I looked up said to split one of the leaves so that the tamales could be tied shut, but I used some cotton string.  The dough is slightly sticky, and resembles a cookie dough consistency. It is smeared onto a blade of corn leaf. It sticks to the leaf, and I made a smooshed mass that was baby finger thick and as wide as the corn leaf and about five inches long. Then, I placed a spoonful of meat/vegetable mixture on the dough and brought the edges of the leaf up around it. I used a second leaf to cover the sides, and then, brought it up and twirled my string around it and then tied it together. I tied it shut, and then placed the bundle into my rice steamer. I had a cup of water on the bottom of the steamer, and the metal plate above the water. I repeated the process for the rest of the bundles. This was the first time I put my steamer to use, and it worked great. It kept my corn leaf wrapped bundles up above the water and they were in there for 50 minutes, then I shut the machine off and let the tamales sit. We actually left the house and went to the neighbors house for a while and came back. The test of a tamale for doneness is if it falls out of the corn leaf. If it sticks, it isn't cooked enough. Mine were cooked and cooled just perfectly. The flavor was awesome as well. The bag of flour suggests using water to mix with the flour. The authentic flavor comes from using the same water you use to boil your meat, but since I used canned, I had purchased a box of chicken broth to use instead. The grease from cooking the sausage I was using for a different recipe, was a combination of grease from the sausage and juices that were of course, part of frying sausage. chicken broth instead of water. Sausage grease in the bowl. Broth in the cup. broth plus baking powder and salt. Add baking powder/salted broth to flour use mixer to mix. When it starts to clump, add sausage water aka lard water mix in the sausage water set aside until ready to use. use broth. cut onions and peppers use spices small amounts of each spiced up broth garlic to broth butter in small pan onion and sweet pepper brown in butter add spiced up broth simmer until vegies are tender I used an electric rice steamer to cook my tamales. I had purchased it last year and it sat idle until now. We buy a lot of rice packages, but the steamer is more for doing real recipes with rice, so I never thought to use it, nor had a reason. But now, it seems like the perfect choice to use for making these tamales. Easy to use. There is a crock pot, and a metal plate, markings for water, and an on/off switch. Yes. It's as easy as putting a cup of water in the bottom, adding the plate, making the tamales and placing them in the crock pot and closing the lid, and pressing on. It takes 50 minutes, no peeking, and voila, they are done. So. At this point, I had the steamer ready to go with a cup of water under the plate. I then took the corn leaves I had cut from the corn stalk, and smeared an amount of dough across the middle of it. The dough will literally stick to the leaf. I smeared tamale dough on a few leaves, then, took a spoonful of chicken infused broth and put it on the tamale dough. Then, I pulled the ends of the corn leaf up and took another corn leaf and wrapped up and around the sides. Then, I used the cotton string and tied it shut. Placed the bundle in the steamer and wrapped another one. The tamales sit very nicely in the steamer. According to some comments I read online, the true test of doneness of a tamale is if it releases from the corn leaf. If it is done, the corn leaf will not be stuck to it. Remember how sticky the dough was to start with? Remove the tamale from the leaf. Discard the string and the corn leaf.  Char Milbrett (author) from Minnesota on September 16, 2021: Hey Peggy Woods, thank you for your comment. They were good. You will let me know if you try making some... Peggy Woods from Houston, Texas on September 16, 2021: I enjoy eating tamales but have never made them.  Thanks for your instructions and photos regarding the process of making them."
429,You Have to Try These Delicious Oat Brownies!,food," If there's something I'm passionate about besides books and movies, that's food. I love tasting new flavours and cooking. Dana Tentis at Pexels.com Even though it seems like everybody has been cooking for the past few weeks (this lockdown has definitely driven people to improve some skills!) I haven’t really been up for it. Don’t get me wrong: I love baking. But given that my kitchen isn’t especially pretty (neither does it have even a poor window so no natural light for me when I’m cooking Marta Dzedyshko That’s a great question, my dear! There are actually a few facts that make oat flour healthier than wheat flour, which you can learn right here, right now I used another recipe as a guide, but being the kind of human being I am, I forgot to check that I actually had all the right ingredients in the right amount before starting cooking. Of course, being the kind of human being I am, I wasn’t happy to go to the shop once I realised that, for example, I did not have enough cocoa powder to make the original recipe. HOWEVER, as a Spaniard I never forget to bring Colacao when I go home so I thought that could be of a good use this time – and I was right! It worked perfectly well. For those of you, poor souls, who don’t know what Colacao is, it’s similar to Nesquik but better. In other words, it’s sweetened cocoa powder that is dissolved in milk (either cold or hot) and serves as breakfast for all the Spanish boys and girls in the world (I’m not even exaggerating here). It’s a delicacy that I can stop from recommending and that I would love LIDL to offer during the Spanish week. Just saying, in case someone from LIDL reads me (please, do bring Colacao! We’re begging you!). Anyway! There was something else that I was missing, and that is EGGS. I only had 2 where the original recipe asked for 3. However, using only 2 eggs didn’t make any difference to my taste or fluffiness of the brownie, from my point of view. At the same time, I used oatmeal to make the oat flour – which is incredibly simple. Ella Olsson at Pexels.com Et voilà! There’s an oatmeal brownie for you. Easy, quick and sooooo yummy! And just healthy enough to convince yourself you’re actually helping your body by eating it. Not too bad, am I right? Hehe One thing that I think you should know is that brownies are absolutely freezable! Yasss! So, if like me, you can’t share your brownies with no one else at the moment (I usually share my desserts with my friend or coworkers, but obviously right now that’s not an option) you can cut it into pieces and freeze it. This way you can take it out and eat them without the guilt of eating brownie for like a week in a row – and of course, it won’t go bad! Also, a quick disclaimer: none of these photos are mine! This must be the first time I baked something and didn’t take pictures but I was just trying to behave like an adult… from the 20th Century. So these pictures come from an image bank. Sorry about that >,< I promise I will change them as soon as I make this brownie again!"
430,The Authentic Spanish Tortilla Recipe: Easy and Delicious!,food," If there's something I'm passionate about besides books and movies, that's food. I love tasting new flavours and cooking. I know I’ve been talking about Spain lately, probably because I’m spending so long there this summer (Yassssssssss!! Sorry for my excitement, but it’s been a while since I was home for so long!). But I’m aware of how going away this summer is a bit difficult for most people, especially since rules about quarantining change pretty much every week. If there is something I have learned living in Scotland is just how much British (and Scottish) people LOVE Spanish food! So I reckoned, why not shared here the authentic Spanish tortilla recipe so you can all enjoy it at home? I’ve tried sooooo many different Spanish tortilla recipes since I’ve arrived in different Spanish restaurants in Glasgow. I didn’t like them! Any of them! Even the ones that they serve in “Spanish restaurants”, they are pretty terrible and I wonder if they really have Spanish chefs. I’m not trying to be mean, but having eaten Spanish tortilla de patatas all my life, it’s a bit hard to ignore what a true potato omelette really tastes like. Of course, I have also tried bad tortillas in Spain (not everybody is as good a cook as my mum and grandma, that’s true!!!). A traditional Spanish omelette is actually really easy to make.  You only need three ingredients: potatoes, eggs and vegetable oil (not necessarily olive oil, since this is more expensive and you’ll have to use a lot for the potatoes). You could maybe add onions if you wanted (this is the ETERNAL fight: with or without onions?). I personally like it better without the onion, but I have to admit it’s pretty good with onions too (please don’t tell my family!). What I would NEVER put in a tortilla de patatas is garlic or parsley. I know my friend sometimes puts garlic in it, but honestly, I don’t think there’s any need for that. The garlic kind of overpowers the flavour of the potatoes and it’s just too much for me. I recommend you not using it, although if you feel adventurous or simply love garlic, I would use garlic powder or maybe frying a garlic clove with the potatoes and removing it before you add them to the egg. This being said, let’s dive into this super easy Spanish omelette recipe I bring you today, shall we? (for 5 – 6 people… or 3 if you are all really hungry!!)  1. Peel the potatoes and wash them under the water. 2. Cut the potatoes into small, thin pieces. This is important because it will mean that they don’t take forever to cook. Add some salt to your potatoes! I don’t usually use salt, but with tortilla de patatas it’s a must! 3. On a deep frying pan, pour enough vegetable oil to cover the potato chunks. You might need to cook the potatoes in two batches if your pan is too small or if you are using too many potatoes. Heat the oil at high temperature. 4. When the oil is hot enough (you will know this because the surface will start vibrating), pour the potatoes in the pan. Be careful not to splash oil everywhere! It’s not only hard to clean but can hurt you a lot. Turn the heat down to medium-low. 5. As the potatoes will take a little to get to their perfect cooking point, you can whisk the eggs meanwhile. It usually works out an egg for potato and a potato per person, but if potatoes are too big you might need to add an egg or two. Otherwise, your potato omelette could break and would simply not be tasty enough! You can add some salt to the beaten eggs if you like too. 6. The right moment to take the potatoes out of the pan is when you can easily smash them with a fork. Try to get rid of as much oil as possible before mixing the potatoes with the eggs, so that the tortilla is not too greasy. You will notice that, if the potato chunks just came out of the pan the egg cooks a little. That’s completely fine! 7. Carefully pour most of the used oil in a glass jar (you can use this oil for frying potatoes in the future), leaving only a super thin layer of oil in the pan: not even enough to cover the bottom of the pan. Leave the heat at medium-low. 8. As the pan will be hot and the oil will be hot, pretty much as soon as you pour the mixing of potatoes and eggs on the pan the bottom will cook straight away. What I do is break the bottom of the tortilla a little and stir up a little so that more mixture gets cooked slowly. However, don’t overdo this, as you still want a flat tortilla de patatas and not scrambled eggs! 9. Once you see the edges of the tortilla solidifying, you’ll know it’s the time to flip it over! To avoid a disaster, use a big plate or the cover of your pan: put it over the pan, hold it against it strongly and… flip the pan! Now put the pan back on the hob and slowly get the tortilla back in the pan. You only need to do this once while cooking. 10. Your tortilla will be ready in just 2 to 5 minutes, depending on the strength of your hobs. To take it out of the pan, use the plate or the cover again and do the flipping thing. It’s the best way of getting it out of the pan without breaking it!  Mmmmm so yummy! I kind of fancy a tortilla de patatas now! As you can see, this authentic Spanish tortilla recipe is really easy. It takes a little bit of time cutting and cooking the potatoes, but that’s the biggest effort we’ll have to do in this recipe. It’s quick, simple and you won’t need a lot of ingredients for it! However, you’ll have to use a very good non-stick pan. It’s really important to get a beautiful, golden Spanish omelette! So here’s a bit of Spanish culture for you that I hope you can enjoy at home © 2021 Sofia Artola Sofia Artola (author) from Glasgow on September 19, 2021: Thanks Maria!

432,Baked Southern Style Mac n' Cheese (With Egg),food," Rebecca is a retired special education teacher. She earned a master's degree at Armstrong Atlantic State University in Savannah, GA. rebeccamealey Macaroni and cheese, better known as mac n' cheese is at the top of the list for favorite American comfort foods. Like many people, I graduated from mac n' cheese dinner kits to trying out various recipes for the homemade stuff. Tons of them live on the internet, in magazines, and in cookbooks. But it was years before I found out why my mac n' cheese just didn't quite live up to the mac n' cheese my mom made years ago. I made the discovery while going through her old recipe book. An egg. That was the difference. After a little research, turns out it's called baked or Southern-style macaroni and cheese. It made sense. Mom's mac n' cheese is so simple to make. Unlike stovetop recipes, this dish is baked in a slow to moderate oven for 45 minutes. But the taste and texture are worth the wait. The recipe only calls for four ingredients not including any spices. Unlike stovetop recipes, butter is eliminated. And like any mac n' cheese, you can vary the recipe. Sometimes I add a little dry mustard. At other times, I use more than one kind of cheese. For this one, I used a quarter cup of grated parmesan in addition to the grated cheddar. You're not limited to shredded cheeses either, since the cheese is layered with the noodles. Here's Mom's recipe for Southern baked mac n' cheese.  resource: Smithsonian Magazine   Beat together the milk, egg, and any spices you use. As far as food historians can determine, mac n' cheese hails from Northern Europe. A scribbled recipe from 1769 is the earliest one found. The cheesy pasta dish was first served in the United States by President Thomas Jefferson in 1802 at a state dinner. It was one of the fashionable pasta dishes he had discovered while visiting France. He returned with a pasta machine and a stack of recipes. Somehow, by 1937 the creamy comfort casserole had made its way into a boxed meal. Kraft Foods introduced America to its iconic macaroni and cheese dinner. All you had to do was boil the dried pasta and mix the processed powdered cheese into heated milk and butter. It came along at a very opportune time since for 19 cents it fed a family of four and the country was in the midst of the Great Depression.  wikimedia commons Then in 1953, Better Homes & Gardens cookbook published a recipe for a creamy sauce with a base made of melted Velveeta cheese and cream of mushroom soup. Boxed Velveeta Shells & Cheese was born, and college students and young parents everywhere upgraded to the box that advertised ""made with real cheese."" Over the years, many top chefs have attempted to ""take back the mac"" by adding their signature twist to this classic dish. At gourmet restaurants, you'll find it served steamed in melted brie and with ingredients like fresh mushrooms, figs, and herbs. Southern gal Paula Deen, formerly of Food Network wraps slivers of it in bacon and flash fries it.  Many chefs add their own signature twist to mac n' cheese scooby 12353 via Pixabay JP Carlos from Quezon CIty, Phlippines on September 13, 2021: Mac n Cheese Ice cream, I think that is too bold for a meal for me.

433,Classic Chocolate Cake,food," Miriam is an enthusiastic cook. At 13 years old she would bake cakes for her young siblings and parents and they loved them. 1/4 cup whole milk 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract   In a large bowl, mix butter, egg and vanilla with electric mixer and beat until all ingredients combine well. Mix for around two minutes. You can use a wooden spoon and mix with your hand or use an electric mixer, both will work well. If using a wooden spoon take around five minutes to mix.  In another bowl, mix the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Sift the dry ingredients in another bowl. Add butter to the dry ingredients along with half the whole milk, mixing until the dry ingredients get moistened. Mix at a low speed. Increase the speed to medium and beat until the batter has lightened and increase in volume, for about 45 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.

437,Carrot Cake: Simple Steps to Bake Carrot Cake,food," Miriam is an enthusiastic cook. At 13 years old she would bake cakes for her young siblings and parents and they loved them. In a large bowl, mix oil, sugar, eggs, vanilla, and cinnamon. Mix for around two minutes. This will ensure all sugar dissolves and the other ingredients mix well. You can use a wooden spoon and mix with your hand or use an electric mixer, both will work well. If using a wooden spoon take around four minutes to mix. Mix the flour with baking soda and baking powder. Add the flour o the wet mixture and stir until all the ingredients mix well. I prefer to use hand at this stage. Do not mix for long, since mixing for long removes bubbles which are important for cake rising. Once the flour and wet mixture mixes well, add the carrots. At this stage, the carrots are just required to mix with the dough, do not over mix. Just make sure the carrots are well distributed in the mixture. You can also use your hands to mix the carrots. If the dough is thick add some water/milk/ buttermilk. Buttermilk usually gives a great taste. However, buttermilk is usually a bit expensive. If buttermilk is not available use whatever is convenient to you. You can also make buttermilk at home with easily available products. Do not worry about where to get buttermilk. Make one yourself. For vegetarians, the eggs can be substituted with twelve tablespoons of yoghurt. Yoghurt makes very good substitutes for eggs. The oil can be a vegetable oil, olive oil or any other oil provided it is not solid oil. The healthier the cooking oil, the better it is. If you do not like cinnamon you can exclude it from the recipe, the cake will still be good. You can substitute any other spice that you like in the cake. If you like to add more carrots to the recipe, make sure you add the baking soda to 1 teaspoon. Take round baking tin and apply a small amount of oil at the bottom and on the sides.

442,Recipe of Stuffed Capsicums - Microwave Version,food," Umesh is a freelance writer contributing his creative writings on varied subjects in various sites and portals in the internet. Stuffed vegetables are delightful items as side dishes and most people like to have them during main meal times. In this article, I will be describing the detailed recipe of stuffed capsicums using Indian spices and the mode of cooking would be using a microwave oven. The dish can however also be easily made using the conventional cooking methods as used by people in their routine cooking. In some of my recipes published earlier on this site like  Beetroot dry vegetable, I have described the basic precautions and tricks to be used for cooking while using a microwave oven and I would be happy to share some of those points again here in this article. This vegetable can also be cooked in the traditional way that is cooking in a pan on a stove but I have used the microwave for preparing this. People generally use the microwave for just heating the food and do not use it for the complete cooking of dishes but with some care and know-how, most of the dishes can be easily prepared in it. Let us go through some fundamentals about microwave cooking. In microwave cooking, one important difference is that the food is cooked in a direct way by cooking all the parts of the food at the same time. So, stirring and sauteing does not play many roles here. What is important is the amount of moisture and water in the materials to be cooked and the amount of water that we add externally. Then cooking time is also very important where overcooking might ruin the dish. So, it is imperative that we have to change our mindset from conventional saute and cook methods to microwave cooking. Microwave cookers generally have five different ranges of temperature or power and we can select them as per our need. For example for making curries where sufficient water is there in the dish, we can use the maximum temperature or the first range. On the other hand for making dry vegetables or stuffed vegetables, we can use a second range which is very convenient for it. Most people use these two ranges for simply heating the food for one or two minutes which is one of the main use of microwaves in our household. The third and fourth ranges are for slow cooking where simmering of food is required. The last range that is the fifth can be used for thawing or keeping the food warm in which case it becomes a hot case only. I will reiterate that water is the most important ingredient in microwave cooking and one has to learn to add a suitable quantity of water to any dish for the perfect cooking experience. In the beginning, the judgement might go wrong but after 2-3 sessions one can learn the tricks oneself. One tip that I want to give at this juncture is that whenever in doubt press the pause button, open the microwave door and check the consistency of the dish and then add water if so required. If this is followed one will never meet the unpleasant charring of the food situation in microwave cooking. Please note again that those who are not very comfortable with microwave cooking can choose the traditional saute and cook mode using their own basic culinary skills for preparing any dish. The following ingredients will suffice for meeting the requirement of 5-6 people while consuming this side dish with other items at the main meal times. The main preparation is making the capsicums ready for filling. For this, we have to cut the capsicums from their handle sides in such a way that an opening of about an inch is created. The handle part and the seeds are now to be removed by scooping out them. Boil the potatoes separately and once they are cooled down mash them and keep them aside. Chop the tomato, ginger, peeled onions, coriander leaves, and garlic cloves and keep them separately. Preparing the filling: Take a microwave-compatible rectangular bowl preferably a glass bowl and add chopped onion, chopped garlic, chopped ginger, chopped green coriander leaves, turmeric powder, coriander powder, black pepper powder, and red chilli powder (optional). Now add cooking oil to it and mix. Add some salt to taste. Keep the bowl in the microwave and turn on the microwave and keep in the second heat range for about 2-3 minutes. Take the bowl out of the microwave and now add sweet corn, crumbled cottage cheese, mashed potatoes, chopped tomato, and mango powder and sprinkle 1-2 tbsp water on it and keep in the microwave in second heat range for 3-4 minutes. Take the bowl out. The filling is ready now. Stuffing the capsicums: Divide the filling into 8-10 parts for equitable filling of the hollowed capsicums. Take capsicums one by one and fill them with one of the parts of the filling. Final cooking: Stack them in the same bowl in which the filling was cooked. That would have the aroma of filling still there! Sprinkle a little water about 1 tsp on each of the capsicums and then keep the bowl inside the microwave and cook it for 6-8 minutes. Check after every 3-4 minutes for a possible drying up of the capsicums and if such a thing happens a little water can be sprinkled upon them to avoid it. The dish is ready and can be decorated with grated cottage cheese or common cheese or tomato sauce etc or their combinations. Self Self Self Self One can customise this dish as per one's taste and liking in various ways. Sprinkling a little melted butter on the stuffed capsicums will make them more delicious if one has a liking for butter. Sprinkling red chilli powder and mango powder over them makes them tangier if one wishes to have it that way. Sliced hard-boiled eggs also go well with stuffed capsicums. People can also take them with bread, chapati, nan, boiled rice etc. The filling prepared for this dish can even be used for making bread sandwiches for the children. People avoiding cooking oil due to health reasons can avoid it as the microwave is able to do cooking without the presence of oil also. One serving is about one stuffed capsicum and it can be directly served on the main plate where one is taking the main meals. The skin of capsicum is having a slightly little bitter taste and some people like to have more of the internal filling rather than the outer shell. So, they can have more of it to scoop out the fillings. Based on the standard nutritional charts, one serving of the stuffed capsicum contains about 60 to 70 calories only. If the cooking oil is not added then it would be around 30 to 40 calories only. Here, I have assumed one number of stuffed capsicum as one serving.

443,Easy to Make Vegan-Friendly Crunchy Tofu Bombs for Healthy Snacking,food," Brian loves food and enjoys exploring various cuisines. He is a keen experimenter in the kitchen and finds cooking therapeutic. Vegan-friendly Crispy & Crunchy Tofu Bombs Athena Emes How many of you reading this is guilty of indulging in fast foods or snack treats that are full of preservatives and all kinds of additives? Stop snacking the unhealthy way and start being smart about how you keep your cravings at bay. More often than not, when the craving hits we seek the familiar and easily accessible options such as McDonalds, Burger King, KFC, Wendy’s, and Taco Bell for a quick fix. These fast food joints, among others, offer a selection that most categorize as comfort food; food that makes you feel satisfied and happy when you eat it without realizing that its’ heavily laden with flavorings which makes it appetizing in the first place. What if I tell you, that you can make your own snack that is tasty yet without the crazy amount of flavor enhancers you normally find in commercial snacks and fast foods? We often relate snacking to consuming things that are relatively unhealthy, but that is totally untrue. In fact, if you do a little research and experimenting of your own, you will find that there are so many other nutritious alternatives within your reach. You may need to put in a little effort to prepare it, but you might just end up with your next favorite movie time munchies. The recipe that I will be sharing with you today is a simple and easy vegan-friendly snack that will blow your mind. For some meat lovers out there, I know how disappointed you might be by the sound of this treat – you probably think that it is not something you will fancy. Well, never say never until you sink your teeth into one of these tasty morsels. Being a full-fledged meat eater, I surprisingly find myself take to this snack without missing a beat and urge you to try it for yourself. The crunchy bites allow you to satisfy your craving with less the guilt. Here is the recipe for you to enjoy! 10 min 20 min 30 min 3-5 pax Firm tofu is best for this dish. It is delicate with a smooth texture, suitable to absorb the spices used to marinade it before frying We are keeping it light with the seasonings. Season your tofu with just chili flakes, Himalayan pink salt, and black pepper Ensure to oil the plate that is used to assemble the wrapped tofu bombs to avoid them from sticking to one another If you really crave some meat to go with, try adding leftover rotisserie chicken strips into the tofu mix. Alternatively, you can even use leftover beef brisket or braised duck meat for added texture. If you are still unconvinced to try this treat, perhaps you might really need to re-consider the health effects of your current snacking habits in the long run. Unless you are only munching on nuts and seeds or getting your cravings fixed with a fruit smoothie, then this might just be your go-to for those days you feel like binging on fast foods or store-bought snacks. I am certainly not propagating that this is the healthiest option. However, it sure beats loading on the additives-laden treats that clog your arteries or promote hypertension and diabetes which may bring you to an early grave. Many of us find fast foods or junk foods appealing because of its distinctive and delicious flavors. The interesting flavors are actually contributed by the hefty amounts of additives, which are basically sugars, sodium, and fats. These ingredients enhance the taste of the food and consuming them does make us temporarily satisfied and contented. The pleasure derived from indulging in fast foods is caused by the brain releasing dopamine that makes us categorize that act as a form of reward because of how it makes us feel. That is why sometimes we tend to binge on fast foods without realizing how much we have eaten. The logic is that the more you eat, your brain adapts and makes more receptors for dopamine, which actually encourages you to eat even more. So, how can we break this vicious cycle and yet satisfy those cravings? The answer is quite simple - look for an alternative that offers similar satisfaction but with less detrimental consequences. This simple snack recipe is not a means to propagate a certain way of lifestyle or a specific constrained diet. In fact, this recipe is actually a chance discovery that was a result of me being on the lookout for a healthy snacking alternative to the common fast foods. My wife and I decided to incorporate more healthy food options into our diet and came across a tofu recipe, which we customized to yield this easy and tasty crunchy tofu bombs. In terms of our daily meals, both my wife and I are not really particular about the ingredients we use but we do try to eat a balanced meal that includes all the key food groups. We have just recently experimented with peanut butter and came up with a delectable peanut butter cold noodle dish that tastes superb! You might fall for it when you try it. Don’t just take my word for it, but taste it for yourself. Being a die-hard meat eater, I look forward to have some kind of meat element in the dishes I consume. I do stand by the principle of all good things in moderation, which is why we have included an alternative preparation suggestion whereby you can include your favorite meat as well in order to enjoy this recipe. Nevertheless, it does the body good to abstain from meat once in a while if you have been consuming it for a prolonged period of time, which makes the vegan-friendly version a convenient alternative. Do not deprive yourself of this delectable treat. Give it a try and you may just love it for its simplicity and satisfyingly crunchy texture! This here is a wikipedia of sorts for tofu which outlines the different types and forms of tofu that you might not even know exist. Get to know each of them individually so you can reap the most flavor and texture of this delicate ingredient for your next tofu-based dish. This content is accurate and true to the best of the author’s knowledge and is not meant to substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional. © 2021 Brian Brian (author) from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia on September 09, 2021: It is great to know that you tried the stinky tofu before and I applaud you for your bravery, Misbah. Not many people can actually bring themselves to sample this delicacy. I was reluctant at first, but my wife loves it and told me that it doesn't taste as bad as it smells. So, I'm now onboard the stinky tofu boat and the smell does not really bother me anymore. ;) As for the papaya tree, it was a great suggestion that we keep it and try to turn it into a business opportunity but I guess my in-laws had other plans. They are still being good to the land though by growing chili pepper, ginger, and aloe vera, which we get to enjoy when we visit. Misbah Sheikh from ""a Serene Land"" (This Existence Is an Illusion) on September 09, 2021: Yes, Brian, I've tried that tofu version. You may find this funny, but if I had that papaya tree. I would never have cut it down. Instead, I would have tried to open an Amazon store selling those Malaysian papayas online. ;) Think Business. Lol! Blessings to you! Brian (author) from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia on September 09, 2021: You're most welcome, Misbah! Glad to know you like tofu too. I really think it's an underrated ingredient that not many people know how to appreciate and enjoy. It is quite a versatile ingredient that absorbs flavors quite well, depending on how you season or cook it. I'm not sure if you have heard or tried stinky tofu, which is a fermented version of the delicacy that is deep fried and served with sauce and pickles. Some people get turned off by the smell but it actually tastes delicious truly. So, at the end of the day, not everyone has the same level of tolerance and acceptance for a specific dish or delicacy. ;) It is interesting that you mentioned about Malaysian papayas and your love for them. It is quite abundant here and my in-laws used to have a tree in their compound. That was years ago and the tree has since ceased producing fruit that they got it chopped down. So, now we go to the market to get them whenever we feel like having it. :) Brian (author) from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia on September 09, 2021: Hi, Ms Dora! Thanks for appreciating this recipe. Am glad to be able to share some healthy snacks that others can incorporate around their lifestyle. Well, I personally love snacking in between meals and often times reach out for some pretty rich and decadent bites, which I feel is a bad habit of mine. So, I decided to switch it around a little bit and make better choices, where possible. Misbah Sheikh from ""a Serene Land"" (This Existence Is an Illusion) on September 08, 2021: Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe. I love snacking but sometimes I overdo it. Lol! I like tofu. I will surely give it a try someday. Looks yummy! When I was in Pakistan my grandma used to get Pink salt rock from The Khewra Salt Mine that is located in Khewra, Punjab, Pakistan. She used to crush it fine. I have never tasted table salt in my entire childhood .All natural. But now in Spain, we use marine salt. Anyways, thanks for sharing this delicious recipe. By the way I love the taste of Malaysian Papayas. Take care and stay healthy and safe. Enjoy! Blessings always! Dora Weithers from The Caribbean on September 08, 2021: Thanks for this recipe. I'm interested. Thanks also for your wise counsel on healthy and unhealthy snacking. Good advice."
444,How to Sprout Moong (Mung Beans) and Matki (Moth Beans),food," Rajan loves cooking dishes from his native Indian cuisine. He enjoys sharing his favourite recipes with his online readers. Mung bean and Moth bean sprouts RAJAN SINGH JOLLY Sprouts are seeds that have just started germinating, infant plants that have the capacity to grow into adult plants if allowed to. However, seeds used for sprouting are usually those of beans, peas and grains as these can be eaten raw or lightly cooked. Sprouting usually starts with soaking the seeds in water for a certain amount of time, depending on the size of the seed, and then providing them with the right conditions so that they can germinate. Sprouting seeds increases the initial levels of nutrients several times over thereby making them more nutritious. It also makes the protein in seeds easier to digest and also removes certain antinutritional factors like phytic acid, lectins, etc, present in certain seeds. Sprouted seeds also offer certain health benefits like improving heart health, regulating blood sugar levels and making for easier digestion and assimilation of their nutrients. Today, we are going to see how lentils can be sprouted and we are using two popular lentils for this purpose, viz, mung beans and moth beans. As sprouts are mostly eaten raw or lightly cooked chances of infection due to bacteria are more. Therefore, it is best to grow your own sprouts so that you can minimise this chance to almost zero. Also, use clean equipment and potable water to sprout the seeds and store them in the fridge after sprouting is done. Sprouts can be eaten raw by incorporating them in sandwiches and salads. They can be added to certain dishes like stir-fries, soups, patties, omelettes and more. They can be blended into smoothies or ground to a paste to make spreads and dips. 15 min 24 hours 24 hours 15 min 2 servings © 2021 Rajan Singh Jolly"
445,Autumn With Fig Jam,food," I've been cooking for my family for the past five years. When it comes to jam-making and baking, I am a specialist with a degree. Fig Jam https://unsplash.com/photos/n-QvF3vyf5M?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditSh My first experience making jam was in high school, in a Home Economics practical class. The teacher taught us how to make the jam. The first time I made it, it was very watery. It didn't have a good texture, but it was so delicious and fresh that it piqued my interest enough to give it another round at home, in my own kitchen. It was quite nice the second time I prepared it. This increased my confidence in my ability to make a good jam. My father particularly enjoyed it. I've been making jams almost every two months since then. Later, I joined special cooking classes, which helped me even more to become an expert. My younger brother and father are jam lovers, and I enjoy making different jams for them. My personal favorite is fig jam, which I consider to be a unique fall gift. So, without further ado, let me tell you how to prepare this delectable jam. Do You Know? By about 11,000 years ago, people in West Asia had already begun to farm fig trees. Farmed figs may be the first kind of food that anybody farmed, even before wheat and barley. Figs are delicious and healthy. They are a nutritious treat that everyone can enjoy. Choosing which fig you want to use to make jam is your personal choice. All figs can be used to make a good jam, but I prefer using black figs. It's great for stuffing cakes or biscuits, serving with a plate of cheeses, or changing up your breakfasts. It goes well with a slice of bread and butter. It can be used to fill all of your cake, and it can even be used to flavor a cheese plate: fig jam is a true treat no matter how you eat it. You will surely love it. The recipe works well with all sorts of figs, including fioroni, which ripen toward the end of June, and figs that ripen from mid-July to the end of September. Figs have long been thought to be a high-sugar fruit, but is this true? In reality, they are composed of 80% water and 12% sugar. So, no worries about the figure, and when you decide to make fig jam, treat it as if you were making jam with any other fruit. Consider 40-60% sugar for one kilogram of figs, obviously, it depends on how sweet you want it to be. You can add a variety of ingredients like Cinnamon, vanilla, almonds, or walnuts to the jam to enhance the flavor. Always be careful that these ingredients are combined at the end of the cooking process before the jam is poured into the jars. Fun Facts About Figs 1) Figs are among the oldest fruits. They have a soft, and sticky texture. 2) Figs are not really fruits, but flowers turned inside out. The sweet edible seeds we can see inside are the evidence. 3) Figs are very moist. Fig puree can be used instead of oil in baked goods. 4) Figs are ripened and slightly dry on the tree before they are picked. These sweet fruits are very fragile and ripen quickly. So always store them in the refrigerator or on a plate. Sterilize Jar https://unsplash.com/photos/b29z0iltxk4?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditSh It is critical to maintaining a high level of cleanliness. Homemade foods must be a ""hygienic"" delight, free of health risks. So, first, fill a pot halfway with water and place the jars in it. Make sure they are completely submerged, then bring to a boil and leave for 1 hour to sterilize. Then take them out of the water and properly dry them. Fill the jars with the fresh homemade jam, leaving 1 cm around the rim empty. It is critical to use a new cap to close each jar. These steps are necessary for good and long-term preservation. Figs Are Flowers Despite Epictetus’s entreaty, figs don’t “flower”: the fruit is the flower. The black or green orb we eat is called a syconium (from the Greek sykon, “fig”). It is what botanists call an “enclosed inflorescence” because hundreds of tiny thread-like male and female flowers grow inside the urn-like fruit. Fig trees have no blossoms on their branches. The blossom is inside of the fruit! Many tiny flowers produce crunchy little edible seeds that give figs their unique texture. To avoid mold formation, you need to fill the jars up to 1 cm from the edge, cover them well, and flip upside down. Allow it to cool before checking to see if a vacuum has developed. At this point, you should not hear the iconic ""click-clack"" sound. Otherwise, place the jars in a saucepan with enough water to cover them halfway. Bring to a boil, and simmer for approximately an hour, then let it cool in the pot. Dry them and store them in the pantry once they've cooled. Enjoy your autumn with delicious fig jam! Let's fall in love with fig jam this autumn. Some Health Risk Factors for Die Hard Fig Lovers According to  Medical research: The risks associated with figs may vary depending on how people use them. 1) Both fresh and dried figs contain a high level of vitamin K. People taking blood-thinning medications such as warfarin need to keep the vitamin K levels in their diet consistent, so they may wish to avoid figs. 2) Since figs have a high fiber content, eating too many figs — especially dried figs — can cause diarrhea.

448,Heart-Winning BBQ Chicken Cheese Loaded Lasagna Recipe.,food," Lasagna is one of the most common meals, made in my house almost every weekend or once a week. I just simply made a chicken lasagna and everyone loves to eat this delicious food. But last weekend and do some alterations to my recipe, and made bbq chicken lasagna. Don't worry about the term of bbq, it's not going to take lots of effort. The recipe is very simple and very very luscious. Once you made it perfectly you are going to fall in love with it and will make lasagne every day if you are a lasagna lover. Do you know what is lasagne? Lasagna was originated in Italy. The lasagna I'm at found to be delicious enjoyable food for many, containing pasta sheets, heavy cheese, savory tomato sauce, and several vegetables or meats. Lasagna not only adds a feather in the cap to your dining table it has lots of health benefits.   The lasagna is generally far from healthy food, but it can be made a healthy meal by adding nutritious variations. Lasagna is a good source of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Fat in our meal is first broken down into free fatty acids, these free fatty acids move in the bloodstream and utilize by cells for energy. When the body does not need the free fatty acid for energy production, this free fat is stored in the body as fat, and when the body is starved this stored fat is broken down and provides energy to the body. Protein is very essential for body functions. Protein is broken down into amino acids which help to build the muscles. It involves cell repair. Protein helps in the production of hormones, enzymes, and antibodies. Fats and proteins in lasagna mostly come from the meat and cheese you add.  Vitamin B complex found in meat, cheese, pasta, bbq sauce, and tomato sauce helps to stimulate the body's metabolism. Meat in lasagna is a good source of iron. Add more vegetables to get more nutrition from lasagna. Some spices and sauces in a lasagna can be a good source of vitamins like Vitamin A and vitamin C. Liza from USA on September 05, 2021: My family loves lasagna. Besides pizza and pasta, lasagna is one of my favorite comfort food to cook for a family dinner. However, your recipe sounds interesting with the BBQ infused into the dish. Thanks for sharing the recipe. The dish looks delicious."

454,The Taste of India - Culinary Arts,food," Chef  Praveen Abraham
Chef Instructor 
Culinary Academy Of India India is a country that spreads over 3.28 million km² with a population of 139.70 crores. The Indian constitution recognizes 22 major languages and 29 states with different cultures. The country also has a host of tribes and traditions, varied climate and soil conditions, and rich history going as far back as 7,600 BC. India also has all sorts of terrains including mountains, rainforests, hills, plains, deserts (hot and cold), coasts, and islands. This diversity shows itself in the food culture of the country too with people enjoying different tastes, recipes, and styles all over the country. So when we talk about Indian cuisine in general, what exactly are we talking about? Indian cuisine is an extremely broad category of food and drinks that, as a term, simply does not encapsulate the length and breadth of the country. Cuisines within India vary greatly across each state, geography, and culture. In fact, the dishes prevalent in South India are hard to find in the North, and vice versa. The food habits of each region have also diversified over time due to factors like domestic and international trade, economy, migration, colonialization, and availability of ingredients.  This variation in food habits is so immense that Indian cuisine could be considered as one-of-the most diverse food cultures in the world. Going back in time one can find heavy influences of the pre-Aryan period in Indian cuisine. The spice and aromatic-heavy style of Indian cuisine goes back to this ancient civilization and today, masalas and spices are the heart of Indian cooking. Different combinations of spices, powders, aromatics, and herbs give Indian food its intensive, infinite flavor variations. In addition to spices, Indian cuisine is also rich in various types of dairy products which adds its own flavor to the food. One of the biggest reasons for food diversity is socio-religious habits. India is a secular country that houses a significant portion of all major religions worldwide including Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, Jainism, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, and more. Ever since ancient times, India and its people have bowed down to the food customs and practices mentioned in their respective religions. While some religions ban meat altogether, others have similar prohibitions on select meat and vegetables. Going back in time one can find heavy influences of the pre-Aryan period in Indian cuisine.

Ever since ancient times, India and its people have bowed down to the food customs and practices mentioned in their respective religions. While some religions ban meat altogether, others have similar prohibitions on select meat and vegetables. Apart from religion, trade and migration have also helped shape India’s palette. In fact, 1/3rd of India’s most popular ingredients are foreign. Traditional Indian foods such as rice, millets, pulses, sugarcane, bananas, mangoes, lemons, taro, and yam are indigenous to the country. However, common ingredients like onion, tomatoes, potatoes, chilies, mustard seeds, pumpkin, carrots, maize, coffee, garlic, and wheat were all brought to the country over its history. Today, these ingredients are part of a staple Indian diet and deeply rooted within the culinary landscape of India. Apart from ingredients, several kitchen equipment, and items now famous in the country were once brought here, like the Tandoor. When it comes to the modern staple Indian diet, there are plenty of variations across the country. However, there is quite a lot in common too. Indian meals always contain rice, wheat, or other millets depending on the region. These are generally eaten with lentils, pulses, vegetables, pickles, and chutneys. This is supplemented by regional fruits and dairy products. Chicken and fish are extremely popular inland and in coastal areas, whereas red meat is more prevalent based on the socio-religious demographics of each area. Spices and powders such as mustard powder, red chili powder, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves are common everywhere. These spices not only help flavor the food but have proven health benefits too. My inspiration behind this project is to bring this diversity to the forefront. The culinary history of India is steeped in skill, taste, ingredients, and regional diversity. Using the map of India as an element in the prop allows one to not only visualize the range of Indian cuisine but also allows for co-relation between geographies and taste preferences. This display includes all sorts of recipes, and in my opinion, is a diverse representation of Indian cuisine. That said, this is in no way the range of Indian cuisine but a simple visual representation of it. Indian cuisine is varied, diverse, and truly one-of-a-kind, where each recipe deserves its time in the spotlight on the center stage.

457,"Country Foods Can Be Intrepid as Manna, Food of the Angels",food," I have always loved food and it has loved me. I love even writing about it. Allow me, please, to start with a fact that most people know: Since the dawning of mankind there has been food. Items or dangerous creatures (dinosaurs) that fed our fore, fore, fore, forefathers. I cannot prove it, but I can speculate that as big as I am, my forefather, four times removed, loved food. He allegedly ate meat, vegetables, and would have caught fish if he had a teacher to instruct him. But plants and dinosaurs were enough. And there has always been another fact about cavemen and cavewomen. In any of the paintings did I ever spot one caveman or woman who was dangerously-overweight. Nope. Their exercise regiment was easy. When you run for your life most every day, you will be in shape because it's your life of the dino's. I know. I don't want to disregard dino's because they did have intelligence enough to hunt food when they were hungry. All in all, about all that cave person's had to worry about, (no. Strike that. The cave persons didn't know what 'worry,' was) was not starving, staying warm which was most of the time, and staying free from the man-eating dinosaurs. I will go into talking about when the cave-husbands made terrible mistakes as we husbands are wired to do, because even then, cavemen were getting chewed like spearmint  gum on a Saturday night from their cave-wives. This explains why cave-husbands went on ""Meat Hunts"" along with other cave husbands for months because they feared their cave-wives. Enough of that. I thought that I'd never get to the end about cave-husbands and wives. Now I take you to the main floor of this project: ""Rural Foods That Helped Early Southerners to Live."" And I am not about to bash the south or its peoples now, before, or in the future. Mainly because I am a southern guy who loves black coffee, SEC Football, hot wings, and great helpings of the foods that you see in these photos. If you've never tasted this, you've missed something. Corn bread is not only spoken like it's said, but how it was and is made. I have never been given (the gift of cooking, so I will not mess-up any of these delicious food items or any foods in general. My dad, rest his soul, was a natural cook. He would take a pinch of salt, a glass and a half of buttermilk, and enough corn meal to make a solid ""pone"" or cake. The meal is made from yellow or white corn, mostly white. Then the men in the early southern days would take their corn to the local water (or grist) mill and the owner, or ""miller,"" would grind the corn-customer to their specifications because the ""miller"" always had grooves cut into his two large millstones that a big rubber belt and a pulley system turned the wheels and ground the corn. The corn was packaged, but not before the ""miller"" checked the meal for its density and collected his money. Quite frankly, the guys who carried their corn to the mill would hang-around before, during, and after their corn was ground and spend hours talking about current news about families--who was sick or having births, birthdays, and anniversaries. There was hardly any person in these early settlements who were not out of the loop. The cornbread was cooked in about twenty-minutes and devoured (like myself) with the vegetables seen in these photos. Of course there was a lot more vegetables and bread such as biscuits, hand-pies and along with these families never being without the news of the day or month, they never did without food that was grown and preserved for winter days. Of course the ladies canned the vegetables and the apples, peaches, to make delicious food ideas when it was too cold for any of their family members to get outside to work. Hot, but oh so very tasty. Pepper or as most southerners will say, green garden pepper, because for an American-based vegetable, it is always-known by its hot flavor, but oh, so satisfying when eaten with of these foods: corn bread, black-eye'd peas, creamed yellow sweet corn, as well as the delicious white onions if your appetite is asking for these two to be eaten. The amazing thing about garden pepper is that when eaten with string beans, butter beans, fried or boiled red potatoes, stewed or fried okra, the pepper only enhances the overall taste. And what southerner would dare turn any of these foods down? None. Another great idea given by our forefathers who helped settle the early south was the canning of various vegetables and yes, pepper, that will stay fresh and great to eat in the longest winter. Personally, I love the pepper sauce when boiled in hot water then placed in a jar with white vinegar. I've also seen those small tomatoes put in with the pepper sauce, because no matter if one likes the peppers or the sauce, it's all good. Oh yes, the picked tomatoes are delicious. Boiled for corn-on-the-cob or creamed . . .it's all good. I mean, tasty. Does anyone like sweet yellow corn? Sure, a lot of people love to eat sweet yellow corn especially in the summer time when the grills are broken-out into our backyards and when the steaks hit the grill, it's a great food treat. People can lay the ears of corn onto the grill and it is delicious in this fashion as well. Then there is the all-time favorite: boiled sweet corn can be enjoyed by boiling the ears of corn and eat them with a pat of margarine on the corn and get ready to enjoy your taste buds. The tradition of cutting the corn and cooking it in a skillet with a margarine pat on top was derived from the older southerners who loved to eat food that did not take too long to prepare, because they had to work in every available bit of daylight that they had. White onions can be eaten with all types of good vegetables and you will love ithem. White onions are not tricky. You need to wash them and cut them and eat them with peas, green beans, butter beans, corn bread, okra and every food that came from the south or other places. A favorite of mine doesn't have anything to do with corn bread, but biscuits. I loved to eat the biscuits cold and with a slice of onion inside or a long version of the onion on my plate. Blackeye peas are tasty in winter or summer. Blackeye peas is another southern food favorite. And with little preparation, they can be served for the dinner or supper table. (*in the south, dinner is at late evening and supper is around 11 p.m.).

Pizza has become a staple around the world for comfort food. In the U.S. alone, Americans consume over 100 acres of pizza a day. That is a lot of pizza!

The wacky and wonderful pizza toppings from around the world might blow your mind or get your taste buds tingling. Do you dare to sample a slice of one of these unordinary pizzas? This list contains a full English Breakfast Pizza, Kangaroo pizza, bugs as pizza toppings and more. (source)  It might be considered un-American to eat pizza topped with kangaroo, emu and crocodile, but to the Australian’s it’s a delicious menu selection. Emu and kangaroo are two very different meat options available on the “Coat of Arms,” pizza found on the menu at the Australian Heritage Hotel, located in The Rocks, in Sydney Australia. The “Coat of Arms,” pizza is half Emu and half peppered Kangaroo with dried tomatoes, capsicum and lemon myrtle mayo. Kangaroo tends to have a gamey taste similar to venison, while Emu is a lean red meat many find enjoyable. Crocodile is an unfamiliar pizza topping to many, but not in Australia. Crocodile has a mild fish flavor and chicken-like texture. It is a tender and meaty topping. Below the “Coat of Arms'' pizza at the Australian Heritage Hotel Menu Saltwater Crocodile Pizza. Crocodile is paired with spinach, red capsicum and a creamy coconut and red curry sauce and topped with coriander. (sources) Imagine a pizza slathered in creamy, buttery mashed potatoes and topped with cheese. Mashed potato pizza is a thing, and is the perfect combination of two classic comfort foods. Mashed potatoes on pizza may sound a little bizarre to someone used to the typical pizza options like sausage or pepperoni. One popular dive for the potato pizza originates from Bar a night club located in New Haven CT. Among other fantastic pizza’s, you will find the one of a kind mashed potato pizza. Oddly enough, it may not be as far-fetched as you might think. Italy is the infamous home of all things pizza, It is not uncommon in Italy to use potato in or on top of the pizza crust, creating a tender and filling meal that is also budget friendly. Mashed potato pizza may be a spin off from Pierogi Pizza also known as Pagash. Perogis are a pasta shell stuffed with creamy mashed potatoes and seasonings. These originate from the Slavi (Ukranian) regions and are also popular in Pennsylvania. Pagash may also include ingredients like cabbage and onions. Potato pizza is delicious and a meatless dinner option which makes it quite popular among the Catholic in Northeast Pennsylvania during Lent.

While the idea of macaroni and cheese had been around long before Kraft began to mass produce it, the notion of mac and cheese pizza was not. What better way to celebrate your love of Mac and cheese and pizza than to combine the two?(source) This genius combination is the creamy culmination of childhood and adult comfort foods. Pizza Hut introduced the cheesy carb-acious combination to the public in 2017. Since its launch at Pizza Hut it has been spreading to pizza distributors and chef’s world wide. Source The Swedish celebrate their love of bananas and bold flavors with a very unique twist on pizza with their famous Banana and Curry Pizza. You read that right, bananas and curry and sometimes even peanuts! Bananas are sweet and often used in smoothies or dessert, while curry is a bold flavor made from a combination of deep earth spices often found in Indian cuisine. Combining these two very different ingredients is not common, unless you live in Sweden, where Banana Curry pizza is totally normal. Some versions of this peculiar pizza include peanuts, chicken and even pineapple. (source) Mockba pizza is not like your typical hot and gooey pizza. This Russian style pizza is served cold. Mockba pizza translates to Moscow pizza. Mockba pizza is a combination of a variety of fish such as sardines, tuna, mackerel and salmon dressed up with onions and herb blends. Pizza is not always considered a healthy food, but Mockba pizza certainly can qualify due to the fresh and low carb ingredients. (source) English breakfast meets pizza in the English Breakfast Pizza. (source) A traditional English breakfast originates from the British Gentry and is made up of bacon, sausages, eggs, baked beans, black pudding, tomatoes, mushrooms and toast served with a steamy beverage like tea or coffee.  Asada, an European grocery supplier, has taken the traditional English breakfast and turned it into a stone-baked pizza available to the everyday shopper featuring Heinz baked beans, a co-partner in the launch. Baked beans and pizza are a strange combination, but the British beg to differ. Their favorite breakfast has been transformed and it is exciting!  These days Lobster is considered a luxury food item. Ordering a Lobster tail with your meal can cost anywhere between $15 to $35 or more depending on the dining establishment. Lobster is a comfort food and delicacy. Now there is lobster pizza combining comfort food and luxury food into one. Lobster as a pizza topping is not as ironic one might think. Lobster, bread and cheese pair extremely well together. Turning lobster into a pizza topping opens an opportunity for it to be more available to the general public. Lobster pizza blends together a familiar comfort food with an exotic seafood option. Red lobster recognized a genius combination and now offers their own version of a lobster pizza. Their lobster and langostino pizza combines lobster, mozzarella cheese, fresh diced tomato topped with sweet and savory basil. (source) Cicadas on pizza is not something most people would consider when coming up with the next big thing. That was not the case for the Ohio Pizza Bandits. This pizza in Dayton, Ohio really went out on a limb when they harvested local cicadas from the surrounding trees and turned them into a pizza topping. The cicadas used for pizza were first blanched and then sautéed in sesame oil and chili powder before added to the spicy Thai style pizza. The cicada wings were even used as decoration on the crust. The cicada pizza also combined mushrooms, cabbage, green onion, a mango Cilantro and spicy Thai sauce all piled on a layer of miso housing Sriracha sauce. The pizza was more experimental than anything and is not offered on the menu. Did they create a trend or a flop? Social media ate it up as news went viral.

It turned out so impressive that the reindeer pizza won a first place award in 2008 in the America's plate International pizza competition. The pizza is topped with smoked reindeer which in Finland, is viewed as we do deer meat or venison. (source) DesignDrawArtes The world is constantly changing and so is the face of pizza.

459,Foolproof Easy Recipe Vegan Light Cupcakes Muffins Perfect Breakfast Snack,food," I am a pastry chef. My passion is baking mouthwatering sweet treats and desserts. Cooking & baking teaches you to be more aware of what you put into your body every day. By starting to cook regularly, you can become familiar with how some ingredients work or why one recipe fails. For example, making your own batter from scratch takes much longer than buying a pre-made powder mix. Be careful with the amount of butter added, the amount of kneading, and the temperature of all ingredients. When cooking at home, pay attention to the little things and think carefully about what you eat. Only the best quality food is good enough for you. Everyone with a sweet tooth has the same problem. We all love to eat a lot of sweets, but we have to keep it in a healthy balance. After experimenting I fine tuned this vegan & healthy recipe for you. It's super easy to digest and a perfect snack. Baking is my Therapy 15 min 15 min 30 min 19 cupcakes As I love history myself. Here is a little background story about baking and how it started. The first evidence of bread was found when people took the seeds of wild plants, soaked them in water and mixed everything together to make a soup. When this dough is cooked on a flat, hot stone, it becomes a bread-like substance. Then people cooked the dough over hot coals when they heated it. The oldest oven in the world was discovered in Croatia in 2014 and dates back to 6500 years. The ancient Egyptians used yeast to make bread. Baking in ancient Greece began around 600 BC. In 5600 BC the development of bread took place in the Roman Empire. From around 300 BC to the 5th to the 1st century BC, pastry became a Roman profession (pastilerium in Latin), and the Romans began to love parties and celebrations, which eventually became a respected profession. Desserts, for example, are often made for big parties, and any pastry chefs that can create a new kind of delicious dessert are welcome. In her first year in Rome there were over 300 chefs, and Kato wrote about how to prepare a variety of dishes and grow professionally and socially through her creativity. The Romans used fireplaces to bake bread in their ovens and mills to grind grain and flour. Denise McGill from Fresno CA on August 30, 2021: Great history lesson.  I love things like this.  Thanks for the recipe. Blessings, Denise Chitrangada Sharan from New Delhi, India on August 30, 2021: This sounds delicious, with interesting combination of ingredients, especially blueberries. Well presented recipe, with helpful pictures. Thank you for sharing."
460,How to Improve Your Coffee Experience at Home - 5 Tips for Better Coffee,food," I Want to Help you with all my Strength and Solidity. I will always give my Best. Do I have to start getting expensive jugs and pans now? Not necessarily. You can play hi-fi without a 100-euro pouring jug or coffee scale. Many tools make it easy, but they don’t have to be high-end tools. Listed below are five steps you can take to get started in terms of hi-fi without a huge amount of money. And with just the basic cooker you can find in your home. This prevents the taste of the paper from getting into the finished product, ie the coffee you drink. If you are skeptical of the tip, then test the test: take two glasses of water on the table. Also put a filter bag in another glass. Allow the glasses and bag to stand for three to four minutes, lift the bag off, and taste the water from both glasses. You will understand why this free little gimmick is recommended by anyone who is serious about coffee or makes it a profession. Do you visually pull the amount of coffee into the filter bag? Do you make a stronger morning coffee by putting one spoonful of extra? Not worth it. You can significantly improve your coffee by weighing both the amount of water and the amount of coffee you make. Especially in manual extraction methods, this is emphasized, but is also fully applicable when cooking with Moccamaster. Of course, you need a scale for weighing. And don’t worry, it doesn’t have to be an Hario of eighties for the weighing to be successful. Prisms, Tokmanni and kitchen utensils are available in a couple of dozen. A gram with a gram accuracy is good, a 0.1 gram scale is even better. Of course, you need a coffee grinder to grind. Immediately, you should forget about the kitchen grinders with a shredding blade, with them the experiment of hi-fi dying immediately dies. Placing in a conical blade mill is a placement in much better coffee cups. Cone-blade mills are now available for less than a hundred and are excellent equipment for their price. There is nothing to prevent you from immediately investing several hundred in a plate-blade mill, but if you want to start with hi-fi solutions with budget solutions, then, for example, there are a couple of different versions of cone-blade mills in Amazon  collections. This is often forgotten. That is, when all the coffee has drained into the pan, lift the lid of the pan and even spin it a few times with a spoon before pouring it into the cups. The stronger extraction at the bottom mixes with the “weaker” extraction at the surface and the end result is more equal for all drinkers. Otherwise, those who get to the bottom of the pan may have to make a little grimace. Or at least inject an unbridled amount of milk - or even sugar - into the coffee. Gas stations know this and everyone knows what is being said about gas station coffee. That is, if there are more cups or pots left in the pan at a time so that you can enjoy the next cup only after a while, then pour the coffee into a thermos jug rather than store it in the pan with a hot plate in the kettle. The hotplate burns coffee and makes it a “tar” -like disgust familiar from workplace coffee rooms. In a thermos, the coffee stays warm for longer, as long as it is intact. Finally, an extra tip if you want to get into new coffees and even try small roasters:  One-time tasting is not enough. Coffee has more flavors and odor-causing compounds than wines, so it’s pretty clear that once tasted, the coffee doesn’t give the whole truth. Spend time smelling coffee both beans and ground and Taste your coffee over time, carefully and in a hurry. Allow the coffee to cool slightly, as in many cases the flavors only come out or are at their best. With too hot coffee, you just burn your mouth and you don’t taste anything. Have a nice coffee!

461,"6 Tips for Better Coffee - a Filter Bag Tip to Help: “significantly Affects the Taste""!",food," I Want to Help you with all my Strength and Solidity. I will always give my Best. We asked a professional for help in making good coffee. The Helsinki Coffee Festival hosts the Helsinki Coffee Festival. The organizer of the event, Maija Kestilä, wants to share the good news of good coffee with everyone. Even though we drink the most coffee in the world, that doesn’t mean we drink quality coffee. In many homes, the kettle has never been cleaned properly, and coffee grounds are only measured visually, ”says Kestilä. The purpose of the coffee festival is to bring together all coffee lovers under one roof and convey the good news of good coffee. A cross-section of the Finnish coffee world is represented at the event; roasters, cafes and coffee machines of all sizes, as well as other coffee-related items, such as guidance on how to make good filter coffee and specialty coffees. In addition, there is also a secret tea room, so tea friends are not forgotten either. 1-High quality raw material and fresh coffee. All in all a and o is a quality raw material. Freshness and aroma are best preserved in coffee when the coffee is stored as beans and ground fresh just before making coffee. However, coffee does not last a long time, so it is not worth hoarding. The aromas and flavors of coffee disappear the longer it is stored. 2- Correct proportions and grinding. Dimensions are one of the most important steps towards a perfect coffee cup. Depending on the method of preparation, a different amount of coffee is measured. For example, for filter coffee, coffee beans are measured at 6 grams per deciliter. For coffee made with Pour over methods such as V60, 16 grams of coffee per 250 grams of water is recommended. It is most convenient to weigh the proportions with an accurate scale. If the scale cannot be found at home, you can get a measure that goes with just the right amount of coffee. If you grind coffee beans in a mill, also remember the correct grinding coarseness. 3. Fresh water is measured in a separate jug. The filter bag is watered. The filter bag absorbs less paper flavor into the coffee when it is preferably soaked in warm water before measuring the coffee grounds. It significantly affects the taste. A common mistake is that the coffee is measured in advance, for example the night before, ready in the coffee machine. However, you should always make coffee fresh. It is also a good idea to pour the coffee into the machine with a separate jug so that unnecessary grease does not accumulate in the coffee pot. If you make coffee with the V60 or Chemex method, for example, the best way to pour coffee is with a long and thin-spout jug. 4- The filter bag is watered. The filter bag absorbs less paper flavor into the coffee when it is preferably soaked in warm water before measuring the coffee grounds. It significantly affects the taste. 5- The coffee is consumed at the right temperature and is not allowed to stand or reheat. You should always make the amount of coffee you drink at that moment. It is not advisable to stand the coffee on the kettle plate, as it can easily overheat. If you make coffee with pour over methods, the water temperature should be 92 to 94 degrees. Once the coffee has been poured into the cup, it is a good idea to let it cool in the cup for a while. If the coffee is eaten too hot, its flavors and aromas will not stand out. 6- Finally, remember cleanliness. The coffee machine should be cleaned thoroughly every other week and it is a good idea to use the appliances' own cleaners, not too strong detergents. After each use, it is advisable to at least empty the coffee machines and rinse them under warm water. Manual appliances can also be washed in the dishwasher. The nut pan should be washed by hand.

462,"Edible Bird's Nest, Bird's Nest Soup, Bird's Nest Drink: What's the Difference? A Review",food," Mazlan has a passion for health and fitness. He enjoys yoga, cycling, home workouts, and healthy food. What's the difference between edible bird's nest, bird's nest soup, bird's nest drink? greatstuff I started drinking edible bird's nest in January 2021 to boost my immune system as it can nourish the lung system and improve respiratory health. Since there was an improvement, I continued to drink it on a daily basis. Initially, I was confused with the terms edible bird's nest, bird's nest soup, and bird's nest drink. To add to the confusion, someone told me that it is a Chinese bird's nest. Well, I did my research and that's all cleared up now. If you have a similar problem, this article will demystify these confusing terms. I will explain their differences and benefits. Since most people buy ready-to-drink bird's nest, I will explain what to look for before you buy this bird's nest drink. Edible bird's nests are nests of swiftlet birds made by the male swiftlets using their saliva. They are harvested and made into bird's nest soup and drinks, and suitable as savory and sweet dishes. The highly prized ingredient in the bird's nest, sialic acid is also extracted and used in cosmetics. This swiftlet is also known as “walit” in Indonesian and Malaysian languages. These countries are the top two edible bird's nest producers in the world. Only the nest of the White-nest swiftlet (Aerodramus fuciphagus) and the Black-nest swiftlet (Aerodramus maximus) are edible. Additionally, bird's nests of White-nest swiftlet have lesser impurities compared to those of Black-nest swiftlets. Hence, breeders of house nest swiftlet will entice only the White-nest swiftlet. Also, bird's nests of other bird species are not safe for consumption, including the swallow bird's nest. Very often you see edible bird's nest written as swallow bird's nest in some blog sites or in some of the sales and marketing sites. For some unknown reasons, swallow bird's nest has a much higher keyword search at 1,900 daily search volume compared to swiftlet bird's nest at 170 daily search volume. How the latter is more searchable is a mystery as the swallow is not the same as the swiftlet and a swallow bird's nest is not edible. Because of the keyword search popularity, some sites will use the term 'swallow bird's nest' on their sites. 'Chinese Bird's Nest' refers to the same swiftlet's edible bird's nest. This superfood was popularized by the Chinese and is part of their cuisine for generations For convenience, the western media made references to edible bird's nest as 'Chinese Bird's Nest'. Edible bird's nest trivia facts SCMP While the terms bird's nest soup and bird's nest drink are sometimes used to mean the same thing, they are actually not. Bird’s nest soups are usually thicker and served as a pre-dinner starter or part of the main course. The bird's nest content is also higher especially if it was for the main course. Popular ingredients used in some of the bird's nest soup recipes are: You must try at least one of the above bird’s nest soup recipes. They are delicious and hearty, even for breakfast. This is the lighter version of bird's nest soup and is prepared with rock sugar. They are ideal as desserts and as drinks. The ready-to-drink bird nest beverages are versions of this bird's nest drink. Besides the classic rock sugar flavor, there are also sugar-free versions but flavored with sweet fruits such as lychee and dates. They are usually sold in trays of 6 or 12 bottles (8oz each bottle). Most of the bird's nest drinks are certified halal and are accessible to Muslims. A busy person will find it a hassle to prepare the raw-whole-piece bird's nest. You have to initially soak them overnight before they can be double-boiled. If you are not used to doing this, you can overcook and spoil their nutrients. Unless you are on a particular diet or are using a special bird's nest recipe, most people buy the ready-to-drink bird's nests. There are many companies selling these drinks and in various flavors. In any case, before you buy one of these ready-to-drink bird nests, please be mindful of the following six issues: I also prefer to buy ready-to-drink bird's nest but only from reputable brands because their high production standards will ensure the elimination of heavy metals, nitrites, excessive minerals, fungi, bird feathers, bacteria, and mites from the raw bird's nest. Reputable brands will not use 'fake bird's nest' i.e. bird's nests that are adulterated or made entirely of jelly, tremella fungus, karaya gum, pork skin, fish swimming bladder, etc. which can be harmful to your health. This varies depending on the price. Generally, you should buy the ready-to-drink bird's nest that has at least 28% bird's nest to make it worth buying if you want to enjoy the benefits. The table below summarizes the percentage for some of the popular brands. Almost all ready-to-drink bird's nests are prepared with rock sugar and their sugar content varies. If you are shopping for low sugar content, 'Kinohimitsu With Red Dates & Wolfberries' has one of the lowest at 3g per 100g serving (see table below). If you are diabetic, you can buy 'BRAND's Bird's Nest Sugar-Free'. It has no added sugar except for the sweetener Sorbitol and Xylitol. So, if you are concerned about sugar levels, it is wise to check the package label before buying. Just so you know, the FDA's daily value for added sugars is 50 grams per day based on a 2,000 calorie daily diet. Summary of bird's nest content, sugar, and sodium per 100 g serving for some of the popular brands of bird's nest ready to drink Kinohimitsu Snow Lotus with Honey & Rock Sugar 28% 5.8g not listed Kinohimtsu Floral Bird's Nest 18% 7.0g not listed Kinohimitsu With Red Dates & Wolfberries 28% 3.0g not listed Kinohimitsu Bird's Nest with Collagen 28% (collagen 50mg) 5.2g not listed FG Wallet Premium Bird's Nest with Rock Sugar and Extra Collagen 33% (collagen 30%) 5.48g 23.20g Royal Bird's Nest with Red Date & Chrysanthemum 15% (cave harvested bird's nest) not listed 2mg Some people are concerned about the sodium level in their foods. Generally, sodium levels in bird's nests are relatively low. Still, it is wise to check before you buy. As a guide, FDA lists 35 mg of sodium or less per serving as 'Very Low Sodium' and 140 mg of sodium or less per serving as 'Low Sodium'. Unfortunately, not many brands list their sodium content on their label. The above table shows some that list it on their packaging. Royal Bird's Nest with Red Date & Chrysanthemum has a low 2mg and falls under 'Very Low Sodium'. However, FG Wallet Premium Bird's Nest with Rock Sugar and Extra Collagen has 23.2mg of sodium and hence falls under 'Low Sodium'. Most of the ready-to-drink bird's nests are made from house bird's nests as it is cheaper. Not many are from cave bird's nests but if you insist, then try 'Royal Bird's Nest with Red Dates and Chrysanthemum'. It claims to use the cave's bird's nest but has only 15% bird's nest content. It is also slightly more expensive. Should you buy a cave bird's nest or a house bird's nest? From the explanation below, there's no big gain from using a cave bird's nest. In fact, you will be supporting the environment if you choose a house bird's nest. Cave bird's nests are wild harvested from limestone caves, mountains, and sea cliffs. The natural environment affects the texture which is stiffer and harder but it retains its translucent and gelatinous texture after cooking. However, it has higher impurities and can be exposed to heavy metal contamination from the external environment. So, it takes time to clean and production volume is also low. Hence, it cost more. House bird nests are harvested from nesting houses specially built to encourage the breeding and nesting of swiftlet birds. The nest has fewer feathers and impurities and is cheaper. It can expand better in water but cannot be boiled for too long as it will turn mushy. As reported in this study, calcium and sodium are higher in cave bird’s nests. However, from this report, the calcium and sodium can be added to the house bird's nest by precipitating calcium carbonate using a calcium chloride soak and sodium carbonate rinse. In this study by Norhayati et al., the commercial brands were found to have higher amounts of calcium, magnesium, sodium, phosphorus, and potassium compared to unprocessed edible bird nests. Most of the commercial brands are harvested from nesting homes as they are cheaper. The same study also indicated that nutrient contents are affected by breeding sites and the availability of food for the swiftlets. In most cases, owners of nesting homes will ensure a sufficient supply of swiftlet foods to ensure a quality bird's nest. It also reported that swiftlets feed on certain species of insects as their source of food and these are most abundant during the rainy seasons. So, bird nests harvested during this season are usually big and thick, have fewer impurities, and have higher amounts of protein. They are also expensive. Hence, a house bird's nest can be just as good as a cave bird's nest and if you choose the former, you can help conserve the dwindling cave swiftlet population. Comparison of edible bird's nest nutrient composition of commercial brands and raw unprocessed samples Study by M K Norhayati et al. There are several studies on the nutritional values and health benefits of edible bird's nests and all rave it as a nutritious meal that benefits people in all age groups. This study by Rebecca S.Y. Wong, Faculty of Medicine, SEGi University College on 'Edible Bird's Nest: Food or Medicine?' reported that edible bird's nest has multiple bioactive compounds, better antioxidant effects, and the presence of other compounds (such as lactoferrin, sialic acid, ovotransferrin, minerals, and amino acids including essential amino acids, such as lysine, tyrosine, and serin) that synergistically add to edible bird's nest bioactivity. The study further highlights the following as some of the health benefits: Boost immune system and production of antibodies Promotes formation of collagen and muscle protein Anti-arthritis, increase bone strength Restore stamina, relieve fatigue Anti-aging, prevent wrinkle, Enhance memory, nerve functions, mental health Promote gastric health - protect stomach from ulcer and bacterial infection Promote cell regeneration, growth of red blood cells, removal of toxic substances Enhance absorption of nutrients, better appetite, stimulate bowel movement Prevent cold and flu Improve skin texture Raise libido Regulate blood sugar, improve metabolism Reduce body fat and speed up weight loss Lower preeclampsia risk, relieves stretch marks, speed up recovery Main benefits of edible bird's nest Will Harvesting of Bird's Nest Threaten Swiftlet's Population? One of the biggest concerns is, the constant harvesting of the bird’s nests will threaten the swiftlet's breeding success and hence, a drop in their population. The swiftlets actually build a new nest in the next mating season and will abandon the old nest from the previous season. This 'abandon nest' is the harvested nest. In Malaysia, the ongoing preservation of the ecosystem also ensures the natural habitat of the swiftlets is not affected. The swiftlets build a new nest in the next mating season and 'discard' the old nest. Only this 'old nest' is harvested. Additionally, controlled and seasonal harvesting of cave bird's nests are in place. There are not many downsides with regards to consuming edible bird's nests except for: Depending on the promotions, I usually buy ready-to-drink bird's nests either from Lazada or Shopee as the prices are very competitive. Shipping is also free if you buy from certain sellers. I have tried several brands but now stick to Kinohimitsu Snow Lotus with Honey & Rock Sugar that has 28% bird's nest content. It also works well for my budget as I drink them every day. A pack of 6 bottles sells for RM34 but if you buy from the retail shop it can be as high as RM46.00. Once in a while I splurge and buy Kinohimitsu with Red Dates & Wolfberries that sell for RM40 but retail shops sell it at Rm60.00. If you are outside the East and South-East Asian region, you can buy bird's nest from Amazon. Some of the ready to drink bird's nest that I have tried including Royal Bird's Nest that claimed to use cave bird's nest greatstuff These are some of the common questions asked on edible bird's nest soup and drink, for your reference. Yes, you can take it every day as it is good for your overall health. Bird's nest drink is best taken on an empty stomach for better absorption of the nutrients, either in the morning after waking up or in the evening before bedtime.

Sialic acid is known for brain development, skin beautification, and to boost immunity. It is used as a drink or as a serum in cosmetics. It is also reported that edible bird’s nest has the highest natural sialic acid content compared to other natural food sources. A good brand will use a good extraction method to totally isolate and preserve the sialic acid content for efficient absorption by the body. Rock sugar is formed by allowing a solution of white sugar and water to crystallize. The cooling process produces crystals of higher purity and based on Traditional Chinese Medicine practices, rock sugar can replenish and enrich vital energy especially in the stomach and lungs.

464,"Simple, Savory, and Refreshing Peanut Butter Cold Noodles",food," Brian loves food and enjoys exploring various cuisines. He is a keen experimenter in the kitchen and finds cooking therapeutic. A protein-packed serving that is delicious and simple to make Athena Emes Are you a peanut butter fan who loves peanut butter on toasts, in smoothies, with oatmeal, and even in baked goods? These might be the usual combinations you are familiar with, which makes a great energy booster for breakfasts, lunch, or even simple snacking. What if I tell you that there is another way you can enjoy this delicious spread, integrating it into a savory dish that makes a good full meal to be enjoyed with the family? Peanut butter is a staple item in my household and we can bulldoze through one big jar easily in just two weeks or less, between the five of us. It seems to be everyone’s all time versatile favorite in the family that we enjoy it so much, perhaps a little too much. We reach for the bottle of peanut butter almost every day and use it as a spread, a condiment, and on many occasions, on its own as a quick snack. So, out of curiosity and wanting to try something different, the missus decided one day that we will have peanut butter cold noodles for lunch and proceeded to prepare the meal. It requires surprisingly simple ingredients and did not take much cooking except for boiling of the noodles and eggs. The end result turned out delicious and it was indeed filling. The ingredients and method of preparation is quite straightforward and I decided to share it so that you may give it a go as well. 15 min 12 min 27 min Serves three to five people Chinese wheat noodles. A great alternative for this dish is Korean Somyeon noodles, which is slightly finer in texture Once the noodle is cooked, rinse it with cold water or soak in ice water for 30 seconds to stop it from cooking and prevent it from sticking to one another 1. You may add some chili oil into the sauce mixture for an extra kick. 2. For added protein boost, you can serve the noodles alongside baked salmon or grilled meats for a wholesome meal. 3. For those who prefer a slightly diluted sauce, you may add some lemon juice prior to mixing the peanut butter in.  For added protein boost, serve the noodles with a side of grilled salmon or even your favorite meats Athena Emes This way of enjoying peanut butter might come across as peculiar and unconventional to some of you. It was the same for me until I decided to give it a taste. Well, for the die-hard peanut butter fans, this might just be another new way to enjoy your favorite spread. Your palate will be assaulted by the myriad of lingering flavors, ranging from the sweetness of the peanut butter to the spicy kick from the minced ginger and garlic and also the savory hint from the soy sauce and tanginess of the vinegar. The texture of the cold springy noodles just goes very well with the tangy, sweet, and slightly spicy paste. This peanut butter cold noodle would definitely be a great dish to enjoy in the hot summer, topped with cucumbers for the refreshing crunch! This simple dish has got just the right balance of carbohydrates, fiber, protein, and fat, which makes it a solid serving on its own. This dish alone has the right combination of food groups as prescribed by the food pyramid; the carbohydrates derived from the wheat noodles, fiber from the julienned cucumbers and minced ginger, protein from the peanut butter and egg, and lastly fats from the sesame oil. Apart from fulfilling the nutrient requirements, this dish can fill your belly and you do not need to spend hours preparing it. Give it a try and let me know how you find this dish. © 2021 Brian Brian (author) from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia on September 02, 2021: You're most welcome, Pawan! Well, it is indeed yummy.

Yes, this is indeed an easy and tasty recipe. I have not tried using peanut butter in stir fries though, but good to know that it works well to give the added flavor. My wife's Chinese and she came up with this brilliant idea of making the peanut butter sauce for the noodle dish. Was skeptical initially, but it turned out great and the taste was bomb!

468,"Thank God for Cold Foods, and Mom",food," I was born in the south. I live in the south and will die in the south. This is only a small part of the memories I share. Delicious cold, pork sausage tastes even better in mom's cathead  biscuits. Let's go. Time is vitally-important. I would say that there is no time like the present, but that might be a bit too cheesy. But each word in this hub is the truth. No holds barred. No punches pulled. Believe me. This piece had to be that way. I could rant and rave until (rural term here) the cows come home and still not be anywhere near capturing the entire description, feeling, that was attached to my sainted mother and when I use the serious term, sainted, I mean that if I do not type another word. But in the end, you will see my points and my mom all to well.Human beings are not that eomplex as some doctors of the mind would suggest. If so, then why was the mega-genius Albert Einstein a drop-out? Even failed the subject of math? In human terms, this would appear to be complex, but what do I know? I was then of low I.Q. in my teen years, and now that I am 67, my I.Q. points have not changed that much, so what do I know? Just allow me to share this one look (among many) about my years of 17 and 18. These years for any guy or girl should be ""the"" best no matter where they life and no matter their I.Q. I believe that God had His hand in everything including a mental segment of all thongs living, to either increase in wisdom or just live where they are. The last one is me to a T. Not that I need or asking any pity from anyone. I just want to go on record to say that if I had to name ""the"" best time of my teenage years were the ages that I told you about above. These years were from the weekends that I enjoyed Friday, Saturday and (sometimes) Sunday afternoons depending of my dad was in a good mood to allow me to have the family car. Put any of the foods seen on this hub into one of these cathead biscuits and man, what great eating. You may not believe or want to believe this, but these wonderful, memorable weekends were when I was alone. All alone in our kitchen. If you will, exercise your patience and read the below informal essay about one person, my precious mom; her creativity in preparing the most-common foods; pork sausage, biscuits, bacon, and white onions. That's it. And I can attest to the fact that every ounce of these cold foods helped me to gain a good night's sleep and rest and awake refreshed. You can easily-understand this because none of us were born with an I.Q. of 334, (oh, how I wish), but my mom was a special case. She had the gift, as it were, to provide meal after meal of common things that some might discard. The bottom line is that when I reached junior high school, I thought that this time was serious not only to get a passing grade and to have enough units to graduate high school. Serious may be exaggerated some, but I can say that my nerves were never settled whatsoever. Frpm 8 a.m. untl 3 p.m., it was study my elective subjects and added topics Monday through Friday. My stomach was tied-up and did not attend many home football games because I wanted to get into my room and leave the lights on and listen to my all-time favorite rock station: WLS-Chicago with the disc jockey prince, John Records Landecker, his real name. Just Landecker and his LP's and the peaceful darkness of my room and I was fine. Then when I passed my driver's test, I was blessed to get the use of our family car which was another hide-away where I could meet my friends in town and rant about how tough that school had become and how we were going to do come graduation time. When you are 17 like we were, we wanted it all: success, love, and of course, happiness, but we would have to graduate. Sliced Vidalia onion placed in mom's biscuits were Heaven on earth. But when the night ended at 12 midnight for us, I went home and started to head to my room and more WLS and rock, but I happen to spy something on our kitchen table that didn't look like it belonged. In a small plate was a few pieces of seasoned pork sausage and two cathead biscuits that I had to believe that this food was left-over from breakfast. But with a knife and one or two biscuits, I opened them and filled them with the sausage. The first bite was Heaven on earth! Manna that fed the Israelites that Moses and Aaron had left from captivity in Egypt. To put into simple terms: the biscuits and sausage were far-out, as we teen's said in our slang. Sure we all tried hard to match the environment of the Turbulent 60's, but the only stage of turbulence that we achieved was a few choice slang terms with far-out being the one phrase that was said the most. Now. I will add each photo and underneath the food I will give a short caption. I hope that at the end of this hub, if you were ever 17, single, not having much of a base of life, but you had a great mom and dad, and for these special people, you need to tell them if they are alive or not just how wonderful that they treated you. I've done this and I know that they heard my words. Enjoy. I know that I sure did. Yummmm, best describes cold bacon and cold biscuits. https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&insightstoken=bcid_TosP01OEuSYDSA*ccid_iw%2FTU4S5&form=ANCMS1&iss=SBIUPLOADGET&selectedindex=0&id=1738443335&ccid=iw%2FTU4S5&exph=364&expw=496&vt=2&sim=11 https://www.pexels.com/photo/raw-onion-rings-on-marble-surface-4202502/ https://www.landolakes.com/recipe/21308/perfect-flaky-butter-biscuits/ https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&ccid=7siU2R2i&id=CA92E18E1B803C7EA9027DE4D886F811D131A327&thid=OIP.7siU2R2iBboVlMOFwkpazwHaE7&mediaurl=https%3a%2f%2fupload.wikimedia.org%2fwikipedia%2fcommons%2fthumb%2f2%2f20%2fBacon_(1).jpg%2f1280px-Bacon_(1).jpg&cdnurl=https%3a%2f%2fth.bing.com%2fth%2fid%2fR.eec894d91da205ba1594c385c24a5acf%3frik%3dJ6Mx0RH4htjkfQ%26pid%3dImgRaw%26r%3d0&exph=853&expw=1280&q=jpegs+of+bacon&simid=608008489818592734&FORM=IRPRST&ck=0D484D2C6A036A4213912299D85380A7&selectedIndex=0&idpp=overlayview&ajaxhist=0&ajaxserp=0 © 2021 Kenneth Avery Pamela Oglesby from Sunny Florida on August 30, 2021: This is such an enjoyable article to read, Kenneth.

Doris James MizBejabbers from Beautiful South on August 27, 2021: Really glad you enjoyed your mom's cathead biscuits, Kenneth. I have memories of my mother's cooking. Notice I didn't precede ""cooking"" with ""good"". Mom was a passable cook, I think she viewed it as a necessity, not an art. She, however, was a superb baker, with the exception of her soda cornbread and soda biscuits, which my dad preferred. I've never liked soda bread of any kind. Mom's donuts, cakes and pies were to die for, but oh well, you can't have it all, including cathead biscuits. Peggy Woods from Houston, Texas on August 26, 2021: I think we all have memories of our mother's good cooking. Thanks for sharing yours. Janis Leslie Evans from Washington, DC on August 26, 2021: This is a yummy hub, Ken. I was pulled in by the photos. God bless our moms for giving us delicious memories of homemade breakfast to fill our bellies, morning or night.

469,Home Made Jackfruit / Kathal Biryani Recipe,food," Pinterest 45 min 30 min 1 hour 15 min Serves 2-3 people It won't be wrong if I say, We all are just ardent biryani lovers. But vegetarians, somehow fall short of alternatives to this popular dish, when it comes to different types of vegetables and vegetarian ingredients. however, there are some meat alternative biryani recipes too and this jackfruit biryani recipe is one such easy and simple mutton biryani alternative. Kathal or Jack fruit biryani is a unique and flavoured rice biryani recipe made with young jackfruit and biryani masala. it is often known as a meat substitute biryani specifically to the famous mutton biryani lovers for its striking similarities. Therefore, Unripe jackfruit is also known as vegetarian meat. When cooked it has a soft meat like texture. It is generally prepared during the early monsoon season of India, as young and tender jackfruit is easily available, during these days. Though not popular worldwide Jackfruit or Kathal biryani is is quite a delicacy in India. Kathal or Jack fruit is a popular vegetable and enjoyed in many parts of India. It is a very good source of dietary fibre so a good option for vegetarians. It is also used as a fruit and to make exotic curries and pickle. They are also deep fried as chips. Jackfruit chips are popular in the southern parts of India. This recipe of Jackfruit / Kathal biryani is like the way my mom makes biryani. Making biryani itself is time-consuming. So my Mom always cook/fry the jackfruit / kathal separately, and assemble it with the layers of rice. Once you assemble the layers, then you can microwave it in pre-heated oven. Peeling jackfruit skin has always been an issue for me, so I always ask the vegetable vendor to peel it. My Mom is a pro at it although. :-) I chopped the jackfruit and kept the seeds aside. If the seeds are tender, you can add them to the biryani. Please note, When chopping the jackfruit/ kathal, please apply oil on your palms, knife and the cutting board. It is not easy to remove the sticky substance present in Jackfruit/Kathal from your hands and other equipment. Applying oil makes the cleaning process a bit easy. Make sure to marinate the jackfruit thoroughly. in addition, while you marinate, you may feel the taste very spicy, but it would reduce gradually once it is properly rested. 6. You may prepare this biryani with tender jackfruit slices along with other vegetables such as capsicum, carrot and beans. in that case, you may have to double the quantity 7. Do not ever try this recipe with sweet or ripe jackfruit slices. it would spoil the taste. 8.I have used ready-to -use biryani masala in this recipe, If ready -to- use biryani masala is not your thing then, you can also make biryani masala at home. Just dry roast green cardamom, black cardamom, cloves, anise seeds, pepper corn and fennel seeds and then blend them altogether in a jar. Sieve it and store it in an airtight container. © 2021 Prachi Srivastava"

471,Rotis for Road Trips,food," Mallika is a content writer and a foodie who loves her native Indian cuisine. She enjoys exploring the cuisine and sharing it with others. Road trip Road trips are fun for those who love travelling and have a good time with family and friends. A Road trip - a self-organised trip and a long-distance journey by road, usually travelled by automobile. There is no particular distance or range to set to qualify for a road trip. It can be a short trip, an adventurous one, a road trip picnic, an excursion, a pilgrimage road trip or a vacation road trip. Planning and carrying food for a road trip is one of the good things to do on a road trip. The food items for a road trip should be fresh for longer hours. Generally, homemade foods, fresh vegetable slices, fruits, sandwiches, nuts, store-bought snacks like chips, chocolates, energy bars, crackers etc., are preferred.  A roti basket From the basket of Indian foods, rotis (Indian bread) is one such food item that is easy to prepare and pack for road trips. Homemade rotis are healthy, yummy and paired with different durable side dishes. Let us see 15 rotis from different Indian regional cuisines that make a good choice for road trips. These rotis will be fresh for at least 10 to 24 hours. Note: 1.Occasionally, ""roti"" is used as a generalised term for Indian bread. In this article, it is used as such a term for different Indian breads discussed here and hence, the title of this article is named creatively. 2. In this article, the general recipe for cooking roti is not given but ingredients for making the doughs are given for reference.  A roti bag Kathi roll packings Preparing roti is one thing and packing them is another thing. The packing should retain freshness and prevent the sogginess of rotis. Homemade chapatis Chapati, also known as roti, is the basic Indian bread and a staple food in North India. In the South, it is a breakfast and regular dinner (meal consumed at night) item. It goes well with many side dishes, both veg and non-veg but a side dish that remains fresh for longer hours is the catch. One such simple and tasty side dish is a spice podi. Its combination with chapati is an easy and classic choice for road trips! Side dish: spicy groundnut or peanut podi  phulkas Phulka is another type of roti that is slightly different from chapati though both are made from wheat flour. In simple terms, it is oil-less, smaller than chapati and round in shape. Generally, the dough for phulka and chapati has wheat flour, salt and water but in masala phulka, some spices are also added for taste. Ingredients for dough: Side dish: spicy coconut podi  Potato roti Potato roti and aloo paratha are different. In aloo paratha, potato masala is stuffed and rolled in the prepared dough but in potato roti, boiled and mashed potatoes are added during the preparation of the dough. The taste of both rotis differs due to the difference in the preparation. Ingredients for dough: Side dish: any pickle   Spinach Paratha Paratha is stuffed chapati, in simple terms. There are several parathas, but two of the most popular ones make a good choice for journeys. They are aloo masala(stuffed potato) paratha and palak (spinach) paratha. The aloo masala is stuffed into the paratha while rolling, whereas the palak masala paste is added to the dough while making the paratha. Both have a shelf life of 24 hours which makes them a tasty choice for road trips. Side dish: Mango pickle  Butter rotis Butter roti is a simple Indian bread that has the usage of butter in the dough, and for cooking the roti as well. Melted butter makes the roti soft, puffy and tasty. The roti is cooked on a low flame, slowly to maintain the softness and puffiness. Ingredients for dough: Side Dish: Simple potato fry or pepper chicken fry   Reshmi garlic roti It is a super soft roti as the name suggests. The distinct ingredients of this roti are garlic, potato and milk, used in the dough and the roti is cooked with ghee or clarified butter. All these ingredients make this roti super soft and yummy with the nutty flavour of white sesame seeds. Ingredients for dough: Side dish: Dry paneer kebab or dry chicken kebab  Mughali roti Originated in the royal kitchens of the Mughal kings, this roti is another yummy food for road trips. Ingredients for dough: Instructions:   Methi thepla Theplas are everyday rotis in traditional Gujarati households. It is one of the apt foods to carry along on a journey as it remains fresh for 2 to 3 days. In the traditional recipe, the curd is used in the dough preparation but for journeys, it is avoided to increase the shelf life. Ingredients for dough: Side dish: Mango sweet pickle or any relish  Layered pickle roti It is a traditional Gujarati recipe with simple ingredients. As the name suggests, the roti is layered with a mango pickle and cooked with oil or ghee. No side dish is required for this roti. Ingredients: Instructions: khakhra Khakhra is a dry roti that resembles a thin cracker. It is a popular, Jain food eaten for breakfast. It is one of the best snacks to be carried on a road trip. The difference between a normal roti and a khakhra lies in the roasting technique used to achieve the crispiness of this roti. After rolling the roti with the required dough, it is cooked on a low flame. Very slow roasting and pressing with a wooden press makes the khakhra crispy like a cracker. Ready-made Khakhras with different flavours are available in the market as well.   Rumali roti frankie Rumali rotis originated in the royal kitchens of Lucknowi nawabs. This roti is an innovative recipe in which a mini rumali roti is made into a Frankie or roll or a wrap. The filling has to be a dry filling such as minced mutton, paneer or egg bhurji to increase the shelf life of the roti. Do not use onions or any raw vegetables and sauces in the Frankie but sprinkle some spicy Frankie masala powder to complement the taste.   Puran poli Puran Poli, also known as bhaksham, bobbatlu, oligalu, holige, obbattu, Puran puri and Vedmi in different Indian languages. It is known as Puran Poli in Maharashtrian cuisine.

Side dish: Thick Sorrel dal any South Indian thick dal. Adai roti Adai is traditionally a dosa prepared with a batter of mixed dals and belongs to Tamil cuisine. Adai roti is an innovative twist to the traditional recipe. In the Adai recipe, mixed dal batter is used but in the roti version, dal flour is used to make the roti. It is also a mixed flour roti like Thalipeeth of Maharashtrian cuisine but the ingredients used are slightly different.

473,"Health Drink Biogreen Pink Lady and Perfect Pink Lady Oat Milk Drink, Which is Better? A Review",food," Mazlan has a passion for health and fitness. He enjoys yoga, cycling, home workouts, and healthy food. Biogreen Pink Lady vs. Perfect Pink Lady Oatmilk. Which of these health drinks is better? greatstuff Both Biogreen Pink Lady and Perfect Pink Lady Oatmilk are delicious health drinks and full of health benefits. Despite the name, these anti-aging drinks are suitable for both men and women. There are also many differences between them. This article reviews all you need to know about Pink Lady Oatmilk and Perfect Pink Lady including their differences, benefits, downsides, and some popular ways to prepare them. I have been drinking Biogreen Pink Lady Oatmilk since 2015 and have seen three major packaging design changes. The current design is more neutral without the drawing of a lady, which put off many men from trying this awesome drink as the name itself is unlikely to attract many men to buy despite their tagline ""Suitable for men and women"". Biogreen also launched another version called Perfect Pink Lady (Perfect), which is designed to boost collagen production. It costs more and comes in three different sizes, the 30g sachets, the 450g and the 650g tin packs. They are all smaller than Pink Lady, which is 800g. So, when GoShop sold the 450g+50g pack at a good promotion price I decided to give Perfect a try. I initially bought a Pink Lady health drink to reduce my cholesterol level. This was advertised in the old packaging and surprisingly you don't see that anymore in the new pack as well as on their website. I guess it doesn't work as there was no improvement to my cholesterol level. To be fair to Biogreen, I wasn't that strict with my diet or exercise either. But I continue to take Biogreen Pink Lady as I saw improvements to my skin especially on my arms and to my complexion. When I tried Perfect, which was supposed to have extra collagen-boosting ingredients, I didn't see any drastic changes. Since Pink Lady Oatmilk (PLO) is cheaper, I just stick to PLO and I also didn't like the taste of Perfect but more on this later. One of the major differences between these two drinks is the ingredients. Biogreen Pink Lady Oatmilk drink has 10 types of unrefined grains, beans, nuts and beetroot, while Biogreen Perfect Pink Lady has 30 types of collagen-boosting plant-based ingredients. With the exception of inulin which is present only in PLO, both of these health drinks have organic oats, mung beans, buckwheat, red lentil, black rice, black soybeans, pine nut, red sorghum, sesame, wheat berries, flaxseed oil, barley, soy protein, beetroot, soy lecithin, nutritional yeast, and sea salt. In addition, Biogreen Perfect Pink Lady has other ingredients which are glucose, brown rice, maltodextrin, red beans, Job’s Tear, millet, purple rice, linden leaf, oligosaccharide fiber, organic spirulina, calcium carbonate, pumpkin seed, Chinese yam, alfalfa, broccoli, burdock root, cabbage, carrot, psyllium husk, black sesame, shiitake mushroom, spinach, and walnut. The additional collagen-boosting plant-based ingredients in Perfect Pink Lady are claimed to give better collagen synthesis for better complexion, improves skin strength & elasticity, and accelerates toxins removal. These different ingredient mixes are also responsible for their unique color and taste. Pink Lady Oatmilk powder is a light pink and Perfect Pink Lady is a brighter pink color, primarily due to beetroots. This is the same for the drink. See photos below for their colors. PLO has a creamier and sweeter taste compared to Perfect, which has an earthier rooty flavor with a slight hint of bitterness, probably from shiitake mushroom, burdock root and black sesame. I prefer the PLO taste anytime but then taste is a subjective matter and you might prefer the earthier flavor. The nicer and tastier Pink Lady also goes well with my concoction for the matcha latte, coffee latte and smoothies. Biogreen Pink Lady Oatmilk is a lighter pink and Perfect Pink Lady Oatmilk is a brighter pink in color There are several benefits of Biogreen Pink Lady Oatmilk and the most visible, from my experience, are good complexion and ease of bowel movement. Other benefits are: Folic acid and inulin which are present in PLO but not in Perfect and with the higher calcium level make Pink Lady Oatmilk the better drink for pregnant women. The extra ingredients in Perfect Pink Lady have the added benefits of: Serving Size: 25g (2 tablespoons)Amount per serving: Calories 99 kcal (5%) Amount per serving and % Daily Values are based on per serving amount on a 2,000 calorie diet (USA).

These are the collagen-boosting nutrients in addition to hydroxyproline, lysine, proline, and iron, etc. to synergistically re-activate collagen production. These nutrients are either not in PLO or in smaller dosages. Comparatively, Perfect Pink Lady nutrition fact is based on 30g or 3 tablespoons while Pink Lady Oat milk is on 25g or 2 tablespoons serving size. When you prorate the daily values, most of the nutrients are of similar values for both drinks except for the following: Anyway, these values for sugar and sodium are comparatively low and it should not worry you. There are not many downsides but you should be aware of the following: When you compare prices at Biogreen Online Store, retail pharmacies, supermarkets, and online marketplace such as Shopee, the price varies by more than RM10. From my experience, it is always cheaper to buy from Shopee or Lazada and if you use Shopee coins and Lazada vouchers, the price is even lower and some sellers even throw in free shipping. Normally, an 800g Pink Lady Oatmilk is about RM55 and a 650g Perfect Pink Lady is about RM77 if you buy from Shopee or Lazada. Biogreen Online Store sells PLO for RM68 and Perfect for RM90. Surprisingly, it is also available on Amazon but the price is very steep. If you are not from the Asian region, then you have no choice but to buy through Amazon. Also, the Pink Lady is 32 servings per package and Perfect is 21 servings. This works out at RM1.72 and RM3.67 per serving for Pink Lady and Perfect Pink Lady, respectively. As you can see, it is cheaper to drink PLO but if you like the taste and need that extra collagen boost, then go for Perfect Pink Lady. There are several ways to enjoy this delicious health drink and here are some of my favorites: My superfood breakfast drink: Biogreen Pink Lady Oatmilk with matcha green tea greatstuff Here are some of the frequently asked questions on Biogreen Pink Lady and Perfect Pink Lady: Yes, it is suitable for children above 12 years old. 1 serving a day provides about 304 mg calcium and can supplement their calcium requirement to strengthen bone and teeth density. Both Biogreen Pink Lady and Perfect Pink Lady have sufficient nutrients and fiber for you to use as a replacement meal. Yes, you can and it is recommended for pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding. 1 or 2 times a day is sufficient for most people. Both are 100% natural and organic products so keep them in a cool, dry place, and away from heat and direct sunlight. Please consume within 8 weeks after opening. Pink Lady Oatmilk and Perfect Pink Lady both benefit the body in different ways. Whether you should buy one or the other depends on your health problems, your budget, and whether you need the extra collagen boosts. But you have to take them on a regular basis to see the benefits. Moreover, both are appetizing healthy drinks and each has a slightly different taste. Personally, I prefer Pink Lady Oatmilk for its creamy taste and it is cheaper to take on a regular basis.

476,4 Easy Strawberry Milk Shake Recipes You Should Try at Home,food," Miriam is an enthusiastic cook. At 13 years old she would bake cakes for her young siblings and parents and they loved them. Strawberry milkshakes are a refreshing drink or dessert. Strawberry milkshakes can be enjoyed at any time of the day. A perfect strawberry milkshake can be made in only a few minutes. How to create strawberry milkshakes is as simple as following simple guidelines. Ingredients Place all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. Frozen sweetened strawberries, cold milk, and vanilla ice cream are blended together with 140g of frozen sweetened strawberries that have been defrosted and sweetened. Ingredients are blended on high for 2 to 3 minutes. Make a cool and creamy concoction by blending together all of the ingredients. If you prefer a chunkier milkshake, blend it for a shorter period of time. The longer you combine it, the smoother it becomes. Two glasses of milkshake should be filled with the mixture. Strawberry milkshakes are made in two glasses with this recipe. Fill two glasses with ice and straws. Serve when the strawberry milkshakes are still cool, they're delicious. Ingredients In a blender, combine the ingredients and blend until smooth. 1 banana, 4strawberries, 3/4cup vanilla ice cream, 1/2 cup milk and a dash of vanilla extract go into a blender. To make a smooth milkshake, combine all ingredients in a blender at high speed. About 2 to 3 minutes should be required to blend. Pour the milkshake into a glass. Garnish. This milkshake should be garnished with some whipped cream. Serve.  Enjoy this cool milkshake as soon as possible while it is still cold. Ingredients To your blender, add 2 cups of vanilla ice cream. Alternately, you can use other fruity ice cream flavours like strawberry to replace some or all of your vanilla. Blend the ingredients at a high speed for 1-2 minutes until all the ingredients combine and become creamy. Garnish.The milkshake should be garnished with a strawberry This recipe can serve two. Serve and enjoy. It is better if taken cool. Ingredients In a blender, combine the ingredients and blend until smooth. Blend together 6 cups of fresh strawberries, 4 scoops of strawberry ice cream, 1/4 cup of whipping cream, 1/3 cup of milk, 2 tablespoons of sugar, and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice in a blender until smooth and creamy. For creamier flavours, add more vanilla ice cream, while adding more other types of ice cream can result in sweeter, fruitier blends. Add your berries to the recipe. Make your shake even more flavorful by adding 2 cups each of strawberries and blueberries. Change the berry proportions to your liking. Add a third of a cup of milk to the recipe. Drinking a thick or solid shake is made easier with milk. Little milk goes a long way, but don't be afraid to add more if the final result is too thick. Strawberries are among the sweetest fruits anyone would love to consume. It is loved by both children and adults. Since they are perishable, they should be used as soon as possible especially if you don't have a refrigerator. Make sure to try many recipes of strawberries especially when they are in season. Do some adventure in this recipe. Instead of using strawberries and blueberry use grapes, apples or any other fruit that you like. Combine with the ice cream of your choice. Perfection and knowledge come through trying new things and practising. Don’t be left out. If you are not a lover of ice cream, try the recipe without ice cream. The only reason why we have used ice cream is that it gives creamy look and enhances the flavour. Try using whipping cream for thickness and creaminess but do not blend for long It is advisable to use the whipping cream after you have blended the other ingredients.

477,Delicious and Moist Fruit Cake Recipe,food," Miriam is an enthusiastic cook. At 13 years old she would bake cakes for her young siblings and parents and they loved them. 1 cup (227 g) unsalted butter 1 cup (200 g) light brown/brown sugar 3 large eggs 3 tablespoons brandy plus extra for brushing the cake 1 lemon 1 cup mixed dried fruit (such as raisins, sultanas, currants, dried cranberries, nuts (if you love nuts)) 2 cups (240 g) all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon (5 mL) baking powder 1/4 teaspoon (1.25 mL) salt Place the butter, light brown sugar, and dark brown sugar in a bowl, and mix with a wooden spoon with hand. If you have a stand mixer, place them in the bowl and beat the ingredients. Beat the ingredients until the mixture is light and fluffy. Make sure your butter is not completely cold and hard or this will make beating difficult. Include the eggs. Include one of the eggs and beat the blend until the egg is consolidated. Include the other egg and beat the blend once more. Include the ultimate egg and mix until combined. Add the brandy, lemon juice. Mix the blend until these fixings are altogether combined. Fold in the mixed fruits and nuts using a spatula. Please not beat or stir the butter, fold the fruits into the butter in order to maintain the volume of the butter Put the flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl. Mix them for 20 seconds to totally combine the raising agent. Fold the dry fixings into your mixture. Include the dry flour into the wet butter. Take cake 1 baking tin and apply a small amount of oil at the bottom and on the sides. You can also use a loaf tin to bake this cake. Dust some flour on the baking tin. Dusting is important; it helps the margarine not to melt on the cake. An alternative is the paper lining. This process ensures that the cake does not stick on the baking tin. Pour the mixture into the baking tin. Preheat oven to 180o Celsius (356F) for 5 minutes. Set the upper and lower heat so that the heat is well distributed. Put the cakes in the oven and bake for approximately one hour. To identify if the cake is ready, take a toothpick or a knife and insert it at the centre of the cake. If the knife or toothpick has some dough on its sides, the cake is not ready, otherwise, the cake is ready. Once the cake is well cooked, remove from the oven and put it on a rack to cool. Wait until it has cooled completely. After the cake is fully cooled, brush it with some brandy and cover it with foil paper. Refrigerate it. If the cake will be used after one month, make sure you brush with brandy every week refrigerating after every rubbing with brandy and cover it with another foil paper. An alternative to brandy is rum. Any rum will work well. If you want to get that rich and deep taste of the cake, soak the dried fruits in alcohol for three days to one week, or even longer. The more you soak the dried fruits, the richer the taste. The other way to brush the alcohol is to put small holes in the cake and pour a small amount of alcohol so that it soaks through the holes. Cover it with foil paper and refrigerate it. This cake can be served without any frosting. It is just delicious the way it is. In case you want to ice you can use butter/margarine, whipping cream or cover it with fondant. In a bowl, pour the whipping cream and whip until it produces stiff peaks. If using a hand mixer, set a low speed. The best way of knowing that the mixture has stiff peaks is when you remove the mixture and cream holds its shape. Add dry milk and confectioners’ sugar and fold gently until all the ingredients are well mixed. There are also whipping creams that are sugary, use them instead of adding confectionary. The only thing you have to do is to whip it until you get the stiff peaks and apply it to your cake. For the buttercream, you will need butter, confectioners sugar and a tablespoon of lemon juice (or vanilla, strawberry flavour or any other flavour that you like). Mix the ingredients until light and fluffy. This content reflects the personal opinions of the author.

480,Do Restaurants Allow Someone to Wash Dishes as Compensation If They Cannot Pay?,food," You better have my money or go wash my dishes, Sounds good to me It’s funny how some people sort of just veered off and answered it differently. Here’s the exact answer to this question: NO. If you noticed people mentioned here in Quora, you’ll form the same conclusion in that Now, we get in to the interesting part. What about high end restaurants or bills that comes out to be large amount? Can you barter service in exchange for the bill to be forgiven? I worked in restaurant as a kid. Let’s just say that washing dishes are NOT the only assignment you will get if you got dish washing duties. You will need to come in early to prep the ingredients, clean the glass on windows and doors, mop/sweep the floor, be a buser for the tables, and clean the restrooms as well. All those are part of the job along with washing dishes. Oh, did I mentioned that majority of those guys who do those jobs are very desperate and often took less pay than usual? That’s the secret about a job like this no one wants to talk about, it’s one of the ways restaurants do to hire to save the costs as the labor force in each state varies and eat up the small margins they tend to have. Let’s say you went into this restaurant that probably is about $$ on TravelAdvisor. You ordered a cocktail drink ($14 in my area these days), an app ($10), a main ($15-$20), and a dessert ($8). You gulp this in delight and wants to beg off from paying that big amount and see if you can worked the kitchen to wash dishes. More likely it’s going to happen is that the restaurant will want you to call someone up and asked if they can come in to square the bill for you. More likely they want cash. No way they want to take a credit card over the phone if your friend/family will reverse it later. You can put something down as a collateral and go out get your wallet to pay for if you were missing a wallet. But if you didn’t have the means to pay and wants to barter, then it’s a moot point for that instance. If you looked like a less fortunate, the staff would have spotted you and be cautious with you before you are shown to the table. Profiling at its worst. If you looked like you can pay, but just don’t want to, the restaurant would just want to call the cops if you racked up a bill that is in high amount for a per person average. Here’s a story of a guy who skipped paying restaurant bills and left his date to pay for it. LA's Infamous Dine-And-Dash Dater Sentenced to 120 Days The last resort is always calling a cop to give you a citation. Once they record you for non-payment, restaurant will attempt to recoup in either an invoice in the mail to you or filing a small claim based on the info you gave to the police. Either way, a restitution would need to be made if the charges are ever filed. Most restaurant already have a guy that is willing to do a lot more and get paid way less than your meal. No way they want to give you the service for that night and you want to do only a portion of a job for that. You are in better luck to try the first two examples I put above. According to many users who posted up their answers in Quora…. you’ll get free food as they will feel your pain. As in for the higher end restaurants, if you are lucky to get in on a table, no way will they settled. They want their money.

I got out some seasoned salt, but never used it. Later, I fried some in butter in a frying pan, on one side until they were browned. That was good as well. Small pods See glistening?

484,When and Why Do We Drink Coffee?,food," Maya is a writer who aspires to change the world through her work. Coffee is, in fact, the world's second most popular beverage, trailing only water in popularity. Contrary to popular belief, your daily cup(s) of coffee provides more than just a pick-me-up. It also appears to be quite healthy, owing to its high levels of antioxidants and beneficial nutrients. According to studies, coffee drinkers have a lower risk of several serious diseases. Coffee has several health benefits.  Drink a cup of black coffee about an hour before working out to improve results by 11-12%. Caffeine causes an increase in the amount of adrenaline in your blood. Adrenaline, your body's ""fight or flight"" hormone, aids in physical preparation.  Coffee contains magnesium and potassium, which help the human body use insulin by regulating blood sugar levels and decreasing your desire for sugary snacks and treats.  Caffeine helps fat cells break down body fat and use it as fuel during exercise.  Caffeine consumption in moderation (1-6 cups per day) improves concentration and mental alertness.  Coffee drinkers have a 25% lower overall risk of premature death than non-coffee drinkers, according to studies.  According to one study, coffee can reduce the risk of prostate cancer in men by 20% and endometrial cancer in women by 25%. The study's participants drank four cups of coffee per day. Caffeine may also help to prevent basal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer.  Moderate coffee consumption (2–4 cups per day) has been linked to a lower risk of stroke.  According to research, drinking coffee regularly lowers the risk of Parkinson's disease by 25%. Coffee has been shown to stimulate the part of the brain affected by Parkinson's disease.  Coffee contains a high concentration of antioxidants, which act as little warriors in your body, fighting and protecting you from free radicals.  Caffeine impairs glucose tolerance and lowers insulin sensitivity, lowering your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.  Caffeine levels in the blood have been linked to a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. It is also beneficial in the prevention of dementia.  Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, causing an increase in the production of mood-enhancing neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline.

485,Salted Egg Recipe: Spicy Salted Egg Cornflakes,food," The author is an engineer by profession and a lover of food. In his free time, he likes to tinker around in the kitchen. Salted Egg Recipe: Spicy Salted Egg Cornflakes greatstuff If you love snacking while watching TV then try this salted egg recipe, the addictive spicy salted egg cornflakes. These are corn flake cereals that are buttered with salted egg yolk powder, curry leaves, and spicy bird's eye chili for an amazing munch. This easy salted egg cornflake recipe uses only five ingredients: There are several versions of this recipe where sugar, evaporated milk, and dried chilis (in addition to the bird's eye chili) are added to the ingredients. I prefer not to use sugar and evaporated milk for this recipe as I don't like the sweet taste of these combinations to the salted egg. I also don't use dried chilis as it is already hot and spicy with just the bird's eye chili. What is a Salted Egg? To the uninitiated, a salted egg is a duck egg that is preserved by soaking in brine. It is then packed in damp salted charcoal. It is not to be confused with century eggs, which are different in look and taste. Get all the ingredients and cooking utensils ready for cooking: Fry curry leaves with butter on low heat for about 3 minutes, then add the finely chopped red bird's eye chili (or chili flakes or dried red chili). Continue frying for about 1 minute. Add the salted egg yolk powder and mix well until you get a nice creamy sauce. Some of the powdered salted eggs tend to be lumpy during packaging. Mix well to bring this lumpy salted egg to powdery form. Once the creamy salted egg sauce has thickened, remove the frying pan or wok from the heat and add in the cornflakes. Stir, making sure the cornflakes are all well coated. Spread these coated cornflakes evenly on the baking tray that was lined with parchment paper (bakery paper). Bake at 350ºF for about 8 minutes or until it is slightly golden brown. This will crisp up the cornflakes and make them crunchy. Let it be thoroughly cooled before storing it in an air-tight jar. 20 min 13 min 33 min 8 servings (1 serving if you're addicted to it!)

The yolk, which is generally used in most salted egg recipes, tastes like a salty mashed roasted chestnut. You cook them as per the above recipes, which usually use only the yolk. Both, the white and yolk of salted eggs are eaten with rice congee, nasi kerabu (Herb Rice), and in your normal rice as part of the side dishes. This is available in most dry and wet markets. If you live outside East Asia and Southeast Asia, you can buy salted eggs from most Asian grocery stores or buy online. Some of these salted eggs are coated with black charcoal paste. Remove the charcoal coating by gently rubbing it off. Then, wash and dry the egg. Based on this 'Comparative Study on the Nutritional Value of Pidan and Salted Duck Egg', salted duck eggs are rich in proteins, lipids, unsaturated fatty acids, and minerals. These proteins, lipids, and ash contents are greatly enhanced during the salting process with no losses of amino acids. Phospholipids and cholesterol contents are lower in salted duck egg yolk hence, it is a nutritionally rich alternative to duck egg products. Despite the good benefits of salted eggs, the downside is their high sodium content. Per serving of salted duck egg has 1265mg of sodium**. This is because the duck eggs are salted in a high-salt-concentration brine solution that gives a higher salt content in the egg white. High sodium can lead to increased blood pressure. It is advisable not to consume salted eggs if you are pregnant due to their higher sodium level. This can cause water retention and higher blood pressure. If you crave it, do a less salty version at home but take it in moderation. If you keep the eggs in a sealed container, they can last between 1 to 2 months. Based on 1 serving of salted duck egg, it contains 130 calories**. **SOURCE: Nutritionix Be warned. This savory snack is dangerously addictive and your 8 servings can be consumed in just 1 serving.

486,"You Best Beware ""Food Wasters""",food," Many  of my hubs originate from my teenage years and those past twenty. Some pieces were funny. Some were sad,.Some were down right scary. See what a ""Food Waster"" did? I am 67. No apologies . But I am going to share with you one of, if not ""the"" most-arrogant situation that a person can do in any restaurant. This imaginary couple enjoys a great meal, or some of it. When the meal is over, the imaginary couple leaves with almost two full plates and leaves. Without looking anything but remorse. I know. I've witnessed this slap-in-the-face of all chefs, fry cooks, and pizza restaurants in our land. The thing is this: intentionally-leaving half the food that was ordered in the beginning. The people who do this cold-hearted action slide down to the cashier where we hear her/him ask, ""was everything alright?"" ""Sure. Great."" replies the couple who left their food on their plates and didn't even look at what others were doing. The ""I don't care Beast"" has once again reared its vulgar head to cause problems among innocent citizens--who were once humble-hearted, hard-working people. Not now. No, siree. These people drag their self-importance into this fine restaurant,order great food and eat a few bites. What else is this besides waste? This half-eaten pizza could have went to a hungry person. Enough small talk. I am not at a high-end society shindig where the hosts urge the guests to enjoy their spacious food buffet. The foods range from America to West Germany. What a scene. I am the only guest who eats his fill and heads to the refreshment area and grab a cup of my hot, black coffee. Then I see it. Over by the table where I have just left, I see this very rich people (the mom is still wearing her full-length mink coat) who are nibbling their food. Then they leave over half of their food, wipe their cloth napkins sewn with gold threads, and go to the bar for a martini or two. Knowing what I have just seen, I wager that they only take one sip of their martini and then set their crystal glasses (half full) on the bar and slide off for the elevator. I said all of that to say this: enough talk. Time to get down to business. I am going now to tell you what happens when those ""food wasters"" are doing when they leave food on their plates and drinks half-drank. This might blow your mind. ⦁ When ""food wasters"" leave food on their plates, they force the already-overworked staff to clean more thus not making it to their hot dates that they have made six months ago or some of this burdened-staff are divorced and are finally going to visit their children for half an hour. All because food was wasted. ⦁ ""Food wasters"" do not take the time to think about how much food that the restaurant buys each week and the costs are staggering. All because food is wasted more and more. No wonder that there are so many restaurants that have shut-down, thanks to this greedy act of just eating a few nibbles of their food.Hey, ""food wasters,"": if you are working to lose weight, then do not go to a fine restaurant and waste good food just because of your vanity. ⦁ When ""food wasters"" walk toward the door of their restaurant, this can be seen as a social symbol of being rich and popular. ""I bet that couple are loaded and do not even like food,"" says a hard-working, middle-aged couple where the husband has worked for 70-hours for weeks and finally got one night off to take his wife out to eat. ⦁ Each time that the ""food wasters"" walk through the door of their restaurant, yo can almost hear whispers from the kitchen staff say, ""I knew it. There they are, the snobbish ""food wasters. I bet that they will waste an entire plate full of food tonight."" ⦁ To further rub the faces of us commoners, the ""food wasters"" think their cute habit of ordering expensive food from the menu, then nibble on it, then leave is hilarious. I ask, to whom? Not me. And not any family of commoners or kitchen staff. ⦁ Wasting food gives the waitress and waiters a psychological problem that says, ""that food that is wasted says that our food is not good enough to eat. Wonder if my therapist can help me?"" Now that you've heard what's wrong with ""food wasters,"" now listen to what we, the food-loving citizens can do to combat these non-caring diners. ⦁ Have respect for ourselves, the food that we order, and eat it all. Simple. To the point. Nothing hard about this tip. ⦁ Even if our food order is not that perfect, do not make a nasty scene. Whisper to the waiter/waitress and they will fix it. They had rather whisper from us than be embarrassed in the restaurant and causing us to hate our guts. ⦁ If we love our food, then take your time. Do not gulp it down like a hungry wolf. Waiters/waitresses love this and they will tell the managers that they cooked a food that you love and those that you tell making new customers for the restaurant. ⦁ We need to offer warm compliments to other diners about how they are ""cleaning their plates."" Restaurants love that. And the final word to ""food wasters,"" that includes me, if I have eaten breakfast between 10 and 12 a.m., then my wife wants to have an early dinner, I can pretty much say that I will not be that hungry, so instead of wasting my good food, Iwill have the small house salad and eat all fit. The waiter/waitress and kitchen staff love how I respect their food and work and my wife loves it for she thinks that I am trying to lose weight. No wait! A second final word that will work but only without lawyers and the EPA. A few years ago, there was a famous fast-food chain located in my hometown. As part of my newspaper career, I got to be friends with the manager and staff. One night while I was on the second shift (I sound like Sgt. Joe Friday), I visited this restaurant for a cup of coffee. But as I waited for my order, I happen to notice that the restaurant crew were dumping brand-new, uneaten food--chicken, burgers, French fries. I was appalled. I had to ask. The cashier told me that this, the tossing of food was a restaurant policy due to the local health dept. and the EPA who would arrest anyone who helped themselves to this good food. I had to reply, really? Really, replied the cashier. Then I had to ask this last question: what if a few homeless, jobless people were to take the food to eat to keep from starving? The cashier whispered, this is a great idea, but you know how the government works. Anything that is good and sensible, cannot work.But I didn't forget my idea. And yes, Big Brothers, this idea WOULD work! It's a win, win, win situation.

If there is no way to refrigerate the leftovers, what is left on the plate must of necessity be tossed. We take leftovers home in what used to be called ""doggie bags"" if dining locally.  Because of the pandemic, we have not done much of that in a long time. What bothers me most is when people dine at buffets, help themselves, and then leave loads of food on their plate.  That is wasteful!  They should not take so much in the first place if they are not hungry enough to eat it. BRENDA ARLEDGE from Washington Court House on August 16, 2021: I imagine it does trickle down like that. I myself am not a big eater, but i take leftovers home to eat another day. In the bigger cities you can find a homeless person that will gladly take your leftovers."
487,Healthy Drinks: 5 Types of Healthy Juices You Must Try at Home,food," Miriam is an enthusiastic cook. At 13 years old she would bake cakes for her young siblings and parents and they loved them. Ingredients Method Wash the bananas and peel them. Cut into four pieces. Put the cut bananas and the peanuts in a blender. Add some water for easy blending. Do not put a lot of water, put 1/4 of a cup. Blend for 1 minute. Put a small amount of the juice in a cup and taste if the nuts are fully blended. The juice is good even if the peanuts are not fully broken. If you love that crunchy feeling in your mouth do not blend the nuts until they are fully broken. If you love smooth juice then blend a few more seconds until you get the smoothness that you desire. Bananas are very sugary, there is no need of adding honey or sugar. Serve the juice immediately since bananas tend to change their colour when exposed to air for some time, if you love ice, dip some ice cubes in the glass of juice and enjoy. Alternatively, blend the ice cubes together with the banana and peanuts. For this recipe put two pieces of ice cubes. If you are making juice for many people, multiply the recipe by two or three. The recipe I have given is for two people. If you love peanuts, try doubling the peanuts or triple and see the outcome. You will love this recipe. Ingredients Method Wash the mangoes. Peel them and cut them into small pieces. Put them in a blender together with the peanuts. Blend until you get a smooth consistency for one minute 30 seconds. Serve with ice cubes if you love them. You can also refrigerate for 30 - 40 minutes before serving. Mango juice can stay frozen if you do not want to serve it immediately. Try another recipe by adding/reducing the number of peanuts, and see how the results will be. If you want it sweeter, add a tablespoon of honey. Enjoy. Ingredients Method Wash the mango and avocado. Peel them and cut them into small pieces. Put them in a blender together with the peanuts. Blend until you get the right consistency.  The reason why we have added mango is to give it some sweetness. If you need it sweeter, add a tablespoon of honey or sugar. We do not encourage the use of sugar so use it sparingly. Ingredients Method Wash the carrot and the mango. Peel the mango and carrot. The carrot can also be used without peeling. This depends on you. Cut the carrot into small pieces. Blend it first until you get a smooth consistency. Add some water for easy blending. Put in a separate jug and sieve. If you like you can use it without sieving, but if you want a smooth juice sieve it first. Take the mango and the peanuts and blend with some water. Blend until smooth or if you love it crunchy do not blend for long. Once you get the right consistency, add the carrot juice and blend to mix the well. Serve it immediately or refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving. Try to play with the recipe and have more fun experimenting. Put some honey or sugar to get the sweetness you desire. Enjoy. Ingredients Method Wash the pawpaw and the avocado. Peel them and cut them into small pieces. Put them in a blender and blend for 45 seconds or one minute if you want a smooth consistency. Serve immediately or refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving. Try experimenting with more peanuts and enjoy the journey of keeping healthy. Blending time depends on the type of blender. There are powerful blenders whereby you just blend in 30 seconds and the work is done. Study your blender and try to estimate how much time your blender gets to get a smooth Consistency. Honey is usually preferred to sugar. Honey has health benefits to the body, unlike sugar. If there is no access to honey, try to use the unprocessed sugar.

Although there are several tell tales surrounding the consumption of coffee and these myths vary from region to region, most of these are just woven facts and still others hold a partiality of truth. My love affair with coffee is not a matter of days or months, it actually started when I stepped into my professional life and the stress was simply driving me mad. It was then my colleague (who later became a very dear friend) offered me that first cup of coffee which I had in her office. And the rest is history. Since then, without fail, I used to kick my day with a cup of hot steaming coffee. I am not a 3, 4 or more cups of coffee addict, but I never fail to relish my first cup of coffee before the onset of my daily routine. You must be wondering now why I love coffee so much. And if its humanly possible to be that crazy for a beverage? Coffee makes me happy and I think it is enough of a reason in itself but still here a few top reasons why I have a heart for coffee. Just grab your cup and read, who knows we might be on the same boat! The aroma of coffee is so refreshing; it is surely the best smell worth waking up for. It is so heartwarming and undeniably good that I really can’t imagine to break my day with anything else. And I bet this morning ritual is quintessential to turn me from a lusty Berber to a civilized being, much like the memes you might have come across. I cannot deny that I am addicted to its aroma, just like I can’t get enough of its taste. The heavenly and distinct taste of coffee is no doubt a treat for your tastebuds. This taste is different for every coffee drinker because of the vast variety of coffee flavors, roasts and varieties available in the market. Each variety has its own appeal and every sip is so enriched that anyone can barely hold back. I appreciate it without sugar and creamers, what’s your preference? Flavored coffees are no less a treat, creativity is at its peak. If you haven’t tasted yet, give your tastebuds a delightful twist and try French vanilla, hazelnut and caramel; you surely won’t regret it! It’s truly addictive. Coffee always comes first. I not only love coffee for its taste and mesmerizing aroma, but also because the caffeine in it stimulates my energy levels and helps me to get through a really stressful day. It helps to cross the activation energy barrier and puts me into gear. It keeps me focused and more productive. Yes! It is cent percent true that coffee can relax my nerves and help me to wind down like nothing. Its smell, its taste and its soothing effect is absolutely enticing. Researches have proved the calming effect of coffee on one’s nerves and hence aids in creativity and mental activity. So, if you are also having a tough time, give yourself a break! Just sit back, relax and enjoy the warmth of your hot coffee. You deserve it! Coffee beans are cultivated in various diverse climatic regions around the world. I have spent a significant time of my life in Saudi Arabia and walking in the bazars, the earthly smell of freshly ground coffee beans was simply beyond one’s comprehension. From the farms of Brazil to Colombia to Ethiopia, coffee beans have a unique cultural identity which not only fail to invite you but also speaks for itself. Conversations and coffee go hand in hand. Coffee and conversation are the best partners. Ever had a coffee date with your friend? How easy it is converse over the table relishing the taste of your favorite coffee? What an absolute relief; idle talks, laughs over lame jokes and hearty chats! Not only this, but coffee is also a partner during many business meetings and formal gatherings. Coffee creates an environment of acceptance and understanding that surrounds the drinkers and helps in free-flowing conversations. So, among the myriad reasons to love coffee, these are a few ones. The number of people drinking coffee is increasing at an exponential rate every day and everyone is adding their own reasons to the list. Love, live, smile and add some shine to your day with a cup of coffee."
492,Moist Red Velvet Cake Recipe,food," Miriam is an enthusiastic cook. At 13 years old she would bake cakes for her young siblings and parents and they loved them. Icing Add the eggs, one at a time and mix well every time you add an egg. There is no problem if you add all the eggs at the same time, make sure you mix well. Preheat oven to 180o Celsius (356F) for 5 minutes. Set the upper and lower heat so that the heat is well distributed. Put the cakes in the oven and bake for approximately one hour. To identify if the cake is ready, take a toothpick or a knife and insert it at the centre of the cake. If the knife or toothpick has some dough on its sides, the cake is not ready, otherwise, the cake is ready. Once the cake is well cooked, remove from the oven and put it on a rack to cool. Wait until it has cooled completely. Frosting does not work well with the warm cake. In a large bowl, mix butter and sugar. Mix until light and creamy. You can use a wooden spoon and mix with your hand or an electric mixer, both will work well. Mix the dry ingredients (flour, salt, baking soda) and add to the butter/margarine mixture. Add vanilla, and buttermilk beat to a smooth consistency. Pour one teaspoon vinegar which helps in giving a nice subtle tanginess. Stir the mixture well to ensure that the flour and butter mix well. Do you need more colour? Add a few drops of food colour. Do not worry about where to get buttermilk. Make one yourself. Alternatives to buttermilk Make a paste of cocoa and the red colour and then add to the butter/margarine and sugar mixture. A paste will ensure that the colour is well mixed in the buttercream. Take cake 1 baking tin and apply a small amount of oil at the bottom and on the sides. Dust some flour on the baking tin. Dusting is important; it helps the margarine not to melt on the cake. An alternative is the paper lining. This process ensures that the cake does not stick on the baking tin. Pour the mixture into the baking tin. Use cream cheese and butter at room temperature. This helps during whipping when it is soft enough. In a bowl, whisk/beat the butter and cream cheese until light and fluffy. Add the confectioners’ sugar. Add vanilla and whip until creamy. If the mixture is too thick add several teaspoons of cold milk and mix well. Cut the cake into layers (you can cut so that you have three pieces of cake). Set the cake. Apply the frost in one cake layer, stack another layer and apply the frosting. Finally stack the last layer and frost it covering the whole cake. Do not frost too thin, make the layer of frost thick. The cake is ready to eat. Enjoy. This cake can be served with fruit juice, hot or cold tea, alone without any other accompaniment, or any other drink according to preference. Red Velvet cake is great for outdoor parties such as birthday parties, baby showers, weddings, graduation, anniversaries or any other important occasion.

Kadi patta chai RAJAN SINGH JOLLY Kadhi patta or curry leaves not only make the food tastier they offer a wide range of amazing health benefits as well, whether you make its tea, decoction, drink its water or use them in cooking. The curry leaf plant, Murraya koeniigi is very easy to grow at home from a sapling and hardly requires any maintenance once it takes root and sprouts new shoots. It is quite hardy and pest-free. Curry leaves contain some unique plant compounds which are the reason they offer some amazing health benefits, among them are, reduction in weight and fat, strengthening the hair roots, improving skin health and anti-ageing benefits, relieving digestion-related issues, reducing stress and calming the mind, detoxifying the body and more. We will now see how this curry leaf tea, which is also called curry leaf kashayam in South India and curry leaf chai in the Hindi speaking belt of India, is prepared. For information, structured water is copper-treated water. To make structured water fill an earthen pot with water and place a copper plate in it. Let this water sit overnight. In the morning remove the copper plate and use the structured water. Structured water is bacteria and virus-free water with the correct ph and heavy metals and plastic nanoparticles removed to the bottom of the pot. For this reason, draw water from the top of the pot and discard the water when one-fourth of it is left then clean the pot and copper plate. The copper plate needs to be scrubbed with lemon and salt to remove the oxidation coating and this process is repeated daily. 5 min 10 min 15 min 1 serving © 2021 Rajan Singh Jolly"

500,Tribal Food- Let us Discover Health Secrets of Tribals of India through their Food Habits,food," A Science Teacher, Content creator, constant Learner and a Mother. Adivasi(adi- origin, vasi-dweller) or tribals are regarded as the foremost dweller of India. They are the indigenous people of India. They are spread across India.  The Constitution of India has recognized these tribal communities of India under ‘Schedule 5’ of the constitution. Hence, the tribes recognized by the Constitution are known as ‘ Scheduled Tribes’. Although they are considered primitive, uncivilized, they exhibit great community feeling, rich culture, language, authentic food to name a few. You might wonder what tribals eat? Tribals rely on vegetarian and non-vegetarian food like us. Vegetarian foods consist of edible leaves, roots, vines, wild fruits, mushrooms ,flowers, tubers, yam, honey While wild rabbits, pigeons, porcupines, field mice, wild boars, water snails, snakes, red ants form non-vegetarian food. The food is simple yet flavourful, less oily with minimum or no spices, rustic earthy flavours, and nutritious. You will be surprised to know, the tribal food is rich in micronutrients like calcium, protein, carbohydrate, iron, vitamins, and folic acid. Let’s dive into their platter and see what they have to offer. Leaves of plants like (Ficus geneculata) locally called phutkal are plucked from the trees by the woman folks. The main concern is Ficus geneculata are seasonal and people are not aware of it's health benefits. Young leaves and buds are either cooked and eaten or sundried for weeks. They are powdered and added to pulses, stew or make into curries to enhance their nutritional value. They are even pickled to be consumed throughout the year The green leaves are rich in calcium, iron, zinc, and dietary fibre. They are believed to have antioxidant properties and are antimicrobial. They also act as a home remedy for ailments like diarrhoea, leucorrhoea, urinary tract infection, vomiting, and jaundice. Jute flower ( Corchorus olitorius) locally called Sanei phool is widely eaten in West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Bihar. They too are seasonal in nature. When plastic and polythene bags were not common, packing was done in gunny bags and sacks made of patsan or jute. The leaves of jute plants are rich in vitamins A, C, and E. The flowers are plucked and either eaten fresh or sundried and stored for a long time. Flowers can be cooked into curry by adding potatoes and spices to add flavour. In ( Moringa oleifera), locally called munga, sahjan, both flowers and leaves are consumed either cooked fresh or sundried and powdered. Moringa is believed to have therapeutic properties. It is rich in iron and is a great laxative. They are believed to cure oedema, stomach ailments, fight bacterial infections, manage hypertension, nourish skin and hair. The moringa leaves are sun-dried, powdered and made into a delicious stew by the tribals. Moringa flowers- They bear yellow flowers which when plucked and cooked have a robust flavour. They too are sun-dried and stored for later use. Pumpkin flowers (Cucurbita) locally called Kaddu, is an edible flower. Fresh pumpkin male flowers are plucked and made into fritters. They are a rich source of vitamin B9 and are believed to increase sperm count and quality in men. and vitamin A enhances immunity and improves vision. Shoots of bamboo plants are one of the favourites of the tribal population. Tender bamboo shoots are locally called Karil. They are cooked and made into curries or simply saute'd and eaten. When shoots are cut and fermented, they are called Sadhana pickles (bamboo shoot pickles). Bamboo shoots are sundried and cut into pieces and named harrua. Harrua can be enjoyed by mixing into a paste of roasted tomato, onion, chillies, mustard oil, etc. They are rich in nutrients like protein, carbohydrates, fats, minerals, fibres, etc. They are low in calories and rich in dietary fibres. The health benefits include weight loss, manage cholesterol levels, and improve the immune system. They also exhibit anti-inflammatory properties. Come monsoon, and there is a flood of mushrooms in the jungle. Tribals relish wild mushrooms a lot. They are aware of all the places where mushrooms can thrive-- be it loamy soil, streams and creeks, dying trees, burn sites,under the soil, etc. For example, Baans khukhri (bamboo mushroom) are edible wild mushrooms seen only near bamboo shoots. They grow in plenty in the monsoon. They are considered the tastiest of the lot. Jamun khukhri (Indian blackberry or Java plum mushroom), is an edible wild mushroom. The mushroom doesn't look appealing to the eyes but ranks high in the tribal food list. They grow abundantly in monsoon and is known to be a rich source of protein and found only in forest under the Jamun tree.( Syzygium cumini). Rugra (puttu)- This mushroom is indigenous to Jharkhand. They look like puffballs or small camphor balls, rough-textured, with an outer shell with soft yolk black or white interior. Rugra grows soon after the first showers of rain hit the thirsty soil followed by 3-4 days of sunshine and humidity. They grow under the soil in the canopies of sal trees. They are collected by tribal women, washed properly, and then cooked into curry. It is rich in protein, vitamins, minerals. They are good for the heart and diabetic patients. Tribals prefer plant produce but at times wild animals are also hunted for flesh. The animal is hunted with axe or bow and arrow, roasted and cut into small pieces and cooked in community kitchen and enjoyed by the people. The tribals hunt field mice, snakes, wild boars, wild rabbits during special occasions like marriage, the birth of a child and even death. Nowadays, as hunting or poaching is restricted, fewer native people indulge in killing wild animals now. Tribals are good at skills like using bow and arrow, catapult, axe, etc. A catapult hunts down birds. It would be interesting to know that the tribal kids or adults can hunt down the exact bird they aim for. Such is their precision. Birds like a baby crow, pigeon, sparrow, etc are caught, cleaned, roasted, and then cooked. Pigeon’s meat being hot in nature are believed to cure asthma. These creatures add to the special culinary diet of tribals. Water snails and mussels are reared and fished out, boiled, and later cooked into a meal. Water snails are rich in iron, vitamins, calcium, which improve the immune system. They are believed to make one’s vision sharp and strengthen the eye. Mussels are rich in omega3, DHA, proteins, zinc, folate and iodine.  Red ants locally called demta are seen crawling in trees or land. The ones who reside on trees are considered edible. These ants make nests with the help of big leaves of trees and lay eggs in them. Red ants, eggs and larva are considered a delicacy in tribal cuisine. The ants taste sour due to the presence of formic acid they can be eaten raw but tribals prefer salt and a lot of chillies. They can also be made into fine paste or chutney. To conclude, I would like to say though the food of tribals come directly from forests they make sure they do not exhaust the natural resources for sustenance. They make sure all the food resources, which they obtain from nature, are balanced. For this, they keep planting more trees, rear more animals and protect the wildlife from extinction.

501,Calories in Vs Calories out: Is It Really That Simple?,food," Devon is a CPT and Nutritionist who assists individuals in achieving their goals by employing a balance between mental & physical kinship. Tasty burger and fries If you’ve spent any deal of time looking for ways in which to change your physique you’ve more than likely come across the timeless equation: calories in vs calories out. Specifically, this refers to the energy yield (in calories) from food and drink that we consume on a daily basis and the energy we expend due to exercise, day-to-day tasks, and our resting metabolic rate. In theory, if we eat more than we expend within a specific time frame we will gain weight. And if we spend more than we consume we lose weight. And of course, if we consume the same number of calories, we burn then our weight will remain unchanged. This all sounds simple but the reality is people know this is not the only factor that affects our weight loss/gain/maintenance goals. If it were so, why do we see so much fuss over low vs high glycemic index carbohydrates? Why does it matter whether you eat before bed or not? Why does portion size matter if you’re still getting in the calories you require? And why is macronutrient breakdown so important? These questions, amongst others, lead me to do some research on the subject to find out what some of the most important factors are that we should consider when trying to improve our physical well-being and how we should be applying them to get the most out of what we put into our bodies. Let’s break it down real quick To best understand what causes us to gain and lose weight it helps to instead refer to “weight” as either fat or muscle. As much as the body loves to maintain homeostasis, it is in constant fluctuation in an effort to do so, and the things we put into our mouths affect this never-ending cycle. At any given time, we are either in an anabolic (building up) or catabolic (breaking down) state. These building up and breaking down states can affect both muscle mass and fat. Bearing this in mind we can move on to the factors that affect these different states. The burning question Is “calories in vs calories out” a reliable indicator for assuming weight loss and weight gain? The short answer is yes. If you consistently ingest more energy than you spend, your body will store those extra calories as fat or muscle and you will subsequently gain weight. Conversely, if you do not eat or drink enough calories over time your body will use stored energy reserves and you will ultimately lose weight. However, the body quickly adapts to change and will slow down the rate at which you both lose and gain weight in an effort to keep balance. As you gain weight, energy requirements increase and more energy is needed to gain weight at the same rate. Just as energy requirements decrease as weight decreases and the body goes into survival mode trying to hold on to as much weight as it can. Various other factors like exercise will come into play and have an influence on how these calories are used in the body. For example, if an individual consumes an excess of calories but performs strength training, the extra calories provided will first be used to repair and grow the muscles trained before the body stores them as fat. Typically, an extra 300-500 calories a day above maintenance is required to assist in gaining lean muscle mass. Any more than that and there is the potential for fat gain. To lose fat, an individual should aim to consume 300-500 calories less than what they require for maintenance daily to put the body in a calorie deficit. Any more than this amount and the body may think it is starving and will break down muscle tissue to provide it with the energy it needs. Healthy muscle gain and healthy fat loss are achieved through making small changes and applying them consistently over time. Can I have my cake and eat it? The next conflicting issue that is often debated is that of the glycemic index (GI) of carbohydrates and how they can bring the fat-burning process to a halt. All carbs have a GI and this refers to the rise in blood sugar levels and the subsequent release of insulin to control blood sugar levels after the carb is ingested. Insulin is a powerful hormone that plays a vital role in the metabolism of protein, carbs, and fats, and shuttles nutrients into various cells around the body. The higher the GI of carb, the higher the surge in blood sugar levels and the more insulin that is released to bring levels back down to normal. This insulin spike will quickly deliver nutrients to muscles, the liver, and fat cells but it will also force the body to stop using fat as a fuel source. In addition, it will also store excess carbohydrates as fat once muscle and liver cells have been filled. So if insulin has the ability to store extra fat right after a meal, does “calories in vs calories” out still matter? Again the answer is yes. Ideally, you want to be eating the number of calories you need but you also want to avoid these insulin spikes for various reasons. If you’re going to consume carbohydrates while attempting to lose fat, stick to whole grain, low GI sources like oats, legumes, peas, sweet potato, brown rice, and starchy vegetables. Keeping blood sugar and insulin levels low in conjunction with a calorie-restricted diet will ensure your body is burning fat round the clock. Grilled or fried? Next, we can move on to the quality of the calories we consume. What does this mean exactly? Well, it can refer to a number of things. How is the food prepared? Does it have any additives? What is the macronutrient profile, ie what percentage of its calories are from carbs, protein, and fat? These small considerations can largely affect how our body absorbs and digests these foods, ultimately determining whether they assist our lean mass gains or hinder our fat loss efforts. You see, although a slice of cheesecake and a lean steak may yield the same number of calories, the steak will more than likely contain more protein. And the cheesecake will certainly provide more carbs. So it is important to keep your goals in mind when choosing foods and opt for the options that will provide nourishment for the body. Try to stick to foods that are in their most natural state as possible. Canned foods, baked goods, and other processed items typically do not digest well and don’t provide much nutritional value. All or nothing For many years my approach to nutrition was not the healthiest, and through my years in the bodybuilding industry I have come to learn that many competitive athletes adopt the same approach; an all or nothing approach not a healthy one, and I’ll explain why). During ‘off season’ athletes and seasoned gym rats alike tend to eat a fairly balanced healthy diet most often meeting their macros and consuming sufficient calories for maintenance or growth. But when it comes to dieting, and I’m talking serious dieting to get competition or photoshoot lean, all may start well, but over time as the body realizes it’s taking in far fewer calories than it should whilst you’re pushing harder than usual at the gym, you may become prone to developing an obsessive compulsion with food, constantly thinking about your next bland meal and worse of all being hungry almost all the time. It's not unusual to see post competitors head out to their favorite pizza joint or burger bar and indulge as a reward for their hard work and discipline, but far too often this can start to form a habit. As I’ve seen with myself and many others this binge tends to go on for days if not weeks and in a short space of time one can find themselves back at square one or even worse off. It took me just a few weeks to go from 85kg to 101kg. One can only imagine the mental anguish, frustration, and disappointment after seeing their physique go from township dog shredded to what was technically classified as obese. And as I mentioned this is just all too common in this industry. Armed with a degree in clinical psychology, two certified personal training qualifications, and being a nutritionist, I decided to do some research as to why so many of us are prone to relapsing after a successful diet. For competitive athletes it may be a tad more difficult to regain control after being so lean; the body and mind are constantly fighting to maintain homeostasis and all it wants to do is feed after a long diet. But I have found that the best method of retaining as much of a lean physique as possible after dieting is to simply ease your way slowly into eating the ‘normal’ meals you did before you started dieting. Keep in mind these important factors: Hopefully, these tips help prevent you from landing in the position I found myself in too many a time. Keep an eye on how much you’re eating, track your training intensity and volume, and don’t forget to record how your body responds over time. Until next time, keep grinding!

503,Bemba cuisine,food," Chef Ankit Mathur
Chef Instructor
Culinary Academy of India Zambia has a human history dating back at least 25,000 years. Home to some of the earliest humans, this part of Africa has cradled humanity into today’s species. Ever since humans have been around, sustenance has been vital. Food and cuisine have significantly evolved over the many millennia since, and today’s Zambian food is in striking contrast to the country’s history. People from every culture learn, evolve and adopt different culinary principles and practices, and Zambians are no different. Today, food and culinary heritage are a crucial part of the Zambian identity. Zambia enjoys a rare luxury for African countries - water. As one of Africa’s most prosperous water nations, Zambia has access to more vegetables, fruits, and fish in addition to grains, game, and meats. Zambians also take great pride in their food, and even small events are celebrated with traditional dishes. There are also several socio-cultural trends, like pre-wedding events, where a groom is treated to a buffet of traditional dishes from the bride’s family, which help preserve Zambia’s culinary heritage. Before the colonial period, Zambia was home to several free states. Although colonialization harmed the country, its culture, and traditions, modern Zambia has bloomed into one of Africa’s rising nations. Today Zambia’s contemporary culture features more than 70 ethnically diverse societies. The culmination has created a unique blend of values, norms, materials, traditions, and stories. Zambian Cuisine - In a Nutshell Zambia is known for having a tradition of seasonal diets. The Bemba, a group of people who lived in what is now Zambia, were known to eat what was available that time of year. Although modernity has brought comfort and consistency to food habits, authentic Zambian cuisine marries seasonality into the meal. Bemba meals consisted of a thick millet-based porridge called ubwali paired with umunani, a relish. Umunani was most often a stew where the main protein like meat, fish, insect, or vegetables was the highlight. Usually, only one type of relish was consumed with the ubwali, and the stews were cooked with salt and (at times) groundnuts. Beer and other fermented alcohols were an essential part of Bemba culture, and the people brewed their own beer during the harvest season. Here’s a generalization - the most popular food in Zambia is Nshima. Considered the staple food of the country, Nshima is a thick porridge-like meal made with white maize. The grains are finely ground and served in lumps. Although this may not look like a visual delight, Nshima is a world-famous delicacy. Although Nshima has grown to immense popularity, maize in this recipe is said to have happened during the latter half of the 20th century.  Nshima is entrenched in the diet of Zambia and is prepared at home, at stalls, and by restaurants for lunch and dinner. In traditional communities and towards the countryside, making nshima is a long process that includes drying the maize, sorting the kernels, pounding it, and finally cooking it. The type of relish eaten with nshima is usually hearty and straightforward. Chibwabwa, a popular choice, is a relish made with pumpkin leaves. Other common relishes are katapa, delele kalembula and tente. A niche way to create one such relish relies on cooking with chidulo and kutendela. Chidulo is made with green, leafy vegetables and wild mushrooms, dried and burnt banana leaves, beanstalks, and maize stalks. Kutendela is a prepared peanut powder made of pounded raw peanuts. Ifisahi is another typical food in Zambia. In this recipe, pounded peanuts are mixed with vegetables, sweet potatoes, fish, meat, and kale. Nutritionally rich, Ifishai is considered one of the most satisfying meals in the country. The country also enjoys traditional seasons fruits such as masuku (wild loquats), masau (tastes like sour apples),  and mawuyu (baobab seeds). Other popular recipes include Michopo, roasted meat cooked outdoors on a grill. The meat is usually beef, goat, or game and served with chili, onions, tomatoes, and potatoes. Popularized as drinking food, Michopo is commonly found in bars and pairs exceptionally well with beer. Chikanda, widely called ‘African polony’ is a baked vegetarian item made by combining orchid tubers, ground peanuts, chilies, and baking soda. The result is a product with a meatloaf consistency that can be served either hot or cold. Rounding up the list are Vitumbuwas, or in simple words, Zambian fritters. These fried dough balls are made of flour, yeast, sugar, and water and are usual tea-time snacks. Preparing Zambian Food That said, Zambian cuisine is rooted in simple ingredients and simple processes. The approach to food is to make liberal use of locally available agricultural products and meat sources. Typical crops include maize, sorghum, wheat, millet, rice, sugarcane, and bagasse. Cassava and peanuts are also prevalent in the country. Zambia also has a rich tradition of animal husbandry. All this means diverse ingredients and simple cooking processes. The culinary repertoire of Zambia includes vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods, and this food plays a vital role in the tourism industry as well. The reason I chose this project was due to this diversity. Zambia may not be the most famous culinary nation, but its food belongs up there. The prop and display are inspired by Zambian culture and its fruitful plains. The trees and grass show how open and widespread the Savana Plains are.  The eagle is a prominent national symbol in Zambia; it is on the national flag while also visible on the Zambian court of arms. For this project, I focused on traditional Zambian dishes and derived the recipes from the country’s small villages.

505,Peppers - Sweet and Pickled with Mrs. Wages Mixes,food," I had picked off many of the bigger peppers in the garden one day, green, and my hubby thought that I should have left them on the plant until they got red, because that's the color that they get. Well. I hadn't. I had put them in a plastic box and had put them in the refrigerator to keep them from getting soft and mushy in the meanwhile. Well. We took a trip to the northern part of Minnesota and I took them out of the refrigerator before we left and placed them [covered] on the counter. When we returned, some of the peppers had matured into a reddish tinge. Hallelujah! It was decided that we should slice them and mix some Mrs. Wages mixes together to make them more like peperoncini pickled peppers, since we love the tangy flavor. So he sliced, crossways, and packed a bunch of little pint jars. A canner holds seven quarts at a time, but, when you use pints, they are just a little smaller. It ended up taking eight pints, and one quart. He used the citric acid bottle to smoosh down the peppers so he could get more into the jar. It didn't help me a whole lot when it came time to fill the jars, since peppers float. Darn peppers! Ah, well. Suffer though I must. I added the hot brine, wiped the edges dry, added my lids and rings and proceeded to water bath can them for 10 minutes. So. For the most part, we followed the instructions for water and vinegar on the backs of the packages. You mix the water and vinegar and the packages together, heat to almost boiling then pour into the jars. Since we wanted the peppers to be tangy, we added citric acid to each jar. Plus, we wanted the peppers to be crisp, so we added alum. The actual Mrs. Wages mix contains turmeric which is supposed to make them crisp, but we wanted to make extra sure. neatly fill the jars with peppers, leaving headspace at top. leave a little headspace. mix and cook brine 1/8 teaspoon per jar to make tangy 1/8 teaspoon per jar to make crispy"

509,10 Famous Middle Eastern Foods,food," I am Hina; and I am a highly personalized writer. I like to put a lot of my emotions, experiences and opinions into what I write. The cuisine of any region in the world deeply reflects its culture and has a deep impact on the fabric of its tradition. For the past few years, the Middle Eastern cuisine has gained immense popularity and recognition worldwide. Although it is boldly stated that the Middle Eastern cuisine overlaps greatly with the Mediterranean cuisine, but the former still stands out with its uniqueness based on the special herbs and freshness which makes it a great choice for healthy food lovers. Following is a list of the most popular food items of all times in the Gulf region and their taste is so surreal and savory that will make you lick your fingers! What a feast for eyes and tummy! The rough equivalent of chickpea spread; hummus never fails to serve as the best dip ever. This quintessential Middle Eastern spread is made from mashed chickpeas, blended with garlic, lemon juice and tahini and further spiced up with olive oil, whole chickpeas, parsley and paprika. My personal preference is to have it with pita bread or “khubs” (traditional Arabian bread) but I believe it is a perfect companion to be served with a large variety of savory items like vegies, falafel, broast and the list goes on! Golden, crispy and tasty falafel balls. Ever heard of fritters made from ground chickpeas and fava beans? Oh yes! You guessed it quite right, I am talking of none other than falafel. In the Middle Eastern Gulf countries these serve as the best street food. Spiced with some herbs, these golden crispy savory balls are a perfect snack to munch on. So, next time order a falafel sandwich, while roaming in the bustling bazars of the city and I bet you won’t regret! The sandwich is often wrapped in pita with pickles, vegetables and drooling tahini sauce. Tahini is a condiment made from roasted sesame seeds. The tasty tahini paste is a staple ingredient not only of the Middle Eastern but Mediterranean cuisine. I enjoyed a fair share of it when I lived in Saudi Arabia. It also serves as a major ingredient of hummus and halva and also used as a flavor enhancer in shawarma and falafel rolls. The aroma of freshly baked Za'atar bead is believe me so mouth-watering that you won't be able to resist. Za’atar is an aromatic mixture of various herbs like oregano, thyme and roasted cumin. Passing by a local bakery in any Middle Eastern country, you won’t miss to fall for the heavenly aroma of the freshly baked za’atar bread. Taste it first and thank me later! Sooo cheesy and sweet. Isn't it? Let’s talk about sweet dishes and when it comes to Middle Eastern desserts, Kunafeh is the only name that rings my ears first. This mouth-watering delicacy is a sweet mixture of vermicelli, ricotta cheese and nuts with additional topping of clotted cream or nuts e.g. The Turkish kunafeh will have a rich addition of pistachio. In Saudi Arabia the kunafeh of Saadeddin Pastry never failed to satisfy my sweet tooth. Sumptuous meat grilled on skewers in the food streets is so surreal! The eye-catching sight chicken grilled on a skewer is common in the food streets of almost all Middle Eastern countries. Wrapped in pita bread and spiced with pickles, fries and rich creamy sauces with aromatic herbs, the succulent chicken shawarma is the best treat for your roaring appetite. It is indeed accredited to be the most loved delicacy among all other street foods and you won’t resist the divine taste once you get your hands on it. Surely, it is a must to have! Famous wheat and herb salad of Arabian meze Tabouleh salad is indeed a must to find food item in the mezze (appetizers) in the menus of all famous food centers in the Middle East. The salad is made with fresh, finely chopped parsley, tomatoes, mint, onions, bulgur and seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice and sweet pepper. This refreshing salad is a delightful treat both to your sight and taste buds. It is rich in nutrients and equally satisfying! A heavenly treat for your sweet tooth! This classic dessert has been on the hit list of Arabian cuisine since the Ottoman reign. Baklava is traditionally made with sheets of filo dough and layered with coarsely chopped nuts (hazelnuts, walnuts, or almonds) and enriched with honey or sugar syrup. Baklava is the most served dessert in all formal and non-formal gatherings. Dolma or stuffed vine-leaves is yet another culinary legacy of the Great Ottoman Empire. Dolma are served in a variety of ways, both warm or cold and the stuffing also varies from sumptuous meat to rice seasoned with garlic and olive oil and minimal herbs. The leaves even after they are boiled, retain the lingering wine-like taste. Mandi, basically a Yemeni dish, has now become a staple dish of many Arab countries. It is actually the most sought-after Arabic rice dish. Mandi is traditionally cooked in a tandoor, which gives it a dewy texture and is served with rice with resins and nuts. Mandi serves as the main dish in the coarse meal during special events like weddings and feasts. © 2021 Hina Waqar"
510,Do Away With Dry BBQ Chicken,food," Brining has always been my favorite way to make a usually dry meat like chicken into a juicy marvel for everyone to enjoy. Barbequed chicken has long been a staple for many tailgates and backyard cookouts. When done right it's a wonderful thing, when wrong, well, its like chewing leather. I'm going to show you a sure fire way to make a juicy chicken everytime, how to brine. A big problem is that chicken doesn't come medium or rare for health reasons, this means its gotta be well done, but too long on the grill sucks out all the juices of the meat. But it doesn't have to be that way, with brining you can lock in the juices to keep it from drying up when its done. Brining is simple, you soak the meat of your choice ( in this case chicken) in a solution of water, kosher salt, sugar and herbs for anywhere from 1 hour to 24 hour. In a nutshell brining locks in the meats juices. For most of the country BBQ season is no longer just the summer months. In fact many Americans now barbecue year round, enjoying juicy steaks and tender pork chops. If your a first time briner or an old pro, this recipe will give you an edge at any gathering. Take: 1 quart cool water 3/4 cup kosher salt 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1 chicken (3 to 3 1/2 lbs) cut into eight pieces, rinsed then patted dry, or 2 spilt chicken breasts ( bone in, skin on).  Now for the brine: in a gallon sized sealable plastic bag dissolve the salt and sugar in the water. Add the chicken then seal the bag, leaving as little air in it as possible. Refrigerate anywhere from 1 to 24 hours. Remove the chicken from the brine then rinse under cool water and pat dry with a paper towel.  Finally to the fun part, the grilling. Fire up the grill and once it's good and hot, take the chicken, seasoned as desired, and place it skin side down on the grill. Once cooked you can check if its done with a meat thermometer, make sure that it reaches 170 degrees Fahrenheit for chicken breast and 180 degrees Fahrenheit for chicken thighs. Once its done, prepare for a juicy chicken that is sure to impress your guests and family. © 2021 David Young"
511,Eggplant - Deep Frying,food," Eggplant grows on a stout plant. It produces purple flowers that turn into a dark almost black egg-shaped fruit. Picked while shiny, the outside is peeled away.

Then, dipping into an egg and water mixture, and finally ground fine cracker crumbs. Deep fried until rusty brown. Flipping over as the slices cook on the bottom, the tops will not cook until turned over. Peel, slice, dip. Deep fry. Flip over. Salted water. Flour first. Egg. Cracker crumb. Repeat.

512,Frozen Lemonade to The Rescue,food," Kenneth Avery is a Southern humorist with well over a thousand fans. The charm and wit in his writing span a nearly a decade. I can describe this dish in one word: delicious. Especially when FROZEN. I will keep this brief. Although the caledar says that it is the first of August, Dog Days, but the summer hot streak is still much alive. So what do we do, students? First, do not freak. And you might ""drink out of the box,"" with this recipe. It's the easiest recipe to engineer and even more fun to partake of. I promise. Ingredients: ⦁ From 6 to 8 Fresh Lemons⦁ A very small touch of honey Preparation: ⦁ You just take the lemons and roll them with your hands or with a flour roller, the wooden type if you have one, and when the lemons become very soft, then you are ready for frozen lemonade. ⦁ Squeeze each lemon (as much as you can), then cut lemon into halves and squeeze each half to add more juice to your base mix. Note: many people do not know that the lemon halves contain more juice than once thought. So capitalize on this information. ⦁ Take the one very small amount of honey into the lemonade mix and stir with a wooden spoon or electric mixer, but only use on a medium setting. ⦁ Pour lemonade into your old-fashioned ice trays and then sit into your freezer from two to four hours and the mix should be frozen, but the best is yet to come. Now that you have poured your lemonade into the trays and chipped-out each cube into your glasses, take your remaining lemonade and pour on the frozen lemonade cubes and what do I always say, enjoy! This makes a perfect hot summer day. Or night. Keep some lemonade on hand so you can freeze some anytime and drink your thirst away.

515,3 Best ways to Make Puree at Home,food," Miriam is an enthusiastic cook. At 13 years old she would bake cakes for her young siblings and parents and they loved them.

517,German Black Forest Cake Recipe,food," Miriam is an enthusiastic cook. At 13 years old she would bake cakes for her young siblings and parents and they loved them. 205g all-purpose flour 100g margarine/butter 290g granulated sugar 55g unsweetened cocoa powder 11/4 cups (320 ml) buttermilk 2 large eggs 2 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon vanilla extract I ½ teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 3 cups confectioner’s sugar ½ cup unsalted butter ½ cup kirschwasser (This is a type of brandy) 1 pinch of salt ½ cup espresso/ strongly brewed coffee/ rum 1 cup cherries 2 cups heavy whipping cream 1/8 cup kirschwasser ½ teaspoon vanilla extract 2 tablespoons dry o powdered milk 2 tablespoons confectioners’ sugar ½ cup shaves dark chocolate Soak the cherries in the kirschwasser overnight. If kirschwasser is not available, there are other substitutes such as apple juice, White wine, vodka, and cherry syrup. Cherries will be used to put in the middle of the cake and as a decoration outside the rim of the cake. In a large bowl, mix flour, cocoa powder, baking powder baking soda and salt together. Sift the ingredients and set them aside. Beat sugar and butter/ margarine until frothy and fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla and mix well. Add the dry ingredients and buttermilk bit by bit. Alternating wet and dry ingredients helps to maintain the air bubbles in the cake. Do not worry about where to get buttermilk. Make one yourself. Alternatives to buttermilk Mix 1 cup of milk with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Let it sit until it curdles for ten minutes. Mix 1 cup of milk with 1 tablespoon of white vinegar. Let it sit until it curdles for five minutes. Mix 1/4 cup of milk with ¾ cup yoghurt. Let it sit until it curdles for five minutes. Mix 1/3 cup of milk with 2/3 cup of cream tartar. Let it sit until it curdles for five minutes. Mix 1/4 cup of milk with 3/4 cup of sour cream. Let it sit until it curdles for five minutes. Take cake 2 baking tins and apply a small amount of oil at the bottom and on the sides. Dust some flour on the baking tin. Dusting is important; it helps the margarine not to melt on the cake. An alternative is the paper lining. This process ensures that the cake does not stick on the baking tin. Pour the mixture into the baking tins. Preheat oven to 180o Celsius (356F) for 5 minutes. Set the upper and lower heat so that the heat is well distributed. Put the cakes in the oven and bake for 25minutes. The cake will begin turning brown on top. To identify if the cakes are ready, take a toothpick or a knife and insert it at the centre of the cake. If the knife or toothpick has some dough on its sides, the cake is not ready, otherwise, the cake is ready. Once the cakes are well cooked, remove them from the oven and put them on a rack to cool. Use toothpicks to make holes on top of the cakes. Remove the cherries from the kirschwasser, and pour them evenly on top of the cakes. Rum can also be used to pour evenly on top of the cake. If you are not a lover of alcohol in cooking, skip this step. Use syrup of your taste and smear it on the cake and use other toppings other than cherries. Mixing the filling In a bowl, whisk/beat the butter/margarine until light and fluffy. Add the confectioners’ sugar, a pinch of salt and coffee. If the mixture is too thick add several teaspoons of cherry juice of kirschwasser. Take the cherries and cut them into small pieces before topping the cakes. Take one cake and put some of the fillings on top, put another cake on top of the first one and fill it also with some filling. Similarly, take the last cake and put it on top of the second filled cake. Fill it with the last portion of cherry filling. If you do not like cherries, use strawberries, grapes or any other fruit filling of your choice. If strawberries are used, do not soak them. Cut them into small pieces and mix them with syrup and apply on top of the cake. Refrigeration Put the cake in a refrigerator overnight for 2 days for the kirschwasser to soak well. However, it is not mandatory to refrigerate. Refrigeration is done for the production of authentic flavour. If you did not use alcohol, there is no need of refrigerating at this stage. Icing In a bowl, pour the whipping cream and whip until it produces stiff peaks. If using a hand mixer, set a low speed. The best way of knowing that the mixture has stiff peaks is when you remove the mixture and cream holds it shape. Add dry milk and confectioners’ sugar and fold gently until all the ingredients are well mixed. There are also whipping creams that are sugary, use them instead. Spread the icing on top of the whole cake using a rubber spatula and line round the cake with cherries or any other fruit to your preference. Take dark chocolate and use a peeler to peel it in curls and put them on top of the cake. Enjoy. If you want to make this cake for children, make some adjustments such as the elimination of alcohol. Use syrup instead, children love sweet things. This cake can be served with fruit juice, hot or cold tea, alone without any other accompaniment, or any other drink according to preference. It can also be served as a side dish to the main course. Black forest is great for outdoor parties such as birthday parties, baby showers, weddings, graduation, anniversaries or any other important occasion. This recipe is specifically great for adults. Play around with the recipe, with practice it is possible to bake delicious black forest cake which you can sell and make money. Understand your market niche and tailor it to suit their needs.

518,Is It Worth It to Make Your Own Bread?,food," I will say right off the bat that yes, you can save a large portion of your bread budget by baking it at home. But is it worth the cost in effort and time? How long does it take to knead and prepare the dough? How much of your day do you want to devote to kneading? Say you have a family of four and you go through 2 loaves of bread a week. And if you are making rolls and biscuits etc, you have to take that time into account as well. I suspect it would take an entire day to make bread for one week. I personally have other things I would rather do than baking and kneading for one-seventh of my waking hours. I figured out the cost of making bread at the cheapest I could manage. Starting with the 10 pound bag of flour I got for $5.50, estimating electricity cost at .50c ( I got this estimate somewhere else, I could be way off, it is hard to tell.) If I cooked all 8 loaves for the month at one time. and a few cents here and there for yeast (if you buy it by the pound) I came up with about .60c per loaf. This assumes as well that you have a big freezer to store all the extra bread. I generally pay $2 to $2.50 per loaf of grainy, nutty, tasty bread. If I were to add these extras that make bread taste good, I would be spending a whole lot more on my home made bread. I am also able to spend less on good bread when I do sales and coupons, and I now plan to check out the Franz outlet to see if I can find even lower prices on bread. If I can regularly get it down to $1.50 or so on average I would be happy. This is more than twice the cost of home made bread. Is it worth it? I think so, yes. I would only save a few dollars per month, at a savings of $7.20 for 8 loaves of bread. That is clearly not worth my hours spent every Sunday in the kitchen doing hard labor. My time is worth much much more than that. I could spend that time walking to the beach with my dog. Or gardening. Or learning something new. Ok so I just got back from the Franz Bread outlet. I have been planning to go there for a while to see what they had for deals. I had an appointment in town so I decided to stop by Franz afterward. They had a really good deal with five loaves for five bucks. I haven't tried any of these breads before, so I will reserve judgment for now. I chose Franz Milk and Honey, Seattle International Classic French, Seattle Sourdough, Winco Texas Toast,and Franz Blueberry bagels. So if these breads are good, I know where I will be shopping for bread from now on. The only thing is I can't take my boyfriend, he picked up two jars of jam for three dollars each because the jars were""cute"" shaped like a little beer mug with handles. Ugg. You can't take men anywhere, not if you want to save money shopping. I would have bought ten loaves but my chest freezer is at capacity now.  "

520,"I Want Beef, Not to Eat The Lawn",food," I was born in the south. I live in the south and will die in the south. This is only a small part of the memories I share. No wonder that this man is smiling. Writer's explanation: In this piece, toward the end, I used three brands of hot dogs made in America: Hebrew National, Oscar Mayer and Zeigler's. In no way am I promoting the products that these companies sell or pressuring you to sell the products. I used these brands to help my editorial comment. Thanks, Kenneth. I'm sick of it! Sick to death ot it! Sure I can endure at least 90% of all the TV commercials, radio spots, newspaper display ads and billboards selling one thing or the other, But, and I hope you agree, I've had it. The main reason for my anger is not a TV commercial about some green lizard using an English tone of voice hoping that I will buy the insurance that he is selling. Well, I tell you. That ship has sailed. I'm not that bad of a guy, and I'm not even that upset about the rest of the advertising vehicles because I know that these businesses have to make money, or shut down, God forbid! I was in the newspaper grind for 23 years and we took a stiff sales meeting once every month and the ""numbers,"" another name for our profit and loss read-out, to show if we had lost or won that valuable revenue. As for as the radio and billboard companies, I am wagering that they too have employees with mouths to feed. theirs. And their families as well. So I do understand almost every bit of creativity at those big ad agencies on Fifth Avenue in New York City, because these guys and dolls work their tails off, and yes, for that dollar that will buy more food. Oops! I let the ""burger out of the bag!"" I am not going to apologize. I am a flag-flying American with freedoms that I can use (up to a limit) and here is one I am going to use: The Bill of Rights that guarantees me free speech. Plus I am not about to slander or sling mud on anyone, so relax. So listen-up! Who does those ""Money Health-Crazed Merchants"" believe what we are, stupid? Evidently so. One of the big burger giants started advertising something called a Beef Burger That Wasn't Beef, in fact, the burger was made from PLANTS! You read it right, plants. The ad agency who handled this account even showcased ""real customers"" taking huge bites of their Plant Burger. One of the actors even read (from script) ""Hey, this even tastes like beef!"" Nope, it sure doesn't. What we have now is a confusing juncture where fantasy has tried to marry reality and the arrangement has failed. One burger is fine but two is pure Heaven. Since these Plant Burger ads have played, I haven't seen anymore on TV and I am the happiest TV viewer in the world. And to further explain the burger debacle, the ad folks did not take the time to reveal just what type of plant this burger chain was using? Hey, America! Doesn't that cause you to be a littl bit suspicious? Or has your senses been so dulled that you will eat or buy whatever comes down the pike? I would study the new health burger before it hit my mouth. Yes, sir, I would. I am not that conservative, but a health burger? For all that we know, the southern-based plant, Kudzu, might have been used to make this beefy burger. I did some research on this and found out that Kudzu makes a fine food for cattle, but we are NOT cattle. We like to dress-up nice and take our good companion to our favorite restaurant or burger store and dine in peace--without any repercussions of what our food has really been made from. In short, if I buy a breakfast with eggs, toast and bacon, I want all these items to be the real deal. No fake bacon, eggs, or toast for yours truly. And I will ask you, if this current health burger should, even accidentally, began to get traction and then takes over the entire Real Burger-Fans of America, what then? What next? Will we soon be seeing fake hot dogs? But wait. Even now the Real Hot Dogs have taken a bad rap from some of the healthy people who have tried to tell us what hot dogs are made from. The scriptwriters from ""King of Queens,"" that once-starred Kevin ""Doug Heffernan"" James and Carrie ""Spooner"" Heffernan, had a bit of true reality when Doug and his ""International Parcel Service"" buddies were in ""Doug's"" backyard kicking back, drinking cold ones and munching the tasty hot dogs that ""Doug"" was grilling. Before the scene was over, ""Doug,"" asks, ""anybody want another dog?"" Most of his buddies (except Victor ""Deacon"" Williams) who started to explain that he saw on TV how hot dogs were really made. Then ""Doug"" stopped him and said, ""we shouldn't hear anything like that!"" ""Doug"" said which rings what I, and most of America believes that hot dogs are delicious. If not, then allow me to ask, if hot dogs are not healthy, why doesn't someone tell Hebrew National, Oscar Mayer, Zeigler's and more companies such as these? I thought so. A burger with bacon is supr-delicious. So as the sun slowly goes down in the west, there are people somewhere in our country, maybe the world, about to fire-up their grills and toss-on (not another baw-bee) but a hot dog and in seconds flat, they will be eaten and these folks will be satisfied. This is their right to cook and eat what they want. This is America. If hot dogs-eating is wrong, then explain Nathan's Annual Hog Dog-Eating Contest held each Fourth of July at Coney Beach, N.J. And if you subscribe to the ""Healthy Plant Burger Craze,"" then be prepared for scenes like this: Husband: ""Heyyy, Margie! Hurry and get me the Riding Mower to mow the lawn because I am taking you to dinner!""

522,Cucumber Sorting for Pickle Making,food," First of all, when you go out to the cucumber patch, there will literally be hundreds of cucumbers. They will all be different sizes. The tiny cucumbers are used for several uses. They can be pickled in any type of brine you choose. They can be used to fill in the spaces when you create a jar of larger cucumbers. The next size of cucumbers is used to stack in layer one and layer two. Then, the next size of cucumbers is placed in the jars standing up. Many times one pickle will reach nearly to the top or upper third of the jar. The smaller cucumbers are added to the top of them. The next size is sliced crossways to create pickle chips, like you find on your burgers. The next size is peeled and sliced and made into refrigerator pickles. The next size, probably orange, are either discarded into the compost pile or made into yellow pickles. The seeds are removed and the peeling is removed. I have heard stories about orange pickles but ever tried. Some have made a sweet pickle like a watermelon rind pickle with them, but I have not."

525,Things to do in Kenosha Wisconsin,food," The Mars Cheese Castle is a sight to behold. The sand-colored building, with its battlements and grassy moat stands at attention like it's guarding the border between Illinois and Wisconsin - but don't let that fool you! Although this might as well be the state line for many travelers heading to or from Chicago, if you know what really matters in life--cheese--then this will feel more than just an ordinary roadside attraction. The family-owned Kenosha business about 60 miles from Chicago is a protector of curds, an expert in cheese for the ages. This roadside icon and requisite roadtrip stop has been at it since 1922 when they started as a local creamery with just one truck to transport milk across town. Nowadays there are more than 34 varieties sold through their quaint little store! The ruling cheese royalty here comes after two generations that have grown its business into this iconic destination everyone stops by on every trip down I94 to Milwaukee or up Highway 41 towards Door County--and does so without ever compromising quality along the way: you can still see their original brick building near downtown where customers line out front all summer long for fresh batches of buttery cheddar. Mario Ventura was a butcher who’d worked at the Naval Station Great Lakes and later at the A&P grocery store in downtown Kenosha, but he had a good head for business. He decided, with his wife Martha to open an old schoolhouse that would sell cheese as well as deli foods they called “Mars."" Mario found himself by two-lane U.S. 41 and I-94 that connected Milwaukee and Chicago - it wasn't long before Mars became one of Wisconsin's most iconic food destinations! Mario and Martha have been working together for years. They are both hard-working people, who do anything that needs to be done at the cheese shop on a daily basis - from slicing cheese behind the counter to handing out samples of 600 pound cheeses when they're not busy doing their other tasks. Over time there were changes: more traffic due to an expanding road caused by construction; then one day Mario's store burned down! Luckily it wasn't too much work since he had bought a gas station up the street which turned into his new location with some extra features like bakery goods, coffee barista services and even craft beer taps. Mars Cheese Castle fire back in the 50's unknown Mario and Martha lived their lives in the cheese shop, raising two children. Their son Mario Jr. would work there until he became too old for it while his daughter Angela worked at times as well when she was home from college or on break during her childhood years, with both of them eventually having kids themselves that now run Mars Cheese Castle!  Tyson Wehrmeister is a little boy with an even bigger dream: to clean the castle. His grandfather would show up every Saturday morning while he was cleaning and point him towards the vacuum, instilling in Tyson his work ethic that still lives on today.  When Michael Ventura was 12, he had to prove himself before being given the privilege of helping out around his grandpa's car shop. ""I would do things like clean Grandpa’s car,"" laughs Michael. His grandparents passed away in 2004 and 2007 respectively, but their legacy lives on- for a time after they died Mario Jr., with help from Angela’s husband Phil Wehrmeister ran the business together. In 2017 both encountered health issues; however, that didn't stop them or hinder what needs done at this auto garage including keeping up appearances (cleaning cars). The next generation stepped up! Michael Ventura has fond memories working as an apprentice helper at his grandfather's tire store when he was just twelve years old. The cousins had an opportunity to really leave their mark. In 2011, the highway was expanding and they castle was in its way. They thought about what would happen if everything just stayed the same after all these years of hard work, so when it came time for them to relocate there were two options: stay where they are or find a new place down the road that's more practical but still has those old-world touches on which this company thrives -- like stone walls carved with large windows from floor to ceiling looking out onto lush green fields dotted by grazing sheep while sunsets kiss vast blue skies filled with fluffy white clouds high over head; at first glance you might think this is some kind of fairy tale come true... But then again ... it could pass as a mall at a Renaissance fair. Picture of how mars cheese castle stands today. In the past few years, Tyson has seen drastic changes. The first reconstruction was around one sixth of its original size- which is still plenty for a mall at a Renaissance fair. Now it stands as more than two thirds larger and can accommodate up to 2,500 visitors on weekends!  You know how there are those people that seem to always be rubbing elbows with celebrities? Well, they have the best time when Taste of Chicago is going on in Chicago and Summerfest is happening right next door. ""Tour buses come in,"" says Natalie. ""Everybody in the band gets off and tries some cheese."" It's not just a one-time thing either - these celebriphiles get their fix every year during this very concentrated period of celebrity sauntering around metro areas! The cousins are eager to leave their mark on the family business. They have plans for their growth and are hosting events and working to become a destination for locals. On Christmas Eve, they fly in oysters from both coasts and Canada then pair them with bourbon barrel beer at an annual event that ends around midnight when Santa arrives via horse-drawn carriage; on Valentine's Day, they hosted Love at First Bite: Valentine’s Day Dinner at the Castle where guests could enjoy five courses of food paired with wine while listening to live music by The Clayton Brothers Band.""  At the end of the day, this is one place you must come see if you have never been here. I would like to thank my friends who help give me ideas for my adventures so that I am able to take the time to write these for you. I did find this write up of another Kenosha attraction, the Faire right next door which I will review in the next few weeks. Until then thank you for reading. © 2021 Faris Coates"

528,Humans And Meat Eating,food," All humans started their lives eating the products of the earth, like most other animals including the apes from whom we are said to have descended. So our diets consisted of vegetables, fruits and grains that grew in the wild in forests. Even our teeth are designed for this diet, unlike those you find in carnivorous animals whose teeth are meant to tear, and not to chew as ours are meant to. Vegetarian eating is a natural way of eating, and is healthier. It is no wonder that more and more people are turning to vegetables as a major part of their diet, both for its health and other environmental concerns. Meat eating requires a constant supply of animals, like cows, sheep and poultry, besides fish, and is one that makes great demands on water, land, and other resources to maintain the vast herds that the human meat eaters need to satisfy their appetites. Even the digestive systems that we have are not meant for meat. The eating of meat can thus be said to be a recent development in human history, that may have been more from necessity and opportunity. Humans in, all probabibility, had observed carnivores eating meat and when they ran out of natural food, like berries, nuts, and grans, probably experimented with eating meat, though eating it raw must have made it difficult, both to eat and to digest. Maybe they found that meat of animals trapped in forest fires was both edible and digestible. Or when they discovered fire, found it easier to eat meat, as well as their own vegetarian diet. It is more than likely that humans started eating meat, only after they discovered fire. A vegetarian diet required humans to constantly forage for food. Hunting on the other hand, required proper planning, getting the necessary weapons together, and finding ways to track and kill the live animals. Eating meat requires proper preparation and the use of fire to make it edible."
529,The Frugality of 50s Appliances and Canning,food," As a baby boomer, Denise and millions of others are becoming senior citizens. She explores what it means to be over 60 today. Don't ya love a parade? I am a 50’s child.  I love that era, the diners, the ducktails, the poodle skirts, the music, the cars.  It is all a wonderful era. Plus, it has the added charm of being the decade I was born. Just saying. I fell in love with Richie on Happy Days.  Who didn't want to be a Cunningham?  I know all the lyrics to the Laverne and Shirley theme as well as the lyrics to Grease. I was right there with Marty McFly in Back to the Future. I actually love black and white movies for the artistry of it.  My father was very resistant to getting a color TV (because of the cost I think) until all the programs were being aired in color and he finally couldn't take the suspense any longer. He just had to see what Miss Kitty from Gunsmoke looked like in color. He wasn't disappointed! I have the added pleasure of being married to a wonderful man who actually worked on the Laverne and Shirley and Happy Days set (behind the scenes) and who actually owns a pair of boots once belonging to the Fonz. When the Fonz blew on his fist and rapped the jukebox, my hubby was backstage making the music come on. Someone had to make the magic. How many people can say they have Fonzie's boots in their closet (other than Henry Winkler’s wife)? We have old episodes of ""Life with Elizabeth"" with Betty White on DVD (what a tiny waist that woman had) and ""Halls of Ivy"" with Ronald Coleman (what a voice that man had) on DVD. The old episodes of ""What's My Line?"" and ""Queen for a Day"" give me thrills. And who could forget the ""$64,000 Question"" as well as the ""You Bet Your Life"" Chrysler-Plymouth show with Groucho Marx (what a funny man)? I still wear hats I find at the antique and thrifts stores; why would anyone want to part with those treasures?  I’m a little bit anachronistic; someone lost in time or living a life of the time she would prefer. Vintage phones next to a computer Denise McGill It was a time of innocence and growth for many countries, and it was a time of change.  If you love the 50's as much as I do, you may be surprised to know that many appliances from that era are still working and available. A few are reproductions but very cool looking. Like phones.  Phones from the '50s were so cool.  You could practically kill an intruder with one.  They were made heavy and to last. Ice cream makers, refrigerators, toasters, bottle openers and can openers (manual and electric), televisions or television consoles with a record player and radio (now there was a piece of furniture!), vacuum cleaners, and electric mixers. Root Cellar Pixabay One of my favorite sets inherited from those days is my canning equipment.  I have Mason jars and Ball jars that date to my grandmother’s use and maybe even beyond.  The big aluminum pot for immersing the jars still gets used.  I had to replace the tongs that pull the jars out of the water bath and was surprised that I could find them so easily.  I must not be the only one who still cans fruits and vegetables in the summer. Corn Field Graphic Stock Old people shouldn’t eat health foods.  They need all the preservatives they can get. —  Robert Orben (1927) American humorist. Every summer we canned not only what my mother grew outback but also what we would glean from the local farmers.  If you have never gleaned in the fields, you have missed out on something special.  After the pickers have passed through and the farmers will be plowing under what is left on the vine, so they let it be known to corner gas station attendants and friends that it is okay for gleaners to come.  Mom came in announced we would be gleaning the next day.  It didn’t matter for what.  We all groaned.  It would be hot and tiring, but there was no arguing with Mom.  We kids would drag boxes and cartons through the long rows to load them with tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, and sometimes green beans.  In the orchards, we loaded peaches, nectarines, apricots, plums, pears, and sometimes apples, dragging the heavy boxes to the waiting get-away car.  It was hot and sweat glistened on our brows as we complained but still picked the treasure.  Mom hauled us out of bed early to beat the heat, to canal banks for free wild blackberries as large as apricots. By the end of the summer, our pantry was stocked with sweet pickles, dill pickles, pickled watermelon rind, relish, spiced peaches – light on the cinnamon and heavy on the cloves, sliced peaches for cobblers, sliced apples for pie, sweet apple butter, pear butter, corn, green beans, spaghetti sauce, our own Mexican salsa (mild), whole stewed tomatoes, and every kind of jam and jelly; all just aching for their favorite partner: peanut butter. When I started my own family, I couldn’t go a summer without doing the same as my dear mother and preserving every fruit and vegetable I could get my hands on. I even tried a few recipes that my mother didn’t try, such as corn cob jelly (tastes like strawberry), cured olives, green tomato relish, and lemon mead (which is a mild fermented fruity wine). I inherited many of my grandmother’s canning jars, some of them so old they were blue and green with age. I find them almost too precious to use for canning. Many preserves, jam, and jelly recipe books can be found for free at your local Agricultural Extension Service. Look them up on the Internet or in the Phone Book. They have recipes you’ve never heard of before, but I’m sure there are lots on the Internet as well. Dad churning the ice cream maker Denise McGill The revelation to produce and store food may be as essential to our temporal welfare today as boarding the ark was to the people in the days of Noah. — Ezra Taft Benson Now a summer doesn’t arrive without my thoughts returning to those days of picking, cleaning, peeling, slicing, dicing, stewing, ladling, sealing, and labeling with my mother. The hard day ending with the music of “phump, phump, phump” coming from the sealing jars on the kitchen table as I lay down to dream of sweet pickle relish in my potato salad and on my hot dog, of apple cobblers and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. There was a special frugality that my mother passed on to me. It was more than just saving money. She taught me that by saving money on groceries we would not need to buy that year, we were in fact, earning it. We were earning money for the family and for my father. This was a lesson I never forgot. It was the legacy I passed onto my daughters; the lesson that you do not need to be in a paying job to earn money. Saving money is earning money too. In the spend-thrift society we live in today, our children need to know that simple truth. Benjamin Franklin said it before my mother did: “A penny saved is a penny earned.” My mom in her garden Denise McGill Have you got a great story about a favorite 50’s appliances or activities? Do you remember using them or are you still? Did it mean something to you and you just can't wait to tell me about it?

531,Thai Artist Bakes Bread Shaped as Severed Body Parts,food," Mamerto Adan is a feature writer who is back in college once again. Science is one of his favorite topics. You think you have a strong stomach? You think you aren’t squeamish? In my case, I don’t claim that my digestive system is cast iron. I do have strong preferences on rare or raw meat, much to the displeasure of my friends. I won’t also say no to exotic food. Bring in the offal, the animal body parts or the deep-fried bugs. I don’t mind. But there are stuffs out there that could make me puke, no matter how well prepared it is. As in the case of a bakery somewhere in Thailand. You may understand my disgust here or laugh at my sensitivity. But believe it or not, you could taste human body parts in that said bakery. You may choose your choice of appendages, from limbs, to head. But before you rush to the nearest Interpol station or organize a mob to lynch whoever came up with this, do calm down because those were not real. Those were just edible reproductions. Nothing but bread shaped like human body parts. And we could guarantee that no lump of human flesh was used to bake those gory pastries that will make the psycho in you proud. Kittiwat Unarrom holding his masterpiece. Kittiwat Unarrom is both an artist, and a baker. At the age of 10, this man from Thailand learned how to bake, with his family in the bakery business. He also has a master’s degree in fine arts, and as an undergraduate student, he painted portraits before moving in the mixed media. But somehow, he managed to marry his family baking business, and his artistic passion in such a unique way. A gory and unsettling way. When paying a visit to their bakery in Ratchaburi, Thailand, prepare to be shocked. At first, one might wonder if one really entered a bakery here, because aside from the usual bread and pastries, something else is sold here. And this made their bakery looked something like from a slasher movie. There are human body parts here! It got everything that rivals the local morgue, or a prop storage house for a horror film. Amputated hands, feet, torso, and most importantly severed heads. One might wonder if their family is also into medical business, or they are really murderers with their bakery as cover. But those body parts aren’t real. Kittiwat used his extensive art background with the dough as his medium to create those realistically gory body parts. In short, Kittiwat made breads shaped like bloody human components. What is sold here. To begin with, these baked horrors are intricately detailed and well-made masterpiece, with realistic features. So much so that it could be passed for real dismembered cadavers. Take the hands for example. They are complete with carved fingernails, palm lines and veins. The same could be said on the feet. He also got baked internal organs to show off.  But the most terrifying part here are the heads. Here we could see Kittiwat’s expertise on human figures. The heads are well proportioned, with the nose, ears and mouth having the right detail. But it was the eyes that made these heads terrifying. They are made in a deceased state, meaning the expression is the accurate depiction of a dead person. In some head sculptures, the eyes are open, which made them agonizingly expressive. And to add more flavor to the fright, Kittiwat gave the dough body parts bruised skin tone and fake blood. The half open eyes are even painted, while the head is devoid of hair, as if in a state of decomposition. Hyper-realistic is what could be said on these body breads, thanks mostly to the sculptural skills of Kittiwat. They are even packaged like real food, you know, sold in shrink-wraps, though some are hung on meat hooks. All in all, the way they are packaged added to the horror, giving their bakery a resemblance to a torture chamber. Kittiwat preparing his corpses. Just to help clear things up, no one was murdered or injured here when Kittiwat made his bread. Seeing the gory nature of these baked goodies, one might wonder how he made them. Again, he never used a drop of blood or a lump of flesh here. It is all the usual bread ingredients like dough, raisins, cashews, nuts and chocolate. Everything is natural and edible, and these baked bodies taste like any usual bread (though understandably, the people have misgivings taking a bite). His carving instruments are also nothing special, and it’s all skills that helped achieved the hyperrealism. This is the result of his experimenting with dough for years. Kittiwat also spent a great deal of time studying anatomy, and visiting museums Designs vary from abused, bruised, bloody, even decayed and putrefied. And if you want to buy some as a perfect centerpiece in a morbid party, Halloween celebrations or even to prank your friends, it is available in their bakery, and such oddities even became a tourist attraction. His baked bodies are also sold as art forms, and some are sprayed with urethane to help preserve them for display. Some works are sold for a few thousands But with all these gore and horrors, one might wonder why Kittiwat is doing this. More of his baked goodies. What the hell is Kittiwat thinking when he turned their bread into slasher movie props? As expected, there are some who thinks Kittiwat is mad, or simply a psycho who channels his insanities into his masterpiece. But as it turns out, there are deeper meanings to what he is doing, aside from grossing out or scaring a lot of folks. Kittiwat has been baking body parts since 2006, and his works questions why use expensive material for fine art pieces, as ordinary dough is enough. At the same time, his baked gores are the expression of his religious beliefs and philosophy. According to him, bread resembles life in a way that both are transitory. Bread is also linked to humanity and tied to various civilizations. His works also gives messages to the observer, to be critical on what one sees and not judge something according to its outside form. And Kittiwat’s bread deliver such message perfectly. It is corpse on the outside, but everyday bread on the inside. And the only way to find out is to ignore what we see and take a bite. If you dare! Because I won't. Linda Crampton from British Columbia, Canada on August 03, 2021: This is a very interesting article! From an artistic point of view, the sculptures are very impressive. I don’t think I could eat one, though! Mamerto Adan (author) from Cabuyao on July 26, 2021: Same here Louise. Common sense tells me those are bread. My eyes say no. Mamerto Adan (author) from Cabuyao on July 26, 2021: Well Greg, those are amazing, but I can't eat that! Mamerto Adan (author) from Cabuyao on July 26, 2021: Indeed John. Beyond the gory art, he has good knowledge of human figures and modeling. John Hansen from Gondwana Land on July 25, 2021: Wow! Kittiwatt certainly is a talented artist and baker. These creations are so “life-like” or should I say “death-like.” Very interesting, greg cain from Moscow, Idaho, USA on July 25, 2021: Well, it is interesting, even if it isn't appetizing! Louise Powles from Norfolk, England on July 25, 2021: Goodness!  I must admit, that's very artistic, but I'm not sure I could eat this lol."

533,Beef Curry Recipe,food," Maimona is a graduate with a degree in Culinary Arts from ITICA. One of her favorite things is creatively cooking and baking for her family. Beef is a preferred and delicious food.  It helps to replenish the body so it is very beneficial for teenagers.  There are many types of beef recipes, of which the beef curry recipe is my favorite.  I have tried to present my favorite recipe very simply.  It can be eaten with rice or bread.  Hopefully someone will be able to cook and eat with a lot of satisfaction. Beef Curry Recipe Image by Author First the beef should be washed well and cut into small pieces.  Cut the onion into two pieces and paste the other two through a blender.  Ginger and garlic should be cleaned and pasted in a blender and kept in a clean bowl.  Tomatoes should be washed well and chopped.  The green peppers should be cut in the middle with a small knife.  Coriander leaves should be washed well and cut into small pieces. Beef Curry Recipe Image by Author Benefits of Beef Beef contains a lot of protein which helps in physical growth.  Also contains zinc, phosphorus, iron, amino acids.  Zinc helps the body fight disease.  Phosphorus helps to strengthen the structure of teeth.  Iron helps to eliminate anemia in the body and maintains the oxygen supply in the body.  Amino acids are beneficial for the skin.  There is also vitamin B which keeps the body and mental health just right.

534,Strict Budget Whisk(e)y: The Glengarry Highland Blended Scotch Whisky,food," I am someone that has always enjoyed a fine glass of whiskey and loves sharing advice. I try all kinds of whiskies from places all over. Usually, when we hear scotch whisky we tend to imagine someone drinking an expensive single malt, typically while wearing a nice suit. When it comes to nice blends everyone immediately thinks of Johnnie Walker, but even these bottles can hurt your wallet after a while. Of course nobody wants to sacrifice quality for a cheaper price, not all cheaper whiskies hurt to drink. One of the best bottles of scotch whisky for under $15 is The Glengarry Highland Blended Scotch Whisky. Blended scotch refers to a blend of single malt and grain whiskies—that can come from multiple distilleries—creating a unique flavor to that whisky. Blended scotch has gotten a bad reputation for being the inferior version of scotch whisky with many preferring single malt scotch. To be honest though, there are plenty of bad single malts out there and some phenomenal blends. This one is certainly one of the better ones for the money. How can that not be great?! This particular whisky has an aroma of raisins with hints of smoke and peat, and with a little bit of water some of the peat is subsided leaving the raisin notes which makes this a versatile whisky depending on your taste. It also makes this a great whisky to get introduced to the unique flavor that is peat. This whisky pairs best with chicken wings coated with more tangy and sweet flavors. The flavors you get from having it neat or with a few drops of water both work really well and complement the chicken and a simple plate of fries. A simple whisky with a simple meal, but sometimes simple is the best way to go. This whisky also works surprisingly well with anything off the grill that has barbecue sauce on it. The smoke and char combined with the sweetness of the barbecue sauce is complemented by this whisky very well. To be honest, this is a great whiskey to keep at home whether or not you’re on a strict budget. It is a good scotch whisky to sip on and it does have some interesting flavors that do appear with the addition of water. It’s also great to have for when you have company that would rather have cocktails and do shots than enjoy it neat. It’s roughly $13 at Trader Joe’s so you won’t feel too bad if this is how it ends up getting consumed. All in all, it’s a solid scotch for the price and one that every whisky lover should have at home."

How about when you want to do food prep for the week? You have a busy lifestyle, so you are going for a more organized life hence a more organized diet...queue food prep. A way to combat the headache of finding a meal or takeaways during your busy week is to prepare all your meals in advance over the weekend. The pertinent factor that becomes a necessity for preparing food in advance is having a proper way to store it because if you are preparing 2-3 meals for each weekday, so you need an airtight container for each. Food containers are the solution to this as they keep food well-packed, clean, and free from outside pollution and other things. Best food storage containers are commonly made up of three materials. Good quality products do not break easily as they are made up of good materials like glass, silicon, plastic, or wood. Good quality food storing containers are re-usable and can be used for multi-purposes. Storing food in containers that are made up of good quality of materials keeps the food almost fresh as new and doesn't allow the food to rot. Good quality containers keep the air away from entering inside the box. This way, the chances of any bacterial infections in the food become very low. Good quality containers usually weigh less and don't feel heavy. Good quality containers are easy to carry and can be easily moved from one place to another place. Let's talk about food storage containers that are made of glass. Some of them are listed below: The food that is kept in the glass containers is very safe and healthy because glass is a material that doesn't do any kind of chemical reaction nor does give out harmful toxins. Glass containers are winners when it comes to surviving high temperatures, either low or high. Glass containers are environmentally friendly, that means it doesn't cause harm to near surroundings.

Over time, silica or silicon-based containers do not become weak or can't break easily. Containers made up of silicon are harmless and do not react with any kind of foodstuff. Everyone wants the best and healthy lifestyle nowadays. And the topmost health comes from good food and hygiene practices. Using good quality containers is also very important and has numerous benefits. Good quality containers for storing food leftovers or using them for weekday meal prep are really beneficial in keeping the food fresh and healthy.

540,ROHU FISH FRY/SORISH BATA MACHA BHAJA/TAWA FRIED FISH FRY,food," In my blogs you will find melange of dishes discovered of my own and some (foods and flavors) are influenced of our ancestors. Delightsum Like Bengal cuisine, in Odia cuisine people are very fond of for fish. Rohu a river fish is available in all over the year and people love to use it most of the fish food rather than any other fish. Mustard sauce fried fish  goes well with any steamed rice especially with pakhalo (water rice). Though its a quite traditional food but it amazes your taste bud with our modern rice like fried rice and some fries as well. These chocolaty shiny fishes, I  love to enjoy ,squeezing lemon over the fish which enhance the taste along with some garden fresh salads. I wont say it tastes like heaven because heaven we cant compare with any food but yes I must say it tastes over the top.. Smear some salt and turmeric powder over the fishes. Keep them for marination about to 15 minutes. Always discard the water after marination which will reduce the odor of the fish. Again mustard oil the best combination for any fish. Drop 4 to 5 tablespoon oil and allow to hot. Always use heavy bottomed pan to fry any fish if you want the real taste of the fish. You can either use skillet/tawa to fry the fish over medium flame. Do not over fry or deep fry fish. Here we need only shallow fried fishes. Whether you use onion paste or mustard paste for fish fry, my mother always shallow fry fishes first instead of use raw fish. She says it will allow you to remove the fishy odor, if anything left after marination and your fish will be cooked properly. For mustard batter, first blend the mustard seeds dry to powder form. Then add cumin seeds, garlic, onion, turmeric, chili powder into it and form a smooth paste using less water. Here we are not used any gram flour or rice flour to bind the batter. For mustard paste there is no need of all these ingredients these will reduce the taste of mustard, so avoid to use them. Though we don’t use any binding ingredients so, its common  the fishes batter will be sprinkle while frying. So with out bother wait for some seconds and turn it. Fry over lower medium heat will give a crispy and brownie texture to the fishes. 15 min 10 min 25 min 2-4 Clean fishes and smear 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder and salt for 15 minutes marination. Now discard the water. In a heavy bottomed or aluminum skillet, shallow fry all the fishes. It should not be deep fried. Now let the pieces cool. Dip each pieces into  the prepared thick batter and coat nicely. There is no need to add any gram flour or rice flour. While frying you should be care full not to burn it. We need to fry only the masala/batter. Meanwhile heat tawa and add some oil. Now place coated fishes over the tawa and fry both the sides. Though fishes are already cooked, so fry over medium flame until the coated mustard sauce cooked nicely and fishes are crispy, brown both the sides. It will be taken around 7 to 8 minutes .Serve it with steamed rice or green salads.

541,Cold Brewed Sugar from Spice,food," Herbal Infusions are widely popular, offering many health benefits. Some recipes bring infusion to new levels... Like this one! When using herbs with psychoactive effects, be responsible: If you need to decarboxylate, you can do so in your oven or instant pot. I suggest placing the herbs in the bags and do as directed here: Cinch the herb bag closed, place it inside of a mason jar. Secure the lid, ""finger tight"", meaning, as tight as only the force of your fingers will allow. You want to avoid any water getting inside the jar, without torquing it down too hard. Methods vary as you see below: When you open the jar, there will be a light aroma from the vapor trapped inside. The herb is now activated. Some herbs need to be activated beforehand, this is called decarboxylation. Cloth Teabags or another pouch for easy straining herbs of choice You can also use Coconut Palm Sugar Mason Jars, wide mouth makes everything easier. You will want 16oz jars for infusing, smaller jars may be desired for the finished product. Grain Alcohol. 190 if available but the 151 does just fine. ....After 1 week: The time it takes will depend on humidity and conditions in your environment, larger batches take longer, if you want it to be faster you can pour the alcohol over the sugar in a glass baking dish, and use a spatula to stir. More alcohol doesn't 'make the batch stronger, it just makes it take longer to evaporate. "

544,Differences Between an Allergy and a Cold,food," After 22 years as an RN, I now write about medical issues and new medical advances. Diet, exercise, treatment, and lifestyle are important. Hives Wikipedia.com An allergy occurs when your body reacts to a foreign substance (exposed to an allergen). Allergies occur in 7.7% of adults and 7.2% of children in the United States. Allergies occur in 7% of people in Australia but only 2% of the people in Europe. Anaphylaxis (an acute allergic reaction to an antigen) occurs in about 1,000 people worldwide annually. Approximately 20-30% of people with asthma have pet allergies. Your immune system is designed to protect your body from outside invaders, such as bacteria and viruses. However, it sometimes produces antibodies as a response (histamine) to something that is normally not harmful, like certain foods or medications. Researchers do not know why allergies occur, but they know that allergies can be genetically passed down from generation to generation. Several conditions fall under the allergy umbrella, including anaphylaxis, food allergies, skin allergies, allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and allergic asthma. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease conducted a joint study in 2019, which found 26 million (10.8%) of adults had food allergies with shellfish being the most common. Food allergies are becoming more common, but the most common allergies overall include: Pollen, pet dander or bee venom can cause the immune system to react, but it doesn’t cause an adverse reaction in the majority of people. Hay Fever symptoms can cause: Insect stings may cause: Food Allergies may cause: Seasonal Allergies that are caused by plant pollen may cause: Drug allergies can cause: Atopic dermatitis (also called eczema) can cause the skin to redden, flake, peel or itch. Allergy Skin prick Test\ Wikipedia.com Anaphylaxis is a serious reaction to your exposure to allergens, and this is a life-threatening emergency. It can cause you to go into shock.

The doctor has several methods to diagnose allergies in general and for specific allergies also. A medical history is typically taken with a physical examination, and the doctor may ask you to keep a food diary. An elimination diet may help determine food allergies. There is a skin prick test and a patch test where a small amount of common allergens are placed just under the skin to look for a reaction. There is also a blood test for food-specific IgE antibodies, which is called a radioallergosorbent test (RAST) or an ImmunoCAP test, which measures the amount of allergy-causing antibodies in your bloodstream. An oral food challenge could also be done, which has you eating more of a specific food and looking for a bad response. Treatments typically include antihistamines to control the symptoms, which may be over-the-counter or prescriptions. Your treatment will depend on the severity of your allergies. Common medications include: Singulair is not often prescribed due to possible mental health side effects. Allergists can give you regular injections over the course of a few years to help get your body used to your allergy. Immunotherapy can help prevent allergy symptoms from ever returning. People who tend to have severe, life-threatening allergies carry an emergency epinephrine injection (EpiPen, Twinject). There are natural remedies that are used to prevent allergies. Care must be taken to read the ingredients of natural remedies as they can contain allergens, which will make your symptoms more severe. For example, some essential oils or teas use flowers or plants that can cause sneezing. Each allergy type has a host of natural remedies that will speed up your recovery. Children’s allergies also have natural options. A health food store is a good place to look for these natural remedies. It is important to know what allergies you have and how to avoid the seasonal and contact allergens. For example, if you are allergic to dust get your air ducts professionally cleaned. Installing proper air filters is also helpful. The Allergy and Asthma Foundation of America states allergic asthma affects about 60% of those people with asthma. Allergies do make existing asthma worse. Allergies can impact your immune system for prolonged periods of time, and when the immune system is compromised you are more likely to get the common cold or a sinus infection. When you have hay fever you are more likely to sneeze, cough or have a persistent, contagious cough. Bacteria or viruses can cause bronchitis as the result of allergies. Acute bronchitis usually ends after several days or weeks. Chronic bronchitis may even linger for months, and it may return frequently. Babies or young children tend to get common skin allergies, including: eczema, allergic contact dermatitis or hives. Headaches, fevers and body aches may occur with a cold but not with allergies. A cold may also include a sore throat and a stuffy nose. A cold only lasts from seven to ten days, while allergies have no time limit. pinterest Most of the people with allergies do not have life-threatening consequences. Those that do learn to manage their allergies and how to treat an emergency situation. Avoidance, lifestyle changes and medication usually manage allergies. If you have a larger number of allergies it is a good idea to see an allergist.

It is good you don't have other allergies as I have so much trouble with pollen. I am glad you found this article to be helpful and easy to understand. I appreciate your nice comments. Have a wonderful day! Lora Hollings on July 20, 2021: This is an excellent article which can be very helpful in distinguishing colds from allergies. Your article provides a concise and clear method of helping people understand the basic differences. I have an allergy to sulfa drugs and break out in a skin rash if I take them. So I definitely have to stay away from them. Other than that, I don't have a lot of issues with allergies. And I'm very happy about that! Thank you for this helpful article, Pamela. Pamela Oglesby (author) from Sunny Florida on July 20, 2021: Hi Peace, I am glad you have learned from my medical articles. I was a RN for many years, and I do research my topics to make sure I am current. I appreciate your thoughtful comments, as always. Peace Tobe Dike from Delta State, Nigeria. on July 20, 2021: This is quite informative, Pamela. Thank you for sharing your knowledge on health related issues. I've honestly gotten to know a lot from reading your articles. Well done! Pamela Oglesby (author) from Sunny Florida on July 19, 2021: Hi Adrienne, You make a good point. I think the Delta variant confuses things even more. I have allergies also. My husband and Both got the Pfizer  vaccines, so I worry less when I am out in public. I try not to rake too many antihistamines as it dries out my mouth so much, but you are right about blowing your nose in public areas. Some diet changes have helped me. I don't drink wine as I am allergic to the sulfites. I also stay away from milk and milk products as I see to get more congested. That hasn't solved the problem, but it helps. Thank you so much for your generous comments. I hope you have a wonderful week. Adrienne Farricelli on July 19, 2021: With the new Delta variant I am sure many worry about whether they have allergies, just a regular cold or COVID. I guess with normal mask use and social distance, one shouldn't catch colds much often anymore. I am prone though to allergies of many types (dust mites, ragweed etc.) and also my nose is very sensitive to temperature changes, so a runny nose and sneezing is very common with me. I now take antihistamines because it's very unpractical and maybe even dangerous removing the face mask to blow your nose in public areas. Pamela Oglesby (author) from Sunny Florida on July 18, 2021: Hi Linda, I do think it is important to know about allergies, and I sure agree that they are annoying. I appreciate your comments, as always. Linda Crampton from British Columbia, Canada on July 18, 2021: Allergies are annoying, and as you say, they can sometimes be dangerous. It's important to know about them. Thank you for sharing the information, Pamela.

I take over-the-counter antihistamines that seem to help. Pamela Oglesby (author) from Sunny Florida on July 17, 2021: Hi Devika, I think you are right about seasonal versus a one time allergy. I hope your son's allergies aren't to serious. I am glad you found this article informative and interesting. Thank you for your nice comments. Have a wonderful weekend! Pamela Oglesby (author) from Sunny Florida on July 17, 2021: Hi Manatita, It does seem that allergies are on the increase, and I wonder if it is due to preservatives. I didn't read that but it makes you wonder. I am glad you found this article useful I appreciate your comments, as always. Have a wonderful weekend! manatita44 from london on July 17, 2021: Very useful hub, Pamela. Allergies seem to be on the increase in some places. You have covered the difference between an allergy and anaphylaxis quite well. Devika Primić from Dubrovnik, Croatia on July 17, 2021: Pamela This reminds me of when I had allergies from a fabric softener it caused hives and I had no idea that will happen to me. Certain allergies just happen in a one time series and other allergies are seasonal. In Spring I don't have these allergies. My son  is allergic  but I don't have the allergies he has. Interesting and informative about allergies and a cold. Pamela Oglesby (author) from Sunny Florida on July 17, 2021: Hi Brenda, I love cats also, and I had a blood test that showed I was not allergic to them. I can't explain why you sneeze every time you eat. A specific food would make more sense. I'm glad you liked the article. I always appreciate your comments. Have a wonderful weekend! Pamela Oglesby (author) from Sunny Florida on July 17, 2021: Hi Denise, Some springs have more pollen than others also, and this spring was really bad where I live. I ended up with bronchitis this year. I hope your husband can find some medication that helps with his symptoms. Thank you for your comments. I hope you have a wonderful weekend. Denise McGill from Fresno CA on July 16, 2021: I'm so grateful I don't have any allergies, but my husband suffers every spring from pollen.  His eyes water and he has a runny nose but that's all.  Still, it is miserable for him because it lasts for a month or more. Blessings, Denise BRENDA ARLEDGE from Washington Court House on July 16, 2021: This is a fantastic article. It covers so much. They say I'm allergic to cats, bit I'd never stop loving them. I think I'm allergic to food because I sneeze everytime i eat. No matter what or where i eat. Doctors are clueless. Great article though. I enjoyed reading this one. Pamela Oglesby (author) from Sunny Florida on July 16, 2021: Hi Alyssa, I have the same issue. I am not allewrgic to cats, but pollen and dust are bad. I had a blood test done to see if I was allergic to csats and I had one I adored at that time. Thank goodness the test cam back negative. I'm glad you found the article to be interesting, I appreciate your coments. I hope you have a lovely weekend as well. Alyssa from Ohio on July 16, 2021: The proverbial question... especially nowadays. I never had problems growing up, but as an adult I became allergic to cats... which is so sad because I love them! I've also noticed as I've gotten older that I need a Claritin once in a while thanks to pollen and dust. Isn't that weird? This article was very interesting. I knew about the patch test, but I didn't realize they could do a blood test. Thank you for the information, Pamela! I hope you have a lovely weekend! Pamela Oglesby (author) from Sunny Florida on July 16, 2021: Hi Sp, It does seem like more people have allergies now, like you said to pollen, cats and to dust. At least there are treatments that reduce the misery of allergies. I am glad you found the article interesting. I appreciate your comments. Have a great weekend.

Thanks for sharing your wisdom. Sp Greaney from Ireland on July 16, 2021: Very interesting article. So many people now it seems are more susceptible to allergies.

Your allergies are easier as you just don't take those medications. I am glad you liked the article, and I appreciate your comments. I hope you have a good weekend. Rosina S Khan on July 16, 2021: Is acne a kind of allergy, Pamela? My face was full of pimples as a teenager. Now that I am much older and into my adult years, I occasionally have them on my face when it gets oily. I have to keep my face very clean and free from oil most of the time and then I am okay. Thank you for this wonderful article. At least now I know the difference between cold and allergies. Wish you a good weekend. Linda Lum from Washington State, USA on July 16, 2021: A very well-organized article Pamela. My only allergies are to sulfa drugs and Percodan/Percocet. (I'm really glad I don't have food allergies). My Godson is highly allergic to fish, shellfish, peanuts, walnuts and wheat. (Cooking for him can be a challenge). He is 13 and is going to immunotherapy to help overcome some of his problems. Pamela Oglesby (author) from Sunny Florida on July 16, 2021: Hi Chitrangada, Your college experience is not unusual, and I am glad you do longer have that problem.

High pollen counts are a problems for people with allergies. I'm sorry to hear the pollen counts are high in the UK. We also had very high pollen counts this spring, so I ended up with bronchitis. Thank you for reading and commenting. Have a wonderful weekend! John Hansen from Gondwana Land on July 16, 2021: A very interesting article, Pamela.

Liz Westwood from UK on July 16, 2021: This is a very well-presented, relevant and interesting article.

Pamela Oglesby (author) from Sunny Florida on July 16, 2021: Hi Peg, The man in that picture has quite a severe case. I wonder why you broke out in hives? It had to be something in the air, but what?

Culinary Academy Of India
Hyderabad Michelin stars are the most coveted awards for chefs all over the planet. Why? Because these ‘stars’ are considered as the hallmark of gastronomical prowess. Given by a list of anonymous inspectors who focus entirely on food quality and taste, Michelin stars are a symbol of prestige for a restaurant. Previously, stars were awarded only to restaurants that prepared French cuisine, however, this trait is slowly changing with times. Today, ‘bib gourmand’ Michelin stars are given to restaurants that offer quality price at a value price. Additionally, in 2020, the Michelin guide launched ‘green stars’ that are awarded to restaurants that excel in sustainable gastronomy. So what exactly are the Michelin stars? In simple words, Michelin stars are a rating system given by Michelin (the French tyre company). This guide was originally developed in 1900 in France to show local drivers where amenities such as restaurants and mechanics were. As time progressed, the guide grew in popularity and today, the guide is published annually and a restaurant can have a maximum of three Michelin stars. The pandemic has caused a lot of restaurants to shut down and several hotel members are without jobs. The toll on the hospitality and restaurant industry has been truly horrific and the impact has set the booming industry down a slippery slope. With no end in sight as to when restaurants can operate in full, foodies are also being robbed of the experience of fine dining. As a result of this thought, I found my theme for the project - ‘Michelin takeaway’. My goal with this project is to bring fine dining into the homes of people. For this, I’ve developed different kinds of takeaway parcel boxes made out of wooden plank, each accented to look pleasant. This was followed by making two boxes with rubberwood, one for cutlery and crockery, and the other for meat, sauce, vegetables, and starch separately. Rubberwood is used to keep the food thermally insulated ensuring it remains hot. Upon opening the box, receivers will see step-by-step directions with pictures that describe how to plate the food. The idea here is to get customers to plate the recipes themselves by following our instructions. The detailed guide on plating and keeping food hot is so customers can have the fine dining experience all by themselves. This leverages reduced human contact and eliminates the need for customers from visiting hotels while offering them an elevated dining experience.

546,Phool Makhana Curry,food," In my blogs you will find melange of dishes discovered of my own and some (foods and flavors) are influenced of our ancestors. Delightsum The holy puffed seeds are become squishy resembles taste of paneer  in a creamy savoury sauce of bangle gram play an amazingly role for savouriness. Its not only for vrat but also a good side dish of any special occasion or festive time. Relish this savory dish with steamed rice or paratha to make any occasion aesthetically pleasing with family or friends.  Makhana a high protein low fat popular pop con plat based diet. Before started preparing on lotus seeds I used to know it as only Vrat ka Phool or use in pudding as well. This is my first curry based Phool makhana and I had learnt many benefits about the blessed lotus in our busy life. A great natural remedy to reduce stress and anxiety to provide good sleep. Surprise to know how one food is blessed with gluten free and edible for both vegan and ketogenic diet. Before preparing I had no idea how to prepare the food which should be no onion and garlic.  I observed there should be a great afford on gravy though the puffed seeds are tasteless. So before preparing you should be kept in mind if the gravy is delicious then the dish would be delicious too. The crunchy puffed is only dunk in the spicy gravy and changed the crunchy texture to slightly chewy. Most of the no onion garlic  foods are creamy no doubt they are taste delicious. But some times I get bored from overwhelmed creamy and spiciness of curries. So I started my experiment and prepared my own version of makhana with out onion garlic without the loaded of creaminess. I was little afraid of my first attempt but the tastes was great and hearty accepted by all family members. First rinse and soak chana dal for one hour. I preferred pressure cooker to boil the chana dal because i need boiled dals to be soften enough. Cook for  5 to 6 whistles to get a soft broken dal. Once it done take them out from the pressure. Use a spoon to mash the dal but dont paste it. If you dont have time then you can soak them 15 minutes. Boil in pressure for 8 to 9 whistles or until get soft. In a pan heat oil and fry makhanas. The roasted makhanas take less time to soak the gravy is one trick to avoid the chewiness of the seeds after cooked. Shallow fry poppy seeds before preparing paste out of them. So that there is no need to soak the poppy seeds which usually does for making a fine paste out of the seeds . Heat oil in a pan and add star anise. When its aromatic add prepared paste, turmeric and chili powder. Let the masala start to leave sides of pan then add green chilies and water into it. Add coconut milk and ghee. Cook on simmer for 4 to 5 minutes. Off the gas. Sprinkle kasoori methi and allow seeds to soak the gravy before serving. You can serve the dish after 10 to 15 minutes though the seeds are taken time to soak the gravy. But the longer you keep it to soak the better it enhance the taste. 1 hour 20 min 1 hour 20 min 4 Rinse and soak chana dal in one cup of a water for 1 hour. Boil in a pressure cooker until soft at least 5 to 6 whistles. Then pour them in a bowl use a spoon  to mash the dals. Keep it aside. In a pan heat 2 table spoon oil and fry makhanas until brown or crunchy around 5 minutes. Set them aside. In the same pan again heat 1 table spoon oil and caramelised star anise. Add prepared paste along with turmeric and red chili powder. Fry the masala over medium flame around 5 minutes. Add sugar and broken green chilies. Add boiled chana dal and 1 cup of water. Allow 1 minute to boil the gravy and add salt. Put fried makhanas into the gravy and cook it for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour coconut milk and 1 teaspoon ghee over the gravy. Cook it over medium flame for another 3 to 4 minutes. Off the gas and sprinkle dried methi. As long you allow to soak seeds in gravy, you enhance the deliciousness. Relish  it with any rice or paratha.

547,Fall In Love With Lentils: They Will Love You Back With Their Benefits,food," Barb regularly writes on the topics of food, health and healing. Bring lentils to your family table. Pixabay Lentils may not make it to the tables of the best and fanciest restaurants around the world but they certainly should be on your table. Lentils have long been a secret of the health conscious because of their powerhouse of health and nutritional properties along with the added ease of versatility in cooking. To be honest I had taken a break from lentils many years ago. We had an unfortunate falling out during a morning sickness episode and I just had to steer clear. It didn’t matter how healthy I knew they were. Fast forward about 30 years and I have had a change of heart. It happened as soon as I saw the red variety. Just before the pandemic hit a friend and I were exploring the expanded remodel of a long favorite bulk food warehouse in our area. We’re both into just-in-case basic survival staples to keep on hand and this local establishment has always been great for that. An hour later we were just about done when we hit the bean aisle. Within minutes we were both squealing with glee at the new arrivals. The red lentils immediately stood out for me. I’d been wanting to try them instead for years, anxious to replace the nauseating memory of green lentil sprout casserole with something new, but the other varieties had been difficult to obtain. It didn’t take me more than five seconds to decide to hoist the only 25 pound bag of red lentils left into the shopping cart. I also picked up a 25 pound bag of pinto beans too, but the real prize of the day for me were those red lentils. I didn’t give a second thought to the possibility of not liking them and being stuck with so many and it turned out to be a good call because I still don’t have any regrets and have enough to share for a little while yet. Any Variety Of Lentils Is A Big Deal At $.99 to two dollars or a bit more per pound on average, lentils are an affordable choice of healthy food for everyone. Considering the exceptional nutritional value you’re getting when you choose to buy lentils, you’re getting a great deal.

One of the most convenient things about all lentils is that they don’t require any soaking, although you can if you want to further reduce the cooking time and lessen gas issues. You should always rinse them and discard any that look questionable. Along with your own go to seasonings, all it takes is a good 15 to 30 minutes (depending on variety) of cooking time on low to medium heat and you’ve got yourself a hearty side dish. No excuse for not eating something. healthy at least once or twice a week. Lentil’s abundant fiber content makes it effective in lowering cholesterol as well as keeping blood sugar levels from spiking which is consistently common right after eating. Lentil’s fiber helps to neutralize and tame the gut’s oftentimes acidic state making way for healthy bacterial growth and normal nutrient absorption. Unfortunately when we neglect to consume adequate amounts of fiber our gut becomes a hostile environment that prevents vital bacterial. growth from occurring, precipitating additional problems like constipation, stomach upsets and varying intestinal discomforts While lentil’s fiber can significantly lower. blood cholesterol, it’s high folate and magnesium content also pair together successfully to greatly reduce the risks of heart disease Besides being protein rich, lentils contain generous amounts of several important minerals including a few equally important B vitamins, all necessary building blocks to maintaining good health. Because of its nutrient rich quality, lentils make a suitable food choice to nurse those who are ill back to good health enabling them to regain their strength. You may find a cup or two after a difficult day to be just what you need to relax and recharge. Lentils have a surprisingly mild flavor. That quality makes it ideal for combining with other foods as it easily takes on the flavor of other ingredients, often enhancing whatever dish you’re preparing. They are a welcome addition to any soup or can stand on its own as a first course in any meal plan. It can be puréed and used in protein shakes, as a thickener in gravies, even hidden in cakes or other desserts to improve the nutrient or fiber content. Anything goes with lentils. If you’re trying to lose weight, lentils can be a powerful ally because they have virtually no fat but are extremely high in fiber, protein and other energy producing nutrients. And thanks to that fiber and nutrient density you won’t be feeling hungry if you include lentils in your daily menu planning. Pixabay For a small legume, lentils have much to offer. They’re amazingly affordable and pack more nutrition than the average meal, even an expensive one.

The convenience of being able to bypass pre-soaking and cook them quickly, makes them immediately welcome at dinner tables more often.

It's a great option to have a weekly rotation of what to cook for dinner.

554,How to Make a French Toast?,food," This recipe nourishes a lot and makes about 8-10 slices, depending on the size of the slices of bread. This has a built-in ratio of one egg, one tablespoon of milk, and two slices of bread.When French toast arrives, work with thick slices of French or Italian bread loaves that are several days old. Sweetbreads, challah, and brioche are popular, but simple Texas toast works just fine. During this time, let your slices of bread dry in the air on a wire rack for 1-2 hours before using them.If your bread is stale, you're lucky, just make sure it doesn't mold and you're good to go. Remember that even if it's stale, it still needs an egg in the mix.Fresh, home-baked pieces of the bread begin to dry after a few days, while store-bought products containing special preservatives to keep the crumbs moist take up to a week to dry. If your bread is too soft and you want to prepare this recipe, there is an easy solution for you. Toast bread in a preheated oven for several minutes to make croutons.Buttery brioche is a shameless indulgence, an imitation of trendy local bistros that charge a small fortune. Brioche (my first choice, hands down the most indulgent), like Challah, is excellent and has a similar consistency, but it is not as buttery as a good white Olean bread or any other simple white bread rolled into a baguette and sliced (see my mini- French toast recipe) or as crispy as artisanal bread such as sourdough. Dunk bread of choice is stale, but the best is fried in butter, with a golden floret on the surface and crispy golden edges, then doused with maple syrup.My little secret is that I love French toast with challah bread or thick slices of Sally Lunn bread - they are delicious and simple slices of our favorite sandwich bread. My favorite French toast is with maple syrup and a little butter. I also love French toast, which is made with heavy cream - it's usually made with milk from my fridge.The best recipes are prepared with good bread and a thick mixture of eggs, milk, cream, and spices. The most delicious and best French toast recipes go well with milk, eggs, warm spices, and cinnamon.It is perfect for a relaxing weekend morning or a family holiday. Enjoy a homemade bistro-style dish without changing your pajamas. This recipe is a clever way to turn a boring slice of bread into a stunning gourmet breakfast.French Toast is a classic breakfast with slices of bread, eggs, milk, cinnamon and vanilla sweetener. Cover with peanut butter and jelly, fresh fruit, icing sugar or marshmallow fluff - the possibilities are endless.There are many international versions of how to make French toast, including savory versions that use salt and pepper. This recipe shares the most common and popular versions: slices of bread dipped in a pudding mixture and toasted with butter. A sweet dish, the mixture of French toast and bread pudding is the perfect combination of protein and yogurt to eat for a fun breakfast or as a sweet snack or dessert. To keep it simple and good, we serve with maple syrup and butter. You can also drizzle chocolate syrup over it, but I just like it with the classic maple syrup.In order to avoid tidying up, I mix eggs, milk and sweeteners (vanilla or cinnamon) in a shallow bowl into which I dip my bread. You want to be sure that you dip your bread and do not let it soak in too much liquid for too long. As soon as the dish is whisked, I place my slices of bread on one side, tip them on the other side and burn the bread to absorb the liquid super well.If your bread is fresh, at this point you should dry it out by placing the slices for about 10 minutes on a rack in a 400-degree oven so that the mixture absorbs more when you flip it over. For thicker breads, it takes longer for the pudding to soak and the French toast to be cooked.Pan is optional, but I prefer a pan to hold the bread tightly when dipping. I find that an 11x7 baking pan or a deep dish pan works great for whipping the dough and soaking the two pieces of bread. For example, for two slices of bread, classic French toast requires an egg and 1 / 4 cup of milk.Dip the slices of bread into the egg mixture, dredge with the side down and place on a hot, greased pan. Put the slices into the pan and roast until firm.Cook for a few minutes until the base of the bread slices is golden brown. Dip both sides of your bread into the egg mixture and add to the pan. Cook until the bread is golden brown on the underside, then turn and cook for about a minute until golden brown.Put the eggs in a mixing bowl and add milk, vanilla, cinnamon and sugar. Put all ingredients except the bread in a blender or a shallow bowl and whisk.Stir the dough until smooth, without separation, and then pour it into a shallow bowl, baking dish or cake dish. Add flour to the dough to thicken it (you won't notice it, but it will stop French toast from frying like an egg on bread). Cook French toast as described in the instructions above, and place the toast on a baking tray in the oven at 200 degrees Fahrenheit.

556,6 Secrets on How to Make a Stir-Fry Successfully,food," The author is an engineer by profession and a lover of food. In his free time, he likes to tinker around in the kitchen. How To Make A Stir-Fry? When stir-frying, cut foods into thin, bite-sized pieces so they'll cook quickly. For more cooking tips and stir fry secrets, check out the article. Nothing beats a perfectly cooked Chinese stir-fry with lots of juicy and tender meat and no soggy veggies. It is big on flavor and with the added protein, fresh herbs, and leafy greens, it is a wholesome balanced meal. This Chinese cooking method and technique with all the ingredients fried, stirred, and tossed in a very hot wok is actually easy to make provided you know how. In this article, I will share the secrets to a successful Chinese stir fry so you can fix the common mistakes and dish out the perfect meal, every time. Here are the 6 secrets to successful stir fry: You really need the right pan for stir fry and the best is a wok to cook a great stir-fry especially if it has little sauce. Because a wok with its small base and concave side can distribute heat uniformly. So, it cooks more evenly. The sloping concave sides also make stir-frying easier, preventing food from spilling, and stir-fry tossing is also effortless. The larger cooking surface means you can cook more ingredients. Lastly, a wok has a small base despite having the maximum surface area, hence you need less cooking oil. We usually use the rounded bottom wok and in this part of the world, the metal ring to set the wok over the gas stove comes as a set when you buy the stove. The best size is a 14-inch wok made of carbon steel with a long wooden handle for easier handling. Alternatively, you can opt for the flat base wok if it works best on your cooktop. One of the good things about carbon steel is, it is affordable and durable. It is also However, the downside of carbon steel wok is: you need to season first before using it to get a proper non-stick surface (see the link below under Recommended Reading on how to season carbon steel wok). It is not dishwasher safe and to make it last longer, avoid cooking acidic food as it will mess up its natural non-stick property. If you cannot afford the carbon steel, you can use a cast-iron pan. Cast iron, just like carbon steel, is an alloy of iron and carbon, but with a carbon content of 2 to 3.5 percent carbon. Carbon steel has less carbon at no more than 2 percent. How to Care for a Carbon Steel Wok To clean; soak in hot water for 5 minutes. Then wash under hot running water. Don't use any detergent or scourer. If there are food remains that need to be scrubbed, use salt and rub it over with a damp paper towel. Lastly, wipe the wok dry and apply a little oil. As mentioned earlier, stir-frying uses heat at high temperatures so you need the right cooking oils that perform well at high temperatures. This is the most important secret to a successful stir fry. Thus, your favorite olive oil, butter, ghee, camelina oil, and coconut oil are not suitable. Cooking oils that have high smoke points are palm fruit oil (one of the highest smoke points among cooking oils), sunflower, safflower, grapeseed, avocado, and almond oils. Vegetable oil is a blend of many different refined oils with varying smoke points. Depending on the oils used in the blend, it can go up to only 400˚F. Likewise, peanut oil also has a high smoke point and varies greatly in heat tolerance depending on the brand. Soy, corn, and canola cooking oils have high smoke points but are usually from genetically engineered crops. They can be avoided if you are concerned about GMO food. The stir-frying temperature should be at least 450F. So, it is advisable to use cooking oil with a smoking point higher than 450F. Stir fry needs to be cooked hot and fast. In restaurants, they use high-power gas stoves that give out both gas and oxygen for faster and hotter cooking. You can't get this from your gas stove. So, you have to adapt to get almost close to restaurant quality stir-fries. Set it to the highest heat on your gas stove. Then heat the wok dry with nothing in it for about 5 to 10 minutes. If drops of water sizzle or vaporize immediately, then it is hot enough. Continue to maintain this high heat throughout the frying as the wok is usually made of thin gauge material and doesn't have much 'stored energy or heat'. You also want the flames to rise up the sides of the wok. Add cold cooking oil only after the wok is really hot. Roll the oil around to coat it well as the ingredients will get pushed to the sides during frying. If you don't have a gas stove, your outdoor coal-fired grill is actually great or even better for fry-up food. The heat from this grill is pretty close to the Chinese restaurant's high-power gas stoves. But you need the removable center flap grill grate (see photo below) for your coal-fired grill. It will be easier to place your wok over. I used something similar, which unfortunately is not listed on Amazon, but that grill grate is just as good. Use this removable center grill grate for your coal-fired grill to place your wok over when you do stir fry recipe Even though a wok is made of thin gauge material and doesn't have much 'stored heat' it regains its heat significantly faster than a skillet. That's why a wok, designed for fast heat, is perfect for stir fries. Remember we said earlier that stir fry needs to be cooked hot and fast? So, preparing all the ingredients in advance is essential. Place them in bowls near your stove in the order of cooking, so you can stir-fry quickly in that hot wok. Do the following: All the ingredients (veggies, meat, chicken, seafood, etc) must be pad dry thoroughly with a paper towel. Otherwise, moistures can lead to steaming and will kill your stir-fry. Adding veggies with high water content such as bean sprouts will also mess up your stir fry as their moistures will be added to your cooking. Choose only vegetables that contain less water after being cooked such as broccoli florets, green beans, broccolini, carrots, bell peppers, celery, snow peas, sugar snap peas, baby corn, etc. for the perfect stir-fry vegetables. If you like bok choy, choose the variety that has thicker stems and smaller leaves. Do not use ice-cold meat in your stir fry as the cooking temperature will drop. Also, any frozen meat must be thoroughly defrosted and any balance of moistures to be pat dry with paper towels. Meat must be in thin slices or in small pieces. All the ingredients (veggies, meat, chicken, etc) must be cut into similarly-sized pieces for even cooking. If you are serving Chinese stir fry with rice or noodles, prepare them before you start your stir-fry as stir-fries are best served hot. Slicing meat against the grain will shorten the meat fibers, which makes meat tender Velveting is another important secret to a successful stir fry but is often ignored. Velveting meat will make stir-fries taste better. It is a technique that creates a protective barrier that seals in the meat's moisture and prevents it from being overcooked and hence, tough. So, if you are using beef (or chicken, turkey, prawn, etc) for your stir fry, coat the beef in the mixture of 1 egg white, 1 tbsp rice wine (or sesame oil), 2 tbsp cornstarch, and a pinch of salt and marinate the meat in the fridge for at least 1 hour (for a half kilo beef, and slice meat in thin strips). This will lock in the juices and keep the meat moist when you cook over high heat. Then boil the beef in simmering water for 2 minutes, strain, and pat dry with a paper towel before stir fry. Velveting your beef or chicken will give moist and succulent meat. Now that you know this often neglected secret to a successful stir fry, apply this technique for all your stir-fries. If you are using homemade stir fry sauce instead of the ready-made store-bought sauce, prepare them earlier before starting your stir fry. Get your stir fry spatula ready for your stir fry. It has a longer handle compared to the usual wooden spatula or spoon used in western cooking. As stir fry is over a very hot temperature, the longer handle prevents your hand from getting burnt by the hot air. It also has a larger surface with sloped and sharper edges to easily stir, scrape and move the ingredients. Prep Work: Preparing all ingredients in advance is one of the key secret to a successful stir fry When you add too many ingredients and overcrowd the wok, two things will happen: Stir-fry has to be sizzling and not steaming. So, if you have a lot of ingredients, stir fry them in batches allowing the wok to reheat in between each addition. Since proteins and vegetables have different cooking times, cook them separately. Sort out your proteins (beef, chicken, seafood) and veggies into half-pound portions. Once your wok has reached the 'hotness level' as described earlier, pour in the cooking oil and begin cooking. Stir fry the portions one at a time letting them sears before setting them aside. Wipe your wok with a paper towel and bring it to high heat just like before. Then cook the next portions, and so on. It is best to stir fry the protein portions first before doing the veggies. For the veggies, start with veggies that need longer cooking time, e.g. carrots, before moving on to the quick frying veggies like mushrooms. Stir-frying is done over high heat, but you need to turn it down before adding the aromatics. They must be cooked low and slow. Aromatics give additional flavor to your stir fry, but they must be added only in the last part of the cooking, before adding the sauce. You can use a small amount of finely chopped fresh ginger, garlic, lemongrass, chilies, or green onions (scallion). Add all the cooked protein and the veggie portions back in and give everything a quick toss (you are not reheating them). If you have a stir fry sauce, this is the time to add it in. Pushed all the ingredients to the sides creating an empty space then, pour the sauce in. Once the sauce starts to darken and bubble, do the final toss until every piece is coated. Serve with your cooked rice or noodles. Velveting and Adding Garlic are the Magic Secrets to a Successful Chinese Stir-Fry If you prefer not to add any aromatics to your stir fry, please consider adding garlic for a better flavor. This is an additional step that you will not regret. As mentioned earlier, add minced garlic and/or other aromatics in the last part of the cooking, before adding the sauce.

558,Bountiful Bistro: Not Your Normal Food Hub,food," Patricia is a retired English teacher who at one time ran a baking business from her home. If you’ve ever visited the iconic over-55 community in Florida known as The Villages, You probably noticed that every fast food venue ever created has found a home there, along with a bevy of restaurant chains such as Applebee’s, TGI Fridays, Perkins, etc. in addition to many upscale dining establishments. If you’re ever in the area and find yourself in the mood for food that’s organic, farm grown, and absolutely delicious, however, you might want to visit a family-owned food gem known as Bountiful Bistro. Located-literally-in a field at 27314 County Road in Okahumpka, Florida, Bountiful Bistro is particularly unique in that dining tables are situated outside in a circle under a massive oak tree, while its kitchen and restrooms are situated inside a trailer. Much of the “bounty” served at the Bistro is grown organically at Bountiful Farms, which opened in 2013. (The Bistro opened on December 4, 2018.) Owners Jessica and Gareth Gentry met when they were attending (what else?) culinary school. The Gentrys went on to work in various restaurants together before establishing the farm and, several years later, the restaurant, which features seasonal crops (120 varieties) grown at the farm. A local pie maker provides the Bistro with desserts. A look at the menu might be enough to entice you to visit Bountiful Bistro. (Reservations are strongly advised!) The appetizers include, among other tasty offerings, fresh corn chips, heirloom tomato salsa, sweet potato fries and tempura vegetables. One of the many tempting salad offerings is the Fresh and Fruity, which features spinach, lettuces, blueberries, strawberries, cinnamon, and honey roasted pecans served with lemon balsamic vinaigrette. One of the sandwich options is The Beat, which includes smoked bacon, carmalized onions, avocado, lettuce, and heirloom tomatoes served on activated charcoal bread. (I must admit that “activated charcoal bread“ didn’t sound all that appealing, but when I tasted it, I was pleasantly surprised.) Word has it that two German shepherds, one of whom actually understands German, roam the grounds of Bountiful Bistro. Some of us attempted to address the dogs auf Deutsch, but they didn’t seem to be interested in communicating in a foreign tongue. They were a handsome addition to the outdoor dining experience, though. If you’d like to take a taste of Bountiful Bistro home with you, a farm stand is conveniently located on the grounds behind the restaurant. According to their website, Bountiful Bistro is open Monday through Saturday, 9-5, from October through May (which marks the end of the growing season). So…if you’re planning a trip to The Villages, you might want to include a visit (or two) to Bountiful Bistro in your itinerary. Your taste buds will be forever grateful!"

I do not have the exact numbers or percentages, but I would wager that the totals are fantastic. Ice cream's original locales are known to go back as far as the second century B.C., although no specific time or date of origin nor inventor's names has been indisputably credited with its delicious discovery. It is a fact that Alexander the Great appreciated snow and ice flavored with honey and nectar. Biblical references also show that King Solomon was fond of iced drinks during harvesting. I have loved ice cream since the age of ten. No matter what flavor, I just loved the ice cream simple as that. But when I came across this Peach Ice Cream, I knew that I was onto something delicious. And had to learn how to make it. (Below is the secret.) This recipe is not hard to create. And more fun to enjoy with family and friends. Ingredients: Directions: Step 1See how simple this recipe is! In a big bowl, mix the eggs and sugar until smooth; puree peaches in blender, then stir 5 cups of puree into egg mixture. Stir in cream, half-and-half, vanilla and salt and mix thoroughly. Step 2You're almost home. Pour mixture into freezer canister of ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions. Servings depend on number of family members and friends who will be attending.July 12, 2021_________________________________________________ These URL's Appear on This Hub: https://www.pexels.com/photo/selective-focus-photography-of-person-holding-ice-cream-1625235/ https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Peach_ice_cream_GODIVA.jpg This is so delicious that I have no adjectives to describe it. © 2021 Kenneth Avery Ashly Christen from Illinois on July 14, 2021: Oh my goodness!

566,My Mother's Secret Hand Pie Recipe,food," Kenneth Avery is a Southern humorist with well over a thousand fans. The charm and wit in his writing span a nearly a decade. No matter the flavor, it's all great. WRITER'S NOTE: let me quickly-explain the workings of this piece. This is from my mother, one of the best cooks in the south, probably the nation. Truth is, I ""stole"" this recipe while hiding in our kitchen closet behind a curtain. I used short breaths. I worked so hard to not make a noise that I was quiter than a church mouse. The ingredients of this delightful offering may not match your recipe of this same pie, but the outcome was always delicious. Thanks, Kenneth. The hand-pie is a blur to those who are curious about it's origin. But with good solid reading, I find that the hand-pie finds its place near the first of the 1800's in the early south and its roots have been discovered as far as the desert lands in Egypt. And if the hand-pie wants to stand and brag a bit, who can blame it. I love hand-pies. Any hand-pie. They can come in most any flavor--apple, blueberry, peach, and my favorite, chocolate, which I am sharing. And again, I watched every move that my mom made and although I didn't have a pencil and paper to record her ingredients, I did manage to call it from my memory. But with that process comes the hunger that accompanies the text. Ingredients For The Crust: ⦁ 3 cups of self-rising flour. Sift until the flour is a fine dust. ⦁ 1/2 cup of sweet milk. ⦁ 11/2 teaspoons of processed sugar. ⦁ 1/2 teaspoons of salt or salt substitute. ⦁ 2 cups or four Hershey bars or Hershey's cocoa--depending on the number of pies to be made. ⦁ 11/2 cups of water Preparation: Take the flour included with the ingredients and be patient. You will have to roll it out, as my mother would say, and it's true. You may feel or look as if the flour is okay, but you need to hold on for another five minutes. While you are rolling the flour, sift a little more flour on the surface as you finish.Add the Hershey's cocoa into a complete covering of the square rolled from the dough. Now add the processed sugar and 11/2 cups of water.Cut the hand-pie into oval shapes so the pie will have one long edge. Now you can take your fork and use the tines to mash hard enough to make impressions into the edge of the dough of flour. Wash each pie with egg fold and completely-cover the areas of the pie.Bake for 20 minutes at 350 degrees. To make good hand-pies, this temperature is not exact, so use your own judgment. If you use this recipe, thanks, and my mother also thanks you.

568,"Mouth-Watering, Hot Chili's Great Anytime of Year Homemade Recipe",food," Kenneth, born and raised in the South, resides in Hamilton, Alabama. He enjoys sharing his unique perspectives on life through his writing. This is the ultimate result of some delicious homemade chili. There's hardly a place in this country that when you mention chili, a half-dozen strangers will tell you either the best restaurant where to eat it, or they will instruct you on how to make it. Briefly, people love chili. Warm, hot, super-hot, chili is the ""King of Comfort Food,"" and there is not a food that can considered a competitor.Now. If you want good chili, the homemade chili, in my honest viewpoint, is the best. And while this is not a knock on restaurants that cook chili, I only speak from my personal experience. And you will find that along with the many temperatures that people love about their chili, there are as many names of the homemade chili as there are recipes. I can only share the names of the homemade chili that I know, because there are too many to be named. There is ""Bama Screamer,"" ""Texas Torch,"" ""Honest-to-God Chili"" (made famous by the western icon, Wyatt Earp, and ""Sudden Happiness."" Like I said. There are many out there. But the only name of my homemade chili that I am concerned is in my headline. So let's move on to the ""meat"" (no pun intended) of this tasty recipe. This is some of the hottest chili pepper in the world: Cayenne.  Be forewrned. The first three paragraphs speak to the point about my chili being great 'anytime,' is because there is not one or two months of whatever season to love chili. I know folks who eat chili i the middle of July as well as the coldest time of the year: January. Chili, and mine included, (I must brag some) is that good. My homemade chili is that that tough to make. Really. It's easier than you think. If you are making this chili for you or your companion or for a house full of friends who love to eat chili and have a good night, then you are in great shape. In a few short minutes, your ""ticket to paradise,"" will be given to you. Before we go any further, this recipe, I say 'mine,' is not that accurate because my late daughter, Angie, created the recipe and I only tweaked it a bit, but not much. Angie was the light of our lives. She went home to Heaven in Feb. 16, 2011, from a sickness in her lungs that didn't go away. She gave us a pot of this chili and our then-pastor came by to eat chili and he could not talk for a few minutes because of the heat. I am not kidding. But Iam going to share the recipe with you and Angie's recipe took more than the one I'm giving you here, because I used on the basic ingredients, but I tell you, this chili is hot and delicious. Ingredients: ⦁ One pound of ground chuck (more depending on you, your companion, children or friends. ⦁ One diced (greatly) white onion. ⦁ One large piece of garlic. ⦁ Two diced hot garden pepper. ⦁ Three diced Cayenne red chili pepper. ⦁ Three diced Habanero pepper (depending on how hot the group votes for).⦁ One or two diced bell pepper. ⦁ Four spoonfuls of Cayenne pepper powder. ⦁ Three spoonfuls of Garlic powder. ⦁ One half spoonful of salt substitute. ⦁ One spoonful of Black Pepper. ⦁ 10 to 15 teaspoons (measure carefully) Frank's Insanity Sauce (primarily used for hot wings). ⦁ 3 cans of Mexican style stewed tomatoes. ⦁ 3 cans of dark Kidney Beans (can be left out if people do not want ""just"" chili.). ⦁ Two spoonfuls of Worcestershire sauce. Preparation: Put your ground chuck in a pan and let brown; season with salt and black pepper. When meat is brown, put into a large pot with all of the (above) ingredients added slowly and stir as you drop the ingredients. Then add bottom full of water. Stir again. When all of the ingredients is now stewing, put on low heat and let simmer for Six Hours, for that great and yet, hot chili that everyone will love. (Depending on put) Serves Six. I doubt seriously if you have any of this great chili left. Before we used Angie's Chili Recipe, two years ago, my buddies and I made some ""Honest-to-God"" chili mix and fixings. This was rumored that this chili (Wyatt Earp's) let it sit in an iron skillet for one full day. The reason why is because before Earp started to eat this tasty dish, he was called away on a bit of law work. If you do come out with left-overs, you can put the remainder in a freezer bag and freeze it for another time.

569,You Are Invited to Try My Ultimate Super Cheeseburger Recipe,food," Kenneth Avery is a Southern humorist with well over a thousand fans. The charm and wit in his writing span a nearly a decade. This is my favorite version of my Ultimate Super Cheeseburger. First of all, let me tell you that I am completely-serious with this hub. Second. I know that I am crawling out of a limb with this one, but what harm could it do? There is no mention of guns, gun-play, fist-fights, gang violence, drug sales, police brutllity  sexual harassment and those that I cannot mention. I make a terrible research editor. America, by and large, is still a great place to be born, live, go to school, work, get married to a great-looking girl and best of all, eat. Yes. Eat one or two of my Ultimate Super Burgers until you have to sit down in a cool place, take a long nap, and do it again. And this is when we go off the rails. What I mean by 'eat' is in America there are so many different food tastes and it would take me (estimated) 10 hubs and more to complete them for publishing. When I was a kid, I was strictly a fried chicken and potatoes man. That was until my brother-in-law turned me onto the all-American food: the hamburger. I was very excited. My brother-in-law always thought on a higher level. One day he took me and my folks to a local state-owned lake and then we had a barbecue. I was still excited. Even when he rolled-out the fresh ground chuck and laid it gently on the grill and the aroma hit me like a truck. Without one bite, I was hooked. I just had to eat one hamburger. The first bite of my burger was as delicious as the last. My dad and mom were stunned. He never eats this much. Something is wrong, he said to my mom, who only bowed her head to pray for me. I was busy asking my brother-in-law to please give me one more burger. He chuckled and agreed. My sister whispered to him that she thought that I had a mental deficiency due to my instant love for hamburgers. My brother-in-law just grinned. As time went on, my love for hamburgers increased. I remember a time when one of those national restaurant chains had burgers for fifteen cents and I begged my dad until I was blue in the face until he took me to this restaurant just so I could pig-out on these cheap burgers. He gave in, but was not happy about it. When he, my mom, and I got there, my dad and mom ate burgers like old pro's. Guess this is the ""burger love"" that my folks handed down on me when I was born. There is no other explanation. As more time went by, I thought about cooking my own brand of hamburger and stop paying some other business to cook my favorite food. Then on one early fall Saturday afternoon, I went for it. And I had a co-pilot, my best friend, Ken ""Wild Man"" Stone, one of the guys I struck-up a good friendship in high school, who was visiting me on that particular Saturday. I took the ingredients and took the burger patties out to my grill and (below) is how the Ultimate Super Burger Recipe was born. My recipe is so simple that anyone can make it, cook it and serve to family and friends. Delicious anytime. Ingredients (Depending on your family or friends)1-3 lbs. Fresh Ground Chuck Sliced Sharp Cheese Roll-out Number of Burger Patties Sprinkle Lightly Worcestershire Sauce Apply Frank's Red Hot Sauce (In the Middle of Each Burger) Place Diced White Onion Bits, Hot Garden Pepper Diced Place Diced Celery with The Other Ingredients Place another Hamburger Patty on top of the one that you have just prepared and prepare it with the dented place in the middle with the same fixings. Then more sliced sharp cheese on top of the bun. Make sure that the top of the hamburger bun has mustard. No catsup, unless it is called for. You may substitute Frank's Hot Sauce on top of bun instead of catsup if you like. Preparation ⦁ Have your grill already hot before cooking. In short, cooking your burgers too fast will eliminate a lot of juicy taste from them. ⦁ Your burgers have been prepare, so now, lay burgers with half-inch space between burger patties to give each patty enough space to breathe. ⦁ Lay grill hood/plain grill over burgers but lay something over them because you have already patted them, but do not turn them now. Added cooking will add to the wonderful taste. ⦁ Turn burgers slowly, and you can choose a volunteer to try (just) a bite of one burger and let them decide. What you want are burgers that haven't cooked too long. ⦁ Makes (depending on number of guests) six to seven people.Serve with potato chips, sweet tea, and potato salad. Enjoy! But keep in mind that these burgers will have a tasty juice that was made by the ingredients placed in the middle of the patties. But the great taste of the burgers will be so good that you will not care. WARNING: this is a really big cheeseburger, so do not try to eat them fast. Take your time. Like most folks, most people are satisfied with one of my Ultimate Super Cheeseburgers. Sure you can have more after you relax.

570,Noodle Bacon - Long Potstickers,food," The original recipe made 80 dumplings. I cut the recipe in half and modified a little. 2 cups of flour that had chicken broth added instead of water. Just enough to make a dough. Once it's moved beyond being sticky by adding flour to the outside, it is refrigerated to thicken the batter. (The meat and other filling ingredients were placed in a food processor and chopped together. Refrigerate until needed.) Then, they are filled and placed in a pan with oil and water. This steams the noodle and crisps the outside. My noodles were fairly long. Filled. Fried and steamed. Reminded me of bacon. Noodle bacon. The recipe called for water. I used chicken broth instead. I put the flour in the big cup and added the broth and stirred it around. It becomes a ball. Sprinkle extra flour on ball to make less sticky. It is helpful at this point to make it into a snakelike piece, then refrigerate. Later, a small piece is cut off and rolled thin, and filled. I used plastic wrap to roll out my flat piece. The ball needs to be about the size of a quarter. I started out with pieces that were the size of a golf ball and ended up with pieces of dough that were squished flat, but were about six inches long, and three inches wide. I just went with it. I placed my meat mixture in a five inch snake across the middle. I then folded the dough over the meat. I squished the edges together and after I had all my dough filled, I placed them in a frying pan with some oil and water. The pan is heated and covered. Ignore the pan for about fifteen minutes. Then, flip the long pieces over. There should be a nice, golden browning on the bottom. Repeat for other side. Ignore and then, they are done. Pull a piece of dough off and place on plastic wrap. Make sure you have coated it with flour so it doesn't stick to plastic. Fold plastic over it, take a rolling pin and mash it into a longer flat shape. Once it is flattened out as thin as you can get it, place a finger sized log of meat mixture across the middle of the flattened area. Pull up on the plastic wrap, and fold the dough over the meat mixture. Pat the edges closed. Repeat in this manner until you have a pan worth of filled noodles.

571,"Oysters Are Perfect For Date Night, Any Night or Occasion (Recipe)",food," Kenneth Avery is a Southern humorist with well over a thousand fans. The charm and wit in his writing span a nearly a decade. What a feast of delicious food. If I try to tell you all about oysters, I will go into a spin and then burn-out. I want to do this right or not at all. Let's talk about what is an oyster? An oyster is a common tag for a number of various families of salt-water bivalve molluscs that thrive in marine or brackish locales. In some species, the valves are highly calcified, and many are quite irregular in shape. Many, but not all oysters are in the super-family Ostreoidea. Varied types of oysters are eastern, consumed cooked ,or raw, in some locales oysters are regarded as a delicacy. A few types of pearl oysters are harvested for the pearl within the mantle. Window pane oysters are harvested for their translucent shells, which are used to make various kinds of colorful objects All that I know is that I love them. No matter where I might be--in a mall or in a car going on an outing. Oysters love to be taken on rides, and so I accommodate them the very best that I can do. My wife, Pam, does not like oysters. I've asked her several times why, but she simply replies, thy are not my cup of tea. The Men, who found and exploited oysters (and other shellfish) had many (and new) advantages and chances to live and thrive, than their ancestors of 100,000 or 20,000 years prior. There are many reasons for this. I wagered that my followers needed a bit more background about oysters. On the average, 787 million pounds of oysters are eaten yearly by Americans with a price tag valued at $218 million. Pretty good if you are oyster shucker. I want to share this easy-to-fix recipe for you who love oysters. This recipe is fondly called the Oyster Rockefeller With Sharp Cocktail Sauce. Oysters Rockefeller Recipe 8.8oz / 250g Chicken Breast, sliced into clean strips1 tsp Fresh Red Chilli, finely diced (adjust to taste)1 tsp Garlic, minced--fresh Garlic.1 tsp Ginger, minced finely1-2 tbsp Vegetable OilSalt & Black Pepper Sauce2 tbsp Dark Soy Sauce1 tbsp Oyster Sauce1/2 Fresh Lime1/2 tsp Brown Sugar1/4 tsp White PepperVeg & Noodles5.3oz / 150g Dried NoodlesDrizzle of Sesame Oil--measure carefully.2.6oz / 75g Mangetout4-6 Mushrooms, sliced3 Green Onions, sliced into approx 1.5"" chunks2 medium Carrots, peeled & sliced into strips1 Red Pepper/Capsicum, sliced into stripsGarnishDiced Green Onion, freshCrushed Toasted PeanutsSesame SeedsLime Wedges Instructions: all of the ingredients for sauce and place to one side.Mix noodles according to packet directions, drain, toss with a good drizzle of sesame oil.

Give everything a good toss to ensure the sauce spreads evenly and the chicken heats through. Enjoy On a personal note, Okay. Now you can trufhfully-say that I gave you a very good oyster recipe that you, your family, and friends can enjoy at anytime of the week, season or holiday. And if you do any research any site with oyster recipes, you will find that they (oysters) are ready and availble in most any bar or restaurant. You might be amazed at the throngs of fans you will find who love oysters. Personally, my wife, Pam, and a couple of friends with to Tupelo, Miss., for a New Year's Get-Together and we went on a Saturday afternoon so we would have time to eat. We ate at this place (which shall remain nameless because it went out of business) and the men ate raw oysters on the half-shell with the spicy cocktail sauce. The ladies ate some sort of oyster soup, but no one was complaining when our meal was finished. Honestly, I loved the raw oysters so well, that I think that I put down a near-dozen because as any expert oyster connoisseur will tell you . . .you don't have to eat them, just hold your mouth right and the oysters will do the rest.Oysters fried or fresh are always a good dinner-starter before the main meal. Don't worry if there is any tension among the amateur oyster fans, it should take just moments to teach those good people just how easy it is to enjoy the oysters of their choice.

574,Chicken And Dumplings: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (Recipe),food," Kenneth, born and raised in the South, resides in Hamilton, Alabama. He enjoys sharing his unique perspectives on life through his writing. Chicken and dumplings can't be beat. Chicken and dumplings is in essence, a soup that's made of a chicken cooked in water, with the result chicken broth used to cook the dumplings by boiling. A dumpling—in this sense—is biscuit dough, which is a mixture of flour, shortening, and liquid (water, milk, buttermilk, or chicken stock). The dumplings are either rolled out flat, dropped or formed into a ball. That's what chicken and dumplings are, and you can find them most everywhere--the mid-west, east coast, but mostly in the place where they originated: the deep south. Actually, it's tough to find anyone who has not tasted (and fell in love)with this simple dish that is oh so delicious. I admit it. I was a finicky eater from age three until seven, but when my mom asked me to try her chicken and dumplings, I laughed. Then cried because she was serious. Since that golden moment, I have been crazy about most foods, but crazed as a Wildeebeest on whiskey for chicken and dumplings. And I know going in that I am not the only Chicken and Dumpling Addict. So let's walk right. Here is The Easy to Fix Chicken and Dumplings Recipe:⦁ 7 lbs. cut up chicken piece⦁ 4 cups chicken stock⦁ 2 onions, chopped⦁ 3 stalks celery, chopped⦁ 3 tsp. salt⦁ 1 egg⦁ ¼ cup milk⦁ 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour, divided⦁ 1 ½ tsps. baking powder⦁ 2 tbsp. unsalted butter⦁ 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley⦁ 1 cup water⦁ ½ teaspoon ground black pepper In a large pot put chicken pieces and add chicken stock, onion, celery and 2 tsp. salt. Put heat on medium low then simmer, almost half covered, 15 to 20 minutes or until chicken is tender. Prepare Dumplings: In a big mixing bowl beat together egg and milk. Add 1 cup flour, remaining salt and baking powder and mix all together. Cut the butter into the flour mixture until the mixture is crumbly. Add 1 tbsp. parsley and mix. In around six large spoonfuls, drop dumpling mixture onto top of simmering chicken. Cover pot letting all simmer for 10 minutes more. Sure. I concede that chicken and dumplings may not look that attractive, like a oyster with a hang-over, but once that chicken broth and that succulent dumpling hits your tongue, you are a goner. If you are eating chicken and dumplings for the first time in a restaurant, you may not want to leave. You end-up eating so many helpings of this great dish that the manager (who doubles as a manager for a local bar) and says, don't ya' think that you've had enough? I may have went overboard, but it could happen. Chicken and dumplings, if you didn't know it, makes a great Christmas or Thanksgiving dinner for family and friends. This dish is not hard to make. Fact: it's fun to make chicken and dumplings. This delicacy may overtake our national bird, the turkey, as our National Food. I tell you right here, strange things are happening all over America. I would wager to bet $5.00 cash that some Hollywood celebrities love to binge-eat chicken and dumplings when they are all alone in their huge penthouse with nothing to do. Not even a pretty girl dinner guest. The male celebrity can hold his chest out and say with pide, who needs a pretty girl to barge up here and devour my chicken and dumplings when I can do that all by myself. This is a very wise Hollywood star. Speaking of stars. I wish that I could contact (you can help me) contact the committee that hands-out those golden Hollywood stars on a sidewalk where crowds gather along with the press to see what famous person is now a public name. Possibly, Sting of the Police, remember him, is possibly a great fan of chicken and dumplings. So is ""The Boss,"" Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. When they get off the road from a long tour, nothing is better for Springsteen to take his band to his home and cook enough chicken and dumplings to please the entire crowd. Ahhh, the glamourous life. Here is a short list of Hollywood stars who eat chicken and dumplings every opportunity that they get.⦁ Dolly Parton⦁ Jennifer Lawrence⦁ Martha Stewart⦁ Willie Nelson⦁ Taylor Swift⦁ Tim McGraw and Faith Hill⦁ Kelly Clarkston I know that these stars are only a few who love chicken and dumplings, so forgive me. I did not want to write a thousand names because space is limited. You will notice that my name is not on this celebrity list? I am not a Hollywood star and that's why. If all of the Beatles, they might have said yeah, yeah, yeah, to eating chicken and dumplings, who knows? It's possible. But in all sincerity, I do love chicken and dumplings just the way that they are. My wife, Pam, makes these treats often and doesn't have to toss any away after we eat. My mom, rest her soul, was great at cooking chicken and dumplings. Her and Pam teamed-up one year and make chicken and dumplings for my dad, sister, and husband and let me tell you. There was hardly any left. In closing, if you ever want to hurt me deep, convince me that I need to go on a diet that has no chicken and dumplings. Seriously.

Like most produce in the market, it's not picked ripe since it would be gross by the time you received it. Such is life. In as much as that is concerned, you have to peel them to find their flavor. When you slice them, I found removing the ends first was a good idea. It's rind, and green anyways. Slice across in thumb width spacing. The rings will have seeds in them. Gently scrape them off using a blunt butter knife. Have a pail handy to catch the slop. Then, use a sharp knife to remove the peel. Only leave orange. Green is bad. Discard green. Gather up and slice peeled strips. Place chunks in bowl. These can be stored in refrigerator for 3 days or until they get moldy. Yes, now just slice them. Cutter has first dibs on the juicy pieces."

585,Cook The Temperature You Want Using The Thermapen ONE Cooking Thermometer,food," An old friend once told me there are only 10 people in the world and 8 of them are hamburger. Now you might argue that his number count is so off as to be silly, but when it comes to hamburger there are a lot of people who give it a thumbs up. As they do to all kinds of food that you cook — be it from the animal kingdom or something leafy or boiling in a pot. There’s all kinds of things you can cook and they all take time — time which is often measured in temperature, for example, “cook xxxx for 20 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 390 degrees” Now cooking something based on time is easy because you can use a stopwatch or your wristwatch or the wall clock or whatever that is telling the time and just watch as the minutes add up to what is needed. But that doesn’t mean the food is cooked correctly, because time is arbitrary while basing the cooking time on the food’s temperature is better. Not just more efficient but better because it means that the food won’t be overcooked and so junky. That calls for running into a phone booth and turning into Super Coking Thermometer. Or better yet into the Thermapen ONE Cooking Thermometer. The Thermapen ONE has a lot going for it, which is why it’s not some pencil thin device like others of its genre are. It’s hefty enough to let you get a good grip on it, and big enough for the LCD screen that is its main contact with the person holding it to be easily seen — not needing the eyeballs of a 15 year old and ignoring the lack of those eyeballs on older folks. As its only function is to give you a temperature reading, it makes sense that the temperature probe cavaliers out from its body and is long enough so that you’re not putting your hand right up to the food (or the heat that is there either). The LCD display mentioned earlier has been factory set to be accurate and Thermaworks makes a big deal out of this as they should. Because regardless of whether you’re looking at Fahrenheit or Celsius, it had better be accurate. So maybe it’s overkill that they include a NIST-traceable calibration certificate, but we’re not going near anybody that takes it to that level — it’s crazy good but c’mon. So you’ve picked up the Thermapen ONE (having chosen F or C already). The battery inside is working because it’s a replaceable “AAA” and not rechargeable that should last for about 2000 hours without backlight or well over 1000 hours if using backlight is a biggie (like who doesn’t have a few “AAA”s on hand anyway?). No ON switch to worry about because it turns itself on when you pick it up and goes to sleep when you put it back down (and yes you can set the “sleep” mode or disable it). Doesn’t matter whether you are a lefty or righty since the display will auto rotate what it shows to accommodate, even when turning this thermometer upside down. You don’t need to squint either or turn on a backlight because a sensor will look to see if the light is low and, if it is, turn on the LCD’s back light for you. We’re not psycho to the point of having to describe how we used this cooking thermometer on food in excruciating detail, but the best part of the Thermapen ONE is how fast it reacts — as in one second (imagine how useful that is for a poke when pulling out the air fryer basket for a quick check-- we can because that's what we did with it). The factory setting is at 1 degree but you can change that but right now we’re just talking about a fast response. Which is good when dealing with anything you can stick the probe into (and really good for a fast reading before closing the lid on the BBQ grill). The range is 58-572F/-49-299C, with accuracy of +/-1.8F/+/-1C. That will do Pig, that will do And that it’s balanced nicely so holding it isn’t a cramped hand in the making helps too. The Thermapen ONE comes in a lot of colors. Lot and lots of colors. Plus it’s IP67 waterproof so it can handle the environment probably better than us humans.

586,Deep Fryer Oil - Clarifying with a Raw Potato,food," We deep fry pretty regularly around our home, so there is a layer in the bottom of accumulated coatings that have settled. They needed to be out. I poured the oil into a bowl and ran it through a fine screen. The fryer, itself, needed scraped out with a spatula. The remaining oil has no chunks in it, but it's a deep brown color. It needs to be clarified. As I recall, if you deep fry some peeled, sliced raw potatoes, the potatoes suck up the yucky stuff. Well. I think we intend to eat these potatoes, but the oil should be prepped for getting another frying or two out of it.  After I clarify it, I'm cooking fish. Timer beeps. My deep fryer generally takes 13 minutes to heat up. Green light. It's good to go. Drop fries in."
587,How to Make Instant Ramen Better and Healthier,food," The author is an engineer by profession and a lover of food. In his free time, he likes to tinker around in the kitchen. Instant ramen or instant noodles are precooked and dried ramen packed with flavoring and seasoning powder. It is the best food option when I am too lazy to cook. They are cheap, simple, and quick to make but not necessarily healthy. With a few add-ons that include protein, fiber, and probiotics, you can make instant ramen taste better and healthier. So, jazz it up with the following instant ramen hacks. How to Make Instant Ramen Better & Healthier In this article, I discuss 6 easy ways to upgrade and make instant ramen better and healthier with the following proteins, fiber, and probiotics add-ons: I also discuss how to make ramen, not only healthy but also make it a balanced meal. With the exception of certain probiotics, the above add-ons go well with all types of instant ramen or instant noodles. Eggs are the easiest way to add protein to instant ramen. I prefer soft-boiled eggs for a soft yolk and solid white. Boiling it for 7 minutes will give you this firm but soft yolk. After boiling, transfer the egg to an ice bath to cool and to stop the cooking process. Once cooled, peel the egg and slice it in half. Finally, place it on top of your cooked ramen (prepared as per instructions on your ramen package). Enjoy this healthy instant ramen. Other options are hard-boiled eggs or poached eggs. To prepare a poached egg, crack open a raw egg into the cooked ramen then cover for 2 minutes (don't stir the egg). Or you can simmer eggs directly in the ramen - beat egg with a fork until the yolk and white are combined. Then pour the beaten egg in. Beef and chicken are the other good protein add-ons for your quick meal. I prefer thinly sliced beef with my instant ramen instead of chunky beef cubes. It is easier to eat and looks presentable. Follow the cooking instruction on the ramen package and add the thinly sliced beef together with ramen noodles and seasoning. Let it simmer for 2 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Alternatively, you can cook the sliced beef with the seasoning/sauce first. Then add the noodles. You can also prepare your very own healthy ramen seasoning. I use chicken breast cut into small cubes and boil with instant ramen noodles and seasonings. You can also slice roast chicken and top it in your bowl of cooked instant ramen. Or stir fry chicken cubes with garlic and onion and add it to the cooked ramen. How to make instant noodles better?Add protein for healthier instant noodles or ramen with eggs, prawns, fish ball, fish cakes, sliced beef or chicken Seafood is an excellent source of high-protein, omega-3s, iron, B, and D vitamins and is low in calories and saturated fat. It doesn't take long to cook seafood, yet you get a full-bodied flavor, just right for your instant ramen. You can go overboard with a handful of mixed seafood that includes squid rings, prawns, scallops, mussels, cooked snow crab meat, and clams. Or use them on their own. For prawns, devein and remove the head and tail. I prefer to boil them together with the noodles but you can also sauté or grill the seafood. Then top the noodles with the cooked seafood. Don't overcook them as they can be chewy. If you prefer fish, the white fish fillet is a good choice. Cut them into 1.5 cm thick slices. You can either boil it with noodles or sauté or grill it. If you use frozen seafood, DON'T thaw at room temperature but thaw in the fridge overnight. Fish balls and fish cakes are great additions to noodles and are very popular in most parts of East and Southeast Asia. Fish balls are typically made with the flesh of mackerel fish, salt, and flour and are usually ""bouncy”. Fishcakes are also similarly made but with the addition of eggs. You don't have to prepare them as the store-bought ready-made fish balls and fish cakes are just as good. They are usually cooked through so it is good for the 3 minute instant noodle cook time. You can use the fishballs or fishcakes, or both for your noodles. For the fishcakes, cut them thinly into few slices. Just add them together with the instant noodle, boil, and serve. You can also swap or add shrimp balls and crab balls for added flavors. Dietary fiber is another essential component of a healthy meal. The easiest way to add fiber to instant ramen is to put in vegetables. That's how to make ramen more filling. Since cooking time is about 3 minutes, your choice is the quick-cooking vegetables. My favorites are bean sprouts, sliced button mushrooms, sweet corn off the cob, thinly sliced cabbage, spinach, bell pepper, scallions, and cherry tomatoes. French beans, chinese mustard green, thinly sliced carrots, cauliflower, and broccoli are the other favorites for instant noodles but take slightly longer to cook. For the quick-cooking vegetables, add a few minutes before ramen is fully cooked. For the other veggies, add them together with the ramen at the start of cooking. Make sure the vegetables are not too soft and mushy. How to make noodles healthy? By adding fiber Eating probiotic-rich foods will promote a healthy digestive tract’s cell lining, support immunity, and manage inflammation. Unfortunately, instant noodles are not probiotic food. But you can add probiotics to boost your gut health, such as adding cheese, kimchi, tempeh, and pickled cucumber or chilis. Do remember that probiotic foods are “alive”. It is best to add them to food that has cooled a bit otherwise, it will kill off the gut-friendly bacteria especially if you add kimchi to your ramen. Ramen or noodles with cheese sound strange, but it's a favorite among the East Asian kids and is my son's favorite. It is also an easy and quick way to jazz up instant noodles. Not all cheese are probiotic foods, only gouda cheese, cheddar, and mozzarella contain probiotics. So, use only these cheeses. To enjoy cheese with instant noodles, prepare it as per the package instructions. Next, transfer them to a serving bowl, then add the cheese of your choice (the easiest is to use cheddar singles). Let the steam melt it for 2 minutes before serving. To make spicy instant ramen milder, add cheese. Kimchi, a fermented Korean side dish, is made with cabbage, garlic, scallion, red chillis, ginger, and salt. It has a unique lactic acid bacteria found only in kimchi, the Lactobacillus kimchii, as well as other lactic acid bacteria that support healthy gut flora. As kimchi also boost collagen production, it is good for people looking for better skin elasticity and healthy, youth-looking skin. So, have it with your instant ramen for better digestive health and a healthy complexion. Once your cooked ramen has cool a bit, top it with kimchi and kimchi juice (if you want that extra oomph). As kimchi is already spicy, it goes well only with instant ramen that is not hot and spicy flavored. Tempeh, the fermented soybean patty that is popularly used as a high-protein meat substitute, is also rich in probiotics. So tempeh is good for a vegan instant noodle dish. To prepare simple tempeh without the trimmings, slice tempeh lengthwise into strips. Then, pan-fry it with some garlic and onion. Add this perfectly crispy tempeh to your cooked instant noodles. Make instant ramen better and healthier with probiotics Eating pickled cucumber or pickled chili is another easy and fast way to enjoy healthier instant ramen as they are already prepared in advance. They are a great source of healthy probiotic bacteria and you eat them straight with your cooked instant ramen. Keep in mind that pickled cucumbers and chilis are made in a solution of salt and water and not in vinegar as pickles made with vinegar do not contain live probiotics. They are left to ferment in this salt and water solution using their own lactic acid bacteria. The only downside is they tend to be high in sodium. Pickles made with vinegar do not contain live probiotics. So, use only pickled cucumber and pickled chilis that are made in a solution of salt and water. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria found in food as described earlier. Prebiotics are food for these probiotics bacteria. An example of prebiotic food that goes well with instant ramen is seaweed. Seaweed is also good for thyroid health and a complete source of protein with essential amino acids. So, don't forget to sprinkle your instant ramen with shredded seaweed the next time you have one. We read how we can add protein, fiber, and probiotics to instant ramen to make it better and healthier. But that is not a balanced meal. Mixing them up will make your instant ramen a balanced meal. So, choose and add from any of the protein, fiber, and probiotics items for the healthiest ramen option. Or follow my suggestions below: You can also add more from each group if you prefer, for the healthiest instant ramen! Make your instant ramen  a balanced  meal by adding each item from the food group - protein, fiber, and probiotics Photo by Bon Vivant and Thanh Nguyen on Unsplash Finally, the toppings and garnishes. To add color and texture to your instant ramen, try these easy ideas for your next bowl of instant noodles: The main difference between cup noodles and packet noodles is the method of boiling the noodles. You add hot water to your cup noodles but with packet noodles, you can use a stove to boil and add other proteins and veggies, etc to make it healthier. So, with the limited heat from boiled water in your cup noodles, you can only add: For the healthiest cup of noodles, add the toppings and additional flavors as listed above. Here are some of the healthy instant noodle recipes with added nutrient and flavor boosters that I prepared and shared on HubPages. However, probiotics are missing in these recipes but you can have them with pickled cucumbers or pickled chillis. Check them out. If you really must have a complete meal, serve a big side salad, fresh fruits, or bread with your instant ramen noodles for the healthiest ramen option. Yes, you can if you include the add-ons as suggested earlier. So that’s it! That’s all it takes to turn instant ramen into a better and healthier meal. If you have other great instant ramen hacks, I would love to hear them.

590,Coconut Shrimp - Quick and Easy Seafood to make,food," Ryan has been an online writer for over a decade and loves to share and educate. by Big City Catering I'm a sucker for seafood and my guiltiest pleasure is some good ol' shrimp. I go for just about any dish involving this crustacean but the ones I love the most are those with fried shrimp. My favorite one of them all is Coconut shrimp. If you're unfamiliar with it, this dish is pretty much some breaded shrimp with coconut included. While many would consider Coconut Shrimp as just an appetizer, the recipe has become quite popular enough to be even used as part of the main dish. As such, it can be served with rice/fries/pasta and greens. Also, because it's fast and simple to make, it's a good way to break in trainee chefs with little hassle while on the job. I know, I was also one. In fact, a recipe like this will only take at least 30 minutes to complete. So if you're also a fan of shrimp, give this one a go. Most recipes involving shrimp tend to prioritize the big ones and this one is no exception. You can choose either jumbo or extra-large shrimp--each at a pound which is required for this recipe. For a pound of jumbo shrimp, you're looking at a yield of up to 25 while extra-large shrimp can yield up to 30. For serving per plate, that's 4 shrimp and 5 shrimp respectively. Also, you can save some prep time by focusing on brands that offer shrimp already peeled and deveined shrimp. For the coconut, is best to use finely shredded coconut. You could prepare it yourself for a fresher taste and that would be preferred. But you could also just settle for the type you buy at the store. Remember, it has to be ""finely shredded."" Optionally, it can be sweetened coconut if you prefer but it doesn't have to be. For the oil, most recipes out there tend to use canola oil or just vegetable oil. Either is fine but if you want to nail that coconut flavor, you can use coconut oil. This is preferred for this recipe, though the other two choices are fine if you can't scare up any at your local store. Separate the ingredients among bowls: one for the shrimp and seasoning; another for the flour and garlic powder; another for the eggs; and one more for the shredded coconut and panko bread crumbs. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper and let it sit in a bowl for several minutes. Combine the flour and garlic powder in their respected bowl. Add the eggs to another bowl. And combine the panko bread crumbs and shredded coconut in another bowl. Dip the seasoned shrimp in the flour, followed with the eggs, and finally the panko/coconut, making sure they're covered completely in each. When I said the shrimp only needs a couple of minutes of frying in the oil, I meant it. Normally, shrimp doesn't require extensive or even moderate time over the stove. In fact, it's too delicate for that; it'll immediately change color under that duration, indicating its doneness. As such, shrimp are among the easiest seafood dishes to prepare. Whatever oil you choose for the recipe, just use enough to cover the shrimp when frying. This can be somewhere between 2cm to 3cm in a skillet or a pan. Don't worry if you can't tell if the shrimp is cooked visually from the change of its color. The coating will. Just check for when it starts to turn golden and don't forget the timing. by Adolfo Chavez III Yes, you can freeze the shrimp that aren't be used on the same day. They can be stored this way for up to two months which is neat. Also, freezing them can be beneficial as it ensures the shrimp don't overcook in the oil. They will have to fry a little longer but it's easy to tell with the color change as previously noted. 15 min 15 min 30 min Serves 6 people, 4 pieces of shrimp © 2021 Ryan Fanus"

593,Cookieteaux,food," Chef Gnanesh -Chef Instructor
working at Culinary Academy Of India Baking was developed during the early Roman Empire where it rose in prominence as an art. Roman citizens loved baked goods in the form of breads, cakes, and pastries all of which led to a constant demand for them being present at important occasions such as feasts and weddings. As a result, baked goods have been around since the earliest celebrations and their growing popularity indicates that they will be around for the future as well. Whether it’s a festival or a celebration, the best-looking and tasting baked treats are always a focal point of the affair. As an aspiring professional in the baking industry, it’s safe to say that the feeling of fulfillment for bakers comes from the artistic side of baking. But that doesn’t diminish the role of science in the baking process. In essence, a baker merges the scientific knowledge of baking with the artistic side to create delicious sculptures. A lot of this process is driven by personal experience and philosophies. The theme for this display - Festal Flair - allows me to fully explore the artistic side of baking. With each day people see more baked goods and the only way to stand out is to create recipes that are more appealing and eye-catching. The visual element though is as important as the taste which is why it’s important to ensure the baked goods taste as good as they look. To bring my theme to life, I used cookies as a visual focus. Cookies are small, flat, sweet baked goods and are enjoyed by people all over the world. They are either baked till crisp or just long enough so that they remain soft. Cookies are made in various styles and flavored with many ingredients such as chocolate chip, nuts, raisins, and more, but in their basic form, they are made of a dough containing flour, eggs, sugar, and fat. Another important aspect of my theme is the Gingerbread house. Gingerbread is a type of cookie typically flavored with ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon, and sweetened with honey, sugar, or molasses. Within gingerbreads, there is a lot of variation ranging from soft, moist loaf cakes to ginger snaps. For my display, I created a backdrop of a two-dimensional gingerbread house with staircase stands that prop up the different themed cookies art. Christmas, Halloween, Easter, and weddings are the themes that I chose to represent on these stands. The center of the table consists of a stunning brookie gateau layered with peppermint frosting brookie and a checkerboard pound cake. This gateau brings the entire display to life and acts as the focal point for my presentation. Around the display, I’ve also placed mini jars containing the various classical cookies. With this presentation, the goal of bringing together grand and major celebrations that showcase the prowess of the bakery has come out well. Using cookies as the base food type in the display and the gateau has enabled me to showcase the artistic side of baking rather than just its scientific, measured side.

Research demonstrates that food sources influence cell conduct, which may prompt health or disease. They likewise show which food sources, are probably going to reduce explicit diseases. These researches have empowered countless people to get mindful of the preventive and mending powers of explicit food sources. People everywhere in the world have been treating themselves effectively for their long-standing sicknesses by surrendering destructive food varieties and medications utilized for their therapy. They have now depended on a nutritious and well-balanced diet, with accentuation on explicit food varieties found to contain important normal medications. Some of them have effectively made incredible progress and have liberated themselves of numerous illnesses.

Although it's a nutritive substance like fresh milk, it has high wholesome and helpful qualities. During the way toward making curd, bacteria convert milk into curd and predigest milk protein. These bacteria then hinder the development of antagonistic or ailment-causing bacteria inside the intestinal tract and advance helpful bacteria organisms required for digestion. Buttermilk, which has similar nutritive and corrective qualities as curd, is set up by agitating curd and adding some water, eliminating the fat in the form of butter. The germs, which lead to infections and inflammation like those, that cause appendicitis, loose motions, and diarrhea, can't flourish within the sight of lactic corrosive found in curd and buttermilk.

It can destroy a variety of bacteria in test tubes, including H. Pylori bacteria which is the primary cause for stomach ulcers. Liberal intake of the fresh juice of this vegetable has hence been discovered truly significant in both gastric and duodenal ulcers. Coconut is known as a wonder food. It is a near-perfect eating regimen, as it contains all the fundamental supplements required by the human body. The water of delicate coconut, by and large, known as mineral water, is an antibacterial food. This water is particularly important in cholera disease. Around 250 to 375 ml. of this water, blended in with a teaspoon of new lime juice, ought to be offered orally to the patient. It redresses the electrolyte balance and neutralizes the acidosis of the blood. The presence of saline and albumen in coconut water makes it an ideal beverage for people experiencing cholera. Coconut is likewise an old solution for ousting a wide range of intestinal worms. Garlic, a garden vegetable of the onion family, has been developed from days of past. It has been differently described as a food, a spice, a remedial plant, an antiseptic, and a mystical cure to evil by different people on various occasions all through the ages. Garlic is one of nature's most grounded, antibacterial foods. Diseases like cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea brought about by creatures can promptly get impervious to anti-infection treatment. They are altogether dangerous are as yet endemic in several nations today. Garlic is quite possibly the best solution for these issues. Its activity has been affirmed against the particular classes of bacteria responsible for these diseases in research facility tests. Garlic has another significant advantage. Antibiotics usually kill all bacteria in the human system, including some that are useful. This can make various new problems.

602,Food Review: McDonald's BTS Meal,food," Shey Saints was born on January 30, 1981 in the Philippines. She has completed her Bachelor of Science in Accountancy. McDonald’s BTS Meal was launched in the United States and South Korea in May, 2021. In the Philippines, it was launched on June 18, 2021 and I ordered it the next day. At first, I was hesitant to buy it because I felt that P270 is a bit pricey for a snack with 10 pieces chicken McNuggets, two types of dip, medium fries, and a medium coke. But of course, that didn’t hinder me from supporting the BTS Meal because I’m an ARMY. So, I decided to order the BTS Meal through FoodPanda, and initially wanted to order additional burger because I thought that maybe it won’t fill my big tummy, but then I ended up just ordering the BTS Meal alone to give benefit of a doubt. When it got delivered and I started eating, I was instantly captivated by the cajun sauce, as well as the sweet chili sauce because they tasted awesome! (I’m not exaggerating, both sauces were really tasty and addictive!) And to think, I wasn’t even a fan of chicken McNuggets, however, with the Korean sauces, the BTS Meal was all worth it! On top of that, the meal was really satisfactory because it filled my belly. I thought that I would only be ordering it one time, but I don’t think so; I will definitely order it again! On the other hand, while ARMYs around the world are going crazy because the two sauces that BTS handpicked themselves made the BTS Meal so special and satisfactory, haters are wasting their time trying to sabotage the meal. They are flooding social media with hateful remarks instead of doing valuable things like reflecting on themselves. The fact that they are so mad about the happiness of BTS, ARMY, and the people who weren’t even fans but bought and enjoyed the BTS Meal, is so indicative of their mental state. They are so fueled by jealousy, and that is pitiful, but I couldn’t care less. If that is how they want to live their life until they die, then let them die full of hatred and jealousy. In the meantime, I’m just enjoying streaming the five Butter versions of BTS on Spotify, which by the way, is still number one on the BillBoard Hot 100 on its fourth week. © 2021 Shey Saints ISHIKA MEHERE from NAGPUR on June 25, 2021: That's cool"

Delightsum It takes less time and healthy too. Its a most demanding dish in our family when summer comes although its for all season. One bowl of rice water (pakhal bhhat) with chadchadi in summer you dont need anything for to combine with for your lunch. I found maurali in our local fish market which was available fresh and due to lock down its price was gone little hike.:)..Instead of maurali you can use any small fish for praparing the dish.  In odia cuisine we always marinate for any fish with some turmeric and salt after nicely clean them. It allows to reduce the smell of fishes . For preparing masala or mustard paste we need to soak mustard seeds in Luke warm water for half an hour which will help to avoid bitter taste of your curry. I have pour fishes into the curry without frying them. If the fishes are fresh then only marinade it there is no need to fry them. If these fishes are not fresh  its better option to shallow fry them before put them into the gravy. But you should be careful while frying them to break them. I have use both tomato and dried mango for the gravy. If you think it will sour the taste though both are sour in taste then my answer will be no, using sun-dried mango only will make the dish slightly black in colour, tomato gives it nice colour and rich its taste. I suggest if you are afraid for sourness then you can remove the seeds from the tomatoes. Machha chad chadi goes well with any rice item but can be eaten with roti also. Though its a one of the staple food of odisha so best option  to eat this spicy tangy mustard flavor dish with rice along  some side dishes, you wish to. At the end; I prefer to temper it at the end which will lock the aroma of the dish and enhance the taste. Enjoy your lunch with such an easy and delectable dish… 15 min 15 min 30 min 4 Rinse and clean fishes. Marinate them with 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric and 1/2 teaspoon salt, marinate for 15 minutes. Discard all the marinade water before pour into the gravy. In a pan heat 1 tablespoon of mustard oil and allow it to smoke. Tempering mustard seeds. Saute onions when they translucent add chopped tomatoes. Saute it. Add prepared mustard paste along with chili powder, turmeric powder and fry for some seconds over high flame. Add 1 1/2 cup of water and sun dried mangoes. When water turns to boil add fishes carefully and adjust salt. Cook on high flame till the gravy  boil and simmer until get a thick consistency.

610,Three Hot Dog Recipes to Impress Your Guests at Your Next Cookout,food," Tom Lohr has eaten a hot dog at all 30 MLB ballparks and is the author of ""Gone to the Dogs: In Search of the Best Ballpark Hot Dog."" Photo by Joshua Kantarges on It's summertime, and that means families from all over the nation will be firing up the grill to partake in a summer ritual: the cookout. Most of the time it is a relatively simple affair, you just toss in some charcoal, fire it up and toss on the meat. It's the choice of meat and the creativity that separates the great barbecues from the mundane. Typical cookout fare consists of hot dogs, hamburgers and sometimes ribs or steak. The vast majority of grillers will stick with the dogs and burgers, mainly because they are affordable options. You may look forward to hosting your next cookout, but probably can't seem to get excited about it. After all, everyone knows what your hot dogs taste like; the only option they have is what condiments to put on it. But what if you had three easy to prepare recipes for hot dogs that will catapult you reputation as a grill master from average to rockstar? If you want family and friends to be talking about your Independence Day cookout on Labor Day, then give them something to remember. Here are three hot dog options (with links to the recipes) that are not only easy to make, but will have your guests coming back for seconds. No recipe can save a foundation that cuts corners. The two items that combine to make a hot dog's foundation are the bun and frank. Get your buns the day before at the soonest. It's best to get the ones that are made at your grocer's bakery. They are larger and taste better. They also get stale quicker, so plan ahead The frank is just as important. There are a ton of options out there. Your grocer probably stocks at least ten different brands. My personal choice (and I have tried them all) is Hebrew National. A close second is Nathan's. Chances are your store stocks both of these as they are national brands. Both are all beef and high quality. If you can't get those, then make sure you get at least a brand that is 100% all beef. They cost more, but they are worth it. Crab Mac and Cheese Dog Tom Lohr The ultimate comfort food dog. It combines two of America's favorite dishes. The crab meat adds a touch of taste and flair. Ensure that the mac and cheese is ready to go before you start grilling. And have a way to keep it warm. The Meat Bomb Tom Lohr Grilling is all about the meat. It is what people expect when they smell the charcoal smoldering. So what will it be? Hot dogs? Ribs? Meatballs? Bacon? Why not all four? For the real carnivores at your party, fixing up this beast will leave them stuff and impressed. The Pizza Dog Tom Lohr Someone will undoubtedly mention that they would have preferred pizza. You can't totally blame them, pizza is a picnic staple that is easy to prepare as well. You could tell them that this is a barbecue and if they want pizza that the number to the local pizza delivery shop is taped to your refrigerator. Or, you can make then a hot dog that will satisfy their craving and make you their personal hero. It' also a big hit with kids. Photo by ABHISHEK HAJARE on It happens at EVERY cookout. The vegans and vegetarians show up. They stand there in there size 1 jeans with there noses upturned explaining how they would love to partake, but there is nothing that they can eat. Gone are the days of the veggie dogs that taste like recycled plastic bags. They are still around, but there are some stellar choices now available. Field Roast makes the best of the meatless hot dogs. You should also have your skillet on the stove, greased up with vegetable oil so you can grill it there if you like. It seems some vegans/vegetarians won't even eat non meat products if they are cooked in the proximity of actual, tasty and delicious meat. The skillet will help you accommodate them. If they still aren't satisfied, kick them out. The best part about offering three gourmet hot dogs at your cookout instead of steak or burgers is the cost. Hot dogs are the most economical items to offer at a cookout. That way, you can have another this summer after your amazed guests insist on you firing up your grill one last time before the leaves fall. Pamela Oglesby from Sunny Florida on June 23, 2021: You have taken cooking hot dogs to a whole new level, Tom. I really appreciate al your great ideas for fixing these hot dogs. Thanks. Tom Lohr (author) from Magdalena, NM on June 22, 2021: Misbah, I have never kicked anyone out for not eating meat, but I have kicked several guests out for putting ketchup on their hot dog. That sort of culinary blasphemy is not tolerated at my events. Misbah Sheikh from ""a Serene Land"" (This Existence Is an Illusion) on June 22, 2021: Tom, Your suggestions are interesting, and I enjoyed reading your article. I especially enjoyed your last suggestion, but I doubt I'll ever be able to do it with anyone. “Kick them out if they still aren't satisfied.” I was just curious. Have you ever done something like that? Lol. If yes, please tell us about your experience. By the way, I love eating BBQ. God bless you."

This article will examine the weirdest most nastiest foods and cuisines found around the globe. We will look at food dishes from Asia to Europe, America and the Latin world. These stomach churning cuisines will definitely leave a bad taste in your mouth. Here are the worst foods that some people find appetizing. America has numerous delicious cuisines but there are some delicacies that are eaten in the United States that will surely make you gag. These insanely gross foods will have you questioning the stomach of some Americans. The sandwich is named after the rock icon Elvis Presley. It is a sandwich made of peanut butter, banana and bacon. Let's just say, if the music legend was living, he surely wouldn't be impressed by this awful appetizer. Chitlins or chitterlings are an American soul food dish. It is basically pig intestines cooked with various spices. The dish is most popular in the American south which is known for its variety of strange and non appealing food dishes. Spam is can meat on steroids. The fact that some Americans actually eat this stuff is pretty laughable. The can good is most suitable for a pet than it is an actual person. The southern part of the United States continues to amaze those of us from the east coast. Pickles soaked in kool Aid anyone? In the state of Mississippi, It is a common dish that many locals enjoy. If you love to eat roadkill than west Virginia has got you covered. Some residents of the state actually enjoy fried squirrel which sounds pretty gross to most people but don't tell the weirdos in west Virginia that. They may get offended. I'm pretty sure most West Virginians dont enjoy fried squirrel but for the ones that do, they are the complete air heads. The American south is here again with another gross dish. The dish consist of animal brain pieces, liver and cornmeal. North Carolina why? Just why? If you thought North Carolina was pretty bad in cooking up gross foods, check out South Carolina most delightful dish, pig ears. The stomach churning cuisine is popular in some parts of the state which is shocking. Some mid westerners belive consuming a rattlesnake is appetizing. They love eating the reptile corpse. Deep fried rattlesnake is also a beloved dish unfortunately in some areas of the U.S Asian has some of the weirdest and grossest cuisines on earth. There are many awesome Asian dishes but the ones below are not among the most celebrated in the world. Most people can't stomach such madness of these insanely gross cuisines. Japan is a beautiful country but some of the nation's food choices is among the worst in the world. Fish semen also known as Shirako is widely prepared in restaurants and is also sold in markets. Some times the dish is even eaten raw or deep fried with tempura or served over rice. Koreans top the list for gross with this crazy disgusting dish known as Sannakji which is live octopus chop in bite size pieces and consumed raw. Apparently, some Koreans are unconcerned about food poisoning In some parts of Vietnam, eating worms is perfectly fine. Coconut worms which grow in coconut trees throughout the region is a popular dish in the city of Hanoi, Vietnam. Some of the locals enjoy infusing spices with worms. It sounds pretty gross. I must say come on Vietnam, what on earth are you thinking? Japan makes the list again, this time with tuna eyeballs. It is commonly served as a snack in the region. The eyeballs are usually sauteed or braised before consumption. The incredibly non appetizing dish is also eaten in some parts of China. Japan oh Japan, here again with a stomach churning dessert. Yes, cookies infused with wasp bugs. The dessert is apparently known for its nutritional value and buttery taste. However, many wasp crackers lovers seem to complain about the insects legs and other body parts getting stuck in their teeth. Unbelievable, how do people eat such grossness? Balut is a crazy horrible cuisine eaten in Vietnam and the Philippines. The dish is fertilize duck eggs that are preserve for a couple of weeks. It is eaten by cracking the shell open and consuming the beak and numerous other organs of the unborn duck. Seems too offensively gross for most people, but in some parts of Asia, it is a hugely popular food item. The gross dish is often sold by street vendors thoughout Vietnam and the Philippines. Fried Tarantula may seem inconceivable but in some parts of Cambodia, it is a alluring food dish. Eating a gross poisonous spider is quite disturbing but don't tell the locals in Skuon that. They find the delicacy quite good. Europe is a wonderful continent with many great dishes however, some cuisines are among the worst in the world. How do anyone eat these gross food disasters is beyond logic? The country of Scotland may be gorgeous but there is one weird food item that tops the list of gross. Haggis also known as sheep stomach is consumed by some people in Scotland. The dish is prepared with oatmeal and other parts of the sheep such as the liver and heart. Italian cuisine is among the best in the world but this atrocious dish will definitely make you sick. Casu Marzu is century old cheese that is infested with maggots. However, some Italians love the disgusting diary item. The latin world has so many amazing food options but unfortunately this next dish is not one of them. Oaxaca, Mexico is known for its beautiful beaches and tasty delicacies but this god awful dish will have you in disbelief. Chapulines is grasshoppers from Mexico. It is often eaten as a side dish. The recipe is usually prepared using garlic, salt and chili. Some Oaxaca locals love including the horrible item in its burritos and tacos. Rachel L Alba from Every Day Cooking and Baking on June 23, 2021: Wow,  LOL  I haven't even heard of some of those things.  I can't bet my life on it but I'd venture to say, even if I were starving, I wouldn't eat those things.  It was all very interesting though.  Thanks for sharing."

615,"Festive Fettucine in a Mole Sauce with Corn, Beans, and Chicken Recipe",food," Often at my job, I have plenty of spare time to write - well, that's all you can do, since you can't use a computer for your own purposes, can't bring a book, can't listen to an audiobook or watch a movie. Instead, the only things I have found to do to help stay busy other than just chatting, are either drawing (which some of my coworkers do), or writing. It's an odd experience, writing when you don't have access to the internet, since you are so used to constantly having the internet at your fingertips, where you can constantly look up things, but when you write on paper you have to just trust what you know and write, without being worried about what thoughts might lead you to look up something online, or to check what you've written. In a certain sense, it is liberating: I quite enjoy writing on paper, and it is something which this practice has helped me rediscover. What sort of food recipes do you tend to get out of such idle musing, passing the time? Odd ones for sure! You tend to just combine ingredients as they come into your mind, and in this case, what sprung forth was the idea of a combination of molé sauce and fettucine noodles. One of my favorite recipes is pasta in a pesto basil cream sauce, a rich combination of fettucine noodles in pesto, typically with prosciutto, olives, and often mushrooms - and so it made me think about what it would be like to marry fettucine noodles with molé, the famous Mexican group of sauces, and which so far have been the only Mexican food which I have found I am any good at cooking - my efforts to make Chimichangas I remember, were a complete disaster! Persevering despite doubts, and a good but not-quite-perfect initial recipe where I decided that prosciutto and olives did not go well with the mole, I hit upon what I think is my penultimate version of the recipe. The ole sauce on its own is too intense, but that's the perfect pair for the fettucine noodles, which on their own lack sufficient flavor. Combine that with corn, black beans, shredded chicken, crumbled tortilla chips, cilantro, and some quesadilla cheese to sprinkle on top, and the whole thing really bursts with flavor, with a delightful different texture and complexion at every bite, and with the rich chocolate-spicy-savory combination of the molé sauce a great ever-present element within. What's more, it's surprisingly quick to cook, since many of the operations can be done at once - you can be making the mole at the same time as the pasta, beans, and corn, the three of which all cook together in the same pot, and provided you have a rotisserie chicken everything else just gets thrown on at the end! Just on my first time making it I was able to make a truly huge bowl in just 40 minutes, and I bet with some additional tries I could get it down to 30 - a surprisingly delicious but fast weeknight meal. This recipe is my own, but I did use a mole sauce recipe from Gimme some Oven for the mole."
616,Heavenly Pancake Recipes,food," I always cook pancakes at home and this recipes are my favorite. Homemade Pancake Recipe is thought to be the earliest food ever created, as prehistoric people ate it according to archaeological evidence.  According to food historians, the first written reference of these flat cakes dates back to the 5th century BC, when they were known as tagenias and were made from wheat flour, curdled milk, olive oil, and honey.  Pancakes can become boring, but you can liven them up by adding chocolate chips, fruit chunks, chopped nuts, or even candy bits as they cook.  Set aside instant mixes while making pancakes and make light and fluffy diner-style pancakes from scratch. So simple! ⅓ cup sugar 1 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons water 2 apples, cored, chopped into small cubes, and mixed with 1 tablespoons lemon juice 1 tablespoon sugar ½  salt ½  teaspoon baking powder ¼  teaspoon baking soda 4 cups buttermilk 1 egg, beaten 2 tablespoons butter, melted oil, for brushing pan    Yes, it is correct! Pancakes can be made without eggs! For this recipe, we used a really unusual egg substitute: peanut butter. These result in fluffy pancakes that prove that you don't need eggs to achieve a delicious breakfast. If you don't have the exact ingredients, fresh milk can be substituted for the evaporated milk and water if you have it. You can omit the brown sugar or add to taste if you use sweetened natural peanut butter. ½ cup water ½  cup evaporated milk ¼ cup crunchy peanut butter 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, more for frying 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1 cup all-purpose flour ¼  teaspoon salt 2 ½  teaspoons baking powder    Anyone's morning will be brightened with a stack of fluffy red velvet pancakes. You'll want more of the cream cheese frosting once you've tried it! 3 teaspoons baking powder 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder salt, to taste 1 ½  tablespoons sugar 1 large egg, beaten 3/4 cup buttermilk 2 tablespoons butter, melted, plus more to cook 2 tablespoons red food coloring semisweet chocolate chips, to top toasted almonds, to serve ⅛  ounce pack cream cheese, at room temperature 1 cup powdered sugar, plus extra, to dust 1 teaspoon vanilla extract ¼  cup whole milk    You may do this or make Coffee Pancakes, which combine two of your favorite morning meals into one delectable plate. Although this recipe prepares pancakes from scratch, it can also be made with pancake mix. 2 tablespoons good-quality instant coffee granules 1 cup fresh milk, warmed 1 ¼  cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon brown sugar ¼  teaspoon salt 2 ½  teaspoons baking powder 2 tablespoons salted butter, melted, more for frying 1 large egg     It's time to try your cooking skills to make your own version of this cake. Even if you're not confident about your cooking abilities, you'll be able to ace this one! Don't forget to serve it with a variety of excellent toppings. Fresh fruits, jam, syrup, chocolate, butter, cheese cream It's up to you how you want it. Enjoy!"
617,Residents of a Kenyan Town Surviving on Dirty Water as Water Crisis Persists.,food," Nyamweya is a journalist currently attached to a leading Kenyan media a water vendor in Ongata Rongai town, the source of such water remains unknown as shortage bites Residents of Ongata Rongai, a Kenyan town which is only 18kilometers from the capital city Nairobi are up in arms against local leaders for a water crisis that has persisted several months now. According to residents interviewed by the Standard Digital, a Kenyan media firm, the taps have run dry for close to a year now yet no action is being taken by responsible parties. Besides, their calls to the ministry of water and the company mandated to manage water supply identified as Oloolaiser Water and Sewerage Company have been futile. Many of the boreholes that act as alternative sources of water in the area have also dried up, thanks to persistent drought in the area. Residents are now left to use their own devices to get water, with water vendors making a killing from this debacle. A 20 litre jerrican now goes for Ksh 150  equivalent to $1.5 yet residents have no option but to purchase the vital commodity by all means. The greatest concern for residents however, is the source of water by these vendors since some are known to get it from streams which are known to be unfit for human consumption. Lucy Karanja, a resident of the town laments to the Standard that nobody is coming to their rescue despite doing all they can to reach the leaders. “The most affected areas in Ongata Rongai and Kiserian are Gategi, Mailoji, Naromoru, Safenest and the adjacent areas” reveals Lucy adding that “we have been facing acute water problems since February this year and as a matter of fact, the taps have been dry, can someone please intervene, Oloolaiser water and sewerage company have slept on the job hatuna Maji kwa miezi tatu sasa” She also acknowledges that at times, some residents have developed healthy complications including stomachaches, diarrohea, typhoid among other problems as a result of consuming water which they don’t know its source. “A lot of people get complications here occasionally and we are forced to visit hospitals on various occasions due to consuming water whose source we don’t know; but what should we do since the leaders have refused helping us?” Lucy laments. However, what is shocking many residents as revealed by Lucy is that despite the taps being dry all those months, the staff at the water company still come for metre readings. “Imagine they even come for meter reading; I wonder what the use is?” Some residents like Steve Wanyama blames the county administration overseen by governor Joseph Ole Lenku for the water problem and other issues they are facing. According to him, the governor has remained aloof and inaccessible to residents and therefore, has no concern for the issues they are facing. “Ole Lenku doesn't want to come and talk to Ongata Rongai residents ...there is a water shortage problem ...yet Ololaiser company got a bailout of Ksh 75million debt management ...there are no tarmacked roads or proper bridges across river Kandisi ...just the one the World bank donated ...his focus is elsewhere” Steve Wanyama lamented to the Star. Christine Siro another resident has to device a survival tactic; for her, she buys pure drinking water from a shop specifically for drinking, the one from water vendors is for cooking while she fetches water from nearby river Kandisi for laundry purposes. A 20 liter Jerican of water from a water vendor goes for ksh 100. “If you are not careful, you will end up using a lot of money on water a lone and so you have to strategize” observes Christine. The Standard Digital made a phone call inquiry to the ministry of water Kajiado County who adviced us to contact Oloolaiser Water and Sewarage Company Limited on this issue. A staff who declined to be identified acknowledged the existence of water shortage problem but claimed the supply system was caused by a technical hitch which was being rectified and residents will start enjoying water as soon as possible. “They should expect water anytime from now; yes we have been having a technical problem that barred water supply but our engineers have worked on it and we are expecting the supply to resume anytime from now” she told the Star before disconnecting. Our further inquiries on this issue has bone no fruit since our messages and calls remained unanswered."
618,Baked Bread on the Grill - Rhubarb and Banana,food," Yes. Yes. Yes. It's almost like baking in the house. I used a bread pan, but, I lined it with a sheet of aluminum foil. The bread is now baking in the grill. The electric Char-Broil grill is set at 3. I'm hoping the temperature stays at 350ish. It's tempting to open and look, but, that will affect my temperature. I'll wait until the first hour is over. It's mostly for the eggs, I guess. I put one banana in it and three stalks of thin sliced rhubarb. It's hot outside. We have been running the air conditioner to reduce both the heat and humidity in the house. So. Baking bread in the house seems a little daunting, considering all of that, so, here I sit in the garage. The grill is holding a nice 350 degree temperature. The bread is putting out some nice smell. It's been 50 minutes. Is that a burning smell? I have to open it. It's a grill, Char. It's supposed to smell like smoke. Smoked bread. Isn't that an interesting concept? When I first checked it, the streusel topping was melting together. The sides were boiling and bubbling. It's best to leave it in the heat until the streusel topping has dried and has become slightly crisp to the top. Then, carefully, take it off the heat. Peel the foil away from the bread.

620,Recipe of Stuffed Brinjal Dry Vegetable - Microwave Version,food," Umesh is a freelance writer contributing his creative writings on varied subjects in various sites and portals in the internet. Brinjal (also known as Aubergine or Eggplant) is one of the most common vegetables used in many recipes and cuisines especially in India. It is generally found as purple colour oblong fruit in various sizes. The smaller sizes are generally in the range 2 to 4 inches while bigger ones vary from 5 to 8 inches. It can be used in various ways in cooking and goes well in curries, baked items, snack items etc. As per scientific classification, Brinjal is a plant species in the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and by botanical angles it is classified and considered as a berry. Brinjals provide high fiber but low calories and also provide a range of nutrients like manganese, copper, vitamin B-6, and thiamine. It is also a good source of antioxidants. Generally, people prepare vegetables in the conventional saute and cook mode using a pan over the gas stove or hot plate but it is equally possible to cook the vegetables in a microwave oven. Only thing is that if we want to prepare the dish using a microwave then we have to use a microwave compatible bowl like a thick glass bowl for cooking purposes in a microwave oven. Another thing about microwave is that a large number of people utilise it only for the purpose of heating the food though it is capable of cooking a variety of dishes if one knows how to handle it. Let us go through some basics about the microwave before making a particular dish or this dish in it. Microwave has generally 4 or 5 cooking temperature ranges from very high to very low. So, most of them will have positions like very high, high, medium, low, and very low. Some microwave come with menu and are driven by the program inside and depending on the menu selection, the oven will choose the cooking temperature range automatically. In such cases one has to choose 'Dry vegetable' or 'Vegetable' menu selection for preparing this dish. Anyway, in a non menu type microwave, I would recommend to use second position or 'high heat' for preparing this dish. It is always better not to use 'very high' heat position to avoid chances of getting the food burnt or charred due to wrong water proportions added to the dish before cooking in this position. So, using 'high' position in place of 'very high' is a precautionary measure which many housewives or cooks will love to prefer. Making curries is easier in microwave than that of dry vegetables. The amount of water is the crucial factor in microwave cooking and in curries the water is more than sufficient while in dry vegetables we put minimum water in the dish before putting it in the microwave and then the chances of it getting burnt or charred increase. The basic rule for using the microwave is that never forget to add the required quantity of water in the dish before putting it inside the microwave for cooking. If there is any doubt then one should stop the microwave in between at suitable intervals and check the dish and add little water or even sprinkle a little water if so needed after assessing the dryness of the dish. Another important point in microwave cooking is that unlike traditional cooking it does not require oil for cooking and the food is cooked by the microwave impact on the food and water present in the dish. So, those people who do not want to consume oils due to health or personal reasons can very well avoid it. The following ingredients will be sufficient, when the dish is ready, for 3-4 people when taken during main meal courses alongwith other food items. We have to take small to medium sized Brinjals for this dish as it would not be possible to stuff the very small ones and also the bigger ones which are not suitable for stuffing. In this preparation, I have taken Brinjals of sizes in the range 2 to 3 inches. Wash the Brinjals, Tomato, and capsicum and drain them over a sieve. Peel the onions and garlic cloves and keep aside. Break the cloves in smaller parts. Coarsely chop the onions, garlic, tomato, capsicum, and green coriander leaves and mix and put in a plate. Now sprinkle all the spices (cumin seeds, fennel seeds, clove pieces, black pepper powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, dry mango powder, oil (optional), red chilli powder (optional), green coriander leaves, and salt) over it. Mix them well and keep aside. This is the stuffing ready for the dish. Some people add little curd (yoghurt) to this stuffing to make it a bit wet and it actually helps during filling. Stuffing We have to prepare the Brinjals for getting stuffed by the fillings. We slit each of the Brinjal by partly slitting them in four parts taking care not to competely cut them and let them remain jointed at the handle or stem. Divide the filling material in 8-10 equal parts so that one of the parts goes to one Brinjal. Please note that Brinjals are not to be hollowed for filling purposes but only two deep cuts on its head will make a lose cage in between which is able to hold the coarse fillings. Now, hold the Brinjal in your palm and keep the slit parts upside and force fillings in the space between the parts. Do not allow the filling to go out of that partial trap made by the four parts. Try to put the one complete part of the filling in each Brinjal and keep all the filled Brinjals in a microwave compatible bowl for 13 to 16 minutes in 'high' heat position and check in the last 5-6 minutes whether some water is required. Whenever you have a doubt about adding water just sprinkle some little water and that would avoid the dish getting too much dry. Keep the microwave door closed for a minute and then take out the completed dish. Before putting in the microwave Completed dish During the main meals this is to be served one piece to each person and those who like it can always have more. Some people may not like the taste of Brinjal due to personal liking, for them sprinkling a little lemon juice over them makes their taste different but generally acceptable. Many people like this dish with yoghurt especially when red chilli powder is used in it during cooking. Based on the usual calories the various food items provide to us, one serving of this dish provides calories approximately in the range of 25 to 30 calories when oil is used as mentioned in the list of ingredients. If oil is not used then it would be only 15 to 20 calories per serving. Stuffed Brinjal dry vegetable is an interesting variation cooking for the people who like Brinjal in their food. Due to use of the Indian spices it gives an oriental flavour. I would recommend the oil less version of this dish to the health concious people.

623,Favorite Recipes in 2021,food," I am a writer with a great passion for writing. I have written a lot of articles on other websites. I am here to share my articles for knowl Favorite Recipes This meal has saved us from a last-minute pizza run countless times. It’s my go-to friend on busy days when I don’t really feel like cooking and am about to call Josh and see if he’ll pick up a pizza on his way home. Trouble is, I don’t really like pizza and especially don’t like how unhealthy it is. But I love this salmon recipe and it’s super easy to throw in the oven, crazy healthy, and (if you keep frozen fillets from Aldi in the freezer at all times) cheaper than a pizza. It’s also simple to dress up for company or to take to a friend who could use a meal.Super a simple salmon recipe with consistently flaky and juicy results. Often I’ll just do salmon and onions, but a medley of fresh vegetables makes it extra delicious. Rosemary Salmon Baked in FoilIngredients4-6 Salmon fillets4 T olive oil2 T lemon juiceSalt & pepper4-6 sprigs rosemary, optional2-4 cloves garlic, minced1-2 onions, thinly slicedOther vegetables, optional (mushrooms, squash, potatoes, etc.)Salmon and veggies baked in foil. So easy and SO delicious!I’ve tried making individual fillets of salmon baked in foil, but when you’re serving six, this is WAY faster and you still get the juicy results.  Favorite Recipes Instructions Thaw salmon according to instructions, if frozen. Mix together the oil, lemon juice, rosemary, and garlic. Salt and black pepper then mix to taste. Add salmon and let marinate in the fridge for 1 to 4 hours. If you’re in a hurry (like I often am), skip the marinating. Thinly slice the onions and place them on the bottom of a Pyrex pan. Salt generously. If adding other vegetables, wash and chop them. Toss them in with the salmon to coat with oil. Arrange the salmon and veggies over the onions. Drizzle any extra oil on top. Cover tightly with foil. Bake at 400° for 15-25 minutes or until the fish flakes easily. The foil keeps in the moisture and helps make the salmon juicy and flavorful. It goes well with rice or sweet potato hash browns and salad but is very versatile. Favorite Recipes A Clam Chowder is one dish that has been served in the colonial times. It is also a great supper for a cold night. The chowder should be initially prepared for about fifteen minutes and then cooked for only twenty minutes. Thus, this brings the whole session to a total of thirty five minutes. This is the perfect time of preparing the clam chowder. Ingredients The Clam Chowder has to be made from a number of ingredients, which include, 2 cuts bacon, cut into 1/4-inch pieces, 1 huge yellow onion, diced. Other ingredients include 1 tablespoon flour, 2 containers of water, and 4 medium reddish brown potatoes. A mixture of 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, dark pepper, 2 tablespoons chopped green parsley leaves, 2 measures cream, and lastly 2 containers of minced mollusks form the last bit of the ingredients. Step-by-step Directions: One should strain the broth. This means straining the Clams from the pot and put them aside in a vessel. Moreover, he should strain the Clam that is still on the pot by using cheesecloth or a strainer to wash away ever bit of sand. One should make not less than two and a half glasses of Clam soup. However, if one needs more juice, he may add some water to achieve to the desired amount. Finish up by removing the Clams. At the point when the Clams are cool, one should take them out to the cutting board. Then, he should lay them on a cutting board and harshly slash them into the small parts. He should put them aside to mix to the chowder after a few minutes. Preparing the Soup Base One should commence by cooking the bacon. One should place a huge stockpot over the hot stove. He is then supposed to add the bacon pieces, and cook them until the oil is rendered, and the bacon is fresh. After a few minutes, bacon should be removed from the pot and put aside. One should remove everything except two tablespoons of bacon in the pot. Sauting the onions is the next step. The next step is to lessen the heat under the stockpot to a moderate size. An individual should add the onions to the pot and cook until they are ready for almost six minutes. He should add flour over the onions and cook for more three minutes. It is important to blend the onions so that they can be covered in flour. One should then add the broth. One should spill the broth onto the onions. The mixture should be blended using a wooden spoon. After that, he should add the potatoes. One should put the thyme, cove leaf, and potatoes in the pot, and heat the soup once more to a boil. In this stage, the temperature should be medium, and the pot should be covered. A person should let the soup boil until the potatoes are delicate. This may take almost forty five minutes. Completing the chowder First, one should add the cream and sherry. One should mix all ingredients into the pot, and let the chowder boil. This is the every important process when preparing Clam Chowder. He should then add the Clams. It is crucial to taste the soup to figure out if it needs more salt and flavors. It is okay to add more flavors to make the soup spicy and smell nice. Serving the Chowder is the final step. The chowder is normally served with Tabasco sauce and chopped green parsley leaves, following the New England traditional. However, a person may serve a Clam Chowder with other types of food. © 2021 Ark hira from faisalabad on June 13, 2021: Delicious"
624,The Fascinating British Story of the French Champagne,food," Ravi loves writing within the realm of relationships, history, and the bizarre—where boundaries are blurred and possibilities are immense. The Interesting History of the French Champagne champagne-peligri-christian-wine On a cold evening on Aug. 4, 1693, a disciplined Benedictine monk suddenly went amok, breaking the silence in the Abbey of Saint Pierre situated in Hautvillers in the Champagne region of France. He started screaming with excitement. ""Come quickly, I am drinking the stars."" The monk was Dom Pérignon (sounds familiar?), the blind monk who accidentally invented champagne. Dom Pérignon spent 47 years of his life in the Abbey of Saint Pierre, where, among other duties, he worked on improving some of the aspects of champagne-making. It was due to his pioneering efforts that champagne became a beloved drink in countries all over the world. As the story goes, Dom Pérignon was drinking the wine from a bottle that had been bottled and sealed in the mistaken belief that the fermentation was complete. In fact, the fermentation had only stalled due to the low temperature in the cellar in the winter due to which the ‘yeasts’ stopped working. Once spring came, the fermentation started again, this time within a sealed bottle. The carbon dioxide produced by this renewed fermentation dissolved in the wine and became bubbles when the wine was opened. The story was subsequently embraced by the champagne industry and in 1889, the Syndicat de Commerce declared that Dom Pérignon was the father of champagne. Later it also published pamphlets that Dom Pérignon had “discovered” champagne by following ‘ancient traditions.’ A perfectly timed story adopted by a powerful industry. But it does raise the pertinent question. Was Dom Pérignon really the first man to taste sparkling wine? Is it possible somebody else (maybe the English) beat him to it? Was Dom Pérignon really the first man to taste sparkling wine? Is it possible somebody else (maybe the English) beat him to it? Dom-Perignon The history of champagne is inadvertently shaped by two Englishmen, one invented the method called 'methode champenoise' for creating it and the other orchestrated the creation of the heavier champagne bottle. Their names are Christopher Merrett, a physician, and Admiral Sir Robert Mansell. It was the 1600s and Christopher Merrett wanted to do something to make English wine the best in the world. Particularly he wanted to find a way to make the wine into a sparking effervescent, bubbling concoction. And after a lot of experimentation, he found the solution by using sugar and molasses. As he described his findings in his 1662 paper, ‘Some Observations Concerning the Ordering of Wines’. “Our Wine-coopers of latter times use vast quantities of Sugar and Molasses to all sorts of wines to make them drink brisk and sparkling and to give them Spirits. That is how we can make our wine better.” What Merrett was describing was an early version of methode champenoise in which still wines were loaded with sugar and molasses to get the yeast going again, then sealed in a bottle to produce an effervescent, bubbling concoction. This was the first known description of making “sparkling” wine made famous by the French later as the methode champenoise named after the Champagne region of France. Christopher Merrett created the method called 'methode champenoise' for making wine into a sparking effervescent, bubbling concoction christopher-merrett-1024x833 Around the same time, the English were going through an ecological crisis due to rapid industrialization, overpopulation, and decimation of the country’s forests due to blatant deforestation. Admiral Sir Robert Mansell of the British Navy was terrified. No wood means no new ships and no new ships meant weak defenses against the enemies. No, wood has to be rationed for defense purposes only. Admiral Sir Robert Mansell appealed to James the first and was granted a Royal decree banning wood-fired furnaces, the only alternative was to use coal. Craftsmen around the country were up in arms about this new prohibition, but grudgingly they adjusted to using coal for all their activities including the glassmakers who had been burning timber for centuries to make their product. But unknowingly for the glassmakers, although coal created pollutants and toxins, it also made their glass stronger as coal burns at higher temperatures creating stronger, more durable, and thicker glass. Over time, artisans honed new industrial methods to take advantage of this discovery. But the biggest use was in the creation of stronger champagne bottles. You might be wondering what thicker glass has got to do with champagne. The simple answer is pressure. The new ‘effervescent” wine generates an incredible amount of pressure and only an especially strong bottle could withstand this sort of pressure. And English bottle makers had the edge and the first-mover advantage to make unbreakable champagne bottles compared to the French whose bottles started breaking under pressure. The English provided the tools and the French capitalized and marketed it across the world. The founding myth of Dom Pérignon made champagne one of the most famous imports to come out of France. And we all know the result; the clear sparkling delight that we all open to celebrate our every thrill and victory in life. And all this was made possible due to the ‘happy’ accidents of two English stalwarts of the British Empire. The English glassmakers used coal for making their glass stronger as coal burns at higher temperatures creating stronger, more durable, and thicker glass. merlin_153988854_899c30c5-2406-4635-ad69-45e4ef417d2e-jumbo Ravi Rajan (author) from Mumbai on June 15, 2021: Thanks Flourish FlourishAnyway from USA on June 15, 2021: An intriguing article.

Do you think you've ever had authentic kung pao chicken? If you're not sure just take a look at the following article. In the 19th century, the late Qing Dynasty, Shandong governor Baozhen Ding was promoted to the Governor of Szechuan , and after arriving in Chengdu, he created his own private dish, Kung Pao Chicken, by adding red pepper to the main ingredients of the ""sauce popping chicken"" (diced chicken and peanuts). Because Baozhen Ding was the young protector of the East Palace, he was called ""Ding Gongbao"", and his surname Ding literally means ""small cube"", which is why this dish was called ""Kungbao Chicken"". After Kung Pao chicken was introduced to northern and northeastern China, cucumbers or carrots were added to adjust the original spicy taste, but the water content of the vegetables also made the dish taste completely different.

They are often mixed with tofu flowers and bean curd. According to the different tastes of different regions, the north prefers salty food, while the south prefers sweetness. Some regions such as Sichuan prefer sourness and spicy taste. The most important feature of Douhua is the tenderness and softness of tofu, so it is called the tofu brain, so you must master the skill of marinating. It requires a low heat to boil the syrup without overflowing the pot (you can add a special defoamer for soy products to eliminate bubbles, and cooking oil is also ok), so that the tofu is not sticky, bitter, and not astringent. That's it. To cook the marinade, you need to use fresh lamb slices and a good-mouth grinding soup. The heat must be mastered, and the stew technique cannot be used to boil the marinade to keep the marinade fresh. Due to the ingredients, the original taste of tofu is tasteless.

After the soybeans are full of water, they are beaten, filtered, boiled, and then cooled to 90°C. The last step is called ""Chong tofu brains"", which means that you need to pour in the coagulant soy milk and then let it stand for 5 to 15 minutes to complete. The delicacy of bean curd comes from the temperature control of the fusion of soy milk and coagulant, as well as the speed and skill of ""Chong tofu brains"". Salty Salted tofu brains is generally added with seasoning suitable for salty taste, which varies slightly from place to place. In the north, there are meat, celery, mustard, day lily, fungus, and shiitake mushrooms; in coastal areas, there are kelp shreds, seaweed, and shrimp skins; there are also sesame sauce, chili oil, coriander, soy sauce, and vinegar; there are also leeks, Garlic, chopped green onion, etc., the taste varies from place to place mainly depends on the seasoning. Among them, there is also a kind of spicy soup in Henan, which is called ""tofu brains and spicy soup"", which is rich in local characteristics, and Sichuan's spicy tofu is spicy and fragrant, and it has a unique flavor. Salty SweetnessSweet ones are usually added with syrup or granulated sugar or brown sugar. In summer, tofu flowers are usually cooled and eaten with hot sugar water in winter. Some people will add ginger juice in the sugar water or add mung beans, red beans, and eat with various favorite fruits.

Among them, Changsha and Nanjing are quite famous. This may be hard for some people to accept, but let's first try to understand what stinky tofu is. It's actually somewhat similar to blue cheese, and those who like it will really enjoy it, but those who don't may want to run away when they see it. There are two different stories about the history of stinky tofu: Story 1The story goes that Yuanzhang Zhu came from a poor background and worked as a beggar and monk when he was young. Once, when he was so hungry that he could not stand it, he picked up some expired tofu that people had thrown away and fried it in oil, stuffing it into his mouth with a mouthful of stinky tofu. Later, when he became the military commander, his army was victorious all the way to Anhui, and he was so happy that he ordered the whole army to eat stinky tofu to celebrate, and the fame of stinky tofu finally spread. Story 2The Ming Dynasty scholar Rihua He had already said in his writings at the time that people in Yixian County, Anhui Province, especially like to use salt to make tofu discoloured and hairy in the summer and autumn, scrubbing it clean and frying it in boiling oil. With a history of nearly 1,000 years, its most successful times can be traced back to the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty. According to historical evidence, Empress Dowager Cixi also had a hobby of eating stinky tofu, which was also listed as an imperial snack. Although stinky tofu is small, the production process is more complicated. It usually goes through several procedures such as frying, braising, and fermentation. During the whole production process, it is required to be carried out under natural conditions, and the requirements for temperature and humidity are very high. First, the top-quality soybeans are used to make tofu, and then the white tender tofu is pressed into white dried tofu subs; then the dried tofu is added to a kind of brine. The brine here is the most elaborate, it needs to be made from the juice of salted vegetables left over from other years, pure green, natural, no coloring added, and emits a very natural smell. Seal the jar, and then buried in the ground, white tofu has become green ink-colored dried stinky tofu a few days after taking out. When you break open the dried tofu, you can see that it is green and ink-colored from the inside to the outside, and smells bad, but when it is fried, it smells great in the mouth. After cooling, add mushrooms, asparagus, white wine and other spices and soak for 15 minutes. Deep-fried to be thoroughly fried, the surface is burnt, but the inside is white and tender. Drizzle with chili paste to eat. Some people like to eat stinky tofu, however, some people avoid it, and they want to make a detour when they smell it. So have you ever wondered why stinky tofu smells so stinky, and it tastes so delicious? Stinky tofu ""smells bad"" because the tofu in the process of fermentation and post-fermentation, which contains proteins in the role of pro-tease decomposition, the sulfur amino acids contained in the full hydrolysis, resulting in a compound called hydrogen sulfide (H2S), this compound has a pungent odor. After the breakdown of the protein, that is, the production of amino acids, which in turn has a delicious taste, so ""eat well"". Stinky tofu uses high-quality soybeans as raw materials. The process is complex and the process is complicated. Soybeans are processed by dissolving, dehulling, soaking, refining, filtering, spotting, forming blocks, and ten processes. It is stinky to make fermented and soft. Stinky tofu contains the essential amino acid Lysine, so it should be avoided to heat with reducing sugar to avoid carcinogens such as the end product of glycation. Features: the exterior is ink black, crispy but not mushy, tender but not greasy, stinky at first smell, fragrant and tempting, with the freshness and crispness of white tofu and the aroma and crispness of fried tofu. Changsha Stinky Tofu There are two types: one is tile gray dried tofu and the other is tender gray tofu. Tile gray dried tofu Tender hoary tofu Local people like to collect snow in a tank in winter, add straw ash and some spices to the snow water in the next summer, and then use it to make a marinade to soak fresh tofu, and after a day, fish it out and wash it, then pour sesame oil, green chili, garlic paste, ground coriander, soy sauce and a little salt. It is very pleasant to use as a side dish to accompany a meal. In addition, because it is soaked in snow water, it is also a small dish to relieve the summer heat, and it has been passed down from generation to generation among the locals to eat this kind of stinky tofu to relieve the summer heat and satisfy their cravings during the summer season. Hakka Stinky Tofu The ""stinky tofu"" produced is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, salty and fresh, with an incomparable taste, and the characteristics of both stinky and fragrant are unique.

628,One of the most representative of Wuhan Delicacy: Doupi,food," Doupi is an essential part of Wuhan ""GuoZao"" culture and is considered a ""must try"" food when visiting Wuhan. Doupi, also called Meat and rice pancake, is a breakfast dish from the city of Wuhan in Hubei province. It is, however, much more than a phrase; it is a custom ingrained in the ""Wuhan culture.""It is often sold as street food. In Wuhan dialect, ""GuoZao"" literally means ""to have breakfast"".Doupi is an essential part of Wuhan ""GuoZao"" culture and is considered a ""must try"" food when visiting Wuhan. For those who have never had it before, you might think it is a soy product? Actually, Doupi is a staple food made of eggs with glutinous rice and a variety of fillings. Although it is called ""tofu skin"" in Chinese, it actually refers to a type of breakfast delicacy made primarily of Dougan (It a kind of tofu, however, it differs from regular tofu in that it is firm whereas tofu is soft.), lean meat, fatty meat, shiitake mushrooms, Zha Cai, all fine dice, and then put the fine dice Stir-fry in a pot, add oil (slightly more), soy sauce, MOG(monosodium glutamate), a little salt, and set aside. and made by frying. Its skin is golden and shiny, and the mouth is crisp and tender and fragrant. P.s: Zha Cai is a type of pickled mustard plant stem originating from Chongqing, China. In English, it is commonly known as Sichuan vegetable or Chinese pickled vegetable, but be sure to wash the saltiness, the taste will be fresher. It seems that the first restaurant to sell Doupi would have been “Hongfa Yang Doupi,” which opened in 1929, however, the form had been without eggs at the moment. Later that same year, in 1929, a local chef named Jinan Gao, who had previously worked at “Hongfa Yang Doupi,” opened his own restaurant selling the upgraded method of Doupi. Gao's Doupi was crispier and also more fragrant than the previous still, thanks to the addition of eggs as well as a change in cooking techniques. The restaurant was called ""Lao Tong Cheng,"" and it quickly rose to prominence as the king of the street snack. During the mid-1950s, the popularity of Doupi extended over and above Wuhan to Guangzhou, Shanghai, Changsha, and even Urumqi. Doupi's ancestor can be traced back to the invention of traditional ""Dousi"" in rural Hubei province. Dousi, as opposed to Doupi, is made by grinding, heating, and drying a mixture of mung beans and rice milk. Dousi is typically thinly cut into slices, making them ideal for pan-frying or boiling. Locals began wrapping glutinous rice after Dousi arrived in Wuhan. After Dousi arrived in Wuhan, locals began wrapping it in glutinous rice, pork mince, and scallions to make a deep-fried snack, which became the precursor to Doupi. The outside of a perfect Doupi should be golden and thinly crispy, but the inside should be chewy and springy. To begin, mung beans and rice are finely ground to make the Doupi pancake spread. Second, pan-fries the spread in a large wok while adding eggs to give it a golden color. Thirdly, fillings such as steamed sticky rice, various ingredients, and occasionally Master stock are poured onto the pan-fried layer. Finally, when the underside is golden and crisp, the entire square of Doupi is flipped over to allow the rice layer to crisp up. All these ingredients and heat are key aspects to consider when producing a perfect Doupi. The beans that are used in the external interface must be peeled mung beans, and the pancake spread must be made from delicately refined rice milk. The eggs that are usually added to the dispersal should not be any below four; otherwise, the taste will be far from ideal. In terms of fillings, instead of the pickles and bean-curd that are commonly used today, a truly traditional Sanxian Doupi consists of the aforementioned pork, fresh mushrooms, and bamboos. Doupi is cut into small squares, sprinkled with chopped scallions, and represented in smaller containers or plates once properly cooked. It is one of the main foods ""GuoZao""(breakfast) for Wuhan natives, and it is also a very characteristic traditional snack among the natives of Wuhan. Its shape is square and thin, its color is golden and yellow, and is fragrant. It was originally a special holiday delicacy made by Wuhan locals during the New Year and Special festivals, and later it became a common breakfast. Many Westerners have disputed it as Hubei's answer to lasagna due to its resemblance to the equally famous Italian dish. Doupi is now being served as a preparation for a different dish on the table and the existence of this food is now accepted in many places.  © 2021 delicacylandscape"
629,Wuhan Hot dry noodles introduction,food," Needless to say, love in words for Wuhan people have the affinity for it. Hot dry noodles, also known as Re Gan Mian(“Re, 热” means hot, “Gan，干” means dry, and “Mian, 面” means noodles.), is a typical Breakfast of Wuhan and called ""Guo Zao"" instead of 'Have breakfast' in Wuhan dialect. Due to Wuhan's central location in China, it has historically been an important commerce center. Every year, tens of thousands of business people from all over the world flocked to this metropolis, bringing both goods and traditions from their own countries. Traders or ordinary customers who rushed to the markets usually didn't have enough time to prepare breakfast for themselves, so they had to settle for snacks at local food stalls. Flavors of food and snacks have become a blending of northern and southern China styles to satisfy the varying tastes of people from different places. Nowadays, you may be astounded by the skillful performance of vendors in front of any food stall in Wuhan. In addition, hot dry noodles are convenient, fast, and delicious, it has become the first choice for many people in Wuhan. It found all across Wuhan since these noodles were indeed popular with locals throughout the year and could be eaten for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even as a snack. With the high summer temperatures and long span of time in Wuhan, for a long time, people have added edible alkali to the noodles to prevent spoilage, which is the predecessor of hot dry noodles - cut noodles. It was recorded in the Qing Dynasty. The noodles have enjoyed a long history within Chinese food culture spanning 90 years. Hot dry noodles originated from Mingwei Cai who sold noodles in soup in Hankow in the early 1930s. Mingwei Cai, a native of Wuhan, made his soup noodles so popular that customers often had to wait in line to get them, and many of them couldn't wait to leave, Mingwei Cai had a talent at doing business. In order to speed up shipments, through repeated experiments, he finally worked out a process of ""dusting the noodles"" - that is, first boiling the noodles to medium well, then quickly cooling them down and evenly smearing oil, so that when selling the noodles, the shipments would be faster. Once Mingwei Cai saw a sesame oil workshop and saw that after they had extracted the sesame oil from the sesame seeds, the sesame paste -- The key of hot dry noodles-- was left unattended and the aroma was so strong that he had an idea; why not add the sesame paste to the noodles and try it out? Again after many iterations, he felt satisfied and everyone around him said it was delicious, and that's when he confidently launched his new product on the street and hawked it. Hot dry noodles - the favorite delicacy of the Wuhan people - were born. At this time Mingwei Cai gave the noodles the name ""sesame paste noodles"" and it was until 1950 when the business was registered that they were officially called ""hot dry noodles"". Bronze statue of the person who made hot dry noodles in Wuhan Jianghan street The basic ingredient of hot dry noodles is the alkali noodle, which itself is added with alkali, then shaped, over water, and finally to be blown off the water and smeared with oil when it is rolling. In a fundamental sense, it is a kind of semi-cooked noodles. After it is cooled, it is soaked up and down in boiling water and passed several times to make it cooked. At this time, the noodles are still tasteless, and then some basic seasonings will be added, sesame paste, soy sauce, MSG(monosodium glutamate), salt, and depending on the region, may also add red oil, sesame seeds, some auxiliary ingredients. The final product is a bowl of hot dry noodles. Once the noodles are cold, not only do they become unpalatable, they also soggy, which simply means that they become a dry mess, which is completely unpalatable compared to other noodles with soup, and it is difficult to separate them with chopsticks. This is why hot dry noodles must be eaten while they are hot or warm so that their essence can be reflected, and it is a food that needs to be fiddled with constantly, it is not very mold-able and is always fixed in one position, otherwise, it will be easily shaped and thus unpalatable. Because of the dry nature of hot dry noodles, it requires people to keep stirring it, then it will have more and more contact with the air and the speed of heat dissipation will continue to accelerate, plus a bowl of hot dry noodles is done in just a minute or two, which is also very time saving and extremely filling, which is undoubtedly the best choice for those who are in a hurry to go to work. Wuhan is indeed very hot, but it seems that only hot dry noodles can match this heat, it can be left for a long time, seems to encounter this hot summer day is not afraid, on the contrary, is trying to conquer the Wuhan people's tongue with more and more intense taste buds. With the hot weather in Wuhan, shouldn't it be more normal to have raw or cold food? If you eat hot dry noodles again, isn't it hotter, but hot dry noodles have their own charm! Just like spirit, the higher the alcohol content and the drinker is warmer, so are the hot dry noodles, and so are the people of Wuhan, seemingly feisty but warm heart-ed, which is their unique attitude to life. Needless to say, love in words for Wuhan people have the affinity for it. Furthermore, it is an integral part of Wuhan's folklore and food culture. For those who come to Wuhan from abroad, most of the time they think of Wuhan again because they remember its noodles. For Wuhan people or those who have spent some time in Wuhan, hot dry noodles are no longer just a delicacy, but a sentiment. Hot dry noodles should be stirred at the beginning. © 2021 delicacylandscape"

631,Grilling Out Secret: Frozen to Fully Cooked,food," James loves preparing classic dishes the old-fashioned way and learning about the history of foods and recipes. Properly placing your meats on the grill is important. James Timothy Peters Nobody likes to bite into a chicken breast and realize that it's still raw so people will go to extreme measures to ensure the chicken is fully cooked. With this little secret I'm about to share, you'll soon realize that there's no need to thaw out or boil chicken breasts before placing on the grill. Using the 30"" Kingsford GR1031-014984 Barrel Charcoal Grill along with the Original Kingsford Charcoal Briquettes, I was able to grill two delicious chicken breast and two perfectly done hamburgers. Never have I ever thought that there was difference when it comes to grills. I figured the cheapest is the ultimate way to go, but that doesn't always turn out to be such a wise decision. So I figured why not go the pros when it comes to grilling out. I chose a Kingsford grill because they've been around, like, forever and it's a product you know you can trust. Wait until the charcoal is completly grey before adding in new charcoal. James Timothy Peters Add wood chips if you'd like. I added strips of pinewood. James Timothy Peters Place your raw, frozen chicken breasts (meat side up) in the top rack off your Kingsford grill. James Timothy Peters To be honest, I haven't tried any other charcoal when doing this secret tip. The charcoal must be Kingsford in order for this work properly and safely as far as I am concerned. The last thing you want is for your chicken breast to still be raw, but for it to taste like charcoal fluid also is twice as bad. So I ask you, ""Why trust any other brand besides Kingsford?"" Start grilling your raw, frozen chicken breast in the top part of the Kingsford grill. James Timothy Peters Your ideal grilling temperture is 350 degrees. James Timothy Peters When you first start your grill, you want to use about 30% of your grill when adding the charcoal. Use one side of the grill to grill and the other side to keep warm wait until the charcoal is completely grey before you add the new charcoal. You need to add just enough to cover the old, burning charcoal. No need to make a pile. When this charcoal turns completely grey you may immediately add your raw, frozen chicken to the far ""warm side"" of the grill for 30 minutes (meat side up first) after which you flip for another 30 minutes. However, each chicken breast is created different. If you're not sure, cut into the breast and check for yourself if you want to be sure. Keep the temperature of the grill at around 350 degrees. If you need to cool the grill down, lift the cover for a second or two while watching the temperature dial. When lifting the cover of the grill, GO SLOW. The sudden rush of fresh oxygen may ignite the fire to blaze way above the grill. Lift the cover with extreme caution. Lift the grill cover for a second or two to cool the temperature down. James Timothy Peters Let the raw, frozen chicken breasts cook at least 45 minutes before you start adding frozen hamburgers. Make sure your constantly turning and flipping your chicken breasts frequently. You don't want those babies to burn. How to get those grill marks on those burgers. James Timothy Peters It's quite easy, really. You can do this with any type of burger. Start grilling your burger on one side of the grill. Before flipping the burger, slide the burger slowly to the other side of the grill according with the grill pattern.Don't go against the grain! Try standing your chicken breasts upright for a good length of time. James Timothy Peters Halfway through grilling your raw, frozen chicken breast, try balancing the chicken breast on its meat side for a good length of time. This will sear the chicken to where the juice is sealed in. Nice set up. James Timothy Peters The juiciest chicken breast you ever had. Honest. James Timothy Peters A perfectly well made hamburger.

632,"Pork Chops, Onions, and Potatoes Mustard-Dill Roast Recipe",food," Recently, I discovered the wonders of mustard-dill sauce, with the particular variant being a sweet one made by a local fine restaurant, Larrupin's. It's such a wonderful combination, which is so easy to apply to so many different foods - one of my favorite so far has been mustard-rubbed triptip. I like mustard well enough on its own, but it gets even better when it is sweet and paired with the nice flavors of dill, removing its harshness but leaving this tremendously delectable aftertaste. In this recipe, a casserole dish composed of sauteed pork, onions, and potatoes, all in a mustard-dill sauce. The sauce infuses the meat with such wonderful flavors when it is marinated in it, and a variety of other spices, and then sauteed, making this heart-catching rich aftertaste as well as a superbly sweet flavor when eating it itself. This method of cooking, with sauteeing the pork to lock in the flavor followed by a long roasting in the oven, helps make it tantalizingly tender and appetizing. While I made this recipe with just potatoes, pork, and onions, it would be easy to add in other things into it: I think carrots and cabbage are both great ideas for additions, while in previous iterations I have also had sauteed apples. I don't know personally how the mustard-dill sauce that I use in this recipe is made, but I would suggest a mixture of honey, mustard, and dill. Or you can order it online: see the link below. I based this recipe on another recipe of mine, pork chops with onions, potatoes, and apples."

636,Things to Consider When Designing a Restaurant,food,"  Similarly as with homegrown tasks, high up regarding the matter rundown for eatery stylistic layout thoughts is that of the shading plan.  ""It's very regular for eateries to be striking with their shading decisions. In a parlor or lounge area there are only a couple of things of furniture and the shadings picked feel especially 'on show', in an eatery setting, the volumes of furniture, extras, and light sources are far more prominent so there's an interruption from the shading. It's this that empowers the courage and investigation in shading,""  Shading in a café can likewise turn into an immense idea. In bigger foundations, it goes about as an apparatus to characterize unmistakable regions. David Collins Studio utilized shading as a brand name in various very good quality activities, for example, the Blue Bar at The Berkeley or the heather cashmere dividers in The American Bar at Gleneagles. The tone turns into a symbol for the eatery being referred to.  Keep in mind, additionally, with shading choices to consider how they sit together in sunshine and how they advance when dusks and they depend on candle and light for radiance.  ""An eatery's floor plan frames a quick impression of vibe. Keep tables spread out so that each feels isolated, and the visitor experience will be a private one.  ""Tables stuffed firmly together then again is an assertion of gaiety and exuberance. Deciding café format requires a choice on what air is expected to be set up,' clarifies Linda Holmes, Interior Design Director at LuxDeco.  There's a simply useful angle to the café's room plan as well, however. David Collins Studio consistently focuses on the significance of a reasonable operational design for staff and benefactors to move unreservedly. The traffic should stream flawlessly. Bottlenecks are quickly clear and cause an off-kilter interruption that visitors will get on.  A division between the bar and eatery region is another inquiry to be replied to regarding the matter of the design. This will influence the sensation of custom or familiarity across the entire space.   At the point when an eatery moves toward its furniture decisions as objects of capacity and that's it, the whole experience gets degraded. The significance of painstakingly chose eatery seats, tables, and emphasize pieces isn't to be disparaged.  In the entirety of its undertakings, David Collins Studio highlights bespoke things of furniture that resound with the gourmet specialist's ethos and thus, the eatery's environment. For Tom Kerridge's Bar and Grill at Corinthia London, the eatery's bar configuration highlights club-style and profoundly agreeable bar stools. This style is proceeded through to the café with its profound, Chesterfield-motivated banquettes in cherry red cowhide. Such furniture decisions support the menu's message of exemplary British cooking that weds solace with immovable quality.  ""It is important that only one out of every odd component matches. That doesn't imply that each eating table and seat should be unique, however, that there are incidental pieces in the space to separate any consistency. An assertion dresser or a few rich control center tables enhanced with ornamental lights or a jar are useful here and fill in as an update that café furniture stretches out past table and seat.""  Apparently perhaps the most urgent parts of café configuration, lighting thoughts should be deferential of the scarcely discernible difference between vital, task-style radiates and encompassing enlightenment.  ""In our homes, we reliably stress the need to layer the lighting all through space. It's horrible having the entirety of the lighting swung from a higher place; it should float down gradually from pendants to divider lights and lights in abundance. A café might be a business space, however, visitors need to be caused to feel quiet in their environmental factors as they do at home, so it's legitimate to follow a similar lighting theory as you would in the home,"" prompts Linda.  David Collins Studio additionally recognizes the impact that lighting has on every visitor, taking into account what is the most complimenting light at each point. In the Harrods Dining Hall, they center the lighting around the plate to exhibit the food, with delicate, low-level lighting for the burger joints to loll in.  As David Collins Studio puts it: ""In the event that there's choice detail in the food, there ought to be flawless detail in the manner the room is assembled.""  Café stylistic theme thoughts, in this way, are a principal part in how the LuxDeco Interior Design group moves toward each business project. ""The term 'final details' is deluding. These aren't the pieces to be just added in toward the end. Adornments and enhancing contacts are the place where you develop the degree of thought in eatery inside plan,"" Linda exhorts.  Recollect too that in the online media-driven world that we live in, cutting out spaces of engaging vignettes, complete with knickknack boxes, enriching bowls, and amazing decorative layouts, implies your eatery's plan is all the bound to turn into an absolute necessity visit and should photo area.  Likewise of stylistic themes and extras, showing expertly curated expressions and antiques says a lot to visitors. They fill in as focal points, they support or sabotage the general inside plan course and they add warmth and surface to space.  ""Like how we light an eatery with as much suspected as we do a home's feasting region, café divider configuration merits as much suspected as would be given in a private venture. The craftsmanship decorating the dividers and figures on tables are rich subtleties that uncover the family of the foundation. We generally energize this in our eatery inside plan tasks, and it's a speculation that our customers never lament,"" says Linda.   It's normal to hear inventive sorts and inside fans guarantee that to know the genuine commitment to the plan of a café, you should look at the restroom. This is the place where a similar degree of scrupulousness found in the primary eatery either thrashes or twists.  David Collins Studio remarks: ""The blend and difference of materiality are so intriguing in washrooms. Marble and stone give a lavish completion and differentiation delightfully with lumber, which can add warmth. Reflected glass, metal, and nickel all give a reflection and a feeling of glow.""  Lighting, as well, is basic around here of the café, in any case fixing the entirety of the difficult work in setting the ideal degree of climate during eating. ""Legitimate lighting is so significant, eye-level sconces that flank a vanity can give a complimenting brightening, without the shadow that is made by overhead lighting,"" David Collins Studio adds.

Once everything is added to the meat mixture, you simmer for 30 minutes.  Ketchup, mustard, Worchestershire sauce. Campbells Chicken Gumbo soup. Fresh, ground black pepper.  Once your ingredients are mixed together, cover the pan, reduce the heat to a simmer and keep covered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. It will thicken as it simmers. I put ours on Brioche buns. They were delicious!"
638,Pursue Better Coffee With Melitta’s 10-Cup Aroma Enhance Glass White Coffee Maker,food," Coffee? Who cares about that? Pretty much everybody — Starbucks is always crowded and it’s not about caramel based drinks, it’s about that black brew that has caffeine in it (and yes it does get diluted down with other stuff but that’s how it starts). So for many at home, the first thing they want to do in the morning is make a cup of coffee — avoiding having to get dressed and running over to a store to wait in line to get that brew. But back to the house, because that’s where the coffee needs to be found. Now for those who want instant coffee, we say good for you but don’t think you’re getting the kind of real good and tasting coffee you deserve. To do this you need to brew that coffee from coffee grounds — which also lets you pick the type of coffee that best suits your tastes. So the best way to get this coffee is to brew it; meaning you’ll need coffee grounds but mostly a filter coffee maker that plugs into a wall outlet and which will optimally brew the coffee to its moment of enjoyment. That pretty much describes Melitta’s 10-Cup Aroma Enhance Glass White Coffee Maker. Before we get to the actual use, describing the physical aspects makes sense. So we take it from the name — the carafe is made of glass and can hold a total of 10 cups. Obviously the handle is heat resistant so it can be handled once filled with coffee. The base into which the carafe goes has all its controls at the top end — again obviously the very top opens so that water can be poured in (tap water is never recommended to use). Before putting the carafe in, open the area so that you can take out the filter basked (both it and the carafe are dishwasher safe, btw) — this is where the grounds are placed. So now there’s water in the coffee maker as well as grounds and yes a filter has been inserted into the basket first. Getting to the controls, perhaps the most important is setting the indicator for the strength of the coffee — the amount of heat that is generated for “cooking” the coffee is automatic. Then by using the controls off you go for coffee — if you want things to start at a different time than with you standing right in front of it, just use the programmable timer and yes that LCD display shows the time to those bleary eyes. Once the coffee is made and consumed (coffee can be kept warm for up to 2 hours but who expects it to last that long?), cleaning the coffee maker can be done (see above as to dishwasher). And if to put it away, then the cord can be coiled away, but for those using this at home it’s going to stay ready to go. And because water caused problems over time, having a rescaling indication and program to use is a big help — if not an ongoing necessity. Of course hot coffee is not only what people like to drink - there’s ice coffee being enjoyed as well. One way to quickly make coffee and then cool it down with ice is by using a pour-over coffeemaker: this works without electricity and is able to quickly accomplish its goal. Melitta’s Signature Series Pour-Over Coffeemaker is plastic based and shaped somewhat similarly to a huge coffee mug with a handle even. You place the Pour-Over on top of a coffee mug and put a filter inside. Add a scoop of coffee grounds and then pour hot water so as to saturate the grounds. Once cooled, in goes the coffee into a glass or take-away mug, then ice is added (maybe sugar and milk too, up to you). This Pour-Over makes all this easy to do and is attractive red as well. The Melitta 0-Cup Aroma Enhance Glass White Coffee Maker easily becomes an integral part of one’s morning ritual — because it’s coffee! And yes that includes decaf too, because there’s room for both and Melitta is fine with that.

641,Food in Bottles,food," CHEF AKSHAY KULKARNI                                                                                     HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT Italian cuisine may be considered the origin of all Western and European cuisine. In fact, the culinary world of Italy dates back to the Roman Empire and has evolved since. Italy is also the country where the art of fine dining originated. This is why it’s considered to be among the most developed cuisines in the world known for its rich, bold flavors and its multi-layered yet smooth palatability.  Italian cuisine is also extremely art and creativity-driven with many professional chefs specializing in Italian cooking. The two cornerstones of Italian cuisine are fresh, seasonal produce and simple processes. Just between these two factors, there is a lot of ingredient diversity and stylistic influences that result in huge variations of recipes across the country. In fact, Italian food varies from village to village. Internationally, Italy is known for its wine, cheese, pasta, and pizza, but to a local, there’s so much more than that. Italy is also known for its proud heritage of celebrating food with family. This aspect results in strong cultural ties of food and celebrations. Family gatherings and reunions are often organized and celebrated with wonderful and scrumptious meals. This is particularly true on weekends where meals tend to be longer than in other cultures with feasts lasting up to a few hours. Dive a little deeper into each region and one can observe the many nuances of Italian cuisine. Spaghetti and Pizza originate from the central region of Italy. Move to the North and you’ll see a huge change in ingredients with fish, potatoes, rice, sausages, pork, and cheeses being commonplace. This region is particularly famous for stuffed pasta, polenta, and risotto. Down South, dishes are prepared mainly using tomatoes and include capers, peppers, olives, garlic, eggplant, and ricotta cheese.. What’s common to all these regions is the use of wheat as a staple part of the diet. Many globally famous breads and pastas come from Italy. Focaccia is one such example. Wheat is also the core ingredient in pasta and Italian cuisine is well known for its use of a variety of pastas. The most famous ones include - penne, spaghetti, linguini, fusilli, lasagne and ravioli. Another important attribute of the Italian kitchen is wine. Wine is used both in cooking and as a stand-alone drink, and Italy is home to some very famous vineyards. Italy is also known for its cheese and with more than 400 dairy creations, Italian cheese production has the richest varieties in flavor. However, what makes Italian food a global success is its informal, relaxed, family-style cuisine which is easily accessible across the globe. Even in India, Italian cuisine is highly rated and has many patrons with several foodies creating a space for it in their hearts and stomachs. As for me, I believe Italian cuisine can be taken explored deeply to create unique, exciting offerings to the food marketing of any country. For my profile photography project, I’ve decided to bring together Italian cuisine and a BOTTLED theme. This trend in food utilizes glass bottles to preserve the flavor of food. Glass is better than any other packaging material and bottled food doesn’t get contaminated easily as the exposed surface area is minimal. Another reason I chose this theme is because of the pandemic and its effect on the restaurant culture. This bottled approach is a new way to put forth the efforts of chefs.

These nuts will have you reaching for more! Enjoy."
643,Haleem: A Popular Meat Stew Dish,food," Rozlin loves to cook healthy food for her loving family, and she enjoys sharing her recipes with her readers. Delicious chicken haleem (stew) garnished with fried onion, coriander leaves and lemon. Haleem is a kind of stew popular in the Middle East, Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent. The dish varies from region to region. It is called keşkek in Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and northern Iraq; hareesa in the Arab world and Armenia; halim in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India; khichra in Pakistan and India. Haleem is made up of four main components. Grain, meat, spices, and cooking liquid. Grain includes wheat or barley. These two are almost always present. Lentils and rice are present depending on the originating region of the recipe. Meat includes beef meat, goat meat or chicken. Spices includes a wide variety of dry spices as well as powdered spices depending on the originating region of the recipe. Cooking liquid includes water, milk, or broth. A traditional haleem is made by firstly soaking wheat, barley, and gram lentil overnight. A spicy meat gravy called korma is prepared until the meat becomes tender. The wheat, barley and gram are boiled in salt water until they are tender. The cooked wheat, barley and lentils are then mixed with the meat gravy and blended with a heavy hand mixer to obtain a paste-like consistency. The cooking procedure takes about 6 hours to complete. In the end the cooked haleem is garnished with fried onions, julienne cut ginger, sliced green chillies, coriander leaves, lemon wedges and chaat masala. Haleem is eaten with naan or with any type of bread. However, haleem preparation varies in different regions. The origin of Haleem lies in the popular Arabian dish known as Harees. Harees was introduced in the Indian subcontinent by the Arab soldiers of the Hyderabad Nizam's army to the city. Haleem is sold as a snack food in bazaars throughout the year. It is also a special dish prepared throughout the world during the Ramadan and Muharram months of the Muslim Hijri calendar, particularly among Pakistanis and Indian Muslims. Some South Asian Muslims have started to refer to this dish as ""Daleem"", reasoning that it is more correct since the South Asian version of this dish contains large amounts of lentils(dal). Haleem is also very popular in Bangladesh, especially during the holy month of Ramadan, when it is a staple dish. Haleem has become a popular dish in the cities of Hyderabad, Telangana and Aurangabad, Maharashtra (Aurangabad, the first capital of Hyderabad State) in India. In Pakistan, Haleem is available all year round, as well as in most Pakistani restaurants around the world. Haleem is sold as a snack food and street food in Pakistani bazaars throughout the year. Khichra or khichda is also a variation of Haleem in the Indian subcontinent. Both haleem and khichra are made with same ingredients. In khichra, the chunks of meat remain as cubes, while in haleem the meat cubes are taken out of the pot, bones are removed, meat is crushed and put back in the pot. It is further cooked until the meat completely blends with the lentils, spices, wheat, and barley mixture. A high-calorie dish, haleem provides protein from the meat and fibre and carbohydrates from the various combinations of grains and pulses. This is my and my family’s favourite food. I often make it for my family. We prefer to have tandoori roti with this Haleem. I start preparing it in the morning and then we have it in lunch as well as dinner. It turns out delicious, finger-licking and tempting too. Here’s a run down of my recipe: 30 min 1 hour 1 hour 30 min Serves four people In pot, add barley and wheat. Wash them. Add water, salt, and some oil. Take a boil and off the flame. Cover the lid and soak overnight. Wash chicken thrice and squeeze out the water. Ingredients: oil, ginger garlic paste, red chili powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, salt, curd and fried onion Add soaked wheat and barley in a pressure cooker with the same water. Pressure cook barley and wheat to 1 whistle. Low the flame for 20 mins or until tender. Then off the flame. In wok, add oil, ginger garlic paste, chicken, fry until it changes color. Add red chili powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, salt, curd and mix well. Add some water to cook the chicken. Once the chicken is cooked, add fried onion, and mix well. Remove the cooked chicken pieces in a plate. Separate the bones and shred the chicken. Blend barley and wheat mixture until smooth, add shredded chicken and chicken stock cubes, mix until well combined. Let it simmer and cook slowly for half an hour. Keep stirring in between. Add garam masala powder, chaat masala. Serve hot with fried onions, chopped coriander leaves, chaat masala and lemon juice. If you do not want to use pressure cooker to cook wheat and barley, you can cook wheat and barley in a cooking pot for approx. 1 & ½ hour. While cooking haleem, do not add lemon juice in it as it can kill the real flavors of the dish. Always add it on top of Haleem as a garnish along with some fried onion. While the haleem is cooking on low flame, you do not have to stand there stirring the whole time it cooks, but every couple minutes just stop by and give it a stir or else it will start sticking to the bottom of the cooking pot. You can use mutton or beef in place of chicken as well. If there is some leftover of this dish, you can store it in an air-tight box for up to 7 days. Just reheat in microwave for 2 minutes when you want to eat, and it will remain delicious. You can serve it with tandoori butter naan or roti or any type of bread. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haleem This content is accurate and true to the best of the author’s knowledge and is not meant to substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional. © 2021 Rozlin Rozlin (author) from UAE on June 06, 2021: Thank you, Amara.

at Culinary Academy Of India France is renowned for its culture and heritage. One of the most spoken about traits of France is the rich architecture and visual prowess of its cities and towns. From the Eiffel Tower to the Musée National d'Art Moderne, France is known for its bespoke sense of style. Among these buildings, one which has sentimental and functional value is the Notre Dame Cathedral. The Notre Dame Cathedral (Paris), translated to “Our Lady of Paris” is a medieval catholic structure and that boasts an elaborate, intricate Gothic style. One of the most famous churches of France, the cathedral is located on the Île de la Cité (the heart of Paris), i.e the center of Paris. The iconic structure is roughly 800 years old and attracts millions of visitors every year. Another important attribute of the French is their cuisine. French cuisine developed throughout the centuries influenced by its surroundings. During medieval times, French cuisine was extremely similar to Moorish Cuisine where meals were served in a timely manner with courses primarily made of spiced meats. As time progressed, so did the recipes and food styles of France. Desserts slowly gained prominence and today, French desserts are among the most admired in the world. France is well known for its contributions to globally consumed pastry and baked items such as croissants, eclairs, macaroons, crepes, and crème brûlée. French dessert is a major part of weddings and celebrations. A traditional french wedding replaces the cake with a ‘croquembouche’. A croquembouche, in simple words, is a conical pile of choux pastries filled with delicious pastry cream covered and bound with threads of caramel giving it a noteworthy crunchy and heavenly taste. The recipe was first made in the 17th century and ever since then, all french wedding ceremonies include the cutting of a croquembouche. Some of the most classical and traditional French desserts that are served on all the happy occasions include: Some of the other classical desserts include: The diversity and breadth of the French cuisine served as my inspiration for my ‘Profile Photography’.

649,World-Cooking,food," Cooking is my passion and I want to share the joy of cooking by making it easy for you from start to finish! Easy to make super filling dinner. W. K. Hayes Cooking is an art and like any art, it takes heart, cooking and passion. For me, cooking is one of those passions that say a lot about who I am and the artist of culinary delights I have become. Now, for me, a fancy looking dish is the least important part of a meal. Sure, you want your food to look appetizing but what really counts is a culmination of how full you get, how delicious the meal was and most importantly, were you able to share? (I have a hard time with sharing after being tortured with all the aroma circling me like buzzard. LOL). With that thought in mind, I have decided to start sharing all of my tricks, tips and recipes in Youtube videos to help you make meals that are sure to put a smile in every belly you feed. Her recipe made my own W. K. Hayes Cooking should never be a duplication. Start with the recipe but make it your own by adding a different ingredient that says something about you. Think of cooking as a style of clothing. What you wear reflects who you are and cooking should not be any different. When you cook, create a flavor that says something about you. Never be afraid to try something new. All of my recipes are tried and true after many, many, ""not quite right"", moments. So, play around and found out what works best for you and your family and don't be afraid to try a new seasoning or ingredient that works. Sticking to a recipe is a great way to duplicate the taste but mixing up a recipe is a great way to get creative and art is all about creating. In my videos, I will do my best to start by sticking to the basics of cooking but I make no promises. Think of a recipe as a guideline but nothing that is set in stone. This was so much fun...I can't wait to do it again! W. K. Hayes Cooking should always be fun. explore all the possibilities of creating new dishes and never be afraid of trying something. Although the picture is a bit blurry, I made this homemade oriental chicken and pepper entre with a stuffed portabella mushroom on the side. It was my first attempt at trying a new recipe and my family was really glad I did. Ironically, while making this dish, I learned a new trick to frying that I later used for when I fried up some tilapia and shrimp. I enjoyed the light texture of the crust so muc, I really can't see myself frying any other way. The crust was so light and flavorful that just thinking about it is motivating me towards the kitchen. (Although, I'm under strict orders to take a day off from the kitchen...the temptation to ignore her is weighing heavily on my stomach. LOL). Either way, learning to cook is a challenge that is fun, great for impressing the person you are dating and ultimately, the best way to control what goes in your food. Eating healthy is very important and by learning to cook, you can stay on top of the ingredients you use to make the best healthy dishes while avoiding processed foods that can contain very unhealthy recipes. Eating fresh and cooking with wholesome ingredients will always be the best way for you to go. Loaded Chili...one of my favorites to have fun with when cooking. W. K.

650,How to Make the Easiest Lasagna,food," My name is Ark. I am an Indian freelance writer. I write health and food from a young age. I have some stories, poems that I will publish in HOW TO MAKE LASAGNA Lasagna is one of those classic dishes that just screams home, with rich flavors and intoxicating smells that hit you as soon as you walk through the door. This Italian favorite may seem complicated to make, but it is actually quite easy once you know what you are doing. There is no need you should not try to make this recipe yourself at home… It should come out perfect the very first time, so long as you follow these directions to the letter. So try this recipe today, and all the members of your household will be begging you to make it again and again. 1. Take a big pot of water to boil on the flame. This should be the type of pot you would make soup or chili in. Place the lid on the pot and leave it to boil. Once the water begins to boil, remove the lid and place about a teaspoon of salt in the water, to flavor the water and thus the noodles. Place twelve dry lasagna noodles into the water, pressing them down as they soften so they are fully submerged, but do not break them. Let boil for around eight minutes. The noodles do not have to be all the way done, as they will cook more in the oven. Drain the noodles in a strainer and set them aside. 2. Now it is time to make the sauce. Warm a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a pan. Finely dice one medium onion and toss it in the oil until the onion is translucent. Cubes two cloves of garlic and add to the onion. Then, pour three small cans of tomato purée over the onion mixture, stirring well. Add a bay leaf to the sauce and let it simmer until you are ready to assemble the lasagna. Craving Home Cooked 3. In a mixing bowl combine fifteen ounces of ricotta cheese, eight ounces of Parmesan, and one large egg. Stir until combined well, then add a handful of freshly chopped flat-leaf parsley. If dried parsley is all you have you can add that as well. Also, season with black pepper sand alt to enjoy the taste. 4. If you want to make this a meat lasagna, brown one pound of ground beef or sausage in a pan. Drain out any fat or grease then add the meat to the sauce mixture you have already made. 5. Now it is time for the fun part…assembling the lasagne. Pre heat an oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, and grease a lasagna pan with cooking spray. At the bottom of the pan, lay three lasagna noodles side by side, so the noodles are touching and there is no room around the edges. Then, pour a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture, followed by a layer of the sauce mix. Top the sauce with a layer of grated mozzarella cheese, and then a layer of three more noodles. Repeat this process until you are out of noodles, ricotta and sauce. Once the lasagna is finished cover it with one last layer of mozzarella cheese. 6. Place the lasagna in the oven and let it bake for about 45 minutes, or until all of the cheese is bubbling and golden brown. If the cheese is becoming too dark, you can cover it with a layer of tin foil to protect it. Once the lasagna is done, remove it from the oven. And here is an important tip– let it cool off for ten minutes before you cut into it. If you slice it too early, all of the layers will slide apart on the plate. If you give it a moment, you will have perfect, in tact slices. 7. Now cut three columns into the lasagna, and four rows going the other way, so you have twelve perfect slices. Gently lift each piece out of the tray with a spatula and serve. You can serve this with a green salad and some garlic bread for a complete meal. Enjoy! Lasagna makes a great make ahead meal. Put together a tray of this on the weekend or in your spare time, freeze it, then just heat it up one evening when you need it. © 2021 Ark"
651,Avocado Desserts Recipes,food," Avocados are the favorite fruit of millennials, including myself, for good reason. Is avocado a fruit or a vegetable? Is it a vegetable or a fruit? When we hear this question, we are frequently puzzled, and it is simple to believe that something isn't precisely what it appears to be. Avocado is commonly used in salads and savory dishes. Avocado is a fruit, not a vegetable. You can definitely connect to the debate over whether avocado is a fruit or a vegetable if you're used to eating fruit with firm seeds. Despite the fact that both have hard seeds, some people prefer soft fruits while others prefer firm ones. Avocados come in a variety of flavors, from soft to hard, depending on where you live. Above all, some people are unable to ingest avocados. Avocado isn't a vegetable; it's a fruit. It's also worth noting that an avocado and an acorn squash are not the same thing. Because the acorn is not a fruit, it is not classified as a vegetable. Avocados, on the other hand, are classified as fruits because they are primarily green. Avocado is a fruit, so it can be eaten like any other fruit. It's crucial to remember that avocado should never be eaten raw. It is high in vitamin C, which is essential for the development of the brain and nerve system and is important for healthy bones and teeth. Avocado is a healthier option when cooked or in the form of juice. Avocado also contains a lot of vitamins A and C. Both of these nutrients help in the prevention of a variety of diseases. Consume a variety of fruits and vegetables on a regular basis to ensure that your body receives all of the nutrients it needs. However, some of us have a difficult time eating more veggies and fruits than we eat in our daily diets. Certain nutrients may become deficient as a result. Deficiencies occur when the body is unable to absorb enough vitamins and minerals. Weight loss, anemia, blurry vision, and immune system issues are just a few of the inadequacies. Are you prepared to work with avocados? From chilly creamy, sweets to warm breakfast toasts, to a healthy pasta dinner for evening, here are some avocado recipes to try: 2 teaspoons unflavored gelatin 1 cup coconut cream 2 cups coconut milk ¼  teaspoon fine sea salt 3 tablespoons honey, plus more to drizzle avocado, (use the flesh), plus extra to serve 1 to 2 pinches green cardamom toasted coconut, to serve     4 pieces avocado 1 cup heavy cream 1 can condensed milk, 300-ml can ¾  cup milk 1/4 cup almonds, chopped     ½  tablespoon balsamic vinegar 1 ½  tablespoons olive oil Pepper & Salt 1 Avocado slice & diced canned diced tomatoes or fresh tomatoes (Optional)  1  sweet corn, grilled, remove kernels 2 tablespoons butter, unsalted 1 tablespoon virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon cajun seasoning salt, to taste ground black pepper, to taste 2 sliced bread, whole grain, toasted 1 avocado, flesh only, sliced thinly ½ lime, juice only ¼ cup feta cheese, crumbled 2 tablespoons cilantro, finely chopped smoked paprika lime wedges, to serve   2 servings pasta of choice 1 ripe avocado ½ garlic gloves ½ cup fresh basil 1 tbsp lemon juice 1 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp any plant-based milk Salt & pepper to taste Pinch of cayenne   Medium avocado, sliced 1/2 cup evaporated milk 1/2 cup crushed ice 2 tablespoons sugar, or more to taste   Avocados are the favorite fruit of millennials, including myself, for good reason. They boost almost every meal, including breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Lovely Tolentino (author) from Philippines on June 16, 2021: Hi ken! I love Avocados too and Yes you should try, Thank you for this wonderful comment! Ken Burgess from Florida on June 16, 2021: A lot of great ideas here, I will get around to trying a couple of them.

657,Mockmill 100,food," Lemonkerdz I love bread making and especially during these stressful times it’s one of those things to do that is therapeutic and a joy to produce something that makes the house smell amazing and then eat your hard work. As I searched around on YouTube watching bread videos ( I know sad but compelling) where I saw a machine that caught my attention, the Mockmill 100. Now I love kitchen gadgets but it did make me wonder, when you can buy flour so cheap why would you even want to spend about $180 on a machine to grind your own flour apart from the fun of it, so I started investigating. Nutritional value of home milling I was shocked to find out that freshly ground grains can lose 45-90% of its nutrients to oxidation within 24 hrs to 3 days from being milled. This is due to the oils inside the grain going rancid. Freshly milled grain is full of vitamin E but when the oils go bad that nice bread flour kept at room temp will contain toxins that are carcinogenic. So freshly ground flour is amazingly good and tasty. Flour at room temp over days is not good at all for your body. So how come flour sold at the store is months old and possibly stored in your cupboard at home for months but yet is still good to bake with? Have you read ingredients? To stop flour that is stored for weeks to months at the store from going bad, parts of the grain that contain oils, which are the vitamin cabinets of the grain are removed leaving you with white dust that’s got almost nothing left to give you, that’s why the ingredients say wheat and then words like “fortified” or “added vitamins” to put something back into the flour. Imagine if you found out they did the same process with your fruit or vegetables, Pick them, take the goodness out and then pump them up with vitamins! You wouldn’t accept it, you would cringe at the thought and never buy it. So why compromise now with your flour. Make sure you get the best for yourself and the family. Lemonkerdz Power: 360w Voltage: 230v (1,100 rpm) American version 110v (1,300rpm) Dimensions: 380x220x190 mm / 15x8.7x7.5 inch Milling mechanism: Corundum ceramic milling stones Milling efficiency: approx 100g per min Casing: Arboblend made from renewable raw materials Hopper capacity: 1,100g / 2lbs 7oz Weight: 6.6kg / 8 kg Cable length: 150cm Mockmill guarantee: 6 years The settings lever will go well beyond 1-10. I had mine set to 30 for cracking grains for home brewing. Lemonkerdz Will it grind grains? Err yes. Dont grind oily seeds like linseed as it will clog up the grinding stones. If you mistakenly ground something oily just set the machine to a course grind and run though a cup of rice with the machine running. Pass the rice through a few times until the stones are clean. Can I mill grains for home brewing? Yes. I do home brewing and set the grind to around #30 ran a few grains through to get the coarse grind I wanted like cracked grain. You may need to adjust the setting for each different kind of grain milled. Do a test batch. Run 1/2 a handful of grains through if you think the setting is right and adjust accordingl. Can it mill spices? Yes. From very fine powder to a coarse cracked pepper corn. For spices like star anise they will need to be broken up smaller to pass through the feed holes in the grain hopper feeder. After milling spices pass through the mill about a handful of rice and repeat until you are sure it’s clean. Can I pass ground flour through for a second milling for a finer texture?  Yes. Don’t pour into the hopper a whole kilo of milled flour for a second milling as it may block up the hopper feeder. I found it to be trouble free milling spooning in a little at a time but constant. Does it create a lot of dust? No. Just be sure to have a jar or bowl that sits close under the mills spout to eliminate fine dust escaping during milling. is it difficult to clean the Mockmill 100? No. After use just give it a light tap with the palm of your hand on the side of the mill to loosen any flour sitting in the spout and just put it away. No cleaning necessary. It is recommended if you are not going to use the machine for an extended period of time I.e away on vacation, you may want to remove any flour in the mill. Just remove the top and release the stones and clean brushing lightly with a clean paint brush. Do not wash with water. The outer casing can be wiped down with a damp cloth."
658,Olives Can Be Frozen - Just What I Thawed,food," I was given a gallon jar of olives the other day, and now, I'm deciding methods of keeping them.

659,How to Make Healthy Salad Recipes,food," A daily salad may appear to be a simple thing, but it can be a life-changing lifestyle adjustment. Eating a salad every day can improve your life in a variety of ways. To begin with, a salad is full of vegetables such as carrots, beets, and other root vegetables, and no matter which ones you choose, you'll find that this is an excellent method to increase your consumption of fruits and vegetables. The majority of people do not eat enough fruits and vegetables each day, and a salad can contain as many as 5-10 veggies, all of which can contribute to better health.  A salad, as part of your improved general health, can also help reduce your risk of cancer. Because many great vegetables contain antioxidants, eating a salad every day can significantly minimize your risk of contracting this life-threatening condition.  Another amazing benefit of eating a salad every day is weight loss. Did you know that those who eat a salad are less hungry all the time? For the most part this is most likely due to the high fiber nature of a salad. Higher fiber foods not only serve to enhance the function of your digestive tract, which can help you lose weight, but they can also boost your metabolism and provide a natural colon cleanse. Because most people don't get enough fiber in their diets, a salad a day might be quite beneficial to your elimination process.  Salads are naturally low in calories, allowing you to stuff your plate with a variety of healthy foods and still not overeat. Of course, it's best to stick to a low-calorie dressing and use it moderately. While fat-free dressings may appear to be a better option, they actually neutralize some of the salad's health benefits. For best health benefits, use a dressing that contains at least some fat.  If you're thinking about making some healthy lifestyle changes but aren't sure where to start, try eating a salad every day for lunch. You will discover that doing so allows you to become healthier while also providing you with a variety of options for a balanced diet and the ability to eat out at any restaurant.

661,"When Life Gives You Lemons, Reap Their Health Benefits",food," Fredda Branyon has dedicated her life to the advancement of complementary medicine. Did you know that one 58-gram lemon gives you more than 30 milligrams of vitamin C? Vitamin C is essential for good overall health, and a deficiency can cause serious health issues, including a condition called scurvy. Moreover, lemons are a rich source of good-for-you soluble fiber and plant compounds. That said, here are five evidence-based benefits of including lemons in your diet.  Health Benefits of Lemons, According to Science  You should consider adding lemon to your salad dressings, drinks, marinades, baked goods, and sauces because:  1. Lemons Make the Heart Stronger  Multiple sources (1, 2, 3) show that eating fruits and vegetables containing vitamin C minimizes your risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.  Aside from vitamin C, the fiber and plant compounds in fruits and vegetables, especially lemons, could also help reduce your risk of developing heart disease. For example, one study concluded that consuming 24 grams of citrus fiber natural extracts every day for a month can reduce blood cholesterol levels. Certain plant compounds in lemons, specifically diosmin and hesperidin, may also help manage high cholesterol levels, according to medical studies published in 2003, 2004, and 2013.  2. May Help Prevent Cancer  A well-balanced diet consisting of fruits and vegetables may prevent some cancers, particularly gastrointestinal cancers.  According to multiple studies, including a 2015 research published in the National Library of Medicine, some plant compounds in citrus fruits, including limonene and naringenin, may have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties.  In addition, a 2012 study, which used pulp from mandarins containing the plant compounds hesperidin and beta-cryptoxanthin (also found in lemons), discovered that the compounds blocked cancerous tumors from developing in the tongues, lungs, and colons of mice.  Though the results of these studies are promising, currently, no evidence suggests that lemons can stop cancer from developing, especially if malignant tumors run in your family or if you have a history of prolonged exposure to carcinogens.  3. Improve Gut Health  The primary fiber found in lemons is pectin, which is a soluble fiber associated with a myriad of health benefits. For example, soluble fiber plays a significant role in improving overall gut health and slowing the digestion of starches and sugars. As a result, blood sugar levels go down.  4. Stop Kidney Stones in Their Tracks  Kidney stones are small, hard deposits that form inside the kidneys when waste products begin to crystallize and accumulate. Each year in the United States, more than half a million people are rushed to the emergency room due to kidney stone problems.  Drinking one and a half cups (125 ml or 4 ounces) of lemon juice daily may provide enough citric acid to prevent kidney stone formation, especially in those who already had them. The citric acid in lemon juice may inhibit kidney stones by increasing both urine pH and urine volume, therefore creating a practically inhospitable environment for kidney stones to form.  5. Protects Against Anemia  Anemia, a condition describing a lack of healthy red blood cells, occurs when you have an iron deficiency. Left untreated, anemia can cause severe fatigue and pregnancy complications.  Though lemons contain trace amounts of iron, they can help prevent anemia by improving your body's ability to absorb iron from plant foods. Your digestive system absorbs iron from chicken, red meat, and fish (called heme iron) easily, unlike iron from fruits and veggies (non-heme iron). You can improve your absorption of the latter by consuming vitamin C and citric acid, which are both found in lemons. Thelma Alberts from Germany on May 28, 2021: I love using lemon in my food and my drinks. Thank you for sharing the information."

664,What Is Structured Water and How to Prepare it? Health Benefits,food," Rajan loves cooking dishes from his native Indian cuisine. He enjoys sharing his favourite recipes with his online readers. Earthen pot with Structured water RAJAN JOLLY Structured water, also called magnetised or hexagonal water is water whose structure has been altered to form a hexagonal cluster. In simple terms, this is water as pure, as unpolluted, or as uncontaminated as water found in natural spring water. Water can be restructured in various ways. Some of these are: Today, drinking water comes in contact with plastic/pvc ever so often since: Because of this plastic nanoparticles get into the water and when such water is consumed they get deposited in the digestive organs. This water is hydrophobic thus reducing the absorption of vital nutrients from food. This creates a deficiency of micronutrients like minerals and consequently, many health issues crop up if such water is consumed for an extended time. Copper plate removes these plastic nanoparticles and other impurities from the water and when structured water is consumed these get flushed out of the body. Structured water has several healing properties and should be used for all cooking and drinking purposes. Making structured water at home is a very simple process with just a few commonly available things being required for its preparation. A video showing this process is also shared in this article. The water structuring is achieved by using a copper plate/sheet. Although a copper pot can be used instead of the copper plate there are 2 reasons why it is not advised: 1. The copper pot has to be cleaned daily. This becomes a cumbersome process as copper gets oxidised very fast. Using a copper sheet makes this very easy and quick. 2. More importantly, copper has to be in contact with water for only about 6-8 hours for the water to get structured. Using a copper pot in which this water is stored for 24 hours may result in copper toxicity. Silver also structures water but the water quality has been found to be better by using copper. You can use a steel pot if you do not have an earthen pot. Do try it and share your experience. 8 hours 15 min 8 hours 15 min several servings The videos below are references for this article.

669,"8 Healthy and Easy Low-Carb, High-Protein Snack Ideas",food," Patti is a Certified Dietician who specializes in fitness and nutrition. She enjoys helping people reach their healthy lifestyle goals. Carbohydrates are complicated. They’re necessary for cell function, but eating too much of them can cause your body to feel bloated and tired. You shouldn't cut carbs completely unless advised by a physician; however, eating low-carb snacks can boost your energy level and ensure you get the other essential macronutrients you need like protein and fat, which help build muscle and promote satiety. Here's a list of eight healthy and easy low-carb, high-protein snack ideas that are delicious! Nuts and seeds are rich in protein and fiber. Convenient and tasty, nuts and seeds make an easy snack that contributes to a healthy lifestyle. In addition to their taste, tree nuts and peanuts contain no cholesterol and are rich in important nutrients including protein, fiber and unsaturated fatty acids. They also contain relevant micronutrients such as folic acid, niacin and vitamins E and B6 and minerals such as magnesium, copper, zinc, selenium, phosphorus and potassium. Trail mix is an ideal on-the-go snack. However, most store-bought trail mixes contain high-carb ingredients and are usually loaded with sugar and industrial oils. Here is a healthier low-carb version you can make yourself. Combine your favorite nuts, seeds, chocolate, and coconut in a plastic baggie and shake vigorously until everything is well coated with the cinnamon. Pecans 4 3 Walnuts 4 4 Peanuts 6 7 Almonds 6 6 Pine Nuts 4 4 Sunflower Seeds 7 6 Pumpkin Seeds 4 9 Dark Chocolate (70-85%) 13 2 Unsweetened Coconut Flakes 8 2 Cinnamon (1 tsp) 2 0.1 Ham and pickle roll-ups can be eaten as an appetizer or a snack. Ready in five minutes, ham and pickle roll-ups are super addicting! They're great as an appetizer and even better as a snack. Spread cream cheese onto ham slice and place pickle spear on top. Gently roll. Cut the roll crosswise into 1/2"" to 1"" pieces. This is a very versatile snack and can be customized to your liking. Here are some recipe variations to change things up a little: The variations are endless! Cream Cheese (1 tbsp) 1 1 Dill Pickle (1 spear) 1 0.2 Cucumber (1 stick) 0.4 0.1 Ham Slice (1 oz) 0.3 6 Chives (1 oz) 1 1 Hard-boiled eggs are so simple and easy but yet extremely low in carbs and full of brain-healthy nutrients such as vitamin B12 and choline. One large egg is packed full of protein. Boil a batch of eggs at the beginning of the week, and you're all set for the rest of the week. 1 Hard-Boiled Egg 1 13 Fruit and yogurt are a great combination any time of the day. Fruit and yogurt parfaits are an excellent choice for a low-carb breakfast, but they also make for a healthy snack. Berries come in a variety of colors and can have a sweet or sour taste. They are highly nutritious and high in fiber, vitamin C and antioxidants. For a quick and delicious, low-carb snack, layer yogurt, fruit and granola, then repeat 1 or 2 more times. You can use your favorite low-fat yogurt or cream, any low-carb fruit mixture or nuts instead of granola. Strawberries 2 0.2 Blueberries 4 0.2 Raspberries 3 0.3 Cranberries 3 0.1 Blackberries 3 0.4 Greek Yogurt (6 oz) 7 17 Heavy Whipping Cream 0 0 Granola 15 4 Nuts *See Section 1 *See Section 1 If you're trying to manage a sugar craving, it's sometimes better to eat naturally sweet fruits. However, some fruits come with more carbs, so be careful. Dark chocolate satisfies the sweet tooth. When you’re craving something sweet, dark chocolate is the perfect low-carb treat to satisfy that sweet tooth. Just remember moderation is key. Quality dark chocolate is rich in fiber, iron, magnesium, copper, manganese and a few other minerals. For a quick little treat, try spreading 1 tablespoon of cashew butter (or any other low-carb spread) onto 1 ounce of dark chocolate. Just remember the darker the chocolate, the fewer the carbs. Dark Chocolate (70-85%) 13 2 Cashew Butter 9 3 Peanut Butter 7 6 Hazelnuts 5 4 Almond butter 5 4 Cinnamon roasted pumpkin seeds taste like autumn. Pumpkin seeds are rich in zinc, an essential mineral needed for optimal immune health and metabolism. Cinnamon Toasted Pumpkin Seeds are very simple to make with very few ingredients. Combine ½ cup of pumpkin seeds with ½ teaspoon of cinnamon and 2 teaspoons of olive oil. Spread the seeds evenly onto a baking sheet and bake in a 300-degree oven for 45 minutes or until the seeds are golden brown. Pumpkin Seeds (1 oz) 4 9 Cinnamon (1 tsp) 2 0.1 Olive Oil 0 0 Eat the rainbow with freshly cut vegetables. Plain vegetables are one of the healthiest snacks a person can eat. Simply wash and slice a variety of fresh veggies into sticks and enjoy. Some low-carb veggies include: Pairing these veggies with a dip low in carbs gives you a special treat with added flavor. You can always buy dips at the store, but I recommend making your own homemade dip because then you know exactly what goes in it with no preservatives added. Here are some quick dip recipes you can whip up at home. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and mix well. Place avocados in a medium bowl and slightly mash with a fork or potato masher leaving some large chunks. Add remaining ingredients and mix well to combine. Using a metal strainer or coffee filter, strain the yogurt for a few hours to remove as much liquid as possible and set aside. Mince cucumber slices in a food processor, drain the liquid in a metal strainer and sprinkle with a little salt to help release the liquid. Use the back of a spoon to help squeeze out any excess liquid. Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl and mix well. Cottage cheese is a calcium-rich food. Cottage cheese is low in carbohydrates and rich in bone-building minerals such as calcium and phosphorus. Many people add fruit for extra flavor, but you can also add avocado slices, cherry tomatoes, chopped green onions or hot sauce for a more savory dish.

673,Streusel Topping for Banana Bread for Example,food," The streusel topping is mixed together. I used a small metal bowl to mix the ingredients together. I didn't really measure, but there was an equal amount of sugar and flour and I liberally sprinkled cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger across the mix before I added half a stick of melted butter. The combination is mixed with a fork, and mine was crumbly. My banana bread was freshly poured into a bread pan and I dumped the streusel mixture over the raw bread and spread it to the edges of the pan. The butter will melt into the bread, and the remaining flour, sugar and seasonings will fry together, resulting in a crispy, spicy coating. The bread was baked a good hour, maybe an hour and 15 minutes. The topping rides up with the bread baking. The bread that I created was banana bread with rhubarb. It's a wet bread, almost like a bread pudding by the time it is done baking. Generally, banana bread is stiff enough to pick up with your fingers, but with the addition of a bunch of rhubarb, it is too sloppy to do anything but eat with a fork."

676,"7 Ways to Prepare a Healthy, Mouth-Watering, Veggie Zucchini Dish",food," Evangeline Pulgo is a culinary enthusiast and has studied various ways of cooking healthy foods and baking cakes and pastries. zucchini pexels.com Just like many other types of squash, Zucchini is native to Central America. However, it’s thanks to the Italians who popularized the veggie that we’ve come to know and love today. They coined the name zucchini, which means ‘little squash’ for the new food that was brought to Italy by New World explorers and integrated into all kinds of dishes fast. Zucchini dishes spread to cuisines all over the world. They’re easy to cook, amazingly versatile, and is nutrition-packed. A medium-sized zucchini only has 25 calories and contains more potassium than a banana. A zucchini furthermore also is a great source of vitamin A, folates, and manganese. How do you enjoy your zucchini dish? There are several ways. The first thing to do however is to choose zucchini that’s about six to eight inches long and firm to the touch. It has a dried-out stem and feels heavy. It could also be yellow or green with a glossy texture. Make sure to rinse the vegetable under cold, running water before using it in your recipe. You can enjoy it raw or cook in an air-fryer, microwave, oven, or on a grill or stove. Check out these five tips.  1. Zucchini could be simply steamed in the microwave. Slice into bite-size pieces and put in a microwave-safe bowl. Use a lid to cover the bowl, but leave one corner slightly open. Cook for four to six minutes until soft. If it’s not yet tender, cook for one more minute and repeat until you get the desired texture. 2. For a big amount of zucchini, using an oven is an efficient way to cook.After cutting the veggie in half, remove the seeds. Drizzle the zucchini with olive oil and with salt and paper, season to taste. Roast cut-side down around 30 to 60 minutes at 400 degrees until a fork could be easily inserted. Remove from the oven and let cool. 3. Cook in an air fryer for a crunchy texture. Commonly, an air fryer is used to make ‘zucchini chips.’ Cut thinly, then remove excess moisture by patting dry with a paper towel. Use olive oil, salt, and pepper, and then put the slices in the air fryer’s basket. For 8 minutes, cook at 350 degrees. However, the cooking time may differ, depending on the thickness of the slices. Zucchini chips will have a slightly brown appearance with a crisp texture. 4. Grilling typically is associated with fish and meat. Vegetables, however, could also be grilled. To grill zucchini, slice it into ½ inch-thick pieces. On a bowl, sprinkle the pieces with seasoning, adding a small amount of olive oil. You could opt to put the veggie on a grill pan or wrap it in aluminum foil. For grill marks, cut the veggie lengthwise and place it over the grates. Grill for about 3 to 4 minutes per side over medium heat. 5. Sautéing over a stovetop will boost the zucchini’s flavor. Slice it into quarters or circles to make bite-size pieces. To make zucchini noodles, or zoodles, use a vegetable peeler or knife to slice into thin strips. In a pan, mix one to two teaspoons of olive oil then cook over medium heat. It should be lightly brown and tender. Use salt and pepper to taste. 6. If you’re in the mood to broil, the smaller, more tender version of zucchini, the baby zucchini, is the best pick. Flash the vegetables under the broiler for a minute or two and enjoy delicious mellow zucchini bites. This is an easy and quick way to cook zucchini as a side dish served together with a pan-seared fish, roasted chicken, or pork tenderloin. 7. Zucchini is also delicious when baked, breaded, or crisped up. Bake this veggie with layers of marinara sauce together with two kinds of cheese such as mozzarella and cheddar cheese. Spread the sauce and cheese liberally on the middle portion of the zucchini but exclude the edges so they’re crunchy when they’re cooked.  Eating enough fruits and vegetables is important. Thus, if you include zucchini in your diet, you are keeping your body well-hydrated, healthy, and toxin-free.

678,Nutritious Herbal Chicken Soup with Ginseng and Chicken Essence,food," Brian loves food and enjoys exploring various cuisines. He is a keen experimenter in the kitchen and finds cooking therapeutic. A nutritious tonic AthenaChanEmes Being adventurous has brought me out from my motherland, and I ended up in a country known for its melting pot of culture, which has so much good food. Growing up in Nigeria, I had been exposed to a myriad of herbs as a result of having generous amounts of it in our various delicacies. Upon marrying my wife who is of Chinese ethnicity, we both embarked on a journey of gastronomical adventure, delighting each other with our vastly different styles of cooking and totally different dietary preference. One very impressionable moment was when my wife introduced this herb - ginseng, which she cheekily called the man-root. Well, I later found out that ginseng was a root with a peculiar appearance that highly resembles a person. Its’ root were forked-shaped and looks like the legs of a man, hence, the name. I was initially hesitant to try it out, but, gave in after much persuasion from my wife. The winning argument was that ginseng has medicinal value and integrating it into our diet can help to greatly improve our health, when consumed in the right amount. I did some research on the herb and found out that ginseng actually have quite a number of science-backed health benefits. An article in Healthline stated that ginseng is actually a potent antioxidant that can help reduce inflammation and improve the capacity of body cells. In addition, taking ginseng in small amounts can also help improve brain function. Amongst the positive effects recognized in subjects that were examined, was that their brain functions ranging from behavior, memory, and mood vastly improved. On top of that, ingestion of ginseng actually boosts the subject’s mental performance and reduced their fatigue as well. With all these newfound information, I decided to give this ginseng root a try. The most common way to get the best benefit of ginseng is to consume it on its own, such as slicing it thinly and chewing on it. Another way would be to add it into a cup of hot water and let it steep for awhile before drinking it. Some people even consume the whole root by grounding it into powder form and adding it into cooked food, preferably steamed dishes. Well, my wife and mother-in-law have their own personal favorite recipe using ginseng and they have agreed for me to share it here. Do let me know if you like it in the comments below! COOKING TIPS 1.	Consuming chicken essence on its own is good enough, but adding it into the soup enhances the flavor more. 2.	Using a slow cooker to slow-boil the soup allows the ginseng and chicken essence to absorb into the chicken meat, boosting its’ flavor and texture. 10 min 4 hours 4 hours 10 min 1 - 3 Clockwise from top - Wolfberries, red dates, and sliced ginseng AthenaChanEmes Fomec Essence of Chicken with American Ginseng and Cordyceps. A personal favorite of mine although there are better brands such as Brand's Essence of Chicken AthenaChanEmes Put in the chicken, red dates, ginseng, wolfberries, and water into the slow cooker pot or ceramic pot AthenaChanEmes Slow cook the soup for 4 hours in a slow cooker. If you are cooking using a ceramic pot on normal stove, you can let it cook a little longer to absorb the chicken essence better AthenaChanEmes Ready to dig in! AthenaChanEmes Serving Suggestions You may serve the soup with rice as a side dish. Otherwise, you may also blanch noodles and add into the soup to make it into a herbal noodle dish. © 2021 Brian Brian (author) from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia on May 22, 2021: Yes, Louise!

679,How to Make Moist and Soft Sago Idli (Sabudana Idli),food," I like to cook and eat natural, healthy, and tasty foods, and I enjoy sharing recipes from my native Indian cuisine. Sago Idli (Sabudana idli) served with coconut chutney Sago idli (Sabudana idli) is a brilliant variation of the regular South Indian idli, but it has a unique taste. Unlike South Indian idli, Sago idli doesn't include white lentils in the batter. Sago idli batter is made of sago, rice semolina, and curd. This batter is then added with grated veggies, ginger, and tempering. South Indian idli is made with rice semolina and white lentil batter. However, both types need fermentation of the batter. Sago idlis are spongy and colorful. They are protein-rich. Serve them hot with coconut chutney or pickle. Though they are heavy, they are easily digestible. Enjoy these scrumptious idlis for breakfast! 15 min 20 min 35 min Serves 3 or 4 people Step one: Soak the rice semolina in lukewarm water for 10 minutes. Discard the water. Add fresh water. Squeeze the water out and add the semolina to a mixing bowl. Add the sago. Add thick curd and salt While adding water little by little, prepare a dropping consistency (idli batter consistency) batter. Cover it and rest for 8 hours or overnight. Step two: During resting, the batter ferments and increases in volume. Check for consistency. Add water and mix well to get the dropping consistency. Add grated carrots and grated ginger. Also, add the tempering as per instructions. Mix well. Step three: Add fruit salt or baking soda. Pour a tablespoon of water over it. When bubbles form on it, mix the batter gently. Now, the batter is ready for making idlis. Step four: Grease the hollow containers of the idli maker with oil or ghee. Keep the steamer or cooker ready for making idlis. Place a cashew nut on each of the hollow containers. Add the batter until the brim. Place the stand inside the cooker. Cover it with the lid. Don't place the cooker weight. Steam-cook it for 20 minutes. Turn off the heat. Open the cooker lid after 3 minutes. Take the idli stand out. Sprinkle some water over the hot idlis. This will make the idlis moist and super soft. Step five: When they are not so hot, remove the idlis from the idli maker. Serve hot idlis for breakfast with coconut chutney or any other chutney or sambar. Enjoy the taste. They make a delightful breakfast! ShailaSheshadri (author) from Bengaluru on May 22, 2021: I am pleased to know that you are going to try this recipe. Thanks for reading my article. ShailaSheshadri (author) from Bengaluru on May 22, 2021: True. Sago idli is healthy and delicious. Thanks for reading my article.

680,Equilibrium -Chocolate Showpiece With Gateaux,food," Chef Unnati  Supekar
Chef Instructor
Culinary Academy Of India There’s more to a plate of food than just the ingredients and the taste. Especially at the higher levels of cooking. An important part of a tasty dish is how it looks - and this is where food styling comes in. Food styling and presentation refers to how the different components of the dish are modified, processed, arranged, or decorated, all done to enhance its aesthetic and visual appeal to make the dish look more appetizing. There are many ways plating can be done with basic geometrical shapes or a more abstract interpretation of its components. My theme with this dish is ‘Equilibrium’, and as the name suggests, it’s all about balance. Equilibrium is a state when opposite forces act on each other. When it comes to food plating, this term goes hand-in-hand with symmetry and shape.  The word symmetry has many meanings and symmetry is defined as being exactly similar to the eye of an observer. There’s usually a plane of symmetry, think of it as an axis, around which symmetry can be observed. In the real world, kaleidoscopes come close to bringing this concept to life. As a naturally occurring theme, symmetry is often associated with balance and beauty. There’s an art to being exact. Much like a harmonious flock of birds flying behind a leader, symmetry is extremely captivating. When we talk about food plating, symmetry plays an extremely important role as it draws the eyes to the plane of symmetry and allows the customers to immerse themselves in the visual euphony of the dish. the dish. While plating a symmetrical dish it’s important to think of halves and mirrors. A mirror projects an exact reflection, similarly, the first half of the dish must look the exact same as the second. There can be no change in the appearance of either half. This is a classical style of plating that allows for an interesting interplay between colors, shapes, textures, and ingredients. It is also a commonly seen technique with several famous plates and platters following this design language. For my dish, I have used a prop, a gateau, and a base; all three of which have some classical elements and I worked around this to create a unique visual blend to make it look like a single shape. The gateau is a beautiful flavor balanced recipe made up of 5 different layers topped on one another and molded into different shapes. When it came to the assembly and presentation, it was pertinent to show a balance of forces, and the final showcase just does that. Gateaux Name: Velvetique  Caramel & Milk Chocolate Mousse Ingredients  Method1)  In a pan, add the caster sugar and caramelize. To this add cream and gently mix it in.

686,Enduri Pitha ( Turmeric Leaf Wrapped Dumpling ),food," In my blogs you will find melange of dishes discovered of my own and some (foods and flavors) are influenced of our ancestors. Delightsum The aroma of the steamed dumpling is known as endure pitha or turmeric wrapped dumplings, prepared on the day of Prathama Ashtami. The turmeric itself a sattvic food intensifies when heated and impact in the dish to sooth our thinking and calm thoughts, could be the reason of preparing the holy dish by our eldest. Though the name it self described it is a pitha or we can say it’s a steamed dumpling.

689,Top 5 Blursed Flavor Combinations That People Actually Eat,food," Stephen is a former dinner theater actor, humilitarian, unemployed mascot and general home cuisine meth lab technician. Bon Appétit Courtesy of Reddit From the award winning thread: What is a random combination of food you always eat but don’t tell anyone because you know it sounds nasty together? These are questionable flavor combinations carefully curated and ranked in order of how much they upset my wife. We frequently read the internet while laying on the sofa together, and she would never willingly subject herself to this kind of gross-out thread, but that's why we're married. I can read her the highlights and see which make her gag. These were her least favorite, in ascending order of most upset reaction. Peanut Butter Pickle is rough. But let's not pretend that people aren't stranger than fiction. These were real meal choices made by readers and I've ranked them in order for your pleasure or displeasure, depending on how you roll. ""Sounds abhorrent, but goes surprisingly well together. Salty and sweet."" Sweet, velvety nutella spread and the tangy brine of cured Italian meats. Not many would opt for this particular combination, but one reader swears by it. A commenter replied: ""That's how you make salmonella."" While this seems like a lunch time non-starter, it merely makes number 5 in our top 5 bizarre flavor combos list. If you're tired of putting milk over cereal, why not switch up your morning beverage lineup? Another reader replied: ""I once saw a kid pour equal parts milk and orange juice into his cereal. It didn't really mix, it looked like mottled like colby jack cheese."" Which seems bad enough, but another reader went on to explain this phenomenon in greater detail. ""Milk mixed with an acid will almost always cause curdling. The proteins in the milk denature and clump together. It is the same way you make a really simple farmer's cheese."" Science really has a way of taking something repulsive and making it very slightly less awful through understanding. They explain it thusly: ""Hot chocolate with raw eggs, the boiling water cooks the eggs."" And the image alone made me shiver, but then another user was quick to swoop in and make sense of it through the lens of an American tradition. ""This sounds like a variation on Swedish egg coffee."" And ""Basically, a raw egg (and sometimes the shell) is added to the coffee grounds before the hot water is introduced. It’s good stuff."" I'll be sure to serve some in the morning whenever I have company from Scandinavia and see if I get any strange looks. ""Different yolks for different folks I guess."" ""Im calling the f****** police."" This may be an over-reaction, or maybe not. Certainly, there are very few endorsements for this flavor profile and nobody but the original commenter is suggesting that this would be a nice snack for anyone. I honestly feel it's petty to include a straight up gross-out one like this, but that's why I'm only giving this the #2 spot. I would have left it out, but the reader seems sincere and actually eats this. You can put peanut buter on a pickle, you can dip a cucumber in mustard or put jelly on your grilled cheest, but please don't drink vienna sausage water in front of me. One claims: ""My boyfriend puts in the fridge so it kinda gelifies & eats that. It’s horrendous!"" That's simply a dealbreaker. ""That's like the old thing of using hot dog water to make ice cubes for the drinks of people you don't like."" Eau de Sausage would definitely increase my likelyhood of socially distancing myself from your dinner party. I passed up a lot of really bad flavors to list these 5.

693,3 Breakfasts With Peanut Butter: Delicious Recipes to Start the Day,food," Misbah is a kitchen geek. She loves to cook for her family and share her recipes. Corleto Peanut butter Photo by Corleto Peanut butter on Those of us who like to cook and enjoy little things are constantly looking for new recipes, dishes, and breakfasts that bring joy to the day while helping us take care of ourselves. The more we read, the more information we have and the more we can choose from, which is why in the battle of property-rich breakfasts, oats or peanut butter, for example, have gained ground. Unlike pistachios or pine nuts, peanuts are a cheap alternative to consume nuts, they are rich in protein and although they tend to have a high caloric intake (that is, we should not consume much if we are watching our calories) they are a great alternative for breakfasts where we need energy and motivation. Without a doubt, an unbeatable source of energy and a great option to make delicious recipes to start the day on the best foot. Consuming them in the right amount first thing in the morning will be perfect to start the day. In addition, they reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases due to their monounsaturated fats, they are a powerful antioxidant and they have a lot of fiber. When consuming butter or peanut butter, you must take something into account: the recipe with which it is made. On many occasions, we find packaging in the supermarket that looks very good, but when we observe their nutritional content we realize that they are full of sugar and they give us an extra that we are not interested in. Therefore, my advice is that you do it yourself. It is very simple, nothing cumbersome and it is the best way to make sure that the ingredients it contains are 100% reliable: the ones you have added! Do you dare? In addition to the homemade recipe, we bring you the 7 most spectacular breakfasts with peanut butter. Do not miss the details. Peanut butter is also a good source of copper, a mineral that helps maintain our bone health, immune function, and blood vessels. Some research suggests that getting enough copper in your diet may reduce your risk for osteoporosis and heart diseases. Take a good handful of natural or roasted peanuts (without salt) and crush them with a mincer or mixer for two minutes. In this first step, you need to be patient, as it will take time for them to be thoroughly crushed (in a creamy texture) and not just-chopped. Approximately a minute after grinding we will begin to see the paste, although at first, it will be very dense. Give yourself a few more seconds to get the perfect texture. Peanut Butter Photo by Irene Kredenets on In some recipes, you may find that they encourage you to add a few drops of extra virgin olive oil, but my recommendation is that you do not. Peanuts already have an oil that will give you a creamy texture and adding more to it is adding an excess of fat that you really do not need. Also, those bought in supermarkets usually have added sugar and salt, but I do not recommend that you add them at first. Only if your recipe, when you go to consume it, is necessary. Once the creamy texture is prepared, store it in a jar and put it in the fridge. This will last for weeks, but you must bear in mind that being homemade and without additives, part of the natural peanut oil will rise to the surface over the days and you will need to mix everything again when you go to consume it. Easy, simple and very natural! We already have our peanut butter now. So shall we talk to prepare some breakfasts to enjoy it? Fun facts about peanuts Peanuts are not actually nuts at all. They are legumes – like beans, peas and lentils. Th peanut plant is unusual because it flowers above the ground, but fruits below the ground. Runner peanuts are preferred for peanut butter, and are grown primarily in Georgia, Alabama, Florida and Mississippi. Africans ground peanuts into stews as early as the 1400s; Chines have crushed peanuts into creamy sauces for centuries; and Civil War soldiers dined on “peanut porridge.” The first step is to toast the bread in a toaster or pan so that it is crunchy. Meanwhile, cut the avocado/ bananas into slices. When the toast is ready, spread the peanut butter (to taste) on top and let it melt a little with the heat. Later place the avocado/ banana slices. You can also add some sesame seeds to give it a nice finish if you like. Peanut butter is a good source of Vitamin E, Niacin (B3), Manganese, Vitamin B6, Magnesium Put the oatmeal and the egg whites in the blender and beat everything well. When we have the mixture we have two options: the first is to add the peanut butter to the mixture, before making the pancakes, and the second, to add it later. If you decide to do it before, you must mix well and make the pancakes in a non-stick pan over medium heat. When you have them ready, it would only be left to put the sliced ​​banana or any seasonal fruit of your choice on top. If you prefer to add it later, you will have to make the pancakes and then garnish it with the fruits and the peanut butter on the top. Great! oat pancakes with peanut butter and fruits Do you know March is National Peanut Month; November is National Peanut Butter Lovers Month. Slice of sliced ​​bread Half an apple One teaspoon of cinnamon Peanut butter to taste Toast the sliced ​​bread as you like and when it is warm spread the peanut butter with the help of a knife or a spoon. Then cut the apple into thin slices and place them on top. You can leave it fresh or put it in the microwave for a few seconds to make it a little. Later add the cinnamon powder to it to taste and enjoy! Delicious! Do you know any more recipes for peanut butter breakfasts? They sure are to die for. Nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter quite like unrequited love. — Charles M.

696,Food Review at the Bengaluru International Airport,food," Pixabay I had to fly to Chennai from Bengaluru in India on 15th August 2018. My flight was scheduled to depart at around 11 am from Bengaluru's Kempegowda International Airport. I had made an online booking through Air India's website for my scheduled flight. However, my flight was delayed and the re-scheduled departure was now at 3 pm. I had plenty of time to check out my maiden visit to Bengaluru's Kempegowda International Airport. As usual, I started off from home at 7 am to travel by public transport BMTC bus to Kempegowda Bus Station in Central Bengaluru. BMTC is the flagship public transport carrier in Bengaluru and operates intra-city shuttles extensively in Bengaluru. BMTC has also made special arrangements for air travelers to connect to Bengaluru's Kempegowda International Airport from Central Bus Station located at Kempegowda Bus Station. BMTC operates dedicated air-conditioned shuttles titled 'Vayu Vajra' to the airport on a round-the-clock basis. My shuttle from Kempegwoda Bus Station operates on route number KIAS-9 to Bengaluru's Kempegowda International Airport via Shivananda Circle, Mekhri Circle, UAS College, Hebbal, IAF bus stop to finally reach the airport. The shuttle was ready to depart from the bus bay at 7.30 am. I quickly got in and settled in my seat. The crew collected the ticket fare and it was around INR 235/- to the airport. The bus was packed in the morning as it was a weekend holiday along with the celebration of India's Independence Day falling on the same day. Pixabay The shuttle made a smooth journey in the early morning to the airport as the traffic was less. We soon made it to the airport at around 8.25. am and it took us nearly an hour to reach the airport from Bengaluru's Central Bus station. I got off from the BMTC shuttle which parked the bus opposite to departure gates at the airport's BMTC bus terminal. I could witness an early morning crowd at the Departure hall of the airport. I waited my turn to get inside the terminal after verification of my e-ticket with the identity card. As soon as I entered the departure hall, I quickly rushed to Air India's economy waiting in line to get my boarding pass. After waiting for about 20 minutes in the line, my turn to present the identity card and e-ticket came up. The ticketing agent quickly scanned the e-ticket and informed me that I need to wait till 9 am to get the final status of my flight. I had no choice but to leave the counter. At first, I sensed that there might be a delay in issuing the boarding pass though my flight was on time as per the display screen. I soon spotted the Cafe Coffee Day outlet in the corner of the departure hall. I had to wait for about ten minutes in the queue to place my order and soon I was sipping a cup of hot coffee. I entered Air India's boarding gate lane for economy class passengers at around 9 am. Yet again I had to wait for about 15-20 minutes to arrive at the ticketing counter. I presented my e-ticket and identity card at the counter and my ticket was scanned. This time the scan was successful and I was issued a boarding pass for my trip to Chennai and as requested I was allotted a window seat in the last row of the Airbus aircraft. After collecting my boarding pass, I headed to the security check area located on the first floor. After the security check I rushed off to my boarding gate to view the status of my departure and it was not yet updated. As I had plenty of time ahead of the scheduled departure at 11 am, I headed to have some yummy breakfast. Pixabay The restaurant selling the breakfast on the mezzanine floor was crowded too. I had to wait again for my turn to pay cash and order for breakfast and 15 minutes passed off without any hassle. I had ordered yummy idli vada and masala dosa along with a cup of hot filter coffee. I relished and enjoyed the breakfast at the airport's restaurant. Soon it was time to head to the departure gates and I could see that all the passengers were waiting at the boarding gate to get the final status of the flight departure time. However, at around 10.45 am I along with several passengers received an SMS alert informing me about the delay in departure of my flight and the re-scheduled time at 3 pm. Many passengers were anxious and at 11 am an official announcement was made regarding the delay in departure. Some of the passengers intended to get on to another connecting flight while some had to cancel the plans. I was feeling a bit relaxed after the official announcement was made. I was happy that I had plenty of time to spend my first time at the airport. The aircraft crew informed the passengers that the lunch was made available at around 12.30 pm only for the Chennai-bound passengers. I quickly glanced through the boarding hall and found a display board leading to the 'Above Ground Level' lounge. Since this was my first time at the airport, I decided to try the lounge and have lunch before the scheduled departure at 3 pm. Pixabay 'Above Level Lounge' is located on the top floor of the boarding hall. One can gain entry to the lounge through the elevators and staircase. As soon as I entered the lounge floor, the reception desk was abuzz with a long queue of passengers who wished to visit the lounge. I had to wait here for another 15 minutes to make the payment at the reception desk. The payment was successful and I opted for the non-alcoholic beverages and veg food option. The lounge was busy with many passengers as it was a weekend holiday. I headed to a lounge chair to keep my backpack tucked into it safely so that it is easier for me to have lunch. Upon arrival, I was greeted with a choice of mango or orange juice as a welcome drink. I opted for orange juice and it was very refreshing to start off my lunch course. Soon I made a quick tour of the lounge area and food spread. The lounge had an excellent buffet arrangement with a wide variety of North Indian and South Indian cuisines. The lounge also had a live counter catering to dosa and paratha requests by the guests. I also had a look at the starters which were offered to the guests as a special dish on the occasion of Indian Independence Day. A special pastry made of tri-color with sweets was offered to the guests. I quickly grabbed spring rolls as a starter and tasted the pastry along with sweets. It was tasty and had an interesting aroma due to the freshness.Next, I headed to opt for main course lunch. The following items were available to the guests I opted for a naan, vegetarian gravy, paneer dish, fried rice, papad, curd rice, sweets, and rose milk. The lunch was wholesome and I enjoyed the food at the lounge. Since it was a special day, the ambiance was vibrant with a festive spirit and guests had ample time to spend at the lounge with a wide variety of food at the lounge. After my lunch, I had some more time before the scheduled departure time at 3 pm. I headed to recliners to take a nap and read a newspaper. I spent some time relaxing at the lounge and also got a good view of the busy departure hall. The lounge also has a flight departure display screen. I noticed that my boarding gate for the Air India flight to Chennai was announced with the scheduled departure at 3 pm. I quickly grabbed my backpack and rushed to the boarding gate. Pixabay I could spot many passengers bound to Chennai already waiting at the gate. Since my seat was located in the last row of the flight, the last row passengers were called first to the departure gate. Soon we could spot the arrival of our Air India flight specially arranged from Chennai, (as informed by the airline staff). The boarding gates were opened and I was the first person to board the flight. I settled in my seat with a good view of the apron of Bengaluru's Kempegowda International Airport. Soon the flight was full of passengers with the exception of up to five seats which remained vacant due to last-minute cancellations. The flight was one time and left Bengaluru at 3 pm. The weather outside was gloomy with few spells of rain showers witnessed at Bengaluru and there was no sunshine. We made it to Chennai within 40 minutes and landed in Chennai at 3.45 pm. The flight was delayed for about five hours but I had sufficient time to enjoy and relish the food at the airport's lounge.

699,Warm & Comforting Nigerian Fish Pepper Soup,food," Brian loves food and enjoys exploring various cuisines. He is a keen experimenter in the kitchen and finds cooking therapeutic. A tantalising bowl of hot and spicy Tilapia fish pepper soup CharlesEmes My better half and I love to cook, and the lockdown has given us the opportunity to utilise our kitchen more than usual. Although we are not professional chefs or cooks, my wife and I will take turns donning the apron to show off our self-acquired skills. Our recent favorite is this Nigerian fish pepper soup, which was adapted from the West African cuisine. For those that have experience preparing West African cuisine might testify that the process can be an uphill task, especially if you are making the dish from scratch. Growing up in Nigeria, I had lived in Owerri which is situated in Imo state and there are several rivers in Owerri which blessed us with an abundant supply of fish. On certain evenings, the boys will gather by the river to try our luck; if we managed to catch a Tilapia, it will surely end up in a pot of fish pepper soup. I had a recollection of me going to the village market with my aunt as a little boy, to get Tilapia on days when we wanted to have the dish but did not manage to catch any fish. The village market is situated close to the rivers which guaranteed only the freshest produce, whereby every fish caught is instantly sold to eager customers. The fish pepper soup dish uses quite a myriad of organic ingredients and definitely lots of spices, which makes it impossible to resist for those that can take the heat. This fragrant and mouth watering dish features a distinct blend of ingredients such as the freshwater Tilapia and combination of spices and seasonings. It is usually eaten in exclusive Nigerian bars and restaurants. Nonetheless, you may still find this dish in any roadside stalls in the streets across Nigeria, but, the locals will lead you to find the better tasting ones. In Owerri, numerous restaurants may offer a variety of fish or seafoods in their own distinct version of pepper soup. However, those die hard lovers of fish pepper soup will definitely tell you that they prefer the ones cooked using Tilapia or either catfish. I personally prefer Tilapia, because the meat is able to soak up the flavour of the spices and seasonings better. Additionally, most would opt for Tilapia fish because it is inexpensive and thus easy on the wallet. COOKING TIPS 1.	Adding a stalk of lemongrass gives the pepper soup an amazing aroma. 2.	If you can’t handle the spiciness of the scotch bonnet peppers, you may use it minimally and substitute it with more portions of bird’s eye chilies instead. 3.	The combination of herbs and spices in the pepper soup spice mixture gives the soup an extra oomph. You may source for pepper soup spice in an African grocery store. 4.	Adding smoked paprika gives the pepper soup a hint of smokiness. 5 min 30 min 35 min 2 - 4 persons Clockwise from bottom to top – Red chilies, green bird’s eye chilies, scotch bonnet peppers, lemongrass, fresh bay leaf, red onion, spices and seasonings, and Tilapia fish CharlesEmes Put a pot of water to boil CharleEmes Once the water is boiling, put a whole onion in CharlesEmes Add in all the chilies, spices and seasonings along with a stalk of lemongrass CharlesEmes Cover the pot with its lid and let the spices cook for 10 minutes CharlesEmes Add in the fish into the pot to cook with the boiled seasonings and spices CharlesEmes After the fish is cooked, put in the chopped red and green bird's eye chili CharlesEmes Garnish the fish pepper soup with cilantro before serving CharlesEmes Serving Suggestions I normally eat the pepper soup on its own, but you can serve it with plantain or rice. For added texture and bite, you may even add boiled yam into the soup. © 2021 Brian Brian (author) from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia on May 16, 2021: Good to hear that, Liz! My family and I are doing fine over here, keeping safe indoors. Thank you for asking. Do agree with you that soup requires a lot of preparation,but, there are some recipes that are quite simple too. Either way, the effort invested will surely be worth it. Liz Westwood from UK on May 16, 2021: I am fine, thanks. I hope all is well with  you and your family. In my experience many soup recipes require quite a lot of preparation. But, like you say, the effort is worth it for the result. Brian (author) from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia on May 16, 2021: Hi, Liz! How are you? Hope that you are keeping well. Well, thank you for the kind words as always. This dish is certainly tasty although it looks a bit intimidating I'd say. It may seem a bit tedious to prepare, but, the work is worthwhile when you get to enjoy the soup after it's done. Brian (author) from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia on May 16, 2021: Hi, Brenda! Reading your comment tickled my funny bones and reminded me of a friend of mine. He too is just like you and does not like to be presented the fish in it's 'original' state, regardless of how delicious the dish may be. Well, that is why he only eats fish and chips, as he says it does not remind him of the 'animal'. Brian (author) from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia on May 16, 2021: Thank you, Louise! This here is my go to dish and comfort food when I am missing my home. Sorry that you don't fancy the head. Well, there is not much meat on the head except for the cheeks and maybe some on the base of the neck, so you will not miss out anything by tossing it out. Liz Westwood from UK on May 15, 2021: This sounds like a tasty dish. Your step by step directions are very helpful. BRENDA ARLEDGE from Washington Court House on May 15, 2021: Oh my...the ingredients sound great but there is no way I'm eating anything that still looks like a fish. Sorry, even the pictures make me squirm. We de-skin fish and cut up into little bites. I don't want to see the eyes. Otherwise this recipe sounds good. Louise Powles from Norfolk, England on May 15, 2021: This sounds lovely, I'd love to try this soup.  I think I'd have to throw the head away though lol."
700,How to Make the Easiest Lasagna,food," My name is Ark. I am an Indian freelance writer. I write health and food from a young age. I have some stories, poems that I will publish in HOW TO MAKE LASAGNA Lasagna is one of those classic dishes that just screams home, with rich flavors and intoxicating smells that hit you as soon as you walk through the door. This Italian favorite may seem complicated to make, but it is actually quite easy once you know what you are doing. There is no need you should not try to make this recipe yourself at home… It should come out perfect the very first time, so long as you follow these directions to the letter. So try this recipe today, and all the members of your household will be begging you to make it again and again. 1. Take a big pot of water to boil on the flame. This should be the type of pot you would make soup or chili in. Place the lid on the pot and leave it to boil. Once the water begins to boil, remove the lid and place about a teaspoon of salt in the water, to flavor the water and thus the noodles. Place twelve dry lasagna noodles into the water, pressing them down as they soften so they are fully submerged, but do not break them. Let boil for around eight minutes. The noodles do not have to be all the way done, as they will cook more in the oven. Drain the noodles in a strainer and set them aside. 2. Now it is time to make the sauce. Warm a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a pan. Finely dice one medium onion and toss it in the oil until the onion is translucent. Cubes two cloves of garlic and add to the onion. Then, pour three small cans of tomato purée over the onion mixture, stirring well. Add a bay leaf to the sauce and let it simmer until you are ready to assemble the lasagna. Craving Home Cooked 3. In a mixing bowl combine fifteen ounces of ricotta cheese, eight ounces of Parmesan, and one large egg. Stir until combined well, then add a handful of freshly chopped flat-leaf parsley. If dried parsley is all you have you can add that as well. Also, season with black pepper sand alt to enjoy the taste. 4. If you want to make this a meat lasagna, brown one pound of ground beef or sausage in a pan. Drain out any fat or grease then add the meat to the sauce mixture you have already made. 5. Now it is time for the fun part…assembling the lasagne. Pre heat an oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, and grease a lasagna pan with cooking spray. At the bottom of the pan, lay three lasagna noodles side by side, so the noodles are touching and there is no room around the edges. Then, pour a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture, followed by a layer of the sauce mix. Top the sauce with a layer of grated mozzarella cheese, and then a layer of three more noodles. Repeat this process until you are out of noodles, ricotta and sauce. Once the lasagna is finished cover it with one last layer of mozzarella cheese. 6. Place the lasagna in the oven and let it bake for about 45 minutes, or until all of the cheese is bubbling and golden brown. If the cheese is becoming too dark, you can cover it with a layer of tin foil to protect it. Once the lasagna is done, remove it from the oven. And here is an important tip– let it cool off for ten minutes before you cut into it. If you slice it too early, all of the layers will slide apart on the plate. If you give it a moment, you will have perfect, in tact slices. 7. Now cut three columns into the lasagna, and four rows going the other way, so you have twelve perfect slices. Gently lift each piece out of the tray with a spatula and serve. You can serve this with a green salad and some garlic bread for a complete meal. Enjoy! Lasagna makes a great make ahead meal. Put together a tray of this on the weekend or in your spare time, freeze it, then just heat it up one evening when you need it. © 2021 Ark"
701,Avocado Desserts Recipes,food," Avocados are the favorite fruit of millennials, including myself, for good reason. Is avocado a fruit or a vegetable? Is it a vegetable or a fruit? When we hear this question, we are frequently puzzled, and it is simple to believe that something isn't precisely what it appears to be. Avocado is commonly used in salads and savory dishes. Avocado is a fruit, not a vegetable. You can definitely connect to the debate over whether avocado is a fruit or a vegetable if you're used to eating fruit with firm seeds. Despite the fact that both have hard seeds, some people prefer soft fruits while others prefer firm ones. Avocados come in a variety of flavors, from soft to hard, depending on where you live. Above all, some people are unable to ingest avocados. Avocado isn't a vegetable; it's a fruit. It's also worth noting that an avocado and an acorn squash are not the same thing. Because the acorn is not a fruit, it is not classified as a vegetable. Avocados, on the other hand, are classified as fruits because they are primarily green. Avocado is a fruit, so it can be eaten like any other fruit. It's crucial to remember that avocado should never be eaten raw. It is high in vitamin C, which is essential for the development of the brain and nerve system and is important for healthy bones and teeth. Avocado is a healthier option when cooked or in the form of juice. Avocado also contains a lot of vitamins A and C. Both of these nutrients help in the prevention of a variety of diseases. Consume a variety of fruits and vegetables on a regular basis to ensure that your body receives all of the nutrients it needs. However, some of us have a difficult time eating more veggies and fruits than we eat in our daily diets. Certain nutrients may become deficient as a result. Deficiencies occur when the body is unable to absorb enough vitamins and minerals. Weight loss, anemia, blurry vision, and immune system issues are just a few of the inadequacies. Are you prepared to work with avocados? From chilly creamy, sweets to warm breakfast toasts, to a healthy pasta dinner for evening, here are some avocado recipes to try: 2 teaspoons unflavored gelatin 1 cup coconut cream 2 cups coconut milk ¼  teaspoon fine sea salt 3 tablespoons honey, plus more to drizzle avocado, (use the flesh), plus extra to serve 1 to 2 pinches green cardamom toasted coconut, to serve     4 pieces avocado 1 cup heavy cream 1 can condensed milk, 300-ml can ¾  cup milk 1/4 cup almonds, chopped     ½  tablespoon balsamic vinegar 1 ½  tablespoons olive oil Pepper & Salt 1 Avocado slice & diced canned diced tomatoes or fresh tomatoes (Optional)  1  sweet corn, grilled, remove kernels 2 tablespoons butter, unsalted 1 tablespoon virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon cajun seasoning salt, to taste ground black pepper, to taste 2 sliced bread, whole grain, toasted 1 avocado, flesh only, sliced thinly ½ lime, juice only ¼ cup feta cheese, crumbled 2 tablespoons cilantro, finely chopped smoked paprika lime wedges, to serve   2 servings pasta of choice 1 ripe avocado ½ garlic gloves ½ cup fresh basil 1 tbsp lemon juice 1 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp any plant-based milk Salt & pepper to taste Pinch of cayenne   Medium avocado, sliced 1/2 cup evaporated milk 1/2 cup crushed ice 2 tablespoons sugar, or more to taste   Avocados are the favorite fruit of millennials, including myself, for good reason. They boost almost every meal, including breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Lovely Tolentino (author) from Philippines on June 16, 2021: Hi ken! I love Avocados too and Yes you should try, Thank you for this wonderful comment! Ken Burgess from Florida on June 16, 2021: A lot of great ideas here, I will get around to trying a couple of them. I love Avocadoes, I need to get around to planting a couple of trees in the yard. Good article, keep them coming."

707,Mockmill 100,food," Lemonkerdz I love bread making and especially during these stressful times it’s one of those things to do that is therapeutic and a joy to produce something that makes the house smell amazing and then eat your hard work. As I searched around on YouTube watching bread videos ( I know sad but compelling) where I saw a machine that caught my attention, the Mockmill 100. Now I love kitchen gadgets but it did make me wonder, when you can buy flour so cheap why would you even want to spend about $180 on a machine to grind your own flour apart from the fun of it, so I started investigating. Nutritional value of home milling I was shocked to find out that freshly ground grains can lose 45-90% of its nutrients to oxidation within 24 hrs to 3 days from being milled. This is due to the oils inside the grain going rancid. Freshly milled grain is full of vitamin E but when the oils go bad that nice bread flour kept at room temp will contain toxins that are carcinogenic. So freshly ground flour is amazingly good and tasty. Flour at room temp over days is not good at all for your body. So how come flour sold at the store is months old and possibly stored in your cupboard at home for months but yet is still good to bake with? Have you read ingredients? To stop flour that is stored for weeks to months at the store from going bad, parts of the grain that contain oils, which are the vitamin cabinets of the grain are removed leaving you with white dust that’s got almost nothing left to give you, that’s why the ingredients say wheat and then words like “fortified” or “added vitamins” to put something back into the flour. Imagine if you found out they did the same process with your fruit or vegetables, Pick them, take the goodness out and then pump them up with vitamins! You wouldn’t accept it, you would cringe at the thought and never buy it. So why compromise now with your flour. Make sure you get the best for yourself and the family. Lemonkerdz Power: 360w Voltage: 230v (1,100 rpm) American version 110v (1,300rpm) Dimensions: 380x220x190 mm / 15x8.7x7.5 inch Milling mechanism: Corundum ceramic milling stones Milling efficiency: approx 100g per min Casing: Arboblend made from renewable raw materials Hopper capacity: 1,100g / 2lbs 7oz Weight: 6.6kg / 8 kg Cable length: 150cm Mockmill guarantee: 6 years The settings lever will go well beyond 1-10. I had mine set to 30 for cracking grains for home brewing. Lemonkerdz Will it grind grains? Err yes. Dont grind oily seeds like linseed as it will clog up the grinding stones. If you mistakenly ground something oily just set the machine to a course grind and run though a cup of rice with the machine running. Pass the rice through a few times until the stones are clean. Can I mill grains for home brewing? Yes. I do home brewing and set the grind to around #30 ran a few grains through to get the coarse grind I wanted like cracked grain. You may need to adjust the setting for each different kind of grain milled. Do a test batch. Run 1/2 a handful of grains through if you think the setting is right and adjust accordingl. Can it mill spices? Yes. From very fine powder to a coarse cracked pepper corn. For spices like star anise they will need to be broken up smaller to pass through the feed holes in the grain hopper feeder. After milling spices pass through the mill about a handful of rice and repeat until you are sure it’s clean. Can I pass ground flour through for a second milling for a finer texture?  Yes. Don’t pour into the hopper a whole kilo of milled flour for a second milling as it may block up the hopper feeder. I found it to be trouble free milling spooning in a little at a time but constant. Does it create a lot of dust? No. Just be sure to have a jar or bowl that sits close under the mills spout to eliminate fine dust escaping during milling. is it difficult to clean the Mockmill 100? No. After use just give it a light tap with the palm of your hand on the side of the mill to loosen any flour sitting in the spout and just put it away. No cleaning necessary. It is recommended if you are not going to use the machine for an extended period of time I.e away on vacation, you may want to remove any flour in the mill. Just remove the top and release the stones and clean brushing lightly with a clean paint brush. Do not wash with water. The outer casing can be wiped down with a damp cloth."
708,Olives Can Be Frozen - Just What I Thawed,food," I was given a gallon jar of olives the other day, and now, I'm deciding methods of keeping them.

They froze easily. Solid. Then, we gently thawed them and took a bite. My hubby didn't like the texture. Hmmm. I didn't notice any difference in texture. So. I will not freeze any more.

709,How to Make Healthy Salad Recipes,food," A daily salad may appear to be a simple thing, but it can be a life-changing lifestyle adjustment. Eating a salad every day can improve your life in a variety of ways. To begin with, a salad is full of vegetables such as carrots, beets, and other root vegetables, and no matter which ones you choose, you'll find that this is an excellent method to increase your consumption of fruits and vegetables. The majority of people do not eat enough fruits and vegetables each day, and a salad can contain as many as 5-10 veggies, all of which can contribute to better health.  A salad, as part of your improved general health, can also help reduce your risk of cancer. Because many great vegetables contain antioxidants, eating a salad every day can significantly minimize your risk of contracting this life-threatening condition.  Another amazing benefit of eating a salad every day is weight loss. Did you know that those who eat a salad are less hungry all the time? For the most part this is most likely due to the high fiber nature of a salad. Higher fiber foods not only serve to enhance the function of your digestive tract, which can help you lose weight, but they can also boost your metabolism and provide a natural colon cleanse. Because most people don't get enough fiber in their diets, a salad a day might be quite beneficial to your elimination process.  Salads are naturally low in calories, allowing you to stuff your plate with a variety of healthy foods and still not overeat. Of course, it's best to stick to a low-calorie dressing and use it moderately. While fat-free dressings may appear to be a better option, they actually neutralize some of the salad's health benefits. For best health benefits, use a dressing that contains at least some fat.  If you're thinking about making some healthy lifestyle changes but aren't sure where to start, try eating a salad every day for lunch. You will discover that doing so allows you to become healthier while also providing you with a variety of options for a balanced diet and the ability to eat out at any restaurant. A salad a day may well be more effective than an apple in keeping the doctor away.  Ingredients: 1 cup mayonnaise, to taste honey and lemon juice, ½  celery chopped, ½ cup walnuts toast & chopped, ½ grapes seedless, chopped, ¼ cup raisins, 1 piece apple cored and diced, 1 head lollo rosso lettuce, washed and trim.

Directions: In a large salad bowl, carefully combine all of the above ingredients: cucumber, onion, bell peppers, lemon juice, olive oil, parsley, salt, and pepper. Cover and store in the refrigerator. This healthy salad recipe is best served chilled.

711,"When Life Gives You Lemons, Reap Their Health Benefits",food," Fredda Branyon has dedicated her life to the advancement of complementary medicine. Did you know that one 58-gram lemon gives you more than 30 milligrams of vitamin C? Vitamin C is essential for good overall health, and a deficiency can cause serious health issues, including a condition called scurvy. Moreover, lemons are a rich source of good-for-you soluble fiber and plant compounds. That said, here are five evidence-based benefits of including lemons in your diet.  Health Benefits of Lemons, According to Science  You should consider adding lemon to your salad dressings, drinks, marinades, baked goods, and sauces because:  1. Lemons Make the Heart Stronger  Multiple sources (1, 2, 3) show that eating fruits and vegetables containing vitamin C minimizes your risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.  Aside from vitamin C, the fiber and plant compounds in fruits and vegetables, especially lemons, could also help reduce your risk of developing heart disease. For example, one study concluded that consuming 24 grams of citrus fiber natural extracts every day for a month can reduce blood cholesterol levels. Certain plant compounds in lemons, specifically diosmin and hesperidin, may also help manage high cholesterol levels, according to medical studies published in 2003, 2004, and 2013.  2. May Help Prevent Cancer  A well-balanced diet consisting of fruits and vegetables may prevent some cancers, particularly gastrointestinal cancers.  According to multiple studies, including a 2015 research published in the National Library of Medicine, some plant compounds in citrus fruits, including limonene and naringenin, may have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties.  In addition, a 2012 study, which used pulp from mandarins containing the plant compounds hesperidin and beta-cryptoxanthin (also found in lemons), discovered that the compounds blocked cancerous tumors from developing in the tongues, lungs, and colons of mice.  Though the results of these studies are promising, currently, no evidence suggests that lemons can stop cancer from developing, especially if malignant tumors run in your family or if you have a history of prolonged exposure to carcinogens.  3. Improve Gut Health  The primary fiber found in lemons is pectin, which is a soluble fiber associated with a myriad of health benefits. For example, soluble fiber plays a significant role in improving overall gut health and slowing the digestion of starches and sugars. As a result, blood sugar levels go down.  4. Stop Kidney Stones in Their Tracks  Kidney stones are small, hard deposits that form inside the kidneys when waste products begin to crystallize and accumulate. Each year in the United States, more than half a million people are rushed to the emergency room due to kidney stone problems.  Drinking one and a half cups (125 ml or 4 ounces) of lemon juice daily may provide enough citric acid to prevent kidney stone formation, especially in those who already had them. The citric acid in lemon juice may inhibit kidney stones by increasing both urine pH and urine volume, therefore creating a practically inhospitable environment for kidney stones to form.  5. Protects Against Anemia  Anemia, a condition describing a lack of healthy red blood cells, occurs when you have an iron deficiency. Left untreated, anemia can cause severe fatigue and pregnancy complications.  Though lemons contain trace amounts of iron, they can help prevent anemia by improving your body's ability to absorb iron from plant foods. Your digestive system absorbs iron from chicken, red meat, and fish (called heme iron) easily, unlike iron from fruits and veggies (non-heme iron). You can improve your absorption of the latter by consuming vitamin C and citric acid, which are both found in lemons. Thelma Alberts from Germany on May 28, 2021: I love using lemon in my food and my drinks. Thank you for sharing the information."

714,What Is Structured Water and How to Prepare it? Health Benefits,food," Rajan loves cooking dishes from his native Indian cuisine. He enjoys sharing his favourite recipes with his online readers. Earthen pot with Structured water RAJAN JOLLY Structured water, also called magnetised or hexagonal water is water whose structure has been altered to form a hexagonal cluster. In simple terms, this is water as pure, as unpolluted, or as uncontaminated as water found in natural spring water. Water can be restructured in various ways. Some of these are: Today, drinking water comes in contact with plastic/pvc ever so often since: Because of this plastic nanoparticles get into the water and when such water is consumed they get deposited in the digestive organs. This water is hydrophobic thus reducing the absorption of vital nutrients from food. This creates a deficiency of micronutrients like minerals and consequently, many health issues crop up if such water is consumed for an extended time. Copper plate removes these plastic nanoparticles and other impurities from the water and when structured water is consumed these get flushed out of the body. Structured water has several healing properties and should be used for all cooking and drinking purposes. Making structured water at home is a very simple process with just a few commonly available things being required for its preparation. A video showing this process is also shared in this article. The water structuring is achieved by using a copper plate/sheet. Although a copper pot can be used instead of the copper plate there are 2 reasons why it is not advised: 1. The copper pot has to be cleaned daily. This becomes a cumbersome process as copper gets oxidised very fast. Using a copper sheet makes this very easy and quick. 2. More importantly, copper has to be in contact with water for only about 6-8 hours for the water to get structured. Using a copper pot in which this water is stored for 24 hours may result in copper toxicity. Silver also structures water but the water quality has been found to be better by using copper. You can use a steel pot if you do not have an earthen pot. Do try it and share your experience. 8 hours 15 min 8 hours 15 min several servings The videos below are references for this article.

719,"8 Healthy and Easy Low-Carb, High-Protein Snack Ideas",food," Patti is a Certified Dietician who specializes in fitness and nutrition. She enjoys helping people reach their healthy lifestyle goals. Carbohydrates are complicated. They’re necessary for cell function, but eating too much of them can cause your body to feel bloated and tired. You shouldn't cut carbs completely unless advised by a physician; however, eating low-carb snacks can boost your energy level and ensure you get the other essential macronutrients you need like protein and fat, which help build muscle and promote satiety. Here's a list of eight healthy and easy low-carb, high-protein snack ideas that are delicious! Nuts and seeds are rich in protein and fiber. Convenient and tasty, nuts and seeds make an easy snack that contributes to a healthy lifestyle. In addition to their taste, tree nuts and peanuts contain no cholesterol and are rich in important nutrients including protein, fiber and unsaturated fatty acids. They also contain relevant micronutrients such as folic acid, niacin and vitamins E and B6 and minerals such as magnesium, copper, zinc, selenium, phosphorus and potassium. Trail mix is an ideal on-the-go snack. However, most store-bought trail mixes contain high-carb ingredients and are usually loaded with sugar and industrial oils. Here is a healthier low-carb version you can make yourself. Combine your favorite nuts, seeds, chocolate, and coconut in a plastic baggie and shake vigorously until everything is well coated with the cinnamon. Pecans 4 3 Walnuts 4 4 Peanuts 6 7 Almonds 6 6 Pine Nuts 4 4 Sunflower Seeds 7 6 Pumpkin Seeds 4 9 Dark Chocolate (70-85%) 13 2 Unsweetened Coconut Flakes 8 2 Cinnamon (1 tsp) 2 0.1 Ham and pickle roll-ups can be eaten as an appetizer or a snack. Ready in five minutes, ham and pickle roll-ups are super addicting! They're great as an appetizer and even better as a snack. Spread cream cheese onto ham slice and place pickle spear on top. Gently roll. Cut the roll crosswise into 1/2"" to 1"" pieces. This is a very versatile snack and can be customized to your liking. Here are some recipe variations to change things up a little: The variations are endless! Cream Cheese (1 tbsp) 1 1 Dill Pickle (1 spear) 1 0.2 Cucumber (1 stick) 0.4 0.1 Ham Slice (1 oz) 0.3 6 Chives (1 oz) 1 1 Hard-boiled eggs are so simple and easy but yet extremely low in carbs and full of brain-healthy nutrients such as vitamin B12 and choline. One large egg is packed full of protein. Boil a batch of eggs at the beginning of the week, and you're all set for the rest of the week. 1 Hard-Boiled Egg 1 13 Fruit and yogurt are a great combination any time of the day. Fruit and yogurt parfaits are an excellent choice for a low-carb breakfast, but they also make for a healthy snack. Berries come in a variety of colors and can have a sweet or sour taste. They are highly nutritious and high in fiber, vitamin C and antioxidants. For a quick and delicious, low-carb snack, layer yogurt, fruit and granola, then repeat 1 or 2 more times. You can use your favorite low-fat yogurt or cream, any low-carb fruit mixture or nuts instead of granola. Strawberries 2 0.2 Blueberries 4 0.2 Raspberries 3 0.3 Cranberries 3 0.1 Blackberries 3 0.4 Greek Yogurt (6 oz) 7 17 Heavy Whipping Cream 0 0 Granola 15 4 Nuts *See Section 1 *See Section 1 If you're trying to manage a sugar craving, it's sometimes better to eat naturally sweet fruits. However, some fruits come with more carbs, so be careful. Dark chocolate satisfies the sweet tooth. When you’re craving something sweet, dark chocolate is the perfect low-carb treat to satisfy that sweet tooth. Just remember moderation is key. Quality dark chocolate is rich in fiber, iron, magnesium, copper, manganese and a few other minerals. For a quick little treat, try spreading 1 tablespoon of cashew butter (or any other low-carb spread) onto 1 ounce of dark chocolate. Just remember the darker the chocolate, the fewer the carbs. Dark Chocolate (70-85%) 13 2 Cashew Butter 9 3 Peanut Butter 7 6 Hazelnuts 5 4 Almond butter 5 4 Cinnamon roasted pumpkin seeds taste like autumn. Pumpkin seeds are rich in zinc, an essential mineral needed for optimal immune health and metabolism. Cinnamon Toasted Pumpkin Seeds are very simple to make with very few ingredients. Combine ½ cup of pumpkin seeds with ½ teaspoon of cinnamon and 2 teaspoons of olive oil. Spread the seeds evenly onto a baking sheet and bake in a 300-degree oven for 45 minutes or until the seeds are golden brown. Pumpkin Seeds (1 oz) 4 9 Cinnamon (1 tsp) 2 0.1 Olive Oil 0 0 Eat the rainbow with freshly cut vegetables. Plain vegetables are one of the healthiest snacks a person can eat. Simply wash and slice a variety of fresh veggies into sticks and enjoy. Some low-carb veggies include: Pairing these veggies with a dip low in carbs gives you a special treat with added flavor. You can always buy dips at the store, but I recommend making your own homemade dip because then you know exactly what goes in it with no preservatives added. Here are some quick dip recipes you can whip up at home. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and mix well. Place avocados in a medium bowl and slightly mash with a fork or potato masher leaving some large chunks. Add remaining ingredients and mix well to combine. Using a metal strainer or coffee filter, strain the yogurt for a few hours to remove as much liquid as possible and set aside. Mince cucumber slices in a food processor, drain the liquid in a metal strainer and sprinkle with a little salt to help release the liquid. Use the back of a spoon to help squeeze out any excess liquid. Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl and mix well. Cottage cheese is a calcium-rich food. Cottage cheese is low in carbohydrates and rich in bone-building minerals such as calcium and phosphorus. Many people add fruit for extra flavor, but you can also add avocado slices, cherry tomatoes, chopped green onions or hot sauce for a more savory dish.

723,Streusel Topping for Banana Bread for Example,food," The streusel topping is mixed together. I used a small metal bowl to mix the ingredients together. I didn't really measure, but there was an equal amount of sugar and flour and I liberally sprinkled cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger across the mix before I added half a stick of melted butter. The combination is mixed with a fork, and mine was crumbly. My banana bread was freshly poured into a bread pan and I dumped the streusel mixture over the raw bread and spread it to the edges of the pan. The butter will melt into the bread, and the remaining flour, sugar and seasonings will fry together, resulting in a crispy, spicy coating. The bread was baked a good hour, maybe an hour and 15 minutes. The topping rides up with the bread baking. The bread that I created was banana bread with rhubarb. It's a wet bread, almost like a bread pudding by the time it is done baking. Generally, banana bread is stiff enough to pick up with your fingers, but with the addition of a bunch of rhubarb, it is too sloppy to do anything but eat with a fork."

726,"7 Ways to Prepare a Healthy, Mouth-Watering, Veggie Zucchini Dish",food," Evangeline Pulgo is a culinary enthusiast and has studied various ways of cooking healthy foods and baking cakes and pastries. zucchini pexels.com Just like many other types of squash, Zucchini is native to Central America. However, it’s thanks to the Italians who popularized the veggie that we’ve come to know and love today. They coined the name zucchini, which means ‘little squash’ for the new food that was brought to Italy by New World explorers and integrated into all kinds of dishes fast. Zucchini dishes spread to cuisines all over the world. They’re easy to cook, amazingly versatile, and is nutrition-packed. A medium-sized zucchini only has 25 calories and contains more potassium than a banana. A zucchini furthermore also is a great source of vitamin A, folates, and manganese. How do you enjoy your zucchini dish? There are several ways. The first thing to do however is to choose zucchini that’s about six to eight inches long and firm to the touch. It has a dried-out stem and feels heavy. It could also be yellow or green with a glossy texture. Make sure to rinse the vegetable under cold, running water before using it in your recipe. You can enjoy it raw or cook in an air-fryer, microwave, oven, or on a grill or stove. Check out these five tips.  1. Zucchini could be simply steamed in the microwave. Slice into bite-size pieces and put in a microwave-safe bowl. Use a lid to cover the bowl, but leave one corner slightly open. Cook for four to six minutes until soft. If it’s not yet tender, cook for one more minute and repeat until you get the desired texture. 2. For a big amount of zucchini, using an oven is an efficient way to cook.After cutting the veggie in half, remove the seeds. Drizzle the zucchini with olive oil and with salt and paper, season to taste. Roast cut-side down around 30 to 60 minutes at 400 degrees until a fork could be easily inserted. Remove from the oven and let cool. 3. Cook in an air fryer for a crunchy texture. Commonly, an air fryer is used to make ‘zucchini chips.’ Cut thinly, then remove excess moisture by patting dry with a paper towel. Use olive oil, salt, and pepper, and then put the slices in the air fryer’s basket. For 8 minutes, cook at 350 degrees. However, the cooking time may differ, depending on the thickness of the slices. Zucchini chips will have a slightly brown appearance with a crisp texture. 4. Grilling typically is associated with fish and meat. Vegetables, however, could also be grilled. To grill zucchini, slice it into ½ inch-thick pieces. On a bowl, sprinkle the pieces with seasoning, adding a small amount of olive oil. You could opt to put the veggie on a grill pan or wrap it in aluminum foil. For grill marks, cut the veggie lengthwise and place it over the grates. Grill for about 3 to 4 minutes per side over medium heat. 5. Sautéing over a stovetop will boost the zucchini’s flavor. Slice it into quarters or circles to make bite-size pieces. To make zucchini noodles, or zoodles, use a vegetable peeler or knife to slice into thin strips. In a pan, mix one to two teaspoons of olive oil then cook over medium heat. It should be lightly brown and tender. Use salt and pepper to taste. 6. If you’re in the mood to broil, the smaller, more tender version of zucchini, the baby zucchini, is the best pick. Flash the vegetables under the broiler for a minute or two and enjoy delicious mellow zucchini bites. This is an easy and quick way to cook zucchini as a side dish served together with a pan-seared fish, roasted chicken, or pork tenderloin. 7. Zucchini is also delicious when baked, breaded, or crisped up. Bake this veggie with layers of marinara sauce together with two kinds of cheese such as mozzarella and cheddar cheese. Spread the sauce and cheese liberally on the middle portion of the zucchini but exclude the edges so they’re crunchy when they’re cooked.  Eating enough fruits and vegetables is important. Thus, if you include zucchini in your diet, you are keeping your body well-hydrated, healthy, and toxin-free. Zucchini is, without doubt, one of the most healthy and beneficial food choices that could be enjoyed in different ways and easy to consume.

728,Nutritious Herbal Chicken Soup with Ginseng and Chicken Essence,food," Brian loves food and enjoys exploring various cuisines. He is a keen experimenter in the kitchen and finds cooking therapeutic. A nutritious tonic AthenaChanEmes Being adventurous has brought me out from my motherland, and I ended up in a country known for its melting pot of culture, which has so much good food. Growing up in Nigeria, I had been exposed to a myriad of herbs as a result of having generous amounts of it in our various delicacies. Upon marrying my wife who is of Chinese ethnicity, we both embarked on a journey of gastronomical adventure, delighting each other with our vastly different styles of cooking and totally different dietary preference. One very impressionable moment was when my wife introduced this herb - ginseng, which she cheekily called the man-root. Well, I later found out that ginseng was a root with a peculiar appearance that highly resembles a person. Its’ root were forked-shaped and looks like the legs of a man, hence, the name. I was initially hesitant to try it out, but, gave in after much persuasion from my wife. The winning argument was that ginseng has medicinal value and integrating it into our diet can help to greatly improve our health, when consumed in the right amount. I did some research on the herb and found out that ginseng actually have quite a number of science-backed health benefits. An article in Healthline stated that ginseng is actually a potent antioxidant that can help reduce inflammation and improve the capacity of body cells. In addition, taking ginseng in small amounts can also help improve brain function. Amongst the positive effects recognized in subjects that were examined, was that their brain functions ranging from behavior, memory, and mood vastly improved. On top of that, ingestion of ginseng actually boosts the subject’s mental performance and reduced their fatigue as well. With all these newfound information, I decided to give this ginseng root a try. The most common way to get the best benefit of ginseng is to consume it on its own, such as slicing it thinly and chewing on it. Another way would be to add it into a cup of hot water and let it steep for awhile before drinking it. Some people even consume the whole root by grounding it into powder form and adding it into cooked food, preferably steamed dishes. Well, my wife and mother-in-law have their own personal favorite recipe using ginseng and they have agreed for me to share it here. Do let me know if you like it in the comments below! COOKING TIPS 1.	Consuming chicken essence on its own is good enough, but adding it into the soup enhances the flavor more. 2.	Using a slow cooker to slow-boil the soup allows the ginseng and chicken essence to absorb into the chicken meat, boosting its’ flavor and texture. 10 min 4 hours 4 hours 10 min 1 - 3 Clockwise from top - Wolfberries, red dates, and sliced ginseng AthenaChanEmes Fomec Essence of Chicken with American Ginseng and Cordyceps. A personal favorite of mine although there are better brands such as Brand's Essence of Chicken AthenaChanEmes Put in the chicken, red dates, ginseng, wolfberries, and water into the slow cooker pot or ceramic pot AthenaChanEmes Slow cook the soup for 4 hours in a slow cooker. If you are cooking using a ceramic pot on normal stove, you can let it cook a little longer to absorb the chicken essence better AthenaChanEmes Ready to dig in! AthenaChanEmes Serving Suggestions You may serve the soup with rice as a side dish. Otherwise, you may also blanch noodles and add into the soup to make it into a herbal noodle dish. © 2021 Brian Brian (author) from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia on May 22, 2021: Yes, Louise!

729,How to Make Moist and Soft Sago Idli (Sabudana Idli),food," I like to cook and eat natural, healthy, and tasty foods, and I enjoy sharing recipes from my native Indian cuisine. Sago Idli (Sabudana idli) served with coconut chutney Sago idli (Sabudana idli) is a brilliant variation of the regular South Indian idli, but it has a unique taste. Unlike South Indian idli, Sago idli doesn't include white lentils in the batter. Sago idli batter is made of sago, rice semolina, and curd. This batter is then added with grated veggies, ginger, and tempering. South Indian idli is made with rice semolina and white lentil batter. However, both types need fermentation of the batter. Sago idlis are spongy and colorful. They are protein-rich. Serve them hot with coconut chutney or pickle. Though they are heavy, they are easily digestible. Enjoy these scrumptious idlis for breakfast! 15 min 20 min 35 min Serves 3 or 4 people Step one: Soak the rice semolina in lukewarm water for 10 minutes. Discard the water. Add fresh water. Squeeze the water out and add the semolina to a mixing bowl. Add the sago. Add thick curd and salt While adding water little by little, prepare a dropping consistency (idli batter consistency) batter. Cover it and rest for 8 hours or overnight. Step two: During resting, the batter ferments and increases in volume. Check for consistency. Add water and mix well to get the dropping consistency. Add grated carrots and grated ginger. Also, add the tempering as per instructions. Mix well. Step three: Add fruit salt or baking soda. Pour a tablespoon of water over it. When bubbles form on it, mix the batter gently. Now, the batter is ready for making idlis. Step four: Grease the hollow containers of the idli maker with oil or ghee. Keep the steamer or cooker ready for making idlis. Place a cashew nut on each of the hollow containers. Add the batter until the brim. Place the stand inside the cooker. Cover it with the lid. Don't place the cooker weight. Steam-cook it for 20 minutes. Turn off the heat. Open the cooker lid after 3 minutes. Take the idli stand out. Sprinkle some water over the hot idlis. This will make the idlis moist and super soft. Step five: When they are not so hot, remove the idlis from the idli maker. Serve hot idlis for breakfast with coconut chutney or any other chutney or sambar. Enjoy the taste. They make a delightful breakfast! ShailaSheshadri (author) from Bengaluru on May 22, 2021: I am pleased to know that you are going to try this recipe. Thanks for reading my article.

730,Equilibrium -Chocolate Showpiece With Gateaux,food," Chef Unnati  Supekar
Chef Instructor
Culinary Academy Of India There’s more to a plate of food than just the ingredients and the taste. Especially at the higher levels of cooking. An important part of a tasty dish is how it looks - and this is where food styling comes in. Food styling and presentation refers to how the different components of the dish are modified, processed, arranged, or decorated, all done to enhance its aesthetic and visual appeal to make the dish look more appetizing. There are many ways plating can be done with basic geometrical shapes or a more abstract interpretation of its components. My theme with this dish is ‘Equilibrium’, and as the name suggests, it’s all about balance. Equilibrium is a state when opposite forces act on each other. When it comes to food plating, this term goes hand-in-hand with symmetry and shape.  The word symmetry has many meanings and symmetry is defined as being exactly similar to the eye of an observer. There’s usually a plane of symmetry, think of it as an axis, around which symmetry can be observed. In the real world, kaleidoscopes come close to bringing this concept to life. As a naturally occurring theme, symmetry is often associated with balance and beauty. There’s an art to being exact. Much like a harmonious flock of birds flying behind a leader, symmetry is extremely captivating. When we talk about food plating, symmetry plays an extremely important role as it draws the eyes to the plane of symmetry and allows the customers to immerse themselves in the visual euphony of the dish. the dish. While plating a symmetrical dish it’s important to think of halves and mirrors. A mirror projects an exact reflection, similarly, the first half of the dish must look the exact same as the second. There can be no change in the appearance of either half. This is a classical style of plating that allows for an interesting interplay between colors, shapes, textures, and ingredients. It is also a commonly seen technique with several famous plates and platters following this design language. For my dish, I have used a prop, a gateau, and a base; all three of which have some classical elements and I worked around this to create a unique visual blend to make it look like a single shape. The gateau is a beautiful flavor balanced recipe made up of 5 different layers topped on one another and molded into different shapes. When it came to the assembly and presentation, it was pertinent to show a balance of forces, and the final showcase just does that.

736,Enduri Pitha ( Turmeric Leaf Wrapped Dumpling ),food," In my blogs you will find melange of dishes discovered of my own and some (foods and flavors) are influenced of our ancestors. Delightsum The aroma of the steamed dumpling is known as endure pitha or turmeric wrapped dumplings, prepared on the day of Prathama Ashtami. The turmeric itself a sattvic food intensifies when heated and impact in the dish to sooth our thinking and calm thoughts, could be the reason of preparing the holy dish by our eldest. Though the name it self described it is a pitha or we can say it’s a steamed dumpling. Feeling great how our ancestors are very aware about our health and prepared a dish which has no oil and filled with the goodness of turmeric and coconut could be one of the hot list in vegetarian or vegan diet too. It contains the batter of idli or mixture of rice and black gram(urad dal). For stuffing we need coconut and jaggery, along with the natural fragrances. Though the dumpling is little similar to Potli or steamed rice dumpling, but in Odisha instead of rice, ritually follow the idli batter which is a combination of both rice and black gram. Turmeric leaves are extensively used in India not only in cooking but also has many medicinal and cultural use  since ancient time in India. The black gram which cause gastronomical impact in our body can balance using of steamed turmeric leaf. Though the leaf itself a medicinal use of digestion and abdominal discomfort. In this method, you need to peel off the black thick peel of the coconut using a knife. Cut them into small pieces. Use a small jar to pulse 3 to 4 times or blend it few seconds. Method 2 (coconut scrapper) Using a coconut scrapper which has zigzag edges, you just need to keep the halved coconut on the zigzag edge and scrap until the fleshes come out and only the coconut hard shell will be left, which you can discard. Method 3 (using traditional coconut scrapper or ‘paniki’) Traditional scrapper or we call it as ‘paniki ‘ in odia which is traditionally designed only for scrapping coconut. 8 hours 15 min 8 hours 15 min 06 Or Preparing Stuffing Steaming the dumpling / pitha This content is accurate and true to the best of the author’s knowledge and is not meant to substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional. © 2021 Susmita Tripathy"

739,Top 5 Blursed Flavor Combinations That People Actually Eat,food," Stephen is a former dinner theater actor, humilitarian, unemployed mascot and general home cuisine meth lab technician. Bon Appétit Courtesy of Reddit From the award winning thread: What is a random combination of food you always eat but don’t tell anyone because you know it sounds nasty together? These are questionable flavor combinations carefully curated and ranked in order of how much they upset my wife. We frequently read the internet while laying on the sofa together, and she would never willingly subject herself to this kind of gross-out thread, but that's why we're married. I can read her the highlights and see which make her gag. These were her least favorite, in ascending order of most upset reaction. Peanut Butter Pickle is rough. But let's not pretend that people aren't stranger than fiction. These were real meal choices made by readers and I've ranked them in order for your pleasure or displeasure, depending on how you roll. ""Sounds abhorrent, but goes surprisingly well together. Salty and sweet."" Sweet, velvety nutella spread and the tangy brine of cured Italian meats. Not many would opt for this particular combination, but one reader swears by it. A commenter replied: ""That's how you make salmonella."" While this seems like a lunch time non-starter, it merely makes number 5 in our top 5 bizarre flavor combos list. If you're tired of putting milk over cereal, why not switch up your morning beverage lineup? Another reader replied: ""I once saw a kid pour equal parts milk and orange juice into his cereal. It didn't really mix, it looked like mottled like colby jack cheese."" Which seems bad enough, but another reader went on to explain this phenomenon in greater detail. ""Milk mixed with an acid will almost always cause curdling. The proteins in the milk denature and clump together. It is the same way you make a really simple farmer's cheese."" Science really has a way of taking something repulsive and making it very slightly less awful through understanding. They explain it thusly: ""Hot chocolate with raw eggs, the boiling water cooks the eggs."" And the image alone made me shiver, but then another user was quick to swoop in and make sense of it through the lens of an American tradition. ""This sounds like a variation on Swedish egg coffee."" And ""Basically, a raw egg (and sometimes the shell) is added to the coffee grounds before the hot water is introduced. It’s good stuff."" I'll be sure to serve some in the morning whenever I have company from Scandinavia and see if I get any strange looks. ""Different yolks for different folks I guess."" ""Im calling the f****** police."" This may be an over-reaction, or maybe not. Certainly, there are very few endorsements for this flavor profile and nobody but the original commenter is suggesting that this would be a nice snack for anyone. I honestly feel it's petty to include a straight up gross-out one like this, but that's why I'm only giving this the #2 spot. I would have left it out, but the reader seems sincere and actually eats this. You can put peanut buter on a pickle, you can dip a cucumber in mustard or put jelly on your grilled cheest, but please don't drink vienna sausage water in front of me. One claims: ""My boyfriend puts in the fridge so it kinda gelifies & eats that. It’s horrendous!"" That's simply a dealbreaker. ""That's like the old thing of using hot dog water to make ice cubes for the drinks of people you don't like."" Eau de Sausage would definitely increase my likelyhood of socially distancing myself from your dinner party. I passed up a lot of really bad flavors to list these 5. They were carefully selected, but vienna sausage water/jelly snack really takes the show. You can dip an oreo in so many things that are technically food, but should never be soaked into this patent staple of childhood delight. Hawiian Punch, Bean Dip, Onion Dip, Sour Cream, Ricotta Cheese, Cottage Cheese, Alfredo Sauce, Tomato Sauce, Cheese Whiz. So very many things. But please. Don't drink the sausage water.

743,3 Breakfasts With Peanut Butter: Delicious Recipes to Start the Day,food," Misbah is a kitchen geek. She loves to cook for her family and share her recipes. Corleto Peanut butter Photo by Corleto Peanut butter on Those of us who like to cook and enjoy little things are constantly looking for new recipes, dishes, and breakfasts that bring joy to the day while helping us take care of ourselves. The more we read, the more information we have and the more we can choose from, which is why in the battle of property-rich breakfasts, oats or peanut butter, for example, have gained ground. Unlike pistachios or pine nuts, peanuts are a cheap alternative to consume nuts, they are rich in protein and although they tend to have a high caloric intake (that is, we should not consume much if we are watching our calories) they are a great alternative for breakfasts where we need energy and motivation. Without a doubt, an unbeatable source of energy and a great option to make delicious recipes to start the day on the best foot. Consuming them in the right amount first thing in the morning will be perfect to start the day. In addition, they reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases due to their monounsaturated fats, they are a powerful antioxidant and they have a lot of fiber. When consuming butter or peanut butter, you must take something into account: the recipe with which it is made. On many occasions, we find packaging in the supermarket that looks very good, but when we observe their nutritional content we realize that they are full of sugar and they give us an extra that we are not interested in. Therefore, my advice is that you do it yourself. It is very simple, nothing cumbersome and it is the best way to make sure that the ingredients it contains are 100% reliable: the ones you have added! Do you dare? In addition to the homemade recipe, we bring you the 7 most spectacular breakfasts with peanut butter. Do not miss the details. Peanut butter is also a good source of copper, a mineral that helps maintain our bone health, immune function, and blood vessels. Some research suggests that getting enough copper in your diet may reduce your risk for osteoporosis and heart diseases. Take a good handful of natural or roasted peanuts (without salt) and crush them with a mincer or mixer for two minutes. In this first step, you need to be patient, as it will take time for them to be thoroughly crushed (in a creamy texture) and not just-chopped. Approximately a minute after grinding we will begin to see the paste, although at first, it will be very dense. Give yourself a few more seconds to get the perfect texture. Peanut Butter Photo by Irene Kredenets on In some recipes, you may find that they encourage you to add a few drops of extra virgin olive oil, but my recommendation is that you do not. Peanuts already have an oil that will give you a creamy texture and adding more to it is adding an excess of fat that you really do not need. Also, those bought in supermarkets usually have added sugar and salt, but I do not recommend that you add them at first. Only if your recipe, when you go to consume it, is necessary. Once the creamy texture is prepared, store it in a jar and put it in the fridge. This will last for weeks, but you must bear in mind that being homemade and without additives, part of the natural peanut oil will rise to the surface over the days and you will need to mix everything again when you go to consume it. Easy, simple and very natural! We already have our peanut butter now. So shall we talk to prepare some breakfasts to enjoy it? Fun facts about peanuts Peanuts are not actually nuts at all. They are legumes – like beans, peas and lentils. Th peanut plant is unusual because it flowers above the ground, but fruits below the ground. Runner peanuts are preferred for peanut butter, and are grown primarily in Georgia, Alabama, Florida and Mississippi. Africans ground peanuts into stews as early as the 1400s; Chines have crushed peanuts into creamy sauces for centuries; and Civil War soldiers dined on “peanut porridge.” The first step is to toast the bread in a toaster or pan so that it is crunchy. Meanwhile, cut the avocado/ bananas into slices. When the toast is ready, spread the peanut butter (to taste) on top and let it melt a little with the heat. Later place the avocado/ banana slices. You can also add some sesame seeds to give it a nice finish if you like. Peanut butter is a good source of Vitamin E, Niacin (B3), Manganese, Vitamin B6, Magnesium Put the oatmeal and the egg whites in the blender and beat everything well. When we have the mixture we have two options: the first is to add the peanut butter to the mixture, before making the pancakes, and the second, to add it later. If you decide to do it before, you must mix well and make the pancakes in a non-stick pan over medium heat. When you have them ready, it would only be left to put the sliced ​​banana or any seasonal fruit of your choice on top. If you prefer to add it later, you will have to make the pancakes and then garnish it with the fruits and the peanut butter on the top. Great! oat pancakes with peanut butter and fruits Do you know March is National Peanut Month; November is National Peanut Butter Lovers Month. Slice of sliced ​​bread Half an apple One teaspoon of cinnamon Peanut butter to taste Toast the sliced ​​bread as you like and when it is warm spread the peanut butter with the help of a knife or a spoon. Then cut the apple into thin slices and place them on top. You can leave it fresh or put it in the microwave for a few seconds to make it a little. Later add the cinnamon powder to it to taste and enjoy! Delicious! Do you know any more recipes for peanut butter breakfasts? They sure are to die for. Nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter quite like unrequited love. — Charles M.

746,Food Review at the Bengaluru International Airport,food," Pixabay I had to fly to Chennai from Bengaluru in India on 15th August 2018. My flight was scheduled to depart at around 11 am from Bengaluru's Kempegowda International Airport. I had made an online booking through Air India's website for my scheduled flight. However, my flight was delayed and the re-scheduled departure was now at 3 pm. I had plenty of time to check out my maiden visit to Bengaluru's Kempegowda International Airport. As usual, I started off from home at 7 am to travel by public transport BMTC bus to Kempegowda Bus Station in Central Bengaluru. BMTC is the flagship public transport carrier in Bengaluru and operates intra-city shuttles extensively in Bengaluru. BMTC has also made special arrangements for air travelers to connect to Bengaluru's Kempegowda International Airport from Central Bus Station located at Kempegowda Bus Station. BMTC operates dedicated air-conditioned shuttles titled 'Vayu Vajra' to the airport on a round-the-clock basis. My shuttle from Kempegwoda Bus Station operates on route number KIAS-9 to Bengaluru's Kempegowda International Airport via Shivananda Circle, Mekhri Circle, UAS College, Hebbal, IAF bus stop to finally reach the airport. The shuttle was ready to depart from the bus bay at 7.30 am. I quickly got in and settled in my seat. The crew collected the ticket fare and it was around INR 235/- to the airport. The bus was packed in the morning as it was a weekend holiday along with the celebration of India's Independence Day falling on the same day. Pixabay The shuttle made a smooth journey in the early morning to the airport as the traffic was less. We soon made it to the airport at around 8.25. am and it took us nearly an hour to reach the airport from Bengaluru's Central Bus station. I got off from the BMTC shuttle which parked the bus opposite to departure gates at the airport's BMTC bus terminal. I could witness an early morning crowd at the Departure hall of the airport. I waited my turn to get inside the terminal after verification of my e-ticket with the identity card. As soon as I entered the departure hall, I quickly rushed to Air India's economy waiting in line to get my boarding pass. After waiting for about 20 minutes in the line, my turn to present the identity card and e-ticket came up. The ticketing agent quickly scanned the e-ticket and informed me that I need to wait till 9 am to get the final status of my flight. I had no choice but to leave the counter. At first, I sensed that there might be a delay in issuing the boarding pass though my flight was on time as per the display screen. I soon spotted the Cafe Coffee Day outlet in the corner of the departure hall. I had to wait for about ten minutes in the queue to place my order and soon I was sipping a cup of hot coffee. I entered Air India's boarding gate lane for economy class passengers at around 9 am. Yet again I had to wait for about 15-20 minutes to arrive at the ticketing counter. I presented my e-ticket and identity card at the counter and my ticket was scanned. This time the scan was successful and I was issued a boarding pass for my trip to Chennai and as requested I was allotted a window seat in the last row of the Airbus aircraft. After collecting my boarding pass, I headed to the security check area located on the first floor. After the security check I rushed off to my boarding gate to view the status of my departure and it was not yet updated. As I had plenty of time ahead of the scheduled departure at 11 am, I headed to have some yummy breakfast. Pixabay The restaurant selling the breakfast on the mezzanine floor was crowded too. I had to wait again for my turn to pay cash and order for breakfast and 15 minutes passed off without any hassle. I had ordered yummy idli vada and masala dosa along with a cup of hot filter coffee. I relished and enjoyed the breakfast at the airport's restaurant. Soon it was time to head to the departure gates and I could see that all the passengers were waiting at the boarding gate to get the final status of the flight departure time. However, at around 10.45 am I along with several passengers received an SMS alert informing me about the delay in departure of my flight and the re-scheduled time at 3 pm. Many passengers were anxious and at 11 am an official announcement was made regarding the delay in departure. Some of the passengers intended to get on to another connecting flight while some had to cancel the plans. I was feeling a bit relaxed after the official announcement was made. I was happy that I had plenty of time to spend my first time at the airport. The aircraft crew informed the passengers that the lunch was made available at around 12.30 pm only for the Chennai-bound passengers. I quickly glanced through the boarding hall and found a display board leading to the 'Above Ground Level' lounge. Since this was my first time at the airport, I decided to try the lounge and have lunch before the scheduled departure at 3 pm. Pixabay 'Above Level Lounge' is located on the top floor of the boarding hall. One can gain entry to the lounge through the elevators and staircase. As soon as I entered the lounge floor, the reception desk was abuzz with a long queue of passengers who wished to visit the lounge. I had to wait here for another 15 minutes to make the payment at the reception desk. The payment was successful and I opted for the non-alcoholic beverages and veg food option. The lounge was busy with many passengers as it was a weekend holiday. I headed to a lounge chair to keep my backpack tucked into it safely so that it is easier for me to have lunch. Upon arrival, I was greeted with a choice of mango or orange juice as a welcome drink. I opted for orange juice and it was very refreshing to start off my lunch course. Soon I made a quick tour of the lounge area and food spread. The lounge had an excellent buffet arrangement with a wide variety of North Indian and South Indian cuisines. The lounge also had a live counter catering to dosa and paratha requests by the guests. I also had a look at the starters which were offered to the guests as a special dish on the occasion of Indian Independence Day. A special pastry made of tri-color with sweets was offered to the guests. I quickly grabbed spring rolls as a starter and tasted the pastry along with sweets. It was tasty and had an interesting aroma due to the freshness.Next, I headed to opt for main course lunch. The following items were available to the guests I opted for a naan, vegetarian gravy, paneer dish, fried rice, papad, curd rice, sweets, and rose milk. The lunch was wholesome and I enjoyed the food at the lounge. Since it was a special day, the ambiance was vibrant with a festive spirit and guests had ample time to spend at the lounge with a wide variety of food at the lounge. After my lunch, I had some more time before the scheduled departure time at 3 pm. I headed to recliners to take a nap and read a newspaper. I spent some time relaxing at the lounge and also got a good view of the busy departure hall. The lounge also has a flight departure display screen. I noticed that my boarding gate for the Air India flight to Chennai was announced with the scheduled departure at 3 pm. I quickly grabbed my backpack and rushed to the boarding gate. Pixabay I could spot many passengers bound to Chennai already waiting at the gate. Since my seat was located in the last row of the flight, the last row passengers were called first to the departure gate. Soon we could spot the arrival of our Air India flight specially arranged from Chennai, (as informed by the airline staff). The boarding gates were opened and I was the first person to board the flight. I settled in my seat with a good view of the apron of Bengaluru's Kempegowda International Airport. Soon the flight was full of passengers with the exception of up to five seats which remained vacant due to last-minute cancellations. The flight was one time and left Bengaluru at 3 pm. The weather outside was gloomy with few spells of rain showers witnessed at Bengaluru and there was no sunshine. We made it to Chennai within 40 minutes and landed in Chennai at 3.45 pm. The flight was delayed for about five hours but I had sufficient time to enjoy and relish the food at the airport's lounge.

749,Warm & Comforting Nigerian Fish Pepper Soup,food," Brian loves food and enjoys exploring various cuisines. He is a keen experimenter in the kitchen and finds cooking therapeutic. A tantalising bowl of hot and spicy Tilapia fish pepper soup CharlesEmes My better half and I love to cook, and the lockdown has given us the opportunity to utilise our kitchen more than usual. Although we are not professional chefs or cooks, my wife and I will take turns donning the apron to show off our self-acquired skills. Our recent favorite is this Nigerian fish pepper soup, which was adapted from the West African cuisine. For those that have experience preparing West African cuisine might testify that the process can be an uphill task, especially if you are making the dish from scratch. Growing up in Nigeria, I had lived in Owerri which is situated in Imo state and there are several rivers in Owerri which blessed us with an abundant supply of fish. On certain evenings, the boys will gather by the river to try our luck; if we managed to catch a Tilapia, it will surely end up in a pot of fish pepper soup. I had a recollection of me going to the village market with my aunt as a little boy, to get Tilapia on days when we wanted to have the dish but did not manage to catch any fish. The village market is situated close to the rivers which guaranteed only the freshest produce, whereby every fish caught is instantly sold to eager customers. The fish pepper soup dish uses quite a myriad of organic ingredients and definitely lots of spices, which makes it impossible to resist for those that can take the heat. This fragrant and mouth watering dish features a distinct blend of ingredients such as the freshwater Tilapia and combination of spices and seasonings. It is usually eaten in exclusive Nigerian bars and restaurants. Nonetheless, you may still find this dish in any roadside stalls in the streets across Nigeria, but, the locals will lead you to find the better tasting ones. In Owerri, numerous restaurants may offer a variety of fish or seafoods in their own distinct version of pepper soup. However, those die hard lovers of fish pepper soup will definitely tell you that they prefer the ones cooked using Tilapia or either catfish. I personally prefer Tilapia, because the meat is able to soak up the flavour of the spices and seasonings better. Additionally, most would opt for Tilapia fish because it is inexpensive and thus easy on the wallet. COOKING TIPS 1.	Adding a stalk of lemongrass gives the pepper soup an amazing aroma. 2.	If you can’t handle the spiciness of the scotch bonnet peppers, you may use it minimally and substitute it with more portions of bird’s eye chilies instead. 3.	The combination of herbs and spices in the pepper soup spice mixture gives the soup an extra oomph. You may source for pepper soup spice in an African grocery store. 4.	Adding smoked paprika gives the pepper soup a hint of smokiness. 5 min 30 min 35 min 2 - 4 persons Clockwise from bottom to top – Red chilies, green bird’s eye chilies, scotch bonnet peppers, lemongrass, fresh bay leaf, red onion, spices and seasonings, and Tilapia fish CharlesEmes Put a pot of water to boil CharleEmes Once the water is boiling, put a whole onion in CharlesEmes Add in all the chilies, spices and seasonings along with a stalk of lemongrass CharlesEmes Cover the pot with its lid and let the spices cook for 10 minutes CharlesEmes Add in the fish into the pot to cook with the boiled seasonings and spices CharlesEmes After the fish is cooked, put in the chopped red and green bird's eye chili CharlesEmes Garnish the fish pepper soup with cilantro before serving CharlesEmes Serving Suggestions I normally eat the pepper soup on its own, but you can serve it with plantain or rice. For added texture and bite, you may even add boiled yam into the soup. © 2021 Brian Brian (author) from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia on May 16, 2021: Good to hear that, Liz! My family and I are doing fine over here, keeping safe indoors. Thank you for asking. Do agree with you that soup requires a lot of preparation,but, there are some recipes that are quite simple too. Either way, the effort invested will surely be worth it. Liz Westwood from UK on May 16, 2021: I am fine, thanks. I hope all is well with  you and your family. In my experience many soup recipes require quite a lot of preparation. But, like you say, the effort is worth it for the result. Brian (author) from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia on May 16, 2021: Hi, Liz! How are you? Hope that you are keeping well. Well, thank you for the kind words as always. This dish is certainly tasty although it looks a bit intimidating I'd say. It may seem a bit tedious to prepare, but, the work is worthwhile when you get to enjoy the soup after it's done. Brian (author) from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia on May 16, 2021: Hi, Brenda! Reading your comment tickled my funny bones and reminded me of a friend of mine. He too is just like you and does not like to be presented the fish in it's 'original' state, regardless of how delicious the dish may be. Well, that is why he only eats fish and chips, as he says it does not remind him of the 'animal'. Brian (author) from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia on May 16, 2021: Thank you, Louise! This here is my go to dish and comfort food when I am missing my home. Sorry that you don't fancy the head. Well, there is not much meat on the head except for the cheeks and maybe some on the base of the neck, so you will not miss out anything by tossing it out. Liz Westwood from UK on May 15, 2021: This sounds like a tasty dish. Your step by step directions are very helpful. BRENDA ARLEDGE from Washington Court House on May 15, 2021: Oh my...the ingredients sound great but there is no way I'm eating anything that still looks like a fish. Sorry, even the pictures make me squirm. We de-skin fish and cut up into little bites. I don't want to see the eyes. Otherwise this recipe sounds good. Louise Powles from Norfolk, England on May 15, 2021: This sounds lovely, I'd love to try this soup.  I think I'd have to throw the head away though lol."

752,Getting The Most From Your Daily Harvest Subscription,food," I'm a certified veggie-hater who ended up loving veggies thanks to DH. Daily Harvest arrives in a giant cooler box. All four of my shipments have arrived with zero problems, and the food inside was still frozen. It's crazy that a freaking cooler can be recyclable, but it really is. Everything is cardboard, paper, or recyclable plastic. It's crazy. One claim they make is that you can cook the harvest bowls and soups in the microwave, in the already—packaged bowls. This is true. The bowls hold up, the microwave instructions are accurate, etc. However, the harvest bowls and soups are way, way better on the stovetop. It’s like night and day. Really, you should use a 1 or 2 quart saucepan and do these babies justice. You also can't do the flatbreads in the microwave. Those absolutely have to be heated in the oven. Oh and you have to put cheese on them. It's like, mandatory. Okay, not really, but please, do yourself a favor and throw some cheese on that. I needed some more veggies in my life. Really. That's how it all started. I made a new years resolution to eat more vegetables, but the problem is, I kinda hate vegetables? So my new years resolution wasn't working out. Then, my buddy decided that instead of being a Vegan like Arnold Schwartzenegger, he was gonna go keto like...I don't know, a crazy person. DH is healthy but it has too many carbs for the keto diet. As someone who hates vegetables, but also hates wasting food, here I was, with a freezer full of vegetables... And it turns out that by making vegetables super, duper convenient, like so easy a caveman could do it, I have learned to like, even love veggies. It's nice to be able to pop open the freezer and have an easy, healthy meal to just grab and go, no brain cells required, no cooking skills required. At the time, I didn't even have cookware except for a single saucepan. It didn't matter. Now, I'm hooked. I can't imagine my life without it. It's almost like crack. But like, healthy crack I guess. Spinach and Shitaake grits, frozen Spinach and Shitaake grits, cooked, lookin pretty much the same. The “grits” bowls are a new thing, and I’m not sure I dig them. I added an egg to this one but I think it needed some milk or something creamy to go with Lentil and tomato bolognese, frozen Lentil and tomato bolognese, cooked. This one is delish but needs more seasoning, so I added some generic Italian seasoning. Mamma Mia! Kale and lemongrass, frozen Kale and lemongrass, all cooked up. I made it with too much water—my bad! Green chickpea and turmeric soup, frozen Green chickpea and turmeric soup, with an egg added. Yum! Daily Harvest meals are small. I haven’t seen one more than 500 calories, and some of them are less than 200! I can’t afford to eat two of them a day, so I bulk them out. How? Daily Harvest is still doing 90% of the work, I’m just adding more protein because my lifestyle requires it. Sweet Potato and Miso Puréed Soup. Now, if you haven’t noticed, I don’t order smoothies on Daily Harvest. That’s because I only use DH for my dinners. But one night, I was tired. The instructions are to purée in a blender, then cook on the stove but I was like screw it, let’s see what it tastes like cold...and I’m telling you. It was good. Then I added a scoop of chocolate protein powder and boy. It's like a spicy chai. Yum! This content reflects the personal opinions of the author.

755,Oyster Stew - Enhanced with Chives,food," You can freeze your oysters and thaw them later when you want to eat them. The little pint-sized containers need to be stored in a Ziploc style bag since the oyster ""liquor"" has a tendency to swell when frozen and will freeze the cover off.

Nobody ever said that this needs to devoid of flavor. The drained fluid gets heated with the milk. The finished, fried oysters are dumped into the milk, using a rubber scraper to save every drop. No boiling. I did discover something important. The milk cannot be heated quickly. The oysters can be added slowly, but the fluid used to cook the oysters needs to be added to the milk slowly, and only after being cooled. The temperature needs to stay below 180 degrees. If your milk gets too hot, it will curdle. Melt butter, add oyster and onion. Second pan with the oyster water and the milk. Warm. No boil. Fry until Finney. Add Worcestershire sauce. Add oysters to milk combination. I also cut my oysters into small pieces after I was done frying them. Add oyster crackers and cheese. Enjoy! (I did!)"

761,Common Indian Egg Sabji - Microwave Version,food," Umesh is a freelance writer contributing his creative writings on varied subjects in various sites and portals in the internet. Self India is a country where vegetables are cooked in various ways using different ingredients. They are made in the form of dry vegetables or vegetable curries. Many times eggs and cottage cheese are also used for making delicious combinations. The general name of all these preparations is commonly known as 'Sabji' in India. In this article we will learn the preparation of common Indian egg sabji using microwave cooking. One can of course make it using conventional cooking ways also. Indian vegetables can be easily cooked in the conventional ways on a gas stove or hot plate using the appropriate metallic cooking vessel. But most of them including this particular vegetable (Egg sabji) can also be made using a glass bowl or microwave compatible bowl used as a cooking vessel for keeping inside the microwave. Many of us use microwave only for heating the food and do not know much about its utility as a perfect cooking alternative. So, we will go through some general and basic information in this regard before using a microwave for preparing this dish. Microwave has generally 4 or 5 cooking intensity ranges starting from very high to very low. So, most of them will have ranges like very high, high, medium, low, and very low. Some microwave cookers come with menu and are driven by the program inside and depending on the menu selected the cooker will choose the range automatically. For cooking vegetables one can use very high or high heat option. As per my experience it is better to use high position so that the chances of getting the food burnt or charred due to wrong water proportions in very high position are reduced. So, using high position is a precautionary thing which many housewives will love to prefer. The golden rule for using the microwave is that never forget to add the required quantity of water in the dish before putting it inside the microwave for cooking. If there is any doubt then one should stop the microwave in between at suitable intervals and check the dish and add little water if so needed. One of the most important thing in microwave cooking, especially for preparing a finished dry vegetable, is that one has to mix a calculated quantity of water in the vegetable before cooking it and it should be sufficient to cook it and evaporate in the process so that the dish becomes just dry as planned. This of course comes with experience but if one is preparing a dry vegetable for 2-3 people then on an average 1 medium cup of water is sufficient to make the finished dish dry as required. However depending on the type of vegetable this would require some caliberation. Anyway, we are preparing the Egg sabji in a curry form so we do not worry for this aspect as we will be adding enough water in this so the question of burning or charring does not arise in this particular recipe. Those who are not comfortable with microwave cooking can always go for the traditional saute and cook mode using their own basic culnery skills. The following quantity of ingredients will suffice for 2-3 persons and the quantity can be increased for more people, if required, accordingly. The dish takes about 30-35 minutes time in getting ready which includes time for boiling the eggs and potato also. Boil the eggs and potato fully immersed in water in a pan. They can be boiled together also. It takes 10 to 12 minutes time in that. Meanwhile peel the onions, garlic cloves, and ginger. Chop onions, tomato, garlic, green coriander leaves and ginger. Break whole red chilli in 3-4 parts and discard the seeds. Keep all of the items aside. Once eggs and potato are boiled, peel them and cut in wedges. Normally we make 6 wedge pieces of each boiled egg as well as the boiled potato. If one likes a thick curry then boiled potato can be finely meshed. Take a microwave bowl and pour 1 tbsp cooking oil in it. Add chopped onion, garlic cloves, ginger, and green coriander leaves. Then add whole black pepper, black pepper powder, cumin seeds, cloves, chilli pieces, star anise pieces, bay leaves, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, kasuri methi, coriander powder, and salt to it and mix with a spatula or spoon. Keep the bowl in the microwave and cook it in second heat position for 3-4 minutes. This is equivalent to sauteing in conventional cooking. This should not be done for more than 3-4 minutes time as that may charr the onions and other items in it. If one wants that onion is to be made brown then one can keep heating only for a half of a minute more. It will often require to stop and open the door of microwave to check the status. Stop the microwave, open the door, and take out the bowl. Now add chopped tomatoes to it and cook in the same heat position for 3-4 minutes. Again, take out the bowl and now add potato pieces (or meshed potato) and egg pieces. Add mango powder, sugar, and 4 to 5 medium cups of water. Now keep the bowl inside the microwave and cook in second heat range for 5 to 6 minutes. Open microwave door and check for consistency and add some water, if required, and cook for another 1-2 minutes and the dish is ready. Once the dish is ready it can be transferred to the porcelain or bone china bowl and can be decorated with grated cheese, green coriander leaves, white cream etc by lining and designing them on the dish surface. The dish can be served in medium bowls and can be consumed with bread, chapati, or rice. Those who are health concious can reduce the quantity of cooking oil and avoid adding potato to the dish. The quantity of the dish prepared with above instructions will be about 5 to 6 medium cups and assuming that we serve half a cup at one time as one serving, the total numbers of servings would be around 11 and from nutritional calculations I get a value of about 45 calories per serving which is pretty average value in our routine foods we take. Common Indian Egg Sabji (simple egg curry) is an easy item to be prepared using only two main ingredients as eggs and tomatoes and goes well as one of the main dishes during the meal times. The Indian spices used in this dish give it the ethnic Indian/Asian taste and many people across the globe like its favour.

762,SHADES - A Pulled and Blown sugar show piece,food," N.Srikanth is a Lecturer,Pastry & Bakery and 
Advance European Confectionery
working at Culinary Academy Of india. ‘Fill your plate with shades of colors, for what pleases the eye pleases the body as a whole.’ Shades in essence are the different tones across the color spectrum. They vary greatly - from dark to light, warm to cold, and within each color. Research suggests that the human eye can distinguish up to a million shades with more than a thousand within each color. This happens due to factors such as hue, chroma/saturation, and lightness. So when I start thinking of food plating, I automatically think of the various shades I can put onto it to make it look more appealing. But the thoughts and questions don’t end there. Digging deeper other questions rise up - How bold should color be on a plate? Can a tint be used with white and a different one with black? There are many ‘shade’ factors to consider while plating and with this plate, I wanted to highlight the importance of shades. For the ‘Shades’ theme, my idea was to leverage the different shades available within a single color. This monochrome technique would require me to choose one color and play with the various shades within it. Out of all the colors possible across the spectrum, the one that I chose, is the radiant, vibrant ‘RED’. The color red is a symbol of power, decisiveness, and leadership. It’s bold, encourages action, bolsters confidence. It’s the color of love and passion. It simulates energy, draws the eye, and creates an ever-lasting impact. And with my dish, I wanted to project all these qualities that the color represents. In order to bring this monochromatic theme to life, I chose to go down the route of Sugar Confectionery. Although it is a challenging and ambitious avenue, I felt that sugar confectionery was the only way to bring my vision and its many shades to life. This is because sugar confectionery is extremely creative and allows for the creation of marvelous wonders all of which can be eye-pleasing. To infuse the monochrome theme in the presentation, I decided to use a variety of shades of the color while working with different techniques. These included different ways of making sugar decorations like the pulling method, pouring method, and blowing method. For the pulling method of sugar confectionery, I cooked the sugar and poured the liquid sugar onto a silicone rubber mat before adding coloring to it. After this, I repeatedly folded the sugar into itself while it was still flexible and cool enough. This process allows for air to be incorporated into the sugar while giving it a bright lustrous sheen. The sugar can then be sculpted into various shapes or blown. When it comes to blown sugar, a portion of the pulled sugar is placed on a rubber pump which is tipped with either wood or metal. With this technique, the sugar can be shaped into various shapes like animals or flowers. To bring the entire dish to life I have accompanied the showpiece with a gateau that also compliments the red monochrome. The gateau I made comprised of a rich and moist crimson-red velvet cake, a crunch and gorgeous vivid-red raspberry crunch, a sweet and delicious bright red cherry confit with a silky salmon-red strawberry mousse coated on top with a shiny red mirror glaze. All this in the shape of the current trends around geometrical cakes.

764,Fragrant Coconut Oil-Infused Butterfly- Pea Rice,food," Brian loves food and enjoys exploring various cuisines. He is a keen experimenter in the kitchen and finds cooking therapeutic. The butterfly-pea flower really adds a nice hue to the rice AthenaChanEmes Some of us may not be aware of the laborious effort it takes to get rice from the field to our home, which led to it being underappreciated. Take myself for example; I was unaware of the arduous process involved, from the planting of the seeds, the caring and nurturing of the crop up till the harvesting and processing that gives us the precious grains. Thus, I have come to appreciate when my elders used to reprimand me for not finishing my rice and letting even a few grains go to waste is frowned upon. The average duration required, from planting of the seedling until it is ripe for harvest will be between 120 – 140 days, which is considered a normal time frame. However, depending on the growing conditions, it may take even lesser time which could be about 100 – 120 days or perhaps longer like 160 days and more. The cultivation duration is broken down into a series of stages, which begins with the selection of the best seeds for planting. Once the seeds have been identified, next step would be to choose the seed-bed. A good seed bed will have to be about 5 inches depth and spread out uniformly with good firm soil. The soil should contain enough moisture to allow the seeds to germinate properly. Once the seed bed is determined, the land has to be prepared and cleared off any rocks, stones, and most importantly weeds that may affect the growth of the rice plant. The seeds are then strewn on the seed bed and subsequently fertilized. Farmers will then have to keep a lookout for pests that may spoil the crop. Once the 120 day mark arrives, it is time for the farmers to harvest the straws before sending it to the mill for threshing. Threshing is done to loosen the grain from the straw, before it goes through the machine and graded accordingly. The graded rice will then be packed and sent to hypermarkets and stores for sale. This basically summarises the flow and immense effort that goes into getting this produce to consumers.

This basically summarises the flow and immense effort that goes into getting this produce to consumers.  Times have certainly changed a lot since the days of our forefathers, whereby rice is considered a prized staple. Our ancestors before us survived, much likely, depended on this very staple as the main source of energy to fuel their labor-intensive lifestyle. In fact, in the early days, many poor folks had to rely on a few grains of rice in order not to go to bed hungry. During one of her story telling sessions, I remember vividly of my grandmother saying that on days when she is unable to make enough to put food on the table, they will eat just plain rice with a dash of soy sauce to add some flavor and make it palatable. This made me come to appreciate the fact of how we are blessed right now, having access to so many food choices. Nevertheless, with the birth of many diet fads and the trend portraying carbohydrates as unhealthy, people are quick to find replacements in lieu of consuming rice. I am not against that lifestyle, but, I would still personally chose to satiate my hunger with a plate of steaming hot rice with my all time favorite dish – steamed golden pomfret. Well, everybody has a right to their preference and there will always be those that agree and some that do not, so to each his own. There are actually many varieties of rice out there in the market, approximately about 40, 000 assortments to suit the different cooking needs. These varieties are then broken down into three categories being long, medium, and short. All these varieties yield different textures and the choice of rice also depends solely on the dish that you plan to make. The locals here have a favourite rice dish called ‘nasi lemak’, which is infused with coconut milk. Albeit resulting in richer and creamier rice, cooking with coconut milk has its shortcoming. The rice will have to be consumed immediately and if not, kept in the fridge or cool place as it can go bad very quickly if exposed to high temperature. Thus, I have opted for an alternative that is coconut oil, to lend the similar aroma and boost the flavour of the rice. This rice is best eaten with some spicy gravy called ‘sambal’, fried anchovies, peanuts, boiled egg, and if you are feeling a little fancy, maybe a piece of crispy fried chicken. For those who consume rice on a daily basis, you may want to try the recipe below to add some variety to your daily meals. Cooking Tips 1.	To enhance the fragrance, you may steam the rice along with a single screw pine leaf, better known as ‘pandan’ in Asean countries. 2.	For a more attractive hue, serve the rice mixed together with the petals of the blue pea flower. 5 min 25 min 30 min 3 - 6 servings I used plain rice.

Brian (author) from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia on May 11, 2021: Hi, Urwa! This recipe originally started as a means to add some flavour to an otherwise plain tasting dish. Well, after doing some reading and realising it's health benefits, it has been a common practise for us at home. It's delicious but we try not to go overboard. All good things in moderation. Iqra from East County on May 11, 2021: Hi Charles, You shared an excellent recipe to cook with coconut oil. cCconut cooking oil is a healthy and great alternative to traditional oils such as vegetables, olive, canola, and corn oil. This oil is naturally rich in Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCT) which is efficiently utilized by the body for energy production and helps aid in calorie burning."
765,Manufacture of Alcohol in Pakistan,food," MG is an air warrior and a global traveler well as an amateur astrologer who loves to visit and explore new places. Pakistan is an Islamic state, but the leadership is pragmatic and has allowed alcohol to be manufactured and marketed. The Murree Brewery is the oldest in the subcontinent and its shares are regularly traded on the Karachi stock exchange. During my last visit to Pakistan in 2018, while sitting in the Marriott in Islamabad, I had the privilege of enjoying a glass of Murree beer which is a Pakistani product. The Islamic Republic of Pakistan is not like other Muslim nations as some aspects of its life are quite different from orthodox Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia and Yemen. One aspect concerns the manufacture of alcohol. Pakistan is the only Muslim country that has a functioning brewery that is churning out various types of beer and whiskey. In a country that is 97% Muslim, this brewery is a success and its shares which are listed on the Karachi stock exchange have performed consistently well for over a hundred years. Its products are exported to India and Bangladesh. In 2014, the company established a flagship store on Park Avenue, in Manhattan, NYC. In 2013, it was named by Forbes as one of Asia's 200 best companies. Isphanr Bhandara Origin of the Brewery In 1856 a need was felt for a local brewery for officers of the East India company army posted in the Punjab and Northwest Frontier. The family of General Dyer decided to open a brewery at Murree, a hill resort in Punjab. Later General Dyer from the same family, known as the butcher of Amritsar ordered troops to fire on an unarmed crowd and over 400 were killed. The Brewery came up in 1860 and with help from experts from Scotland started the manufacture of beer. In 1900 the company went public and it is on record that its shares were listed on the Calcutta Stock exchange in 1902. In the meantime, a Parsi family settled in Punjab took over the management of the Brewery. The Brewery continued to function at the hill resort, but a paucity of spring water forced it to shift to Rawalpindi in 1941. The company was listed on the Karachi stock exchange and it is on record that its shares have performed consistently above the national index for well over 100 years. !947 and Formation of Pakistan and Prohibition The creation of Pakistan in 1947 had no effect on the Bhandara family who were the owners of the brewery and things continued as it was earlier. Whiskey and beer were available in most clubs and restaurants in Karachi and Lahore and other places. This continued till the early seventies when Zulfikar Ali Bhutto took over as Prime Minister of Pakistan Bhutto was fast losing support among the populace and in the mid-seventies of the last century, he brought in prohibition. He assumed this step will make him popular among the masses, but he was overthrown by his protégé General Zia Ul Haq and hanged as a common criminal. The introduction of prohibition affected the Murree brewery and production fell and hard times came on the Bhandara family. Lifting of Partial Prohibition and Introduction of Permits General Zia Ul Haq for all his reputation as a strict Islamist was, in reality, a pragmatic man. He realized the importance of opening the brewery and lifting of total prohibition. This he assumed would be in the interest of Pakistan as it would cut down on bootlegging and illegal smuggling of alcohol from India and Scotland. The General lifted prohibition and introduced a permit system. This was freely available to non-Muslims and even Muslims could get the permit on medical grounds. Foreigners were also issued permits. The Brewery now expanded production and the new Managing director Minoo Bhandara brought in new technology and products. In 2007, Murree became the Muslim world's first brewery to make 20-year-old malt whiskey named ""Rarest Malt Whisky"". Local laws ban Muslims from drinking alcohol. However, the CEO of Murree claims that ""99 % of his customers are Muslims in Pakistan.   Pakistan is the only Muslim country in the world to have a functioning brewery. Despite strict laws, the Murree brewery and its products have carved a name for themselves in Pakistan. The company's cellars hold over half a million liters of Malt whiskey in stock. The company has made a foray into India and in 2013 it granted a franchisee to a Bangalore company to market the Pakistani beer in India. The government of Imran Khan has now gone one step ahead and in 2020 they have given the license to a Chinese company to manufacture beer in Baluchistan. Pakistan is in a piquant situation. It continues to give lip service to prohibition and the concept of alcohol being abhorrent for Muslims but at the same time permits the manufacture of millions of liters of beer and whiskey. The explanation given by the Pakistan government is that beer and alcoholic drinks are for the Christians and Hindus who actually constitute 3% of the population. Obviously, this 3% population cannot consume the millions of liters and in practical terms, alcoholic drinks including whiskey and beer are available all over Pakistan at a few select openings. There is also an active bootlegging industry that transports whiskey and beer even to the remote corners of the tribal regions in the Northwest frontier. The penalties if you are caught are stiff but the lure of alcohol is so great that thousands are ready to brave the dangers. I only hope that in due course of time Pakistan will get out of its hypocrisy and become like a normal country and follow countries like the United Arab Emeritus, Dubai, Morrocco, and Turkey.   MG Singh emge (author) from Singapore on May 11, 2021: May peace be with you. Do not get worked up in literary discussions. MG Singh emge (author) from Singapore on May 11, 2021: Excellent sentiments, god bless you. MG Singh emge (author) from Singapore on May 11, 2021: Thank you, Misbah, you know to see how you look you need a mirror. I have not understood what is offensive in this article. A statement of fact on the manufacture of alcohol should not get you worked up. MG Singh emge (author) from Singapore on May 11, 2021: Thank you Misbah, so nice you commented. I have just stated a fact that China is sanctioned to set up a brewery in Balochistan. What is wrong with this? Who drinks this is beside the point and as you are aware in both India and Pakistan there is a lot of piferage. MG Singh emge (author) from Singapore on May 11, 2021: Thank you Peggy for commenting. EK Jadoon from Abbottabad Pakistan on May 11, 2021: Absolutely Misbah, this is just a reminder for them. We are here to support our nation and country. I don't know why people forget their times so easily. They are sabotaging the country's reputation. These are some reasons that why the entire world cannot come together on one platform. One can go so far in hatred and make fun of the nation of others. That's why global human equality is utopic. EK Jadoon from Abbottabad Pakistan on May 11, 2021: Misbah, I am with you. Whatever you have written, is notable. And emge, I feel sad for your tactless thinking. Don't you have any other work to do instead of spreading false news about Pakistan? I wouldn't say that no Muslim has ever drunk alcohol. Like murder is a serious crime in all countries. But can you say that there has never been a murder in India, China, the United States or any other country? No, you can't say. And Tom I don't know why you are showing the rough edge of your tongue. Have you ever been beaten or deceived by a Muslim? Pipe down kiddo, Anyone can commit deception and crime, it doesn't necessary for him to be a Muslim. I hope whatever you have said about the Muslim nation is a slip of your tongue. And dear Mike, thanks for sharing your experience. But sorry to say, you can't judge the entire muslim community on the basis of your useless experience. Sorry for being harsh, but freedom of speech doesn't mean hurting emotions. I alwasys believe in the law, ""every action has a reaction"". Misbah Sheikh from ""a Serene Land"" (This Existence Is an Illusion) on May 11, 2021: The beer produced is to fulfil the requirement of Chinese nationals working in Pakistan. I wonder if you know something about China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Peggy Woods from Houston, Texas on May 11, 2021: I would never have guessed that alcohol is produced in Pakistan in a Muslim country.  Thanks for the education of that fact.  Theoretically, Christian Baptists are not supposed to drink alcohol, but we know plenty of them who do imbibe. MG Singh emge (author) from Singapore on May 11, 2021: Thank you Pamela for your comment. Pamela Oglesby from Sunny Florida on May 11, 2021: I am surprised to learn alcohol is manufactured in Pakistan. This is a well-written interesting article and it certainly does seem hypocritical for this Muslim country to manufacture alcohol. MG Singh emge (author) from Singapore on May 11, 2021: Hi, Mike so nice you commented. Your experiences add to the value of my writing. Yes, it's true, millions like in Egypt consume alcohol in Pakistan even in the heart of Taliban dominated FATA region. MG Singh emge (author) from Singapore on May 11, 2021: Thanks, Tom, yes it is the fact that the Pakistan economy is controlled by 22 families and In a way, I also agree that it is a fake Islamic nation that keeps on going against the tenets of the Quran by persecuting people like the Ahmadiyyas and minorities. Abbas Gokal, unfortunately, ended in jail for fraud. In 1970 Pakistan had less population than Bangladesh, but now its population is way ahead of Bangladesh, its GDP is also lowered and above all, it's on the terrorist watch list of FATF. I really feel sad for Pakistan, so many friends there and they support my writing, that is the silver lining. MG Singh emge (author) from Singapore on May 11, 2021: Olusegun, thank you so much for commenting. Readmikenow on May 11, 2021: Excellent article. I was in Egypt a few years ago.  Some Egyptians took be to a bar in the desert.  When I asked them why they were drinking  alcohol when their religion forbid it.  One man laughed and said for the same reason Christians have girlfriends before they get married. He said to just relax and enjoy myself.  I did, and it was fun.  Nothing is as you think it will be. OLUSEGUN from NIGERIA on May 11, 2021: I enjoyed this. Thanks for sharing"

767,Mozzarella Cheese Making from Scratch,food," Making mozzarella cheese has been a learning experience. Since this was my first time making it, I learned [albeit the hard way] some things that I may not repeat on my second attempt. [If there is a second attempt]. What made me attempt it at all was a half gallon of whole milk left behind by a visit from my granddaughters. We bought it in anticipation of making chocolate syrup infused milk, but they were more inclined to juice bags. So be it. At any rate, this half gallon of milk was just sitting there, and I had heard it was easy to make mozzarella cheese, so... here goes. milk and lemon juice powder infused water. Lemon juice powder instead of straight citric acid. I have heard that vinegar may be an option. heating slowly to 90 degrees. stirring gently with spatula ahah. Temperature 90 degrees. Remove from heat. Let stand for 30 seconds. I thought cheese making would be far more complicated, so I had never tried it. I watched an episode of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and watched someone make mozzarella. I wasn't paying close attention, but the cheese practically made itself. I looked online and found some simplified instructions and since I had a bottle of whole milk in the fridge, I decided to be brave and waste it on my experimentation. I needed some citric acid to curdle the milk. I had some lemon powder. I'm assuming vinegar would work as well. I had to bring my milk, water, lemon to 90 degrees. The milk and lemon water needs to be heated to 90 degrees. My milk is 45 - 55 degrees normally. I started with a Candy thermometer, but realized that the bottom temperature notation was 100 degrees. That won't work. I found my electronic temperature probe and brought the milk to 90 degrees on medium heat. It heated quickly. I needed water, and two things. One measuring cup held one cup of water, and the other held a quarter cup of water. The cup of water needs 1 1/2 teaspoons of citric acid, which I found in 6 packages of Tru Lemon. The smaller cup of water was used to dissolve 3 tablets of junket rennet. I think they sell regular rennet somewhere, but I had this box of regular junket rennet. It's not as effective so it required extra. If I would have just kept the stomach from a dead sheep, I would have been set... Sigh... 90 degrees, remove from heat. Stir in rennet water. Wait for 30 seconds, then cover. Wait 5 minutes. If solid, go to the next step. If still liquid, set timer for 5 more minutes. rennet for junket, not as strong as regular rennet, but they said, if that is all you have, use extra. So, I used three tablets three tablets rennet in 1/4 cup water. Let sit until ready to add. Do not add until second step. jug of whole milk pour milk into sizeable pan. Add lemon juice infused water. add rennet water to milk. stir. let sit for 30 seconds. cover, and let sit for five minutes, until drawn together in a stiff mass. If still watery, five minutes more.Covered. timer. At five minutes, check. If liquidy, do for 5 more minutes. keep spatula handy see how coagulation is occurring. The milk is getting more solid, separating and moving away from edge of pan. After 10 minutes, return pan to burner and heat to 105 degrees. You must cook the solidified mass after you cut it. You will need to use a long spatula to cut the hardening mass. A metal cookie turner worked well for me. The cheese needs to be cut into squares. Once you have made four cuts in left to right and front to back directions, you must heat the cheese to 105 degrees. The cheese must be moved, not stirred, as you heat, so it doesn't settle to the bottom and as you heat, it will gather itself together. Cut the cheese across, three cuts, then down, three cuts. I used a cookie spatula. Cut gently and cleanly to bottom of pan.  move, not stir. Heat mass to 105 degrees. Remove chunks to a microwave safe bowl. Microwave for 60 seconds. Drain off liquid. I used green colander bowl. Retain fluid for future bread baking. Microwave to 135 degrees. I had my batch to 135 degrees and it was a nice ball-like consistency. Then, I microwaved it again, for good measure, and it went to liquid. Lesson learned. I should have quit heating it when it became a ball. The cheese at that point needs to be worked by kneading and folding.  Now, I drained the cheese water [whey] and retained it in a bowl for later use. Then, somewhere I learned that you must return the cheese after heating to 135 degrees, to the hot whey and stretch your cheese. I did not do this. Place cheese curds in bowl and microwave for 60 seconds. Then, heat for 30 second increments until the ball reaches 135 degrees. Then, stop microwaving. Well. I heated my cheese to 135 degrees, and it was a nice, stretchy ball. I put it in the microwave, again, for what I thought was good measure. Nope. I wrecked the consistency. It became a liquid again. Too much. Stop while you are ahead. 135 degrees. Stop. I mean, it thickens up in the refrigerator, and becomes like a thick, cheese spread, but I don't think that was what I was after. On TV, the cheese was thick and stretch and the person cut it and put it on a cracker, and also heated it on bread with a tomato sauce for a pizza like topping. collect curd in microwavable bowl. heat for 60 seconds. drain whey Start testing the temperature. 60 seconds of microwaving, test for 135 degrees. No, then, microwave for 30 seconds. Test temperature. Temperature reached? Stop microwaving. Once it reached 135, it was stretchy. Additional microwaving did something weird to the cheese strands, and it returned to a liquid form. More like a cheese spread. As you can see in the next picture, the cheese has a stretchy look to it. It had just reached 135 degrees. I should have stopped microwaving it. I did not. nice, stretchy ball look. Stop cooking. Temperature good. This is where I screwed up. I microwaved it for 30 more seconds and ruined the ball shape. additional microwaving, caused liquid. See, no longer a ball shape. Char Milbrett (author) from Minnesota on May 11, 2021: Iqra, thank you for your comment. Good luck making the cheese! Iqra from East County on May 11, 2021: Hi Char Milbrett, You shared an awesome recipe for making Mozzarella Cheese. I must try it. Thanks for sharing."

770,A Gift of Rare Scotch From a Love,food," MG is an air warrior and a global traveler well as an amateur astrologer who loves to visit and explore new places. Life has a peculiar dimension, that it moves only forward. One would not mind Einstein's theory of time and space to come true but perhaps it's not practical. One would hope that the Time Machine of HG Wells would appear but again that doesn't happen. One constant factor is a woman who you have loved and the choices of wine and whiskey. Poetry is not my forte but I can write a rhyme or two. Drink to me only with your eyes,And I will pledge mine;Or let the goblet have an imprint of your lips,And I’ll not look for anything.The thirst that I feel can only be quenched from your lips or wine. You are not here, so I make do with good single malt divine; Well, the long and short of it is that the old flame of four years sent me a gift. The courier brought the package. I was intrigued but when I opened the package the contents thrilled me. Here was a woman who knew my taste. The carton contained two of the finest bottles of scotch-rare single malt whiskey. The carton contained two neatly packed bottles. The first was Ardbeg, which is advertised as the ""ultimate Islay Single Malt Scotch whiskey"". It is guaranteed as 10 years old and distilled at the Ardbeg Distillery at the Isle of Islay, Argyll, Scotland. The Arberg distillery lies on the most southerly part of Islay and situated right on the rugged shores of the Atlantic Ocean. Ardbeg is a distinctive whisky with a compelling history. In 1997 it was purchased by The Glenmorangie Company. Since then, Ardbeg is well established as a niche, cult malt, It is a “star” among whiskies, Ardbeg single malt has been awarded innumerable awards by connoisseurs of single malt. Jim Murray the global whiskey experts and the man behind Murrays Bible has declared Ardbeg “scotch whisky of the year” three years in a row .it won “best single malt in the world” and ‘best Islay single malt’ at the World Whisky Awards in 2013 and 2014 The whiskey is non-chill-filtered and has a strength of 46%. This is supposed to be the ultimate single malt whiskey that other whiskies aspire to reach. Well here is my assessment; Nose: Peat, smoke, lemon, salt, maritime. Taste: Peat, tar, bbq smoke, it’s got some earthy notes, pepper, licorice, lemon, and hints of vanilla. Finish: A long, smoky finish with some sweetness and pepper.It's a great drink, but till this bottle came I hadn't drunk it.  Now I come to the second bottle. The second bottle was Glenmorangie's special brand the Duthac. This whiskey is supposed to be inspired by King James IV who made an annual visit to the distillery and the inventor of this concoction Dr. Bill Lumsden set out and created this whiskey for the king. So it is a royal whiskey and associated with royalty and that alone will give you a wonderful feeling. I am told the Maharaja of Patiala drank gallons and gallons of this whiskey and it was really available like water in his gala parties. Well, he could afford it. I was wondering how the name Duthac appeared. A small booklet along with the bottle says that he was the patron saint of Tain in Scotland (1000-65). Most likely King James came to this place to pay homage to Saint Duthac. The whiskey has a special taste, but I will confess that I have never tasted it earlier. What a girl, to pick up a rare scotch which I had never tasted earlier. The whiskey is around for long years and is marketed only in limited quantities to the elite. It's a deep bronze whiskey. I will delineate a few properties of this whiskey for connoisseurs. Aroma:  Seductive aromas of pear, toffee apple, Brazil nuts in toffee, with an underlying spicy note, some toasty oak. Taste:  Mouth-filling flavors of milk chocolate, toffee, Brazil nuts, leather, and some aniseed. The spiciness is definite, but gentle, with hints of ginger and clove. Finish:  The aftertaste once again reminds drinkers that this is a Glenmorangie, with vanilla, apricots in cream, and some almond marzipan.  I will add that I rang her up in America and thanked her for it and mentioned that she knew my taste also included fair women! Adios friends till we meet again on Hub Pages.

781,"What, Exactly, Is Cholesterol?",food," What, exactly, is cholesterol? If you saw it, it would look like fatty, waxy stuff. Not only is it in some of the food you eat, but your body produces it every day. Your liver produces it. It's necessary for good health, and it's a part of every cell in your body.That doesn't mean that you shouldn't take steps to be sensible about it–especially if you're carrying excess weight and need. There are several things that cholesterol helps our bodies to do: So far from being the universal evil that it's always portrayed as cholesterol does have some good in it. We need cholesterol and we produce it ourselves. You also get some from certain foods, basically from animals, like meat or dairy. Fruit and veg contain no cholesterol at all. When is it bad? When the body produces too much cholesterol it sits in the bloodstream and eventually, it can block up your blood vessels. If you eat a lot of animal fats – also called saturated fats -your body can produce too much cholesterol. And a high cholesterol level should not be ignored. Now there are various types of cholesterol and they each have a different role to play in your health. The bad cholesterol is called LDL, which stands for Low-Density Lipoprotein. This is the one that can increase your chances of getting heart disease by clogging up your arteries. When that happens blood flow through the artery is diminished.Good cholesterol is called HDL. This is the opposite, so it's High-Density Lipoprotein. This sweeps up the bad cholesterol from your bloodstream. This means it's important to know your cholesterol ratio to know whether you have a normal cholesterol level. If you cholesterol monitor regularly you will know when you have high cholesterol. And if you do have high cholesterol it makes sense to reduce your LDL cholesterol if you can. And if your levels are high you should do it as soon as possible, for your own sake.Considering that it's been estimated that about 50% of Americans have high cholesterol levels, it's wise for everyone to get their level tested and do something about it. Lowering cholesterol naturally is an attractive option for many. Remaining on medication for any length of time is something a lot of people want to avoid. So start by making wise choices in the foods you eat. There are foods naturally lower in the stuff. Fish is one. An average egg has about four times the cholesterol of a piece of fish, for example, so choosing the fish would help you have a lower level. It's been estimated that if you reduce your cholesterol by one percent you can decrease your chances of heart disease by twice that – 2%. That's an amazing difference for small changes in your levels. Testing time If you haven't had your cholesterol tested in the last five years, then you should seriously think about having it done now. Even if your levels are high, you can reduce them by paying attention to your diet. If you don't know what your normal cholesterol level is, you should speak to your doctor to find out, or you could invest in one of the modern and easy-to-use home cholesterol testing kits out there. It's Complex Cholesterol is a complex topic, which may be difficult to understand. Although cholesterol was known to exist in 1770, research on its structure was not conducted until the early 1900s. It was not until the 1930's the correct structure of the cholesterol molecule was ascertained. The final stage of research about synthesizing the cholesterol compound was not completed until 1951 by the American chemist, Robert B. Woodward. Cholesterol is a fatty lipid, which is a broad class of organic products found in living systems, and is located in cell membranes and transported by blood plasma. Cell membranes, also known as plasma membranes, are barriers inside or surrounding a cell. Blood plasma is a yellow liquid component comprised of 90 percent water in which blood cells are suspended. It is about 60 percent of your total blood volume. It is mostly incapable of disintegration in water but can be dispersed in some organic substances. Facts about cholesterol It is a steroid, which is a fat-soluble organic compound. Cholesterol is found in your brain, spinal cord, and liver in large accumulations. The liver is the most important site where cholesterol is biosynthesized, a phenomenon that takes place when chemical compounds are produced from simpler substances or compounds. Biosynthesis can also take place in your adrenal glands and reproductive organs. Biosynthesis takes place in living organisms and is essential for metabolism. It is produced from acetic acid by a process of enzymatic reactions. Synthesize means a process where the union of two or more elements results in the formation of a new component. Acetic acid occurs naturally in body fluids. It is a molecule that is an originator to other biologically important molecules. A molecule is the smallest physical unit of an element or compound. It is a primary precursor for the synthesis of Vitamin D3, steroid hormones in the adrenal glands, and sex hormones. Adrenal glands are located above the kidneys and their function is to regulate your stress response through the production of these steroid hormones. SterolIt is categorized as a sterol. It is the primary sterol synthesized by animals. Sterols, also known as steroid alcohols, are a subgroup of steroids. It is excreted almost entirely from the liver in a secretion called bile. Bile is a bitter alkaline yellow, brown, or green fluid composed of many elements, including cholesterol that helps food digestion by neutralizing stomach acid. If bile does not flow properly, you will suffer from digestive disturbances and, possibly, jaundice. However, cholesterol can also crystallize in the gall bladder in the form of gallstones. The size of gallstones can be anywhere from a grain of sand to a golf ball. Gallstones from cholesterol are usually green, but also may be white or yellow.If you take away nothing else from this article, remember this: it is necessary for life. It's an excess of it–and the 'wrong' type–that seems to be the problem. That means you don't have to panic if your levels are higher than they should be. You just have to educate yourself and take some simple, but sensible steps to correct the situation."

So cooling down with a sweet and cold desert is a common practice in this archipelago of more than 7,000 islands. Pares in English means pair. The reason it is called as such is because the beef stew with the special sauce is paired with garlic fried rice. The term pares was coined by Roger Tiu and Mrs. Lolita ” Lolly” Tiu. The couple started their restaurant called Jonas' Pares. Their goal was to provide a fine dining experience to the common man.Pares is usually served with beef soup.

785,10 Street foods you need to try if you visit Brazil,food," Food plays a big part in the culture of a country. When you think about France, you think crêpes. When you think about Germany, sausages may come to mind. For the British? The famous fish and chips are the go-to food. However, in Brazil, things are a bit different. With the colonization and the size of Brazil. The Brazilian cuisine is vast, from street food to main dishes and desserts. In this piece, I'll give you 10 of the best street foods in Brazil, some of them you can try to make at home. Espetinhos - Meat on a Stick The Brazilian cuisine is vast, from street food to main dishes and desserts. This type of cheese is originally from the Northeast of Brazil and was discovered accidentally around 150 years ago. The milk curdled inside a worker's canteen. Queijo Coalho is a cheese loved by many Brazilians. You can often find it in many typical dishes and as part of the famous Brazilian barbecue. You'll find this cheese grilled on a stick with honey, treacle, or oregano. The most popular flavor is gooseberry, famous for its red color. You can find a popcorn cart in every school, university, museum, hospital, park, and fair. This tasty treat comes in a variety of ways. You can buy it salted with crunchy cheese, melted butter, or/and crispy bacon and if you like sweet popcorn rather than savory. Then you can get popcorn covered in chocolate or caramel that comes in many flavors. The most popular caramel flavor is gooseberry, famous for its red color. Churros Churros originated from Spain and used to be called Porras. Churros consist of fried dough in a thin, sometimes twisted shape and covered in sugar. The Brazilian version of this pastry is popular and slightly more creative. In Brazil, Churros are a long fried dough filled with a variety of fillings. The fillings that are the most popular are chocolate cream, dulce de leche cream, and guava paste. The dough is then filled with cream and covered in sugar and cinnamon. Eaten while still hot is the preferable way of enjoying this decadent treat. Pão de Queijo or Cheesebread The origin of this snack is a little vague, but the place most commonly known for improving the recipe is a place in Brazil called Minas Gerais. The bun has multiple variations concerning the ingredients. Some have milk and butter others have olive oil and water. The ingredients which never change are the cheese and the cassava flour. It's the perfect pastry for breakfast or an afternoon snack. Anywhere in Brazil, you will find a bakery or food stand selling this amazing bun. You can also find this bun with a nice stuffing like cheddar cream, Catupiry cheese (a Brazilian soft processed cheese brand), guava paste, and dulce de leche. Boiled corn is one of the most simple foods we'll get on this list. Just like Queijo Coalho and popcorn, you will find this snack anywhere in Brazil. The sellers usually have a cart with a pan of boiling water, and the corn is inside to stay warm. When you buy it, they will thresh the corn and serve it hot with a spoon of butter and salt or with a generous helping of honey. Tapioca An indigenous dish, tapioca is made from cassava. The indigenous people of Brazil would prepare it by adding cassava powder to a hot surface. The powder would then turn into a dough-like disk and be filled with the stuffing of choice. When done, the texture is very similar to gum. Today you have the option of a pancake-like batter made of two spoons full of tapioca, one egg, and a generous helping of cream cheese. This batter goes on the pan just like a pancake, and when it is almost cooked and still in the pan, you add your stuffing like cheese, ham, cream cheese, tomatoes folding in half to finish. Tapioca can also be eaten sweet by using fruits and jams. An indigenous dish, tapioca is made from cassava. It's impossible to find a snack bar, bakery, or market that doesn't sell this amazing dish. Coxinha is a pear-shaped, deep-fried, chicken-filled croquette. And if you think the fillings stop at chicken, then you will be surprised. One thing the Brazilians are known for is their creativity and adaptation. And the coxinha is no different. You can find this snack with different shapes and fillings such as chicken, minced beef, and cheese. Most birthday parties have these snacks in smaller sizes. It is an experience you can't miss. Coxinha Espetinhos in Brazil is another street food you can't miss. Everyone knows that Brazilians are known for their barbecue. This tasty food is no different. You can find it in most parks, busy streets, food trucks, beaches, and fairs. The meat can be beef, chicken, or even sausage. It's usually cut into cubes and seasoned. The scent of barbecue will carry you to your happy place. Espetinhos in Brazil is another street food you can't miss. Barbeque sausage I know what you are thinking. Hot dogs and burgers are not Brazilian food. Although that's true, no place in the world makes hot dogs and burgers like Brazilians. Imagine a regular hot dog, sausage, ketchup, mustard, right? Well, not for Brazilians. Most places will have anything you can think of in it, mashed potatoes, corn, peas, bacon, cheddar, cheese, and chips. Burgers are the same. You will find burgers with arugula (rocket), eggs, cherry tomatoes, ham, and so much more. Pastel is the food you must try if you ever come to Brazil. The origin of this food is unknown, but it does resemble spring rolls due to the thin deep-fried dough. You can find pastel anywhere in Brazil, every open fair, dozens of snack bars, and even fancy restaurants with their gourmet version of it. Pastel usually is made in a rectangular shape with a thin dough. There are so many different stuffings. But the most consumed are minced meat with cheese, a pizza flavor that contains cheese, olive, tomato, and chicken with soft cheese. Like everything in Brazil, you can also find the sweet version of this. Which usually comes stuffed with chocolate, dulce de leche, Romeo and Juliet (guava paste with white cheese). I'm certain you will find a dish on this list that you will like. There are so many flavors and different options for all of these suggestions that it is impossible not to find one that suits your tastes. There are still other things worth trying like: the Açai, French Fries, and the Brazilian version of Yakisoba, but we will leave that for another time.

786,10 Fiery Red Spicy Chicken Curries of India,food," Mallika is a content writer and a foodie who loves her native Indian cuisine. She enjoys exploring the cuisine and sharing it with others. Indian chicken curry google Indian cuisine is the home to numerous authentic spicy and hot non-vegetarian dishes and some are renowned chicken dishes in the subcontinent and outside. The alluring fiery red colour in the nonvegetarian dishes results from different spice combinations with red chillies that is one of the natural colouring agents of the cuisine. A spicy nonvegetarian curry or gravy should have that fiery red appealing look that makes the dish, mouth-watering for spice lovers. This article presents information(not elaborate recipes) about 10 authentic regional chicken curries of India that are fiery red in appearance and spicy hot in taste. Note: The definition of curry in the Indian context is different from the western definition and idea which has the usage of typical ""curry powder"". In Indian cuisine that curry powder is not used in the recipes. Different curries have different spice combinations and vary in the preparation and cooking technique. Let's see the fiery red hotty dishes which made their way into the list(the list is made from geographical south of India to north)... Kundapur Koli saaru google Regional cuisine: Kundapur; Karnataka cuisine Best paired with: Ragi mudde, steamed rice, ghee rice etc. Kundapur, known as the land of jasmine is a coastal town in the Udupi district of Karnataka state.

The Portuguese Chacuti is brownish but Goan Shagoti is reddish due to the use of local fiery dry red chillies(also known as gavti chilly) with white poppy seeds and fresh coconut. The coconut is roasted differently. The coconut kernel is mildly roasted directly on the stove and cooled. It is grated and lightly toasted and used in the masala paste. In some recipes, chicken is marinated with a green paste called harvo masala consisting of ginger, garlic, green chillies, fresh coriander, black pepper, lemon juice and salt. The chicken is cooked in coconut oil, onions and the native masala paste. Masala Paste ingredients: 1 tablespoon coconut oil for roasting the spices, dry gavti red chillis, coriander, fennel seeds, poppy seeds, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, star anise, garlic pods, onions and coconut. A peppy dish that brings a Goan beach party into your homes!

Kolhapuri chicken google Regional cuisine: Kolhapur; Maharashtrian cuisine Best paired with: Rice, roti, bhakri/jowar roti Kolhapuri chicken is one of the iconic chicken curries of Indian cuisine and known for its beautiful fiery red colour. It is originated in the Kolhapur region in Maharashtra state. The famous Kolhapuri masala powder is the most important ingredient in the recipe.

Chicken is lightly marinated with salt, turmeric powder and ginger-garlic paste and cooked in oil, onions, tomato puree(optional) along with the masala powder and garnished with fresh coriander leaves. The queen of all Indian chicken curries(in my view)! Rayalaseema natukodi pulusu google Cuisine: Rayalaseema; Andhra cuisine Best paired with: Ragi sangati, steamed rice, Jowar roti, alasanda vada/blackeyed beans vada It is a very popular dish from the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh state.

Murgir lal jhol google Cuisine: Bengali Best paired with: piping hot rice Murgir lal jhol means chicken red curry and it is a Sunday special dish as in Bengali cuisine, fish is consumed daily and chicken and mutton are cooked on Sundays. Jhol means thin or soupy gravy because very few spices are used and thick gravy doesn't form in the curry. Chicken is marinated with dry red chilly paste or powder, ginger garlic paste, salt and lemon juice and cooked along with potatoes in mustard oil. Spices like bay leaf, Bengali garam masala and seasoning ingredients- salt, sugar and ghee are used. The red colour in the curry is due to the breaking of emulsion when water is added to the curry for thin gravy and due to the absence or less quantity of masala powders like coriander powder, cumin powder etc. While simmering the curry, the emulsion breaks and the oil rises to the top bringing the fiery red colour due to red chillies. Bengali garam masala: Coarsely crushed cloves, green cardamom and cinnamon. A perfect dish for a Sunday brunch! Raja mircha chicken google Cuisine: Nagaland; North Eastern Best paired with: steamed rice Even though this dish is prepared with very few ingredients(according to the authentic recipe), it has a unique taste and the world-famous ghost pepper aka Bhut jolokia chilly or raja mircha. The other two native spices-dry bamboo shoot and Sichuan peppercorns/mejenga seeds are used in the recipe. The local chicken is cooked with oil, onions, bhut jolokia paste or raja mircha/naga chutney, roasted and crushed dry bamboo shoot and Sichuan peppercorns. Dry bamboo shoots are used as a spice in North Eastern cuisine. Bhut jolokia paste: A paste of Bhut jolokia chillies, ginger, garlic and vinegar. Naga chutney: A paste of Bhut jolokia chillies, tomato, garlic and salt. A daredevil dish with tribal flavours!

787,What is Black Coffee? Pros & Cons of Black Coffee with Benefits,food," This article describes the benefits of black coffee, how to make it, and its advantages and disadvantages. Black coffee is the simplest and oldest coffee based drink. Black coffee is also known as cafe noir or drip coffee and it has an astonishingly wide variety of methods to brew it. It can be boiled, steeped or pressurized. Unsurprisingly, brewing coffee by boiling was the earliest method. Even today authentic Turkish coffee is made using this method. So when exactly did humans start drinking coffee? Because drinking coffee goes centuries back it is not easy to pinpoint where, when and how it was first consumed. According to one legend it was discovered in the 9th century in the region of Kaffa in Ethiopia. Another legend from Yemen states that coffee was used by Sheikh Omar to survive when he was exiled. However, the earliest credible evidence of drinking coffee similar to the way we do takes us to 15th century Yemen in southern Arabia. In sufi shrines coffee beans were first roasted and then brewed. The coffee allowed the sufis to concentrate and reach what we can see as a spiritual exaltation. As the sufi’s travelled they introduced coffee to the rest of the world. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe. While black coffee may be the simplest of all coffees there is still a lot of difference in how it is made in different countries. Some European cafes may serve an extended espresso shot as black coffee whereas in the USA that would be referred to as an Americano while black coffee would only mean drip coffee. Even within drip coffee there are many ways of preparation.

Just Raspberries For Interest Well, an ideal Keto diet would be a customized meal plan, which works in favor of your body type and helps you control your body's weight, glow, strength, resistance, immunity and beauty too. Yes, your diet affects your personality too. Now, the medical explanation would be - A healthy ketogenic diet should consist of about 75% fat, 10-30% protein and no more than 5% or 20 to 50 grams of carbs per day. Focus on high-fat, low-carb foods like eggs, meats, dairy and low-carb vegetables, as well as sugar-free beverages. A keto diet is a low carb and high fat diet that is beneficial for those looking to lose weight and increase metabolic rate. This diet has increasingly become popular due to the fast results it delivers. In this diet, your consumption of carbohydrates should be less than the consumption of fats. These fats are healthy fats which your body will then use to convert into energy and increase your metabolic rate and consequently boost your activity.Ketones are produced from the fats broken down in the liver. They help in releasing energy, which the body would otherwise get from glucose released by carbohydrate sources. When ketones are produced in the body, the body enters a state of ketosis, wherein your body is completely fueled by fat. When your metabolic rate increases, your body tends to burn fat more efficiently.

795,Pumpkin and Red Bean Paste Ice Cream Recipe,food," Red bean paste has long been one of my favorite flavors to play around with in desserts. It is wonderfully flexible and matches with a huge number of flavors - I've put it with chocolate, with cherry, with pumpkin, with white chocolate, with butterscotch, the list goes on and on. It also has the great feature of being great in ice cream, and so I decided to once more combine pumpkin and red bean paste in an ice cream recipe - and what a success it is! The pumpkin gives it an initial taste of pumpkin pie, but then it has this wonderfully sweet and fruity red bean paste flavor which pervades it, mingling the two together. In this version I also added in chopped walnuts which give a very nice crunch to it, but then these are hardly necessary and if one doesn't like nuts or if one wants the smoothness of the ice cream alone, it is perfectly fine to leave them out. As a total size, it makes around 2 quarts of ice cream I would say. It's also great for making extra egg whites, if you love making egg white recipes like angel food cake! This recipe is entirely my own, but is based on my ice cream for cherry and red bean paste."

804,How to Make the Best Gelato at Home,food," Ryan has been an online writer for over a decade and loves to share and educate. andischatz Gelato is an Italian frozen dessert that's basically a slight variant of ice cream. Its consistency is dense and silky but relies on the same ingredients and method as its French counterpart. Because gelato shares a lot in common with ice cream, it can throw many who experienced it for the first time for a loop. In this guide, we'll unpack what gelato is, how it compares to ice cream, and how to make our very own at home. Both gelato and ice cream are made from a custard base. A custard is basically any liquid that's thickened with egg yolks (or whole eggs for other frozen dessert types). The formula for a custard consists of milk/cream + sugar + yolks + flavoring. They are both prepared over a stove, then cooled down and churned in an ice cream maker. The milk/cream is heated over the stove in a double boiler or just a saucepan. While that's happening, the sugar is combined with the yolks in a bowl to form a thickener called a sabayon. Next, the sabayon is tempered (its internal temperature is raised slowly) by adding some of the heated milk/cream to it while whisking and is all then thrown back into the saucepan with the remainder to form the custard. Once the custard reaches the right temperature for pasteurization (185°F or 85°C) and is thick enough to coat surfaces, it's ready to be removed from the heat. From there, it's rapidly cooled over an ice bath before it's churned and chilled simulataneously in an ice cream maker. The churning breaks up any ice crystals that form and incorporate air to produce a light and smooth dessert. Gelato differs from ice cream in three ways: The formula's ingredient ratio, the churned speed, and the way it's served. Firstly, gelato is made with less sugar, egg yolks, and cream. In fact, a typical recipe has almost no yolks and cream in it, resulting in a dessert with more milk solids. While the omission of yolks is optional, the amount of cream is determined by the FDA for its butterfat percentage. By American law, gelato can only contain 4-9% butterfat while ice cream and other frozen dairy desserts can contain 10-25% butterfat, though it's usually 14-20%. The Italian dessert is also churned much slower than its French counterpart. In fact, the former contains 20-30% air while other desserts have 50-70%. Because of the lack of butterfat and air in the recipe, it has a far denser texture compared to other frozen desserts. Although some might not like the lack of cream and air in the formula, there are benefits for others. The fat tends to mask some of the flavors by coating them while the air can thin them out. Hence, these deficiencies help to produce a much smoother, richer, and creamier dessert. For better results, adding yolks to the formula will increase the creaminess. Lastly, the gelato must be allowed to soften up a bit at room temperature for a few minutes before serving. This is the one real downside since the dessert is denser than most frozen desserts. Hence, it's mandatory to do so. Add yolks: Yolks can be used to stabilize the gelato and enrich its flavor. Although they are optional, this recipe will benefit from them. Use a double boiler: When cooking the custard, it's safer to use a double boiler to ensure the custard doesn't curdle under too much heat. Alternatively, a heat-resistant bowl can be placed over a saucepan half-filled with boiling water can be used. Use a thermometer: Use this to check the custard's temperature when cooking. No more or less than 185°F/85°C. Cooling the custard: Once the custard is cooked, the saucepan should be placed over an ice bath. Make sure to have plenty of ice and a large enough bowl or container. Churning the custard: Prepare the gelato according to the instructions included with the ice cream maker. Soften before use: Before serving, the frozen gelato must be allowed to soften up for 10 to 15 minutes at room temperature after its taken out of the freezer. If it's too soft, just put it back in the freezer for 5 minutes or so. Storage: The gelato can be stored in a freezer for up to one month. Make sure the container is sealed properly. Yes, any flavor can be substituted for the vanilla in this recipe especially fruit flavors. Some variations include, chocolate, strawberry, blueberry, raspberry, citris, pistachio, mint, etc. hojene Prep time: 15 min | Cook time: 40 min Freeze time: 3 hrs  Total: 4 hrs Yields: 12 people © 2021 Ryan Fanus Ryan Fanus (author) from Bridgetown on April 30, 2021: Thanks.

We have already mentioned how to cook rice in an aroma rice cooker. The same goes for cooking vegetables. You will follow the exact step by step method to cook it. But instead of pressing the ""White Rice"" or ""Brown Rice"" button, you will tap on the ""Steam/Cook"" button. That's all the difference you will notice. Cleaning an aroma rice cooker isn't a challenging task — in fact, it is a fun and smart thing you will love to do. Before cleaning your aroma rice cooker, you want to be 100% sure that it isn't connected to the power source. Let the kitchen appliance cool down completely if you just cooked something a while ago.

Make sure not to pressure excessively — you may damage the quality of the inner container. After washing it, rinse and wash it with clean water. And then wipe it with fresh fabric. It is better to clean the lid underneath each time you cook something on the rice cooker. Separate the cover's interior part from the shaft by delicately pulling it towards the outside and keeping it in a water container to wash it concisely. Then, first, wipe it with a moist fabric and use a dry cloth to make it dry by rubbing the lid. When it becomes fully try, put the lid back to the cooker. Make sure the heating plate is completely cool before you want to clean it. Use a moist fabric to rub the surface of the heating plate and avoid pressuring aggressively.

811,Homemade & Healthy Carrot Cake Recipe,food," I am a pastry chef. My passion is baking mouthwatering sweet treats and desserts. Everybody loves to enjoy and to eat a mouthwatering dessert cake regularly, but since most of them aren't healthy, we shouldn't. This super light carrot cake is the solution for our problem. Since it doesn't have butter or heavy ingredients, it's super easy to digest & doesn't have that many calories as a chocolate cake. Of course, this doesn't mean that a carrot cake is less delicious, as a matter of fact, this carrot cake is mouthwatering delicious. Once it's in the oven and you start to smell the aroma's, you will start to long for a piece. I personally like to add a little bit of cream on top of the cake. This can be whipped cream, a homemade vanilla pudding, a delicious mascarpone cream or any other type of cream. I hope you will love this carrot cake as much as I do!  15 min 45 min 1 hour Serves up to 10 people People tend to believe that the carrot cake was discovered in a period where food was scarce, but that's not the truth. In the 19th century the rich Elite loved the carrot cake. People found recipe books of luxury kitchens in French villa's with recipes of carrot cakes in there. But humans started to eat carrot cakes a much longer time ago. According to historians, the modern carrot cake has descended from Medieval carrot puddings. As sugar & sweeteners were difficult and expensive to come by in England, people used carrots as sugar substitute. The oldest carrot cake recipe that has been found dates back to the 13th century. At that time cakes were more like enriched types of flat bread. The bread was often enriched with eggs or fats. The ancient Romans also made types of enriched bread, that looked more like cakes. But for them it always was 'normal' bread. Over time this 'carrot pudding' changed as the kitchen evolved. Ovens as we know them were invented, the carrot pudding became dryer and the cake became lighter and had more flour and fat in it. Piece by piece bakers improved the recipe to get the carrot cake that we know & love today!"

Homemade chocolate chips cookies Chitrangada Sharan Images Baking, cooking, and grilling for the family always gives me pleasure. To look at their joyous smiles, after the food is served to them, is a moment of pure bliss. Baking, however needs precision, besides passion. To see the perfect rise of a cake in the oven, through the glass window, or the touch of a crisp cookie on the outside, while soft inside—These are moments of pure joy and excitement. No pleasure can be as satisfying as, serving your own cooked food to your family. Cookies are wonderful with tea or coffee: Most of you will agree with me, that the Tea time or the coffee time, in the morning or in the evening, are the best times, to be enjoyed with family. The joy is enhanced, if it’s accompanied with fresh, homemade cookies, straight out of the oven. Now, who doesn’t love chocolates? I believe, everyone, young or old, people of all age groups, like everything made with chocolate as one of the ingredients, or part of it, or the whole of it. My family is no different. The cookies are crispy, sweet little desserts, and it has the advantage of portion control. Many people love cookies, but they don’t like eggs. No doubt, including eggs to the cookies, gives it a nice glaze. But, here I will provide two chocolate based cookies, without the eggs, which are equally tasty. 45 min 30 min 1 hour 15 min Serves 5 people Homemade chocolate chunks cookies Chitrangada Sharan images 2 teaspoons cocoa powder, 1 cup chocolate chunks, brown sugar, instead of caster sugar. Follow the same procedure as mentioned above. Add some copped nuts, like cashew nuts, hazel nuts, walnuts, instead of chocolate chips or chunks.

And homemade cookies are the best combination to go with it.

815,"Bars, Bars and More Bars - Three Flavors",food," To start with, do not follow the directions on the box. The recipe is a failed cake recipe. The cake fails and settled into a moderately hard or solid lump. But, so yummy. Oil, egg, cake mix, stir. It's that simple. No water. No mixer. Bake. Frost. Three bowls. 1/2 cup oil in each one. 2 eggs in each. 1 box cake mix. Stir with spoon. No mixer. I used disposable pans so I did not have to keep track of them after the funeral. I sprayed the inside with Pam spray. I had butter flavor. Don't know if it makes a big difference what kind. Oven 350 degrees. 30 minutes. Carrot cake got the extra raw cut carrots and the cup of pineapple tidbits. I added cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. After it cooled, it got cream cheese frosting. The triple chocolate cake mix got a small package of chocolate chips and strawberry frosting. The white cake got chocolate chips and no frosting. The cookie recipe card. The white cake mix and the chocolate cake mix got semi-sweet chocolate chips stirred in at the last moment. Use a spreader to move batter to all points in pan. The batter will be like a ball of clay. Bake at 350 for 30 minutes. A toothpick should come out clean. Let cool and when cooled, cover bars with cover that came with pan. Best to not let them dry out too much. Frost when cool. The moisture in the frosting will somewhat hydrate the top of the bars, adhering and drying. The frosting will become slightly firm. Frosting works better when room temperature. Here, 75 degrees. I used the back side, rounded, of a spoon. Smear a glob across the cake. One direction. Get more frosting on spoon. Continue globbing on cake surface. Do not rub. If cake pulls off, come back to that spot later. All spread evenly in pan. Protect counter top with board. All 3 pans in oven. Baking sheets underneath for support. 30 minutes. Test cake doneness with toothpick. No batter, it is done. Char Milbrett (author) from Minnesota on April 24, 2021: Louise, I see that Walmart doesn't ship to England, but they are named something else over there. Asda.  But, even at that, they had vanilla buttercream, but no creamy cream cheese frosting. (...land sakes, how do you choke down carrot cake without it???) Smile. I did notice that if you wanted to create some homemade, it's butter, cream cheese, vanilla and confectioners sugar... Louise Powles from Norfolk, England on April 24, 2021: I must say, it does look lovely.  When I read the cream cheese, I was thinking like of savoury cream cheese.  I'm in England and have never come across creamy cheese frosting before."

818,Oven Baked Chicken Kiev on a Bed of Vegetables Recipe,food," Chicken Kiev is such a guilty pleasure, with its deep fried, or at least intensely fried, breaded chicken breasts, oozing out melted butter. But perhaps not as much melted butter as I might hope, or perhaps the fact that it oozes out at all says something about my ability to close up and contain the butter, for I am not, in my opinion, the best Chicken Kiev chef! I find it tremendously difficult to ensure that they are properly sealed, and I feel guilty about the butter that leaks out. This raises the question... what if this butter could not simply not be wasted, but actually put to a use? It is a somewhat common technique in cooking to put meat, particularly dark meat chicken, to cook over either vegetables or potatoes, so that the fat renders out onto the delicious foods below. I wanted to copy this with Chicken Kiev, and I think it worked splendidly! The chicken still has its wonderfully rich flavors of herbs and the moistness of the butter, but the butter which leaks out flavors the vegetables below, making them savory and complex. Furthermore, it is less messy, without the need to fry the chicken for a long time, or even to fry it at all - although still, the process of breading the chicken alone tends to be a terrible chore! Don't let that deter you from making this excellent, holistic meal, whose parts work together so well to make a great high quality meal which uses every scrap. This recipe is my own, and is based on a previously published recipe for Chicken Kiev of mine. Ryan Thomas (author) from Eureka, California on April 23, 2021: Thank you, I hope that if you make it it lives up to your hopes! Devika Primić from Dubrovnik, Croatia on April 23, 2021: RyanCThomas, Wow! This is a wonderful idea to bake chicken. Your recipe has everything of goodness and taste in it. I like this recipe."
819,13 Delicious Red Bean Paste Dessert Ideas,food," Korean chefs at work with red bean paste Junho Jung Red bean paste doesn't sound like the sweet dessert that it is, and when people hear of it they tend to think of savory ingredients, like the famous red beans and rice dishes. But it is actually quite the specialty of East Asian desserts historically, with red beans made into a mash, and then pureed and sugar added into them, to make a sweet and wonderfully flexible dessert ingredient. One of the great things about red bean paste is how it can be paired with almost anything! Well...... maybe not everything, I shudder to thing about it with mayonnaise, ketchup, soy, savory flavorings. But with dessert ingredients, I have found that it is probably at least as versatile as chocolate. In fact, chocolate is one of the things which goes the best with it, as the two complement each other wonderfully, with the richness of the chocolate and the sweet fruitiness of the red bean paste merging and producing an even better flavor. But butterscotch, white chocolate, cherry, pumpkin - all of these have worked very well with it. There is such a tremendous flexibility, that I thought it would be interesting to present 13 different ways, unusual ones (I hope) of using red bean paste - different flavor fusions, different recipes instead of the traditional mixture of pastries, soups, wrapped bamboo leaves, sesame balls, pancakes, and gelatins. It really is just the tip of the ice berg I think: I've been thinking of dessert pizza red bean paste, angel food cake with layers of red bean paste, red bean paste biscotti, nougat, and other flavor fusions such as red bean paste and date. But that's for another day! I get my red bean paste from either a local Japanese store, or ordering it online, on Amazon, where it comes in packets of around 1 pound of smooth, sweetened, red bean paste. Thus, most of the recipes below are geared to use around 1 pound of red bean paste. Different portion sizes of course, are easy to get with different amounts of the red bean paste I'm sure! I also recommend, if you are making the cherry red bean paste, to make first the bbangs and sesame balls in tandem: these both have the advantage of using up around 1/2 of the red bean paste, since each one also has cherry in it (the same goes for the cherries too). Or you could double them. It is possible to get the red beans themselves and to make them into the paste, but honestly I have never looked for them in stores so I don't know if the adzuki beans are easily available, and the paste which one gets in bags works great anyway! According to some youtube comments I saw on this video however, kidney beans work completely fine as a substitute however. Of course, one of the best uses for red bean paste is as a filling. It is perfect to go into many things, since its smooth texture is a great contrast with the surrounding bread or pastry, it is easy to fit in to things since it doesn't explode out, and it of course, has the luscious and wonderful taste! Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and other chefs have worked wonders over the years on making various pastries, so most of the recipes here are fusion recipes, focusing on combing red bean paste with other things, or Western-style desserts, such as French Madeleines. Do you ever remember going to Chinese restaurants as a kid and getting those chewy sesame balls, with their filling of some sort of mysterious dark, almost pudding, like material? Bean paste of some sort, but you didn't know at the time, all you knew was that it was sort of like chocolate, but not quite, but still so deliciously rich, chewy, fragrant, succulent, with such a glorious explosion of flavors once you finished biting through the glutinous exterior. This recipe brings back some of the joy of those old days, but with the equally great combination of cherry and red bean paste. I think that strawberry would also be a great fruit to pair with red bean paste, but then almost any fruit would go well - maybe some sort of red bean paste, banana, and cherry banana split at some point? For a long time these were one of my family's favorite dessert pastries, and it is easy to see why - they are simply sublime fresh out of the oven, warm, with the sweet red bean paste, not overwhelmingly sweet, elegant, sophisticated. Mixing red bean paste with cherry is an original twist, but I do urge you to try out the original recipe linked in Aeri's Kitchen in my own article too. I always loved making haystacks, and these haystacks continue the great virtues of the original Christmastime treat - sweet, crunchy, with a delicious mixture of flavors. Red bean paste might hardly be a traditional Christmas dessert, but I can think of plenty of things which could go with it - haystacks of course, but what about fudge, cookies, roll cakes, tarts, pies, etc? Someday I will really have to try it with peppermint or just mint, but I refrain from theorizing about how it will be! There's also a simpler version if you want it, just the red bean paste and chocolate, rather than red bean paste, white chocolate, and butterscotch. I still think it is very good, and it certainly makes for an interesting variation off of regular haystack themes. Maybe you could make different types for comparing and contrasting, tasting the fruity and almost earthy flavors of the red bean paste with other haystacks with chocolate. Madeleines are another thing which I tried out, and to be fair, just like the other ones, I think the sky is your limit for creativity - I could easily see red bean paste and cherry, red bean paste and pumpkin, red bean paste and coconut, red bean paste and chocolate, red bean paste and white chocolate and butterscotch, red bean paste and strawberry - the great thing is that almost anything works! But one can also just enjoy the flavor of red bean paste on its own in these little French cookies, enjoying their buttery goodness with the red bean paste as well. Of course, red bean paste also goes wonderfully in some other food types, and I have found that ice cream in particular is one of them, Red bean paste is great because it is smooth, creamy, and it can be easily put in with many flavors. Simply melting it a bit with other ingredients from chocolate, to white chocolate, to butterscotch, to cherry, - I really must try pumpkin one of these days - gets you some great results, bursting with flavor, rich, and deliciously smooth. I am always too impatient with my recipes, since while I am willing to put plenty of time in, I like speed and dash when cooking. Ice cream is simply not something which you can rush though, and when I had rushed this one I had boiled the custard and made it entirely too soft! This is easy to avoid of course, but when I made it in this, it actually turned out quite good: soft serve, almost like a mousse, and still with the delicious pairings of white chocolate, butterscotch, and red bean paste, which mix together wonderfully. Cherry is one of my favorite flavor pairings with red bean paste, since just like chocolate, the two go so wonderfully well together. This ice cream is very good at taking advantage of it, making a fruity, but incredibly decadent and rich, creamy, and deeply satisfying ice cream. It would be very good with frozen cherries in it too I think Red bean paste and chocolate were the original flavor pairing that I tried, and I think they work great together - the red bean paste gives sweet fruitiness, and a relief from chocolate which is heavy and almost harsh in how strong its flavor is, and the two together become an even better mixture of the two. This means that it is a perfect duo for chocolate and red bean paste ice cream! Much of the same logic applies to custards, and are a real area where original innovation can be made with red bean paste. After all, crème brûlées, pots de crème, rich puddings - these are far removed from what traditional East Asian cooking produces, and yet just like ice cream they soak up the flavor and the smoothness of red bean paste with panache! Red bean paste and pumpkin seems to be a common enough flavor pairing in East Asian countries, or at least I have seen red bean paste and pumpkin pancakes. It makes sense: the wonderful cinnamon flavor of the pumpkin with the red bean paste, a heady elixir of spices. This version goes for making pots de crème, but it would be easy to make red bean paste and pumpkin into any host of different desserts - red bean paste and pumpkin ice cream, red bean paste and pumpkin crème brûlées, red bean paste and pumpkin cheesecake - the sky truly is your limit! Pots de crème are not as famous as their crème brûlée counterparts, but that doesn't make them any worse - in fact, I sometimes think they are even better, with a more creamy interior, without any impairment from the crunchy top. And of course, you easily could make it into a crème brûlée - it is as easy as taking out a blow torch or putting it under the broiler in the oven for a few minutes. Wonderfully cream, sweet, and decadent, these are elegant and tasty desserts, and show another way you can use red bean paste. What if you want something that is more physical, solid, and more glamorous and impressive than just pastries or cookies though? There is no need to fear, since red bean paste goes perfectly in a wide variety of cakes, pies, and brownies! Cakes give a great opportunity to contrast the flavor with various other ones, such as cherry, chocolate, and whipped cream, while the brownies are a real improvement over regular chocolate brownies - lighter, fluffier, still deliciously sweet and rich, and even with the delusion that they are somewhat healthy! I've heard of a few brownie recipes that use red bean paste to fill in for chocolate, probably for the people who are health conscious, or those who genuinely don't like chocolate - who do exist! I have a co-worker who genuinely despises chocolate, although her mother always forgets this despite having known about it for decades. But what about for the rest of us who do like chocolate? Combining together red bean paste and chocolate gives the wonderful fusion flavor that I've talked about elsewhere, with these light, fluffy, and decadent brownies. Red bean pancakes are one of the traditional uses for red bean paste in East Asia. I think they're a great idea - simple to make, large quantities, deliciously sweet, wonderful to pair with lots of flavors. Here, going with chocolate and cherry means that although they are difficult to make, they are a wonderful treat. I think that for any sort of layer cake these red bean pancakes are a great option, since they are infinitely flexible and can be put in many different recipes. Ahh, cheesecake. Such a great dessert, so smooth, so rich, so decadent. I have trouble making them I admit and I am always working to get better at them, since I find that mine often have some problems with texture, as well as cooking them in the oven, after the initial cheesecakes which I made a few years ago with such success lulled me into a feeling of false security. But this cheesecake is one which I urge for you to try since it has a wonderful decadent chocolate flavor to it with a rich fruity upswelling from the red bean paste. It is another way to put you red bean paste to work, and once more the sky is the limit for red bean paste ingredients in cheesecakes!"

Ahhh, these eggs look so lovely. and now you are stunned enough, (not with a Stun Gun either) to even ask a question such as this one. It's fine. No worries, or those I don't know about, but I did ask a fitting question in this day of things that are celebrated, then given their own TV special with Luke Bryan or Matthew Perry . . .hosting the two-hour event. But let's give Perry a break. He is now unemployed, but not without a ""can you spare a dime, sir?"" If he watches his endless-scratch, he will live to a very old guy. And in all fairness, Bryan is still employed on the Big Stage, selling-out arena's, stadiums, and recording studios, so he ain't hurting. Oh, let's not forget the ""I'm With Luke Bryan,"" tee's sold in the concession area for no less than $45.00 each, plus tax. Country Music, if we had one, would be a great place for raw talent. This is all I want to say. But what about eggs? What can we really say about eggs? Besides being one of the most-versatile food items, they can go shell-in-shell with any dinner entree. Meat-loaf;, Prime Rib Roast, Steaks, well, eggs were created for more than eye dressing. They were created for their wonderful protein shots that they possess.I will confess that in my drinking days far ago, there has been more than a few hang-overs that a couple of raw eggs and some tobasco sauce put me back in the pink. No joke. Of course, I give credit to God for ""making everything that was made,"" John, Chapter 1.I should have seeking my Eternal God on nights where I just couldn't drink like my five buddies, so I did what any good drinker does . . he drinks until he goes to sleep. But thanks too for the eggs and did I eat the shells you wonder? Guess! Because I really don't know. Back to my sub-head, which is more important, egg shells or the Golden Gate Bidge? I'm going to take egg shells for the simple reason of if eggs had not helped the thousands of workers who built this mammoth bridge, then the opening date would have been several weeks, maybe months to go. Ahh, the good old egg. America's food staff. Sing a song of fresh eggs and we will all go to sleep. you ask? There you again asking simple questions, but I do not frown on your curiosity. In fact I love it when I ask things to myself and then there are the times that what I ask about a certain thing, then I panic because I did not know my answer. Guess that I need to eat a lot more eggs that I have been eating, eh? With eggs, good old eggs, one can make: Meat loaf; Cake frosting; Fried eggs; Boiled eggs; Poached eggs; Painted Easter eggs; Eggs in biscuits; Potato salad (with mustard, yes!); Egg-Fu-Young; Eggs - sunny-side up; on toast; Scrambled; and the lengthy list could not be written here. My point. Eggs are not afraid of any food, domestic or foreign. Eggs can take-on all comers and win without gloating. I believe that good ole eggs need to be nominated as the Nation's Favorite Food. But what about mom's apple pie? Well, I've never thought about an egg going with apple pie or not, so I guess the good old eggs could be America's Second-Favorite Food. And if there is something that goes wrong and mom's apple pie cannot hold the position that it has held for years, then the egg, the good ole egg is more than able to step-up and save our nation from shame and ridicule. As for how or if eggs would find success in the field of sports, I can only find one: Curling. Instead of gently-pushing the 42-pound stone down the ice, a raw, unbroken egg would do great. The guy who wants to make points will be able to push the egg a bit more gentle and the stress value will be less for him. But the two guys who use brooms to clean the ice rolling down the egg, had better pay attention for the possibility of the egg being brushed from the ice. Now. If this succeeds, should this change from stone to egg, be ""Egging?"" What about ""Shelling?"" It could work. The sports where eggs would not do well are: Football; Baseball (especially baseball); Egg toss (not Javelin throw); Shooting Clay Targets is a definiely train-wreck. Eggs never claimed to be eveyrone's love interest on a hot July night riding in a '56 Ford Crown Vic convertible sipping beer with ""Johnny Chunk,"" the main bully of the local high school. No. Eggs do have a reputation to guard. ""I do not think that (I) know a lot, but there is one thing that I do know . ..and that is sometimes a short hub makes the best reading."" — Kenneth Avery Now tell me that eggs with these side-items are not delicious. could be and this item was produced wita heap of thinking (e.g. Buddy Ebsen aka/""Jed Clampett). Let us pretend that Old St. Nick is making his yearly-visits to deliver gifts world-wide. Then he visits this one home where one kid lives with his parents, who have spoiled him to the bone. ""Little Smucky Smuckins,"" seven, runs from his bed screaming Get up! It's Christmas. But then, he sees a big Christmas stocking ""which were hung by the chimney with care,"" (Clement Clarke Moore), and speeds to see what Santa has left for him. Then tragedy strikes. Smucky reaches into his big stocking only to find is one white egg. Not two. Not a dozen, but one egg. That's it. He cries so loud that he wakes every neighbor in the community and some summon the cops for disturbing our holiday nap. Like a master play-wright, this next few seconds happen like clockwork. Smucky takes his one egg and stops to make a choice of two things: to smash the egg against the wall of the lavish living room or just stomp it with his (big) stocking feet. A dilemma for sure. Until now, no one even to 2021, can find the answer. A classic case of which came first, the egg or the wall? Uhhh, the floor?

823,21 Simple Cooking Tips for Better Cooking,food," A homemaker mixing some ingredients and turning them into delicious recipes with a lot of nutritional value. Recipes are very simple to try. Regardless of whether you're a reluctant fledgling or a quintessential expert, each and every individual who goes to a kitchen needs an update on the essentials at times. Here, I am going to walk you through the cooking tips that completely changed my cooking and will change yours, as well. At the point when a recipe requires a ""zest"" of a citrus fruit, it's alluding to the beautiful external piece of the skin, not the inward white part. The zest contains the entirety of the fragrance, citrus oils and gives a trace of citrus tang to the recipe. A straightforward technique for getting a fine zest  is by scouring the fruit against the littlest openings of a cheese grater. Great cooks are never hesitant to go little away from a recipe and add their own energy and make the recipe their own. At whatever point you make a replacement or expansion, make sure to take notes so you can recollect next time if you enjoyed the change and enjoy it again. Butter is accessible as both salted and unsalted. The salt is added for additional flavor and to help safeguard it so it has a more extended time span of usability. The issue is that occasionally the salt in spread can be an excess. Picking unsalted butter gives you more power over how much salt you need in your dish. When you use salted butter in any dish its better to discard around ¼ teaspoon of salt per ½ cup (one stick) of butter utilized in that recipe. At this moment you presumably just utilize your kitchen scissors for opening bundling and packs of milk. In any case, whenever you're opening your pitas or cutting chicken into strips to make your favorite recipe, think about utilizing your scissors! Culinary specialists use them all the ideal opportunity for cutting meats and other food things. It's most likely best to have a pair of scissor that is assigned as food scissors only. What's more, be certain you clean them very well after each utilization since they do have fissure where microbes can stow away. Nothing is seriously irritating when you're prepared to begin cooking but you can't fine your recipe. Make sure to keep a system to keep your recipes handy in your kitchen. so, when you need them you can find them easily. one of the option to keep the record of your recipes is to purchase a photo album with sticky sheet so you can paste the recipes in there or another thing you can do is keep a clipping file in which you save your recipes, this way you can easily add or remove any recipe. To hold food back from sticking to the lower part of your skillet, try not to at any point put cold food into a hot pan. Additionally, don't place food into a pan that isn't completely clean, in that case that may lead to food sticking to the pan and burn. To hold skillet back from bubbling over when cooking, add a slight layer of butter around the edge of the container. This trick perfectly works for pasta, rice and potatoes. When you boil the eggs do their whites ooze out? It happens because eggs have a air pocket at its rounded end and we place them in hot water that air pocket expands and as result it creates pressure in the egg which is more than the water it is placed in. Inside pressure make the egg shell crack resulting in oozing of the egg. This problem can be avoided by piercing the egg with the pin from larger end of the egg. It will give the air inside the egg a way to escape. To cut cakes and bread you will probably use knife but there is another option by which you can cut the slice perfectly every time, which is dental floss. Yes you read dental floss. Dental floss may sound a bit strange but believe me it slices the bread and cake perfectly. It can also be used to layer the cake for filling. You can also freeze the cake for better result. When your recipe requires a citrus juice, be it lemon, lime or orange, get every drop of juice from the fruit. You can get the maximum amount of juice by simply rolling the fruit under your palm on any hard surface. when you roll make sure to press a little hard. After that cut in half and then squeeze it and get the juice out as much as you can. Citrus juice adds so much flavor to the food. It is frustrating to peel the garlic but if you know a little trick that pro use it gets easier. Put a garlic clove on a cutting board and press it hard with a large knife with its flat side. when you press it hard you will hear a pop which means the peel is separated. Another trick is to cut the clove in half and then press it with the flat side of knife. To get rid of garlic smell from your hands try washing them with salt. If an egg cracks when you're boiling them, add a tablespoon off vinegar in the water, it will seal the eggshell. If the egg has start oozing this trick will not work then. Despite not being the healthiest option, there is no doubt fried food is tasty. For perfect frying oil must be hot before putting food into it, but not too much hot that it instantly burns the food. To know whether the oil is hot enough or not put a small piece of what you are going to fry, if it instantly start to bubble; oil is ready. Using a little bread cube is a perfect trick to find out if your oil is hot enough or not. If that piece of  bread browns in a minute, the temperature of oil is between 350 and 365 degrees, in 40 seconds – 365 and 382 degrees, in 20 seconds – 382 and 390 degrees. You can also use a thermometer but make sur it is of metal and it is designed for the purpose of deep frying. What if your recipe demand an egg but you're all out of eggs? There's nothing to worry because eggs can be substituted with real mayonnaise. Substitute for a large egg is two tablespoon of real mayonnaise. Have you heard that apples should be stored separately from other vegetables and fruits? Yes they should. It is because they release some gases which speed up the process of ripening of other vegetables and fruits. Sometimes these gasses are also useful as the help your potatoes from sprouting Homemade soup may have fat on the top but you can remove it by putting four to five ice cubes in the soup. The fat will stick to ice cubes which you can remove easily. this process may cool down the temperature of soup but you can reheat it afterwards. Pre-made sandwiches often go soggy when its time to eat them but you can prevent that to happen. Spread mustard, butter or mayonnaise to the edge of the both pieces of bread. After making sandwiches wrap them in plastic rap or waxed paper to prevent sogginess. Or another thing you can do to stop sandwiches from being soggy is to pack bread and fillings separately and assemble them before easting, if it is possible. When you marinate anything the ingredients must include lemon or vinegar. both of these ingredients are acidic in nature and can react to the metal and off-flavors can be caused in your food. Therefore, you should use ceramic or glass containers to marinate your food for better flavoring. Fish and Meat can be marinated in the zip lock bag to avoid bad odor from any other container. Grease splatter can be dangerous specially when it gets to your skin. It can be quite painful. To avoid splattering add little salt to the food which you are about to fry, it can help reduce the splatter. A tip to grate cheese easily is to put it in freezer an hour before you need it. This will make cheese hard to grade easily. Do you want more cooking tips like this?

825,To All the Girls Who Cooked for Me,food," I love food. There is no time or way to explain the reason why. It is like breathing. I think. All I know is that food is great. much less Julio Halegious, Willie Nelson or Rich Little, so do not get confused about my headline. It's catchy. It's hip. A headline that I've searched looked to find for several months. And there it is. I might cry. Things like my headline only come very rarely in (a) lifetime. I still might cry. And I've ever heard Rich Little singing. Yep. I'm in tears. This headline also does not imply that I only dated girls who had a talent for cooking. Athough that might have worked, but my mind was on work, money, and having a lasting relationship with a lovely girl and I would not ask for any strings to be put on her. I was ahead of my own time. The Feminist Movement (Hanoi Jane was still Jane Fonda here) had not really started out, on the Fast Tracks, so my thinking up here was ahead of my time, wouldn't you say? There has come ""this"" time in my life when I just have to unload. If I don't, I just might consume a 10-pound turkey. Hunger and unloading a burden can cause one to get instantly and amazingly hungry. Right! I've went over the ledge. Not even Jenny Craig can help me now, much less Marie Osmond. She is definitely in the running. spill my guts and see where it gets me. Not that I'm an ""Ego Monster,"" it's I can surf page-after-page of great articles written by great, talented writers who are on HubPages, and after I finish reading, I feel really feeling less self-worth than I know the Hub writers feel. But life is what it is. And believe me, this is not a Q&A about ""Advice For The Broken Heart, with Sally Snuggins."" No, sir. This is me. All of me. Rats! Another Red Haired Stranger song. I have learned over the yeas that it takes all kids, colors,and behavioral make-up's to weave the Grand Tapestry of Life, so I should't feel bad because that I'm only a small length of thread. Isn.t it nice how I can self-motivate myself when I begin to feel bad? Saves a ton of scratch. Anyway, let's move on. such as my headline that speaks how I'm givig thanks to all of the girls who cooked for me. Yes, I also include first, my lovely wife Pam, who has yet to cook a dish that I couldn't stand. Then there are the rest. Some girls have cooked things for me that I barely got down (the mark of a tough guy) and then, there are the girls who cooked for me and the dishes almost made me sick. (the mark of a foolish guy).I will tell you as much as I can whiteout going into illicit details. But I will let you in on (some) of the details surrounding my main point: something so mysterious about a pretty girl who is cooking, that it defies logic. In shot, this brand of thinking has no answer that can be talked about in the local country club. So do not read the following and get a painful headache, so speed by the text and the main idea will hopefully stick and then flourishing. There's just something (close to ""an Aqua Velva man,"" commercial) about a dedicated pretty girl who doesn't mind getting a little flour on her new dress in order to take a perfect cake from the oven. See how she beams with happiness? This is one of the things that I love about a pretty girl who loves to cook. of the answer that I seek. Just imagine. There she is, a gorgeous blonde, brunette or Ginger dressed in a nice dress with a white apron standing near her microwave and smiling because she has just cooked a nice bowl of delicious soup. Most men would ""wolf it down"" even though she forgot how to adjust the microwave to 'heat' the soup-- her great looks play a big part in why I, and other guys, are just enamored by her looks, not necessarily how much we measure her cooking ability.But don't discount her personality when it comes to forging a lasting-relationship. But both partners must have working behaviors as well as attitudes. If the girl has obviously-failed at cooking her soup, then does not put herself down, but instantly goes back to start over with the other partner's support, will have a lasting-relationship. Her long blonde, brunette, or Ginger hair will go a long way. Then you have her physical abilities will also figure into my view of a lasting-relationship because I get nervous when a pretty girl stumbles and drops things (that I could have eaten) and sets fire to the microwave, but smiles that smile all during the calamities, well, she can pass my test due to the fact that my compassion came to her aid. did you also realize that if you are blessed to run into a pretty girl who is also an excellent cook, just imagine what you would say if you met a girl like this, and . . .she was so multi-tasked at her cooking talent that she could carry-on an intelligent conversation with you and your brother while you two are sitting her kitchen? I am honest. Some relationships such as this one, can work. I hear that the Harvard School of Medicine is graduating more and more female doctors. So, be patient. Go to a local community college, take a cooking class, and then you will be in gear for when ""she"" walks into your life. So why learn to cook, you ask? Well. In all honesty, when you and ""the"" girl meet and nature takes its course, she will be the first to commit a cooking error, but with your slick tongue, you can slip into the suggestion and both you and her will look great. First there was Patricia, a girl who I worked with. We were fast-friends and when Christmas rolled about, she made the best ""Rice Krispy Treats,"" or something like That. Upon my suggestion, she showed-up and sprung them on me. Oh, yes. She was a bang-up typesetter as we both worked at our local newspaper. Another girl that I loved was Joy. She was our manager. She cooked some ""Pigs in The Poke,"" and I almost ate them up before our Christmas party. This timeframe was during our first crew circa 1977-1978. Another crew I worked with circa 1989 - 1992, and with a great joy, was Rena. She was our accountant and she cooked me a fantastic batch of ""Home-made Sausage Balls,"" and once again, I almost ate the entire batch. (I hate that word, batch. But at this late hour, I just do not care). Then in circa 1993- 1999, a woman named, Christy, one of our reporters, made the best dessert, ""Peppermint Hand-pies,"" and they were so good that I gained over, uhhh, a few pounds. So here's to you . . .Patricia; Joy; Rena and Christy, thank you all sincerely, for all of the work in your kitchens and producing such great dishes for me to eat (much of) them. I will never pay you enough. I cannot forget my lovely Pam, my wife for 45 years and this is what I seriously-believe: God in His infinite wisdom, truly gave her so many gifts, and the MAIN gift, cooking. I can testify to this statement. Just look at the pounds that I have gained. (Thanks, Kenneth.) Maybe the reason that these ""other"" pretty girls loved to cook for me was my devastating nice looks.

I especially enjoy finding recipes in period newspapers. Selecting a Jell-O recipe Jell-O is one of those foods that nearly everyone remembers from childhood. Its history goes back more than 100 years, but when refrigeration became common in 1930s, Jell-O recipes grew in popularity. Once refrigerators began replacing ice boxes in American kitchens, recipes using the new technology were featured in women's magazines. Thus, the Jello salad recipe was born. Jello ""salads"" have been a traditional go-to recipe for tropical summer treats since 1897.

834,Top 10 South Asian Cuisine You Must Try,food," I am from Bangladesh.I love to travel and taste different kind of food. Kala Vuna Kala bhuna is a meat curry made of beef or mutton, originated in Chittagong, Bangladesh.The word kala means black and vuna means deep fry. Kala bhuna is deep fried beef meat ,as the meat goes blackish during a long process of deep frying it with plenty of spices. It has become popular also in other Bangladeshi cities like Sylhet, Khulna,Dhaka etc. Nowadays, this dish is also a favorite delicacy in mezbans, weddings, eids and in sehri or iftar during the time of Ramadan. Usually, Kala bhuna is eaten with plain rice, polao, porota, naan or ruti.  Ingredients Kala bhuna can be made of both beef and mutton, but beef Kala bhuna is more popular. The ingredients used in it are as follows:  beef or mutton chopped and cubed onion ginger garlic chili cumin powder coriander powder cardamom cinnamon clove chilli powder turmeric powder black pepper salt mustard oil gorom moshla nutmeg powder toasted cumin powder  Ema Datshi Ema datshi is among the most famous dishes in Bhutanese cuisine, recognized as a national dish of Bhutan. It is made from hot chili peppers and cheese; ""ema"" means ""chili"" and ""datshi"" means ""cheese"" in the language of Bhutan.  Different varieties of chilies are used to make it,green chili, red chili, or white chili, which may be dried or fresh. The cheese in ema datshi is homemade from the curd of cow or yak's milk. In the process, the fat is removed from the curd to make butter, and the remaining curd without fat is used to make the cheese. After the cheese is made, a watery liquid is left over, which is used as a soup that can be taken with rice. No part of the curd is wasted.everyone should try this dish . Kiribath Kiribath is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from rice. It is prepared by cooking rice with coconut milk, hence this name, and can be considered a form of rice cake or rice pudding. It is very commonly served for breakfast on the first day of each month and also has the added significance of being eaten for any auspicious moment throughout one's lifetime which are marking times of transition. It is one of the more renowned traditional dishes in Sri Lanka. The recipe for Kiribath is fairly simple. The rice is cooked in boiling water for about fifteen minutes, the coconut milk is added and cooked again until the liquid is absorbed. Salt is also added when cooking. However, there are some variations to this where different ingredients are added, such as sesame seeds or cashew. The common method of serving Kiribath is once it has cooled and set on a plate, it is compressed and cut into diamond or square shaped blocks. Historically Kiribath had been cooked in earthen clay pots in firewood hearths, this cooking strategy would confer an interesting flavor to the dish. Pav Bhaji The dish originated as a fast lunchtime dish for textile mill workers in Mumbai.Pav bhaji is a fast food dish from India consisting of a thick vegetable curry served with a soft bread roll. Vegetables in the curry may include potatoes, onions, carrots, chillies, peas, bell peppers, and tomatoes. Its origins are in the state of Maharashtra. Variants of the dish may use other bread varieties such as chapati, roti or brown bread.this food has many variations and tastes.this food is not that much healthy but it is tasty and considered as street food. Phirni We all love dessert after our lunch or dinner.phirni is a kind of dessert of our indian sub continent.The history of phirni origin is still unknown ,but it is believed that phirni hailed from ancient Persia or the Middle East and it’s the Mughals who both invented and introduced it to India. The Mughal Empire relished the regal milk-based dish and made it popular. It is also backed by studies which say that the rich, milky, nutty and aromatic rice pudding in earthen bowls is a Mughal legacy. It is a type of pudding from the Indian subcontinent, made by boiling milk, sugar, and rice, although rice may be substituted with one of the following: bulgur wheat, millet, tapioca, vermicelli, or sweet corn. It is typically flavored with desiccated coconut, cardamom, raisins, saffron, cashews, pistachios, almonds, or other dry fruits and nuts. It is typically served during a meal or as a dessert.everyone must try this food at least one time . Fushka Panipuri or fuchka is a type of snack that originated in the Indian subcontinent, and is one of the most common street foods in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.  Chaat is considered the predecessor of pani puri. According to the culinary anthropologist Kurush Dalal, chaat originated in Northern India (now Uttar Pradesh) during the Mahabharat era.Some says, Draupadi in the Mahabharat impressed her mother-in-law, Kunti, by being able to turn dough for just one puri and some potatoes into pani puri to feed her five husbands. Food historian Pushpesh Pant opines that pani puri originated in North India (around modern-day Uttar Pradesh). He also noted that it probably originated from Raj-Kachori. Someone made a smaller puri and made a pani puri from it. Pani puri spread to the rest of India mainly due to migration of people from one part of the country to another in the 20th century.  Panipuri consists of a round or ball-shaped, hollow puri (a deep-fried crisp flatbread), filled with a mixture of flavored water which is known as imli pani, tamarind chutney, chili powder, chaat masala, potato mash, onion or chickpeas.  Fuchka differs from Panipuri in content and taste. It uses spiced mashed potatoes as the filling. It is tangy rather than sweetish while the water is sour and spicy.  Dosa A Dosa is a thin pancake or roti type food, originating from South India, made from a fermented batter predominantly consisting of lentils and rice. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance, although savoury flavours are generally emphasized (sweet variants also exist). Its main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt, then fermented. Dosas are a common dish in South Indian cuisine, but now have become popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Dosas are served hot along with chutney by tradition and sambar in recent times. Other accompaniments include chutney powder. Dosa making is simple but to do it perfectly is hard . A mixture of rice and black gram that has been soaked in water is ground finely to form a batter. Some add a handful of soaked fenugreek seeds. The proportion of rice to lentils is generally 3:1 or 4:1. The batter is allowed to ferment overnight, before being mixed with water to get the desired consistency. The batter is then ladled onto a hot tava (griddle) greased with oil or ghee (clarified butter). It is spread out with the base of a ladle or bowl to form a pancake. It can be made either to be thick like a pancake, or thin and crispy. A dosa is served hot, either folded in half or rolled like a wrap. It is usually served with chutney and sambar. The mixture of black grams and rice can be replaced with highly refined wheat flour or semolina. Momo Momo is a type of East and South Asian steamed filled dumpling. Momo is native to Nepal, Southwest Tibet, Bhutan as well as Indian Himalayan Region of Ladakh, Sikkim, Assam, and Arunachal Pradesh, and Darjeeling. It is popular across a wider region of the Indian subcontinent. Momo is similar to Chinese baozi, jiaozi, and mantou, Mongolian buuz, Japanese gyoza, Korean mandu and Turkic manti, but heavily influenced by cuisine of the Indian subcontinent with South Asian spices and herbs. Momos are extremely popular and can be found in every kind of shop from restaurants to street vendors.There are typically two types of momo, steamed and fried. Momo is usually served with a dipping sauce locally called chutney , normally made with tomato as the base ingredient. Soup momo is a dish with steamed momo immersed in a meat or vegetable broth. Pan-fried momo is also known as Kothey momo. Steamed momo served in hot sauce is called C-momo. A simple white-flour-and-water dough is generally preferred to make the outer momo covering. Sometimes, a little yeast or baking soda is added to give a more doughy texture to the finished product. Traditionally, momo is prepared with ground/minced meat filling, but in the modern era, this has changed and the fillings have become more elaborate. These days, momo is prepared with virtually any combination of ground meat, vegetables, tofu, paneer cheese, soft chhurpi and vegetable and meat combinations. Shorshe Ilish Shorshe ilish is a Bengali dish, native to the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, made from hilsa or Tenualosa ilisha, a type of herring, cooked in mustard gravy.The dish is popular among the people of Bangladesh where the fish is mainly found and in the neighbouring Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and Assam’s Barak valley.The main ingredients are hilsa, white mustard, mustard, mustard oil, green chili, black cumin, turmeric powder, red chili powder and salt. Lime juice and/or coriander leaves may be added for flavor. The main ingredient Hilsa is known to be “queen of the fish”. It’s a very tasty and rich fish. This is not like other fishes that are available throughout the year. It is only available during monsoon. And this particular season is just celebrating like festivals in every Bengali house.Though it’s so high in price, but Bengali don’t deprive themselves from eating this fish. It became a tradition that Bengali have to eat at least one fish to save their identity.The most important ingredient of this fish preparation is “mustard”. The combination of mustard, onion seeds, green chili and mustard oil with hilsa go really great and bring a very distinct flavor. The usage of spices are very less. Simplicity is the main secret of this exclusive “Sorse Ilish”. Biriyani Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. It is made with Indian spices, rice, and meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, or fish), and sometimes, in addition, eggs and/or vegetables such as potatoes in certain regional varieties.Biryani is popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as among its diaspora. It is also prepared in other regions such as parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq. Ingredients vary according to the region and the type of meat and vegetables used. Meat of either chicken, goat, beef, lamb, is the prime ingredient with rice. As is common in dishes of the Indian subcontinent, vegetables are sometimes also used when preparing biryani. Corn may be used depending on the season and availability. Navratan biryani tends to use sweeter, richer ingredients such as cashews, kismis and fruits, such as apples and pineapples. The spices and condiments used in biryani may include ghee (clarified butter), nutmeg, mace,pepper, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint leaves, ginger, onions, tomatoes, green chilies, and garlic. The premium varieties include saffron. In all biryanis, the main ingredient that accompanies the spices is the chicken or goat meat; special varieties might use beef or seafood instead. The dish may be served with dahi chutney or raita, korma, curry, a sour dish of aubergine (brinjal), boiled egg, and salad.There are different kind of biriyani like tehari,kacchi,bhori biriyani,Delhi biriyani, Haydrabadi biriyani, dhakaiya biriyani. Viet Doan from Big Island, Hawaii on April 17, 2021: Reading your article and looking at the photos, I could almost smell the rich, earthy fragrant of cinnamon, clove, ginger, cumin, cardamom on my computer screen!  Thanks Nirzhor for a wonderful culinary tour of the Indian subcontinent."

837,Betty Crocker Lemon-Lemon Cake Frosted,food," Important. Baking ingredients must be room temperature. I got my eggs out the day before. The oil is stored on my counter, the eggs are stored in refrigerator. I used faucet cold water, but really should have used room temperature water. I added lemon powder to the water for intense lemon flavor. Two of them. The box calls for three eggs. I used four. All the ingredients got mixed together in a large, eight cup measuring cup. I used an electric mixer on mixer speed. Two minutes. The cake pan needed shortening on the bottom only. The oven at 350 degrees. Preheat. Water with lemon powder added to it Pour batter into prepared pan. The cake instructed me to grease bottom only the bottom, not the sides. Into preheated oven. Box says 33 minutes for 13 x 9 pan. The same mix works in other pan types. Set timer. Good idea to tiptoe around while baking... I found too that running the mixer blades in water at a good speed did take the majority of batter off the blades. They still needed to be washed in soap water, but it was a start.

838,Bear Creek Clam Chowder or Potato Soup with Clams,food," I neglected to take a picture of the bowl of soup. Start by melting butter in a large kettle, and sauteing the diced onions while you open the cans of clams and get your water measured up. The recipe on the back of the bag asks for eight cups of water. I didn't do that. I measured up four cups. Yes. I used 4 cups of water and 4 cups of milk. This was added to the browned onions and butter.The mixture needs to heated up on a little bit hotter burner so it can come to a rolling boil. A rolling boil is visually a violent boil.  Add the soup mix to the milk, water, onion mixture. Add Mrs. Dash for extra flavor. A little ground peppercorns. Stir. Add clams. Bring to a boil. Lightly boil for 15 minutes. Mixture thickens. Char Milbrett (author) from Minnesota on April 11, 2021: Louise Powles, thank you for your comment! Louise Powles from Norfolk, England on April 11, 2021: It looks lovely, and easy to make too.

839,The Evolution of Cornbread,food," Margaret Minnicks makes a living by writing online about entertainment, celebrities, books, movies, foods, drinks, health, and spirituality. Cornbread cooked in cast-iron pan Photo via Pixnio I often write about my Southern roots. I grew up in rural Sussex County, Virginia. I am one of ten siblings raised by our mother. All of the siblings had chores to do on designated days. I enjoyed cooking on days when we had certain foods to eat. For instance, it took more time to prepare and cook biscuits from scratch. On the other hand, it was easier to cook cornbread because there were only two ingredients to use. If my turn was on a Friday, I knew I was going to cook cornbread to go along with the fish my mother caught from the neighborhood pond. Those were the days that I learned to cook cornbread the ""poor person's way."" Cooking cornbread is still inexpensive to cook, but the bread has evolved in many different ways from those days when money was scarce. Take a look at how far cornbread has come. I learned to make cornbread with only cornmeal and hot water in a cast-iron frying pan with a little lard or frying meat grease. I didn't have to add anything else. This way of cooking cornbread is as basic as it can get. I later learned from one of my sisters that when it was her turn to cook cornbread she would put a pinch of salt in the batter. Another sister said she would sprinkle both salt and pepper in her mixture. Another sister said when we were low on cornmeal, she would sneak a small amount of flour into her batter to stretch it. None of the siblings tried to give cornbread any particular shape like pancakes. We just poured the batter into a pan with hot grease and let the batter go whichever way it wanted to go. Therefore, some cakes of cornbread turned out to be thicker than others, and no two shapes were ever the same. My family always ate plain cornbread, but I later learned that other ingredients can be added to the hot water cornbread to enhance it. Such ingredients include pork cracklings, jalapeños, bacon bits, crumbled sausage, scallions, cheddar cheese, chile, pepperoni, and spicy shrimp. It sounds strange, but even kernels of corn or creamed corn can be added to cornbread. Corn Muffin Mix Photo via flickr.com One of my sisters recently shared with me that once she found out about Jiffy, she began using it.  Another sister said even though she knows about Jiffy, she still makes cornbread the way she used to make it with hot water, salt, and pepper. She admits that she is ""stuck in the past."" A box of Jiffy Muffin Mix is extremely inexpensive. At one time it cost only 39 cents a box. The price is much higher now, but it is still less than a dollar for a box of the mix. You can purchase it from Walmart and most grocery stores for about 47 cents a box. Jiffy is really a muffin mix that is much lighter in texture than cornbread. Photo via Krusteaz Of all the ways I have made cornbread, my favorite is Krusteaz Honey Cornbread. I can taste a bit of honey in every bite. In fact, I can pick up a square of this cornbread and eat it as a snack without having to eat it with a meal. My oldest sister said she doesn't want to eat honey cornbread. She and my youngest sister favor Jiffy Muffin Mix. Pillsbury Cornbread Swirls Photo via Pillsbury Most people know about Pillsbury Biscuits and Pillsbury Crescent Rolls. However, some people will be surprised to know they can also purchase Pillsbury Cornbread Swirls. This is the quickest, easiest, and laziest way to cook cornbread. There is no preparation time. There is no mess to clean up. There is no recipe to follow. All you have to do is open a can of swirls just as you open a can of biscuits. Just place and bake each swirl in a muffin pan or place them on a baking sheet. The swirls are ready to be served in about 15 minutes. Even though there are only six pre-cut swirls in each package, they are big enough to satisfy. Each swirl contains 170 calories, 7 grams of fat, 430 mg sodium, 5 grams of sugar, 3 grams of protein, 23 grams of carbohydrate, and no cholesterol. The swirls are sweet and light and not as heavy as the cornbread I used to cook with only cornmeal and hot water. Try them to see how you like them. They cost $2.48 at Walmart and about the same at other stores. No matter which way you choose to prepare cornbread, you will love it for its taste, texture and aroma. It is a quick, easy and inexpensive side dish that is so versatile that it can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, dinner and as a snack. Sp Greaney from Ireland on April 11, 2021: It's so interesting to see how a receipe cooked from scratch became so commercialised. It does make things easier for people who want to make cornbread quicker though. The same thing has happened to pancake mix. Margaret Minnicks (author) from Richmond, VA on April 11, 2021: Cheryl, that is a good combination. Cheryl E Preston from Roanoke on April 11, 2021: I’m going to cook some today with brown beans"

842,Review of Liv For Sweets Bakery,food," Audrey writes of high quality foods, local diners, mom-and-pop places, and authentic tastes in the foothills of North Carolina. An assortment of gourmet cupcakes Recently I went to Liv For Sweets to try out some of their locally famous cupcakes and cookies. Liv For Sweets is surprising in every way. It has won numerous local and even state awards, the most recent being Best Cupcake of North Carolina, beating out the established Maxie B’s bakery of Greensboro, NC. You would think Liv For Sweets was in Winston, or Raleigh, or Charlotte. Well, it’s not. It’s in the tiny, picturesque town of Pilot Mountain, nestled into a small shop on Main Street, just a few minutes from exit 134 on Highway 52. So how did a tiny bakery in such an itty-bitty town capture the hearts of thousands of customers, selling out of their delectable sweets almost daily? They achieved this by being great at what they do. Every product they put out is created with excellence in mind. The shop is always clean and adorably decorated. The creative mastermind behind it all seems to have endless ideas, and the talent to match. These qualities have made people trust Liv For Sweets and make repeat trips to satisfy their sweet tooth. The creative baker named Liv opened the shop a few years ago after running pop-up shops around town in other businesses and growing in popularity, when she decided to open a storefront, which has been a wild success. Her boyfriend frequently helps out, and her mom also comes in to run the counter. Her brother is also known to help, as well as other family members. If you’re looking for a mom and pop cupcake shop, look no further. Liv For Sweets truly is a family affair. As you can see from the sweets pictured, the cupcakes and cookies are adorable and creative. Liv For Sweets always puts a fun twist on things, and has different monthly menus based on the seasons. Be sure to check their facebook page for the current menu. Also, go early, they almost always sell out. On our recent trip, we ordered a Lava Cake cupcake. The cake itself was rich and chocolatey and moist. The icing was very rich and creamy and packed with fudgy flavor. On top was a mini brownie muffin that looked like a tiny lava cake, and it had a chocolate sauce infuser. Finally, the whole thing was dusted with powdered sugar. It was absolutely to die for! I also picked up a strawberry white chocolate cookie sandwich: two white chocolate chip cookies filled with strawberry buttercream, a surprise of rich strawberry jam in the center, and drizzled with strawberry icing and edible glitter. It was so good! The frosting was delicious, light, heavenly, and tasted slightly of strawberries. The icing was not too sweet. It tasted more like butter than it did of sugar. Finally, we got a chocolate covered Oreo with Easter decorations. It was so cute I almost didn’t want to eat it. You could tell it was fresh and the flavor was great--what’s not to love in a chocolate covered Oreo? Past favorites of mine have been Pumpkin Spice with cream cheese frosting, strawberry french toast, s’mores, chocolate cheesecake, and pink lemonade. Some of the cupcakes even have alcohol infusers, like champagne or bailey’s. Others still have maple syrup infusers, or lemonade infusers. As with anything in life, not everything is perfect. Even though I loved Liv for Sweets, some people may find the following things to be drawbacks. If you like fondant, or want to place an order for a fondant cake, this is not your bakery. They pride themselves on being a non-fondant bakery. I personally do not like fondant, so I am fine with this. Also, if you want to place a custom order, you may have to do it months in advance. Liv almost always is booked up for weeks ahead. If you know you want a cake for a certain time, be sure to call way early. If not, you may be reduced to going that morning and just seeing what they happen to have on hand. (The bakery frequently decorates mini-cakes and sells them that day). I personally like my buttercream a bit sweeter than they make theirs. To me, it tastes almost too light, leaning heavily to the side of butter or crisco, rather than sugar. While I also don't like it too sweet like the icings used at grocery store bakeries, I just think a little bit more sugar on some of the icing flavors could be helpful. However, my husband adores all the icings they use, and thinks they are perfect. As I mentioned before, this is a matter of personal taste and opinion, and in no way reflects badly on this mom-and-pop bakery. I am just careful to order chocolate or cream cheese flavors, which are richer and more satisfying, personally, to my sweet tooth. Finally, the cupcake and cake prices are steeper than other bakeries. There is truth in the old saying, you get what you pay for. Since these cupcakes are gourmet and hand decorated in a small, local shop in a small community, the prices are a bit higher. Some of the plainer ones might be nearer $3, but the more elaborate ones hover around $4. A cookie sandwich will run you $4-5 and a colossal brownie is right around $4. On the more economical end, you have chocolate covered Oreos, mini cake pops, and single (non-filled) giant cookies, which each hover around $2. All these prices are after tax. If you want dozens of cheap cupcakes for a party, this may not be your ideal bakery, and you could probably do it way cheaper at the grocery store bakery, although the flavor and elaboration is completely different, and more in line with the cheaper price. All in all, I give this bakery a full five stars. I will definitely be back. On their website or Facebook page you can find the current menu and hours of operation. Be sure to leave a comment if you've been there and telling what you ordered, and what you thought of it. © 2021 Audrey Lancho"

844,"Lehi Roller Mills Gives Vegan A Good Name with Plant-based Muffins, Pancakes and Brownies",food," We usually don’t bother with food reviews because 1)We’re not good at it and 2)We can’t deal with dairy food because of being lactose intolerant. That means, for those who don’t know or don’t need to worry, that eating dairy foods like milk or something that has milk in it will cause a series of annoyances going into pain — stomach discomfort, bloated gas actions and evacuations very loose. All around, one can see that going with dairy in such circumstances is not worth the effort (and don’t get us going on having to give up pizza). So when a company like Lehi Roller Mills, known for making some pretty tasty products that you mix and then eat, offers a chance to make something tasty that can emulate tasty dairy products — you betcha we’re going to give it a shot. Now let’s get one thing straight — we’re not knocking dairy products but aren’t looking just to not get annoyed eating this stuff — we want to just enjoy a food that can now exist. So open your eyes to three mixing packages: Raspberry Muffin Mix (Vegan); Pancake and Waffle Mix (Vegan); Double Fudge Brownie Mix (again Vegan). It’s been a long time since we could have muffins, or pancakes for that matter. Or double fudge brownies — all this sounds delightful but really it sounds delicious because of how long it has been since we could just grab a muffin or cut into a pancake or take a huge bite out of a brownie. So let’s go ahead and make each of these non-dairy foods that will let us enjoy what we once could before our bodies decided to change its ways. A lot of time it’s all about stirring the mix in the bowl and there’s two ways to go about doing it: one is to mix it by hand and that takes a whole lot of time and effort. The other way — not so much about being faster but being smoother and more efficient in the mixing — is to use a hand mixer or even one of those big guys that works with a mixing bowl. The majority of the ingredients are contained in the packaging, so what you’re going to need is some basic kitchen equipment. In this case we’re talking about a stove and a bowl and a measuring cup since there’s more than just one quantity of food to make. As far as ingredients go you’ll just need vegetable oil and water — using distilled or spring water makes you feel better if not providing a cleaner environmental result than tap. You’re going to use the entire 18 oz package, although it’s possible to divide everything in half but considering how good the muffins (about 12-18 will be the end results), making the whole package seems extremely sensible. So you empty the package in the bowl, add the oil and water and stir, stir, stir if by hand power or whirr, whirr, whirr if electricity is powering the stirring means. Then the mixture gets plopped into those little cups on a metal or aluminum platter  (yes you have to buy that too if you plan on using disposable) and into the oven it all goes — with the oven pre-heated to the temperature as it says on the box. Then you watch them rise and check them (we took a look on YouTube because the best we could come up with first was sticking a toothpick into the muffin because that’s what you do with a cake?) and then out the pan comes and because you sprayed those cups so the muffins wouldn’t stick, out too comes the muffins onto the platter or whatever surface you decide they should land on. Then it’s the best part, which is eating those muffins. Normally we’d see fear, even if those anti-lactose capsules were popped in our mouths first to try and calm our stomach. But here there’s no such concern and for sure they taste good. And yeah making the whole box made sense because we’re not down with sharing and we’ve a big mouth that is now being filled. So there’s also the brownies to make and the process is similar and the results even more delicious because....well chocolate. Leave it at that.  The final testing is for the pancake/waffle mix and since we don’t have a waffle maker it’s all hands on mixing to drip the batter onto a hot skillet and flip the pancakes being made over when there’s that bubbling in the hope (we hope) that the other side will be some sort of golden brown. Which it was. Not that we could see the pancakes over the sugar-high syrup we latched onto as a condiment. But what a treat to make pancakes for breakfast because for those who like iHop or Denny’s, you can go there any morning for pancakes but we for sure can not. Now you can add to the packages with ingredients of your own but the first time around we just wanted to be able to make what it said on the box and consume without any trepidation. But mostly it’s about being able to enjoy safely what others take for granted, and since these Vegan alternatives taste so good, who cares what the excuse is.

845,Baking egg-free chocolate cupcakes,food," These cup cakes are, for and egg free recipe, surprisingly moist and have a good chocolate flavour. I was given this recipe by a former work college and I do not know the original source. Despite being egg free they are NOT suitable for vegans as they contain dairy. I did bake these every now and again and take them into work as one of my colleagues is allergic to eggs, he has now, however, also developed an intolerance to wheat so he can no longer eat them. I have given both metric and imperial measures, please do not mix and match as they are not exactly the same but both work well. I, unfortunately, do not know the US cups equivalents. Ingredients: PLEASE NOTE – the cherry cola needs to be one with sugar and not a diet one. Artificial sweeteners used in soft drinks can be chemically changed when heated so may change the taste. I have only ever used the cherry cola in the UK which is sweetened with sugar rather than with high fructose corn syrup which some countries use. you will notice no actual sugar is used in the recipe. This is because the condensed milk and the cherry cola contain enough so no additional sugar is needed. You will also need a 12 cake muffin tin with paper cases put in. Before you start you need to ensure all ingredients are at room temperature so taking things out of the fridge about an hour or so before you start will help in this. I tend to cut my butter into cubes to help it warm up and soften more quickly. Pre-heat the oven to 175OC (350OF) Cream the butter using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. This can take several minutes. Add the condensed milk and beat into the butter until well blended together. Sieve the flour, cocoa and baking powder into the mixture and then stir in until just combined. Add the chocolate chips, vanilla and cola and mix in. Spoon the batter into the paper cases. Bake for 20 minutes or until the cakes spring back when lightly pressed. Allow them to cool in the tin for 5 minutes then remove them from the tin and allow to cool on a wire rack. Depending on how thick my batter is when making cupcakes I spoon the mixture out using the type of ice cream scoop with a scraper which can be drawn across the inside of the bowl of the scoop by squeezing a trigger like thing on the side. These cakes do sink as they cool but it does not affect the taste of them and it does not mean they are uncooked. They are also rather large so one may serve two but it depends on how much chocolate goodness you want. I tend not to use overly expensive chocolate chips for this recipe a shops own brand chocolate chips from the baking aisle are fine. They will keep in an airtight container for up to 3 days and they do freeze quite well. You can try adding about 75g (3 oz) of roughly chopped nuts along with the chocolate chips for a bit of a variation on this. Also some countries have other ‘flavours’ of regular cola which you can also try. In the UK we used to have lime cola but this wasn’t, in my opinion, particularly nice. However, again do make sure this is cola which contains sugar and not artificial sweeteners."
846,Vegetarian Dining with Finesse at Divya’s Kitchen NYC,food," I am a food enthusiast and frequently eat out in New York area. Sunflower Beetroot Hummus To be fair, the only reason that I tried this restaurant was because of a vegetarian friend. I went there with the expectation that this would be just another Indian restaurant in New York City. It was really easy to reach and it took me just a couple mins to get from subway station to Divya’s Kitchen. I reached 15 ahead of time, and they happened to have our table ready, and welcomed me in. The place was cosy and really pretty and neat. The staff who seated me was really nice. Once my friend had arrived, the waitress told us about their food. Few things I noticed: Based on Ayurveda According to WebMD, “ Ayurvedic medicine (“Ayurveda” for short) is one of the world's oldest holistic (“whole-body”) healing systems. It was developed more than 3,000 years ago in India. It’s based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body, and spirit. Its main goal is to promote good health, not fight disease. But treatments may be geared toward specific health problems.” The waitress explained the Ayurvedic concept of vatta, pitta and kapha, which according to the tenets, help balance the elements in body and achieve well being. Now I am not foreign to the concept of healthy eating for physical well-being, but this was way more evolved than that. Not only is the food supposed to be good for the body, but it is also meant to “heal” any ailments we may have.Few takeaways I had: Spinach Cheese Cutlets I was very excited to try the food, but there wasn’t anything specific in terms of possible healing, so I decided to go with whatever looks good on the menu. The first appetizer which I tried was spinach cheese cutlet - and it was the softest and most flavorful cutlet I have tried. Every bite surpassed the flavor expectations set by the preceding bite. Not being a vegetarian myself, I have to admit that it definitely raised the bar for vegetarian foods I will ever eat! Avocado Toast Next up was Avocado toast, and when it came, I was amazed by the vibrant presentation. The herbs and the radish presentation was appealing. And then I took the bite and I could feel the perfect texture and the subtle flavors which amplified the perfection of the simple yet elegant piece of toast. Seasonal Khichari Next came Khichari, which was a mix of lentils, rice, spinach and some wonderful spices. It was almost like porridge in consistency but very flavorful and light. The quantity was goo. Although, I just wanted to try different items, I was still able to devour several spoonfuls. Each one of them I thoroughly enjoyed. Rose Chocolate Mousse When the desserts came over, I was pleasantly impressed by the fusion. The food had very authentic Indian elements with a very European looking clean presentation. Rose chocolate mousse was very bit as delectable as it looked. I have to admit that it was the first time that I even thought the combination was possible - whoever would’ve thought of putting rose petals on chocolate mousse? It did restore my faith in trying new dishes, as it was every bit enjoyable with the rose enhancing the chocolate flavor. The Pistachio Fudge was an absolute delight, with every bite melting in my mouth with a burst of many flavors. The dessert here was every bit satisfying with:  Finally, I got my check which didn’t cost me an arm and a leg, and left me extremely pleased with the experience. I am definitely going to return, and if a vegetarian asks for recommendations for food placed in Manhattan, this is going to be my top recommendation! Pistachio Fudge © 2021 EphraimHallford"
847,How to Make a Pasta Casserole With Liver and Giblets,food," My name is Shaima Atef, I love cooking of all kinds, especially Egyptian cuisine,Today we will make chicken burger.

If there is no clay casserole, you can use a high pot on the sides, and remove the hands so that they do not burn in the oven. Then we put the liver and giblets in it and put the pasta in it without boiling, then put the tomato sauce and then turn the sauce over from the whisk, do not go deep in the flipping. Then we put boiling water covering the pasta, then cover the pan with foil paper, then enter a preheated oven, keep in the oven for 20 minutes, I hope you try it because it is very delicious. shaimaa atef (author) from Egypt on April 08, 2021: Thanks Iqra from East County on April 07, 2021: looks very delicious"
848,"Positive Notes About Our Friend, The Watermelon",food," Kenneth is a rural citizen of Hamilton, Ala., and has begun to observe life and certain things and people helping him to write about them. Landen Addison, 2020 Texas Watermelon Queen, Lubbock, TX. (Kenneth.) Watermelons, as a rule, are very delicious. Never met one that I didn't like. Don't know if American icon, Will Rogers, ever met a watermelon much less ate one. But that was that. Here is here and I think that I have something to say about the importance of watermelons. Not since the Garden of Eden has there been such a call for one of Mother Nature's finest foods: the watermelon. This creation is a soft-spoken food. Never in anyone's way or running ahead of anyone in a supermarket check-out line. No, sir. It just won't happen. Watermelon, experts agree, was introduced by the French in North America in the year 1500. No one could ever claim that the watermelon stood alone with its merits and did not depend on other fruits to run interference for it. I have already found a newly-found respect for the watermelon, the humble fruit and never thrown into the hoosegow. And people have never filed suit against (the) watermelon or the watermelon farmers in Egypt and America. Right now, we can safely assume that the wattermelon can be the all-American fruit. And although we are an evolved society, able to eat with utencils and such, there are tons of new ideas and philosophies that we are yet to seize. I have uncovered a few of the once-secret ideas about watermelon that I think that you will be interested. This lovely creation is what it'sall about. You cannot beat watermelon for a tasty treat. Watermelon is sweet, just like pretty girls. Ymmm! Watermelon is good anytime of the day or night. https://www.pexels.com/photo/watermelon-fruit-1313267/ https://www.pexels.com/photo/close-up-photography-of-sliced-watermelons-1070858/ https://www.pexels.com/photo/woman-wearing-white-shirt-eating-watermelon-1993660/ https://www.pexels.com/photo/food-dawn-love-people-6075533/ https://www.texaswatermelons.com/about/queens © 2021 Kenneth Avery Robie Benve from Ohio on April 06, 2021: Ah, what would our life be if the French did not give us the amazing watermelon? Louise Powles from Norfolk, England on April 06, 2021: The facts about watermelons were interesting to read.  I love watermelons! BRENDA ARLEDGE from Washington Court House on April 05, 2021: Well...those were a few facts I didn't know. My first thought when I hear the word watermelon is Gallagher. https://g.co/kgs/zgpJeu He was known for smashing watermelons on stage. Doris James MizBejabbers from Beautiful South on April 05, 2021: And your point is? No, just kidding. Let's hope the watermelon never goes extinct or the world will never be the same. BY the way, I'd like to point out that the proper way to eat a watermelon is to cut a slice and bite into it. Who cares if the juice runs down your arm and drips from the elbow? We have a real competition in Arkansas from two towns, Hope and Cave City. Hope bills itself as the ""Watermelon Capital of the World"" and Cave City is so protective of its watermelons that they put stickers on all of them grown there. If somebody says they are selling you a Cave City Watermelon and it doesn't have a sticker proving it, then it's counterfeit, or so those folks say. Whatever. Both places grow delicious watermelons. Either way, you're gonna pay at least $8 to $10 bucks for one of their melons, but it beats those $4-$5 Mexican melons hands down. Good article, my Southern friend."
849,Delicious Stuffed Cabbage,food," Stuffed cabbage is one of the most famous Egyptian folk dishes, especially in the winter season,and during Ramadan tables. First: In a pan over the stove, put the oil heated and descend on it with chopped onions, stir until the onions are drizzled and descend with tomato juice, and add salt, black pepper, spices and chicken stock, if the tomatoes are not red, we can add two tablespoons of tomato paste, let them boil for ten minutes, then set the fire until maturity.  Second: After the sauce is cooked, we put the rice, green vegetables and stuffed spices on it, then turn it over well and stuff the cabbage with it.  Third: the dish in which we are stuffing, put potato or tomato slices on the bottom, possibly slices of onion, and top it with cabbage and put the soup to cover the stuffed.

850,Everything You Need to Know About Carrots: The Perfect Health Food,food," Margaret Minnicks is a health-conscious person who researches the health benefits of foods and drinks. Carrots are root vegetables that grow underground. You probably have seen only those that are orange in your local grocery store or at the farmer's market. However, carrots come in other colors, such as yellow, white, black, purple, and red. Each color has its own health benefits. The colors do not all taste the same. The slight difference in taste is noticed when carrots are eaten raw rather than when they have been cooked. The root is the enlarged, more palatable, and less woody-textured part of the carrot. Even though the root is the most commonly eaten part of the vegetable, the stem and leaves can also be eaten. It is interesting to know that when carrots were first cultivated, they were grown for their aromatic leaves and seeds instead of for their roots. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that the world production of carrots in one year is about 40 million tons with 45 percent of the world total grown in China. Today, the average American eats about 10 pounds of carrots in a year. Carrots are colorful, sweet, economical, and perfectly healthy food. In fact, carrots were originally grown to be medicine. The root, green leaves, and the stem were used to treat many ailments. Carrots have a number of health benefits, including promoting weight loss and being linked to a reduced risk of cancer, lowering cholesterol levels, and improved eye health. Some people eat raw carrots to help keep their teeth clean and plaque-free. The hard vegetable scrapes plaque and food particles from teeth. That method also stops bacteria from building up on the teeth as well as preventing decay. Carrots are versatile vegetables because they can be eaten in many different ways. They can be eaten raw as a snack and served raw in salads or in wraps. Carrots are delicious as a snack when used for Ranch, French onion, and other dips. Most vegetables are healthiest when they are eaten raw. However, Carrots are healthier when they are cooked because heat brings out more of their nutrients. They can be roasted, boiled, stir-fried, steamed, put in casseroles, soups, and stews. The natural sugar in carrots gives them their sweet flavor. That's why carrots are ideal ingredients in cakes, curries, juices, and smoothies. Carrots can be added to pot roasts and other main dishes for flavor and a colorful presentation. They can be cut into thin strips and added to mixed vegetables and to rice. Kids and adults like to have small carrots in their lunch boxes for a treat. Carrots are so healthy that they can be pureed and fed to babies and given to pets to eat. Photo via commons.wikimedia.org Carrots are sold in many different sizes and shapes. Baby carrots are sold in grocery stores. The mini-sized carrots are ideal for snacking and dipping. You can buy carrots cubes and chips frozen the frozen vegetable section. Photo via snaplant The different colors of carrots have their own benefits. Carrots are crunchy, tasty, and highly nutritious. They are a good source of beta carotene, fiber, vitamins, potassium, and antioxidants. The vegetable mainly contain 86-95 percent water about 10 percent carbs with very little protein and fat. One medium-sized carrot has about 2 grams of fiber and only 8 grams of sugar. The roots contain high quantities of alpha-carotene and beta-carotene. The beta-carotene gives them their orange color. Carrots are a good source of vitamin A, B6, C, E, K, and potassium. A medium carrot contains only 41 calories. Carrots are an excellent source of vitamin A in the form of beta carotene. They are also a good source of several B vitamins, as well as vitamin K and potassium Carrots are especially beneficial for diabetics to eat because of their low-glycemic content and soluble fibers that can lower blood sugar levels. They also lower blood cholesterol. Carrots may lead to improved health and decreased risk of disease and reduce risk of constipation.

851,Bacon: Always the Belle of the Ball,food," Kenneth Avery is a Southern humorist with well over a thousand fans. The charm and wit in his writing span a nearly a decade. What a great time to eat right now. wasn't enough, then this one will shock you for sure. I only use that term, for sure, when used in Super Bowl, World Series, and (the old) Dating Game with host, Jim Lagne. Other than these areas, I have found out that bacon, the sweet, alluring, all-American food has a back history and you may want to cover you eyes because young people do not need to learn the cold truth about bacon. Wouldn't you know it? Based on the background of bacon, it was our buddies, the Romans who invented bacons by a process known of browning the meat and using pepper and wine to give it that distinctive flavor. See? I bet you were like me, ""A Bacon Novice."" I am. And not ashamed to admit it. How many things can you think of that goes with bacon? Let's see . . .Bacon ad Eggs; Bacon and Cheese Burgers; Bacon Pizza; Bacon Taco; Bacon Submarine Subs; Bacon Bits (for salads); Bacon used for Shish Kabobs and Pulled Pork and Bacon Sandwich. And sugar, these delicious meat recipes are not even close to an all-inclusive list of bacon the ""Uncrowned Queen of Bacon,"" may she reign from the Mardi Gras to the outdoor grills of good ol' boys in the southd that the sweet, tasty taste of bacon was only a shy, demure food next door, but no. We were all fooled. Sure looks that way. During all of the times when our eyes were on a football game or beauty pageant, bacon, without any skill, stole the spotlight behind our backs and look where we are today. Shamed, put down, and almost kicked from society at large. But God please bless the pork producer's for without their hard work, we wouldn't have bacon. Or pork chops, ribs, and hey! I am talking about bacon and how ""her"" name has been written on many restaurant walls (with a Magic Marker) with something like, ""for a great piece of food, visit 'Jeckyl's Bacon Barge,' call so and so. And do not use your real name. That was long ago. Today, you and I can stroll-up to any restaurant and tell the wairer or waitress that ""think that I'll have some of that tasty bacon, and please bring it uncooked because I love to live on the edge."" Sure enough. The world does not turn with a solitary race, creed, color, nationality, or bacon recipe. Some connoisseurs of bacon will give it a rough time by frying it over an open flame or the grill. To each his own, I can only deduce. ""I'm just a hog about bacon!"" — Kenneth Avery (me) how many folks carry the name bacon. First of all, the famous, Kevin Bacon, the noted actor; Sir Francis Bacon, famous explorer; Jenny Bacon and I'm sure that there are lots of people, both famous and commonplace with that famous moniker. Bacon. Just think of the influence that the name bacon carries. So threes this guy walking around in a hospital waiting room waiting for news about the birth of his first daughter. Soon, a nurse looks in and says, ""sir, you have a new baby daughter"" He grins. Then screams, ""folks I have a new daughter, Jennifer Louise Bacon Burger,"" she will keep the Burger name alive here in 1776. Well, Don't be so judgmental. It might have happene Have you thought about in the years ago, it was the man who ""brought home the bacon,"" and from 1960 throughout 2021, both the female and male do the same work. This is a fact, friends. Then you have the comedy slang term, ""you burned the bacon,"" when you made that mistake yesterday. Remember? I was trying my best to comparing bacon to an ""easy woman"" when this hub started. The comparisons did seem to fit. I guess that the old adage goes: just let some slice of bacon gets to be popular and all of the guys start chasing her."" Ever heard that one? I did find a few bacon-related terms: ""bacon is proof that God wants us to be happy,"" Ben Franklin and Jim Gaffigan said, ""the sound of bacon frying makes folks happy because it sounds like people applauding."" I would go further, but these two were the only celebrity bacon experts that I found. Get this, history buffs. Lincoln County, Kansas has a town named, Bacon, Kansas. And with this one, I have to go take a break. Did you know that there was a Bacon Queen in 2019? Yep. On Feb, 12, Michelle Yoshimura-Smith pleased the Iowa Bacon Royalty Judging Panel with her sheer talents and mastery of the bacon arts. She can easily toss a shuriken with precision accuracy, handle a bō staff, sing and play keys. She also not too shabby at peddling a Mario Kart. All hail our 2019 Bacon Queen, Michelle Yoshimura-Smith! Oh, Bacon! And lest we forget Gwyneth Paltrow, the very talented film star. She said, ""I'm not sure how healthy bacon is in general, but I know it's incredibly delicious.""Can you beat that? Let's just have a BLT (almost forgot) and talk about the possibility of electing a ""Bacon King."" April 01, 2021______________________________________________________ Bacon goes well with cheeseburgers to give them ""that"" special taste. https://pixabay.com/photos/burger-bacon-snack-fast-food-bun-500054 https://pixabay.com/photos/burger-sandwich-food-fast-food-1553287/ © 2021 Kenneth Avery DW Davis from Eastern NC on April 03, 2021: When I had my first maple/bacon cupcake, I knew that bacon could indeed go with anything.

A Breakfast table was not complete without there being a plate of fried Bacon and yes, fried Sausage sitting there, waiting to be attacked by everyone. Now, I call it my daily dose of Protein, but back then, it was how you filled your belly, backed up by biscuits and gravy and eggs. Oh, and I do find it interesting that fast food restaurants now feel a need to add a couple of slices of fried Bacon to their burgers in order to add some semblance of taste.

852,Simple Cheesecake Parfait Recipe,food," Ryan has been an online writer for over a decade and loves to share and educate. By pokirae Cheesecake is just cheesecake unless you plan to serve it in a very unusual and fun way. One good idea is to serve it as a parfait. This beautiful dessert has opened the door for many foodies who want to prepare their desserts differently. Best of all, it's relatively simple to make since nothing needs to be baked or even cooked. Yes, this is one of those no-bake cheesecakes that are all the rave these days. However, the whipped cream that goes with it (and into it) might prove a little challenging if it isn't readily available. Usually, the easiest and most obvious way to obtain this heavenly marvel is from the store. But if supplies don't hold up, it wouldn't hurt for anyone to learn how to make some homemade whipped cream. It's not hard-- it just requires some heavy cream with a few added ingredients whipped together and voila. But to be on the safe side, an additional recipe for it will be included with this one. As for the part about the parfait--what it is exactly and how to make it--here's a quick rundown...  A parfait is what you get when you take a dessert filling, some crumbs, fruit, and whipped cream-- all layered glass in that order. A typical parfait, for example, starts with granola followed by a custard/ice cream, then fruit, and finally topped with whip cream. Ring any bells? However, somewhere along the line, foodies have gotten bored of the usual suspects and decided to switch them out for other dessert items. Some recipes out there feature cookie crumbs likes Oreos. Others try various custard types like bavarois, tiramisu, or mousse. And then there are those who make parfait entirely out of layered cakes whereas the cake is crumbled and layered with frosting or whipped cream. Ever heard of a red velvet cake parfait, for example? Parfait is usually served in tall glasses or more specifically parfait glasses. However, if these are hard to come by, mason jars are the next best thing. This is easier than it sounds. Just think about the way a cheesecake normally stacks up in a pan; you have the crust at the bottom, followed by the cream cheese filling and topped with fruit/whipped cream. In that very order is how a cheesecake parfait would be built and pretty much any other cake to parfait dessert for that matter. Hence, the parfait glass will have three or four layers, starting with crumbs followed by the filling, fruit, and/or whipped cream. And since this is a no-bake cheesecake, the filling won't require any eggs. In fact, this cheesecake is so simplified, it won't even require any stabilizers period. So say goodbye to gelatin, agar, and seed oil. Just beat all the remaining ingredients (cream cheese, heavy cream, sweetener, and flavorings) together. Of course, an electric mixer with a paddle attachment is required in order to get the consistency right. 15 min 15 min 8 servings © 2021 Ryan Fanus"
853,Eating Delicious Lobster Isn't For Everyone,food," I was born in the south. I live in the south and will die in the south. This is only a small part of the memories I share. are. You have arrived home an hour earlier, chatted with your lovely wife, and decided where you want to go to eat. Arguably, this question always brings debate. Truthfully, the more-bolder people love to take the truth and argue. Suppose that this builds the ego. But you have showered, dressed, and used the high-price cologne that your lovely wife gave you for your birthday. You have so many bottles of cologne that we will not see a ""Cologne Shortage"" for numerous years. Here is an economics fact: gasoline is different than men's perfume. Remember the Gas Shortage in the 70's? I do. So do you. But have you ever hear or read about a lobster shortage? No. And you won't anytime from now. Please humor me and tell me that you are confused right about now. Okay. I'm getting back to the restaurant choice made by your lovely wife. Truthfully, you are too hungry to argue, because you work for a construction company and able to eat like a pair of Clydesdales. You can afford it. You pull ddown $2,300.00 a week before taxes. Good thing that you and your wife live in Caliornia. I would comment about taxes in the Golden State, but I would be guilty of forging-up a hot and nasty political snit. $2,300.00? Okay. $1,700.00 after minimal taxes. Still, compared to most day laborers, this is like being a millionaire compared to working at a fast food restaurant. Careful. I know. Snits.You pull down right at $45.00 per hour on the construction company that is now going gangbusters. But the hidden trick is, you work from 7 a.m. until 6:30 p.m. And mister, it's work. Hard work. I know. I've watched a lot of TV shows where hard work was featured. Put me right to sleep. Yummmm! No. Beware. and chomping at the scales and pincers to eat hearty. You help your lovely wife out of your new Lexus, which you only owe seven payments and she's yours. Your lovely wife picked it out. Oh, I forgot. When you and your lovely wife go out, she suggests that you dress accordingly. She already does. She came from a well-to-do upper middle class family and her dad worked for every penny that he has. He did his share of hard work. This is the common bond between you and dad. Upon reading the menu, the waiter to be respectful, asks your lovely wife for her order. Lobster, she coos. Your lovely wife has manners. Sadly, you have to watch what you say and how loudly. Kinda like being a giant ape being married to a lucky safari hunter. Okay. Snits. I haven't forgot. You order what your lovely wife says, lobster for me too, and she nods in ageement. I will help you by asking you a few serious questions in a bit. Gripe #1 ...ever witnessed a lovely woman go at eating a lobster? It's down right pathetic. Unless this lovely woman has passed a rigid ""Lobster Dining Course,"" then that explains why she is fumbling around like a football being fumbled in the NFL. You are her husband, so you begin sweating. But my friend, it is you who is fumbling to eat your lobster. First. You do not know how to correctly eat such a dish. Oh, how you pray inwardly that you are eating a good old bologna sandwich with fresh bread. And that fresh iced tea. Wow. But sadly, you are far from eating a fresh bologna on fresh bread and that fresh tea, you are trying so hard to just get one bite of this big ""red beast,"" and I am not talking about Communism that broke-up during President Reagan's regime. Gripe #2 . ..Ever sat and watched your lobster and quickly-look only to find that your meal is staring at you with two eyes? It's a sad fact that this dinner choice was not yours, but your lovely wife's idea. But do not think evil. She takes care of you. She has a cleaning woman, a cook, someone to get groceries and able to take a long bubble bath in the afternoon. You can afford it. So you do not bark at the lobster decision. This is the number two gripe that goes with the knowledge that eating delicious lobster isn't for everyone. Before I go on to Gripe #3 (below), you are not completely a ""lobster in the headlights."" Your best buddy, ""Craig W. Lewis,"" one of your friends at work, got tight one Friday evening and carried you and your lovely wife out for, guess what? Lobster. Your lovely wife never argued. This was not new ground for her to claim. But for you, at that time, you thought that this might be exciting. Now to Gripe #3 . . .try to relax and enjoy a lobster dinner dressed in a tailored suit, (that your lovely wife bought for you), dress shoes and Italian-made shirt. Expensive? Yes. But if you get a bite on this material, it will be your butt, not hers. Your hand shakes as you take the special fork designed for opening a lobster and give it the ""old college try,"" lo and behold, you scored a big bite of that fresh whte meat from the right claw, but before you chow down, your lovely wife instructs you to dip it in butter that is in this small cup in front of your plate, but as soon as her words have left her pretty lips, lo and behold, up goes the bite of lobster, bread, and drink of hot tea. Another suggestion by your lovely wife. Two things; one, when did a company ever design and manufacture a lobster fork? Won't a regular fork do the job? Second, you might think that waiters are slow .. .not so. No sooner than your delicious bite of lobster has hit the floor until not one, but four waiters have ran to your table only to hear giggling from your lovely wife, but do not worry. She has this. She tells the waiters that you did not mean to throw your food into the air thinking that you were doing a great impression of ""Bluarti,"" John Belushi, of Animal House when he yells, food fight! So you have narrowly-escaped an embarrassing tongue-lashing from your lovely wife, but she looks in your direction ever so often with a glare on her face. Let's see about Gripe #4 . . . and this is the saddest piece of free advice that anyone could ever give you. While you are waiting for the lobster plate to be placed in front of you, there is that unmistakably-sound of someone crying. Did one of my writers, Rod Serling show-up? No. What's really chilling-to-the-bone is that you are the only one who is listening to that terrifying singing. Your lovely wife is being quiet, eating her lobster very properly, and you freeze as you take that one bite of your lobster and you hear it again...""ohhh, pleeeeze. Save me! Pleeze save me! I don't want to die . . .hheellllp!"" You heard it alright. And understand every word. You cannot tell your lovely wife about what has happened, because she will laugh at you and give you a sedative when you arrive home. You just remain calm and act like you are eating and this is only to fool your lovely wife. Then . . .like a cloud out of the blue . . .Eureka! A terrific idea. And it's all yours. Your lovely wife had nothing to do with it. You know what? You could end-up owning your construction company with genius-based ideas like this. But you think it over a time or two, and it will works. You call your waiter. You ask him for a take-home box. He is quick to oblige. And smiles. Your lovely wife is amazed at the possibility that this might be a way for you to lose weight. Nope. It's a Lobster Box, that can go home with you. With no snits. If you take a bite of me, you're in for a fight. https://pixabay.com/photos/lobster-cooked-danish-1608440/ https://www.pexels.com/photo/delicious-boiled-lobster-on-plate-in-restaurant-4553120/ © 2021 Kenneth Avery Ravi Rajan from Mumbai on March 31, 2021: A good bit of information Kenneth.

855,What is 一汁三菜（Ichiju Sansai）?,food," Hello everyone! Thank you for reading my article! I’m a Japanese writer, blogger, and podcaster based in the UK. Are you interested in Japanese food? Have you ever wondered why a lot of Japanese people are healthy? Today, I will introduce一汁三菜（Ichiju Sansai）, Japanese traditional style of meal? Japanese food culture has been inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List. There are four characteristics of Japanese food culture that have been inscribed on the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage 1. respect for the diversity and freshness of ingredients and their flavours 2. a healthy diet with a good nutritional balance 3. the expression of the beauty of nature and the changing of the seasons 4. a close relationship with annual events such as the New Year The Japanese style of eating, in which one soup and three vegetables are prepared using the umami of dashi and miso, a fermented seasoning, provides an ideal nutritional balance and is something that Japan can be proud of. What is 一汁三菜（Ichiju Sansai）? “One soup, three vegetables"" is the basis of Japanese food. In Japanese we call it “一汁三菜（Ichiju Sansai）”. It is a meal consisting of rice, a staple food for Japanese people, with soup and three vegetables (okazu). It is a well-balanced meal that provides the body with the nutrients it needs for optimal health. Staple food Provides carbohydrates as a source of energy. In the case of Japanese food, rice is the basic food. Soup Rehydrates. For Japanese food, miso soup is basic. the usual choice. Three dishes Made up of one main dish and two side dishes. These are the side dishes that make the main meal taste good. It also supplements the nutrition that is lacking in the main meal and soup alone. One dish for main and side dishes makes eating out a 'one soup, three dishes' The Japanese diet is based on the concept of three vegetables in one soup (rice, soup and three side dishes). By combining a variety of dishes, you can get a good balance of different nutrients, which is why it is said to be good for your health. Of course, in order to get the most out of your meal, it is important to avoid duplication of ingredients and cooking methods, and to get the full range of proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. In particular, make sure you get plenty of vegetables, potatoes, beans, mushrooms and seaweed, all of which are often in short supply. And of course, remember to keep your food light and low in salt. Make sure you have a measuring spoon to measure your food and spices to make sure your food is tasty and healthy. Eating out a lot tends to overload your diet with salt, fat, sugar and calories. If possible, choose a set meal with a number of side dishes, or a hot pot or stew that is full of ingredients and serves as both a main and side dish. Side dishes such as boiled or stewed vegetables and salads are also a good idea. Trivia of healthy diets It is not necessary to eat three vegetables in one soup for every meal, but it is ideal to eat two meals a day that contain a good amount of vegetables. Breakfast in particular is an important meal as it wakes up the sleeping brain and other organs of the body and provides energy for the day. Let’s start our day off with one bowl of soup and three vegetables for breakfast! © 2021 Yuzu"

859,Snacks of South India - Culinary Arts,food," Chef  Praveen Abraham
Chef Instructor 
Culinary Academy Of India Chipping it, once you pop…the fun won’t stop, have a break, have a KitKat, the more you eat the more you want… By now, you know what we are talking about, it is SNACKS! Those are the taglines of well-known snacks produced commercially all around the world. You might be thinking what is it to do with SOUTH INDIAN SNACKING, well, even before snacks were commercially made and sold in packets. As a kid, I remember staring at those huge glass jars filled with candies, savories, mints, gums, and all kinds of colorful fascinating titbits, calculating what I can buy from the petty cash I have, from a local shop at the corner of the street. The concept of snacking is not new; it was always there, rooted in the Indian culture but had a different perspective. Back in the olden days’ snacks were made at home with available ingredients either to go with the meal or was eaten in its original form between meals as hunger savior. The build of snacks was made because it should be convenient for people who wish to carry it with them while traveling or going out for work so that its portable, compact, higher shelf life, satisfying, or even fulfilling sometimes. Slowly with better preservative techniques and improved conditions of the food industry, commercial production of snacks with fancy packaging and innovative varieties, have become popular. Traditional Indian snacks are mostly made using various flour, pulses, and dry fruit varieties; there is a wide variety of sweet and savory snacks made to satisfy people of all age groups. Few snacks are made to make an occasion like in Telangana Sakinalu are made during Sankranti. The word snack is not just confined to anything savory but sweet snacks are also quite preferred.  Generally in India snacks are an accompaniment to any beverage be it tea or alcohol, they go hand in hand! Most of the south Indian crowd would like to have some savory as they sip a hot cup of Masala Chai or even filter coffee for that matter. South Indians are obsessed with their snacks and each house makes them differently. There are many similar dishes either the ingredients or the method remain the same. Sometimes the same dish is called differently in a different language. DIVIDED BY LANGUAGE, UNITED BY SNACKS! Let us now look into various regional snacks from the states of South India; TELANGANA: This young state is known for its unique and distinct flavors. Several varieties of snacks like Sakinalu, Vada Appalu, Murukulu, Chegodilu, Arshelu, Makka Garelu, Makka Atukulu, Gudalu, Venchina Pelalu, Pelala laddu, Malida Laddu and the most popular one is SarvaPindi. All the above-mentioned snacks are very native to this region and these are dry and savory expect for Arshelu which is made with a combination of jaggery and soaked pounded rice. Similarly, Sakinalu is also made with soaked pounded rice to which toasted sesame seeds are added, this batter acts as a dilatant, more like how cornflour slurry behaves when pressure is applied, it’s a fun physics experiment do try! The Sakinalu batter is thick, a little of it is taken into wet hands allowed to drop into a string naturally, taking the help of gravity the batter is shaped into a ring; it is allowed to dry on cloth which takes in the excess moisture and is later deep fried. A lot of variations can be found within the region where few add some red chili powder or even green chili paste, but originally the batter is seasoned just with salt. Malida Laddu is a festive sweet made with leftover Roti, Jaggery, and fennel seeds. The Roti is torn into small pieces to which grounded fennel and grated Jaggery is added to bind them into Ladoos. It is made during the Bathukamma festival. ANDHRA PRADESH: before 2015, both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh were known to be a single identity; hence, the food cultures of both states remained more or less the same. This is the exact reason why we find similar or same snacks with a different name, like Chakralu and Chekkalu, which are the same as Murukulu and Vada Appalu from Telangana. Apart from the similarities, the state also has a few snacks unique to this region like Pesara Punugulu, Dibba Rotte, Boorelu, Vaamu Aaku Bajji, Salividi, Bellam Garelu, and Utanki. Pesara Punugulu is small dumpling size fritters made with a thick green gram batter with a lot of chopped green chilies, onion, spices and coriander added to it, liked by the locals during the rainy season. Boorelu are stuffed dumplings that are deep-fried. The covering is made of Urad dal and the stuffing is Jaggery based. Vaamu Aaku Bajji is a fritter made with carom seed leaf dipped in a spiced gram flour batter and deep-fried. Salividi originated from the base for Arshelu, this is made; Jaggery syrup is made to which rice flour is added and allowed to cook and Ghee, Dry coconut, and any dry fruits of choice are added. This is served as it is but only during weddings. Bellam Garelu is a sweet version of Medu Vada where its texture resembles Jalebi once done. A plain Vada is made which is dipped into Jaggery syrup and allowed to drain the excess. Utanki is a sweet snack made by only one family from Srikakulam, the extreme coastal district of the state. It is a thin batter made with soaked rice, milk, and sugar. To make this crispy net-like crepe, they dip their hand into the batter and let the thin and continuous flow of batter fall into hot oil from the tip of all the 5 fingers. They repeat this process for 5 - 6 times until it is firm and a thin lace forms. KARNATAKA: this state is known for its world-famous breakfast. However, what we tend to ignore are their lip-smacking snacks. Some popular snacks include, Avalakki Avrekal mixture is similar to chivda. Halbai is a rice barfi made in Udupi during the Nagar Panchami festival. Nippat is a small thick rice flour-based snack, which is spicy and crunchy, often deep-fried. Halasina Kayi Chips are jackfruit chips seasoned with salt or sometimes with a local spice mix as well. TAMILNADU:  did you know that the word congee (Asian rice porridge) was derived from the Tamil word kanji! That was an unknown fact, time to learn about some unknown snacks from Tamil Nadu. Sinnai seedai is a savory deep-fried snack made with rice flour and urad dal flour cooked in hot water, which is later portioned, rounded and deep-fried. Tirunelveli halwa, it is very similar to that of Bombay halwa but has its own identity. It is made with soaked and ground broken wheat, which is later hung overnight to release extra moisture and allows it to ferment. The thick hung wheat paste is cooked with sugar, hot water, and ghee till the time it doesn’t leave the vessel. Thoothukudi macaroons, yes India has their version of macaroons. These were adopted by the Italian macaroons made by the Portuguese who came in for trade. The only difference is that these macaroons are made with cashew meal instead of almond meal. Sattur seeval are garlic flavored crispy snacks traditionally cooked on wood-fire. Its main ingredients are Rice Flour, Roasted Gram Dal, Butter, White Sesame Seeds, Garlic, Chilli Powder, Salt, and Groundnut Oil. They can be described as crinkled chips deep-fried in groundnut like. KERALA:  God's own country is popular all across the globe for its cuisine but we have a few favorite snacks to share with you, Pazham Pori is a deep-fried plantain fritter, the plantain is peeled, sliced lengthwise, and dipped into a gram flour batter and deep-fried. Banana chips, now who is not aware of these amazing golden looking chips with a beautiful aroma of coconut oil, just a yes any day! Achappam is a rose cookie. The batter is made with rice flour / refined flour, eggs, sugar, coconut milk. A special mould is used, which is then dipped into hot oil and allowed to heat and then the same is dipped into the batter and then fried. The trick here is the heat up the mould and then dip in the batter so that it acts like a non-stick layer and the cookie leaves the mould when it is cooked.

Since my hubby had already mixed up the tuna mixture, I was able to just skip to the salad building and tuna melt making. Salad: lettuce in bowl. Cut rest of ingredients into bite size pieces. Top lettuce. Then, add salad dressing.

As I pulled the pieces out of the bowl, the three mixed together. It was amazing. For my hubby's salad, he simply squirted best western dressing on his.

868,A Fresh Taste at Perry St in Downtown Manhattan,food," I am a food enthusiast and frequently eat out in New York area. I decided to go here on a specially stressful Sunday. It was a quick 6 minutes walk from the Christopher St Path station.  As soon as I entered the place, it immediately uplifted my spirits with the clean decor and friendly wait-staff. Few things which immediately caught my attention: Recommended By New York Times The restaurant is awarded three stars by New York Times. The staff here is extremely delightful. They greeted me with cheerful smile, and escorted me to my table. The tables are set at a good distance from each other allowing the patrons to be able to enjoy their food without stepping on each other. My waiter was really attentive, asked about my allergies and gave great food recommendation. Later during the desert, he apologized for the limited menu and quick to point out the potential allergens for my desert considerations.  Sashimi I started the order with Sashimi and Rice Cracker Crusted Tuna. The food order came out really quickly and looked tempting. I had to request for the chopsticks, and the waiter was happy to oblige quickly. The first bite of sashimi I put in my mouth, it was burst of flavors. It was by far the best sashimi I had. The tuna not only met but also exceeded the bar set by sashimi. Rice Cracker Crusted Tuna I ordered Slow Cooked Salmon for entrée, which was another great recommendation by the waiter. As soon as I took the first bite the it started as a familiar taste of perfectly cooked salmon, but soon I felt the explosion of the spicy vinaigrette. I looked at the menu again, and sure enough it did mention the jalapeño. It took me a moment to realize that a dish which I had originally thought to a typical western dish was infused with strong Asian influences. The combination of East with West had made a beautiful dish which was meant to be felt and enjoyed with every single bite. It wasn’t just a dish, it was an experience, a tour across the world and back. Slow Cooked Salmon I was pretty full by the time I got to the desert, but went with the waiter’s recommendation again, since my favorite desert crème brûlée wasn’t available. The molten chocolate cake arrived looking as tasty as it sounded. The warm molten chocolate oozed out the cake and tasted perfection. It was a great combination of flavors combined with impeccable presentation. Molten Chocolate Cake When I finished my meal, not only was my appetite satiated, but so was my soul. Chef Cedric has not just walked in his father Jean-Georges’ shoes, but walked a great distance. It is a great challenge for him, considering his father‘s Three Michelin star restaurant is in the city. But he is definitely up for the challenge and has done a great job."
869,Indo-Chinese Cuisine,food," Chef  Praveen Abraham
Chef Instructor 
Culinary Academy Of India Over recent times, we decided to support and encourage our local vendors by boycotting everything ‘MADE IN CHINA’ expect for 'Chinese food.' Isn't it ironic how you still crave a cup of hot and spicy by-two Indo-Chinese soup? In fact, according to google trend sources ‘homemade Chinese recipes’ was one of the most trending searches during the lockdown. The popular Indo Chinese cuisine, heartily relished by foodies and non-foodies alike, traditionally does not belong to any particular region. Prepared as a fusion of Chinese ingredients and techniques with a touch of Indian flavors, this style of food is now present all over the country. Tracing its evolution, we discover it originated when refugees from the Hakka region in China, moved into parts of the northeast, Kolkata, and undivided East Pakistan (Bangladesh as of now) and brought along with them their food habits. Adapt their techniques to local ingredients gave birth to this sensational fusion style we commonly refer to as Indo Chinese cuisine. This new food culture spread like a wildfire throughout the country, evolving at every step, to an extent where you can see curry leaves being used in local Chinese in south India. A few years ago, when I visited Kolkata for the first time, a lot of people suggested I visit China Town. What looked like an unorganized marketplace from the outside turned out to have one of the best Indo Chinese restaurants I have ever eaten at. And this was just the beginning of an amusing day. The nearby Khali Temple even serves noodles as Prashad! It is said that many visit this temple for sake of its mouth-watering Prashad. Authentic Chinese food is not preferred by most of the Indian population because we are habituated to our spices and expect the same from all cuisines. That's when fusion comes into the picture, so much so, that we have Schezwan idli, Manchurian Dosa, Chili Chicken Samosa, Chinese Bhel, and so on, all contributing towards an endless list. The Chinese have divided their cooking into 4 schools: Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western cooking which are further, classified into various regions, based upon the cooking styles, the ingredients used, customs, and traditions. Hunan, Sichuan, Beijing, Cantonese, Guangdong, Shandong, Shanghai, and Fujian are the 8 regional cuisines of China each having their own distinctive feature. For example, in Beijing, with its rapid growth and fast lifestyle, the food features more snacks, and street vendors often sell single-pot meals. Whereas the Sichuan province eats a lot of Sichuan peppers and red meat to keep themselves protected in the harsh climate. It is said that Chinese food has the power to heal, and the cuisine is known for its interplay between balance and flavor. The traditional belief in the Ying Yang philosophy (where opposites attract for a positive impact) is applied to food too. What this means is that for every Ying there is corresponding Yang and vice versa. It’s no wonder the food is believed to have medicinal properties. Coming back to our fusion cuisine, the application of authentic Chinese ingredients is difficult in an Indian restaurant. Although ingredients like soya sauce, green chili sauce, red chili sauce, vinegar, and red chili paste are commonly used, the usage of indigenous ingredients like dried noodles, tofu, chicken, seafood, eggs, mushrooms, spring onion, garlic, ginger is limited to diners and restaurants. At a street vendor level, other ingredients like paneer, potato, cauliflower, and other Indian staples, are used to satisfy the population. Did you know that vegetable Manchurian and the Gobi 65 don't exist in China? It is also seen that most of our dishes are garnished with coriander and a squeeze of lemon is preferred, a total no-no in China. Even though most of the cooking methods remain the same as steaming, deep-frying, sautéing, tossing, etc. Indo Chinese does not follow the basic principles of Chinese cuisine. Instead, it is made to be much more spicy, oily, and has a high concentration of monosodium glutamate. Truth be told, there isn’t too much medicinal about this.

Someone should try and do a Fusion between the nearest Indian Regional Cuisine  and the Authentic Chinese Regional Cuisines. Example.....Andhra and Telangana Cuisines can be easily fused with Schezwan Regional Food as these two cuisines have the high quantity of Chilli usage in these foods. If tastes patterns are the same  then fusing of foods is easy provided the other parameters are also balanced.

874,All About Palm Jaggery: Health Benefits and Why It Is the Best Sweetener,food," Rajan is a botany and chemistry major. He has an interest in health, healthy foods, nutrition and home remedies. Palm Jaggery (Taad Ka Gud) Rajan Jolly Palm Jaggery is called Taad ka Gud in India. According to Indian scientist, food specialist and the innovator of Jungle Farming, Dr Khadar Vali, sweeteners like refined sugar, mishri or rock sugar and sugarcane jaggery should be avoided as they are high in glucose content. Artificial sweeteners as well should not be consumed as they are harmful to health. Since the olden days, jaggery has been prepared from the sap of trees of the palm family, like Palmyra palm, Date palm and Fishtail palm in India. Coconut palm also provides palm jaggery. Of these four palm trees, jaggery from the first three palm trees are considered the best and should be used. Palm jaggery has more of fructose in it than glucose. Glucose is burnt by oxygen to produce energy, not fructose. Sugar consumption causes an almost instantaneous rise in blood sugar as it is rapidly absorbed. Fructose consumption does not raise blood sugar as quickly or as high since fructose has to be converted into glucose to be used as energy. This takes time as it has to go to the liver to get metabolised and converted into glucose by undergoing a series of biochemical processes. So although the blood has fructose in it, the fructose does not affect the body like an increase in glucose does. Moreover, only 40-50% of the fructose absorbed is converted into glucose while the rest is simply excreted. Palm jaggery consumption, therefore, does not lead to a sugar shock which is associated when other sweeteners are consumed. This is the reason why fructose is better than glucose and also why palm jaggery is better than any other sweetener. In sugarcane jaggery, sucrose is the major form of sugar along with some fructose. It is, therefore, not much better than table sugar. Sugarcane jaggery has more glucose in it then fructose. Its consumption leads to more glucose in the blood leading to a spike in the blood sugar level. Not only is this sugar food for cancer cells, but it also lowers immunity and the pathogenic bacteria get their energy from sugar. Therefore if the blood is not flooded with sugar or glucose it will be healthier. Although sugar instantly gives a feel-good feeling it is harmful in the long run. Glucose is actually the end-product of digestion. If sugar is eaten you are directly taking in the end product thus blocking all the biochemical processes which would have been performed to get glucose. The disturbance in the biochemical processes leads to disturbed digestion. Therefore it is better to have a sweetener which is not only natural but also does not flood the blood with glucose. Here is where palm jaggery comes in. Palm Jaggery is: During the season of inflorescence, an incision is made near the kernels on the palm trees. The palm sap is collected in clay pots before sunrise. This palm sap is very time-sensitive and gets fermented within a few hours of collection. Therefore, it is boiled as soon as it is collected to make jaggery. Jaggery prepared with sap held for some period of time goes bad as the atmospheric moisture affects the sap and causes even the jaggery prepared to go bad. Therefore, palm jaggery as well as its syrup have to be refrigerated. These also have to be stored in glass or stainless steel containers.  Although palm jaggery and palm sugar are terms frequently used interchangeably, it must be understood that they are very different ingredients. Palm sugar and palm jaggery are as similar to one another as sugar is to jaggery, meaning, palm sugar is refined while palm jaggery is unrefined. Of all the sweeteners, palm jaggery is the healthiest as it has the lowest glycemic index as well the most fructose in it. Here are some health benefits it provides: Hot palm jaggery syrup Rajan Jolly Palm jaggery syrup after it has cooled down completely Rajan Jolly Palm jaggery has some impurities in it like sand, grass, etc in it which need to be removed before it is used making palm syrup is a necessity. A couple of side benefits that accrue when palm syrup is made beforehand and stored: To make palm jaggery syrup the jaggery is pounded then put in a steel pot and allowed to sit for some time to let it get soft. This jaggery and water mixture is then heated and stirred until the jaggery dissolves completely. The liquid jaggery is strained to remove the impurities and then reheated to a syrupy consistency. It is then cooled completely then transferred to a glass or steel container and stored in the refrigerator. Palm jaggery syrup keeps good for about 2 months in the fridge but should be used as soon as possible preferably within a month of its preparation to avoid any chance of it going bad. The video below shows the process of making palm jaggery syrup at home. More Palm Jaggery Facts 1. Because it mainly contains fructose it does not cause blood glucose spikes in non-diabetics when it is consumed. 2. Palm trees grow naturally and need no special irrigation facilities nor denuding forests and therefore do not harm the environment when palm jaggery is produced. Its production and consumption are thus eco-friendly. 3. Palm jaggery production is a cottage industry. Consuming palm jaggery not only makes the villages self-reliant but also provides employment to the villagers.

880,Eat Nuts to Stay Healthy,food," My name is Faiz Karim. I love writing. I wanted to find a platform where I could share my information with people and fulfill my desire. Wallnuts The walnut is the fruit of the walnut tree, a tree of the Juglandaceae family native to Persia. The walnut is the name of a fruit PDO (protected designation of origin, designation regulated by the European Union). It concerns a fruit from a particular growing area and specific varieties specific to that area. The walnut is a particularly good fruit for health with many virtues that I will detail you. Consuming oleaginous seeds and fruits, and walnuts in particular, is excellent for cardiovascular health. Nuts contain a high level of polyunsaturated fatty acids. This is due to their fatty acid content in the form of omega 3 and, moreover, an omega / omega 6 ratio favorable to omega 3. The walnut contains a high rate of saturated fatty acids (10) (polyunsaturated (65%) and monounsaturated (25%) in particular omega-3 (alpha-linoleum acid ALA omega-3) and plus a good omega-6 / omega-3 ratio. The walnut also contains antioxidants: flavonoids, carotenoids, ellagic acid, melatonin, gamma-tocopherol (vitamin E), selenium. Moreover, the TAC index, the index which measures the more or less antioxidant character of a food, is quite high, greater than 4000 umol. These omega 3s and antioxidants , added to the potassium contained in nuts, combine their effects in preventing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes: the more nuts you consume, the less risk you have of dying from cardiovascular disease. By consuming at least 5 servings of nuts per week, the risk of death is reduced by more than 25% compared to not consuming them at all (1). Eating a handful of nuts per day decreases the risk of 30-year mortality by 20% and in particular a 29% reduction in heart disease deaths (2). Among 9 different types of nuts (walnuts, almonds, peanuts, pistachios, hazelnuts, Brazil nuts, cashews, macadamia nuts and pecans), walnuts are indeed the most effective in preserving health, because they have the highest antioxidant content (3). The antioxidants contained in nuts have another ability : they reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (4). Contrary to what one might think, the fatty acids in nuts do not make those who eat them gain weight (5). This is explained by the fact that the unsaturated fats, fibers and proteins they contain increase the feeling of fullness and therefore lead to eating less. Indeed, nuts (but also oil-seeds in general) are extraordinary appetite suppressants. If during the day you have a craving, instead of a chocolate bar, prefer nuts. This appetite suppressant power comes from their high lipid content and in particular from their richness in polyunsaturated fatty acids (72% of the total fatty acids). In addition, nuts contain, compared to lipids and carbohydrates between 15 and 20% protein, which will be of interest to those who do not consume meat.  The walnut will provide you with certain minerals and trace elements in abundance . For minerals you will find: For trace elements, you will find: Finally, walnuts are rich in vitamin B9 and vitamin E. However, walnut has one drawback, it is acidifying (its PRAL index is approximately equal to 6).  It represents a nutritional gold mine because it is an excellent source of protein. Its high content of arginine, an amino acid, makes it a particularly interesting food for muscle reconstruction when you subject your body to intense sports training. In addition, this nut contains vitamins that are involved in many metabolic processes, including vitamin E (3.54 mg / 100 g) which is of great interest due to its antioxidant effect. Rich in minerals and trace elements, walnuts are a privileged nutritional ally. Eat Nuts With its protective shell, the walnut can be eaten all year round. In salads, pies, or to decorate a cheese platter, it can be easily integrated into all recipes, salty and sweet. On the shelves, we mainly find dry walnuts, in their shells or in kernels, which can be stored very easily at room temperature. From September to November, it is possible to buy fresh fruit. Be careful, they are delicate and need to be stored in the refrigerator and to be quickly consumed. Fresh or dry, and even in oil, walnuts have made a name for themselves on French tables. To check the quality of the nuts, immerse them in a tub of cool water. Those which rise to the surface can be removed: they are dried out. Naturalistic advice: You can improve the quality of nuts by soaking them in water overnight. This will help eliminate inhibitory enzymes and phytic acid. After soaking them, dry them at low temperature (between 40 and 45 ° C) until they regain their delicious crunchy texture. "

882,Indians eating with hands,food," Chef  Praveen Abraham
Chef Instructor 
Culinary Academy Of India Eating with one’s hands is a quintessential part of Indian culture. It may sound a tad bit unpalatable, unhygienic or uncivilized to a knife-and-fork audience, but in India the practice of eating with our limbs is a longstanding one. And this tradition isn’t unique only to India but is also visible across other Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Indonesia to name a few. Tracing the practice through time, we find this practice has Ayurvedic roots. The Vedic principles preach of a sync between the elements of nature and the human body, and according to Ayurveda each finger corresponds to one of the Panch Bhootas [Thumb – Space, Forefinger – Air, Middle Finger – Fire, Ring Finger – Water, Little Finger – Earth]. It is believed that eating with your hand brings all elements together, improving the consciousness of taste and allowing you to feed not only your body but also your mind and spirit. However, eating with one’s hands is not as simple as scooping foods and placing them in the mouth. The process has a method where first, large servings are softened with the fingers into a homogenous mixture. This mixture has the added advantage of being ready for enzymatic activity due to the agitation, a phenomenon not easily achievable while eating with a knife and fork. Not only does this make it easier to absorb nutrients, but it also allows the body to enjoy a more wholesome meal experience. This is because eating with hands allows one’s sense of touch to be a part of the food experience. Gauging temperature and texture of foods with your hands allows you to enjoy a more immersive culinary experience, the overall sensation of which cannot be capture by sight and smell alone, or together. Eating with one’s hand’s is no where near as unpleasant as some pictures might show it to be. In a country as hospitable and people friendly as India, touching the food and eating it with your hand is considered as a mark of respect and friendship. Furthermore, each locality also has their own quirks to this, for example, in South India it is considered ill-mannered to let the palm of your hand or outside of your fingers get stained while eating. This goes back to our fingertips holding certain energies. In the Indian kitchen, silverware is conventionally used only in the kitchen for preparation and outside for service of food. Even liquids, sauces and gravies are scooped up using small pieces of bread or are mixed with starches like rice, making it easier to consume. The cuisine of India, and the eating habits go hand-in-hand and truth be told, the best way to enjoy Indian food is with your hands. This is true for everything from laddoos to biryanis. However, there is a concern and apprehension that ‘hands are dirty’ and ‘one shouldn’t use hands to eat’. Well washing hands before consumption goes a long way in getting rid of dirt, and harmful bacteria. These harmful bacteria are different from the good bacteria which are naturally found in our hands, mouth, throat, intestine, gut and pretty much the entire digestive system. Simply put, if you wash the bad bacteria you’ve collected from your day off your hands, you’ll be giving your body a dose of good bacteria that it needs to stay healthy. In addition to the ingestion of good bacteria, eating with your hand helps improve digestion. How? It is simple really. When you use your fingers to pick up food, millions of nerve endings relay this message to your brain, which then prepares itself for the feast you are about to have. It is also believed that eating with your hand promotes a more mindful eating experience, an important factor required to relish and healthily consume food. A calm, aware state of mind allows for optimum digestion and prevents you from overeating. This is what eating with your hands offers. And whether you are a 5-year old child or a 50-year old businessman, there is no argument against the fact that eating with your hands is just fun!.

Though spoon and fork was never part of the Indian Culture , the new generation  has adapted the western culture. We need to go back to our roots of eating with our Hands.

883,Meatless Monday,food," Having a meatless Monday might be easier than you think. First of all, it doesn’t have to be a Monday. You can skip meat any day you want! Secondly, you might already be doing it without knowing. Each time you eat your Alfredo without the chicken, or you skip the bacon on your sandwich, you’re eating a plant based meal. It really is easier than you think! 1. Eating less meat and more vegetables/fruit reduces the risk of stroke and heart disease. 2. Since red meats increase the risk of cancer, you’re safer on that, too. 3. Diets that are low in meat are proven to reduce the risk of Type 2 Diabetes. 4. The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases are the primary source for global warming, and meat happens to produce a lot of greenhouse gases. 5. Saving the animals! Each person that has a meatless Monday every week saves 3.5 animals a year. Imagine if you had a meatless day three times a week! 6. Lastly, skipping meat just one day a week can save you money! Try it out — you might just enjoy it! "
884,Seafood Linguini in Garlic Cream Sauce,food," Alex is a self-proclaimed Disney expert who enjoys expanding her culinary skills in her free time. This dish is perfect for warmer weather. The lightness of the sauce, the bright citrus flavor, and the delicate seafood are fantastic on a hot day. I absolutely love this dish. I cannot state that enough. If I could have it every night, I would in a heartbeat. Why do I love it so much? It tastes like it is from a fancy restaurant, is super simple to put together, and it combines my love of wine and seafood. I live a few miles away from the Atlantic Ocean. Fresh seafood is not hard to come by. In fact the touristy parts of town are filled with restaurants offering fresh seafood at moderately ridiculous prices. This dish rivals those of even the best local seafood joints. Whats even better is I can make it at home in about 30 minutes for a fraction of the cost. 15 min 30 min 45 min Dinner for 2 The smell of the garlic and butter is enough to make your mouth water. Make sure to cook the garlic until it is soft, but do not let it burn as that flavor is not something you want in this meal. The shrimp turn pink and curl inward and the scallops go from translucent to white and become more firm. Remember, do not over cook the seafood or it will become rubbery. Timing is very important for this recipe. You don't want your pasta finished cooking before the sauce is ready or it will cool off and can become gummy. The seafood can become rubbery if cooked for too long. And if you have the sauce simmer in the pan too long you can lose some of the liquid and then there may not be enough to fully coat the pasta and seafood. There are a lot of different kinds of white wine. Which works best for this recipe? I have used Pinto Grigio and Cabernet Sauvignon Blanc. They have a bright crispness to them that I really like. I found a few that have citrus notes, which pairs very nicely with the seafood. I would stay away from resiling as they can be too sweet. A buttery chardonnay may be well suited for this sauce. As always, if you wouldn't drink it don't cook with it. As is, this is a fantastic dinner for two. If you are cooking for more people you will either need to double the recipe or add in additional items. You can add in oysters on the half shell as a first course. You can add in some steamed vegetables and garlic bread to go with the pasta. This dish also makes a perfect pairing with steak for surf and turf. In fact, that is what we had done for Valentines Day this last year. I nice ribeye and a side of delicious seafood pasta. Even adding in the steak we saved money as that meal would have easily been over $50 a person at a nice restaurant. I always serve this with a glass of the same white wine I used to make the sauce. I typically enjoy a glass while I'm cooking and then there is just enough in the bottle left over for two glasses at dinner. It works out perfectly! I know seafood is expensive. I've found that I can use frozen seafood for this meal and I can get several meals from one bag of shrimp and one bag of scallops. I even found langoustine lobster in the frozen section on a couple of occasions. A bag of all three easily lasted the two of use 7 weeks, with having a seafood dinner once weekly. Talk about bang for your buck! Shrimp or scallops not your thing? That's perfectly fine. This sauce will be fantastic with just about any seafood. Clams, mussels, or even fresh fish fillets. If chicken is more your speed a baked or grilled chicken breast with lemon thyme seasoning would be perfect. As already mentioned this dish is great with steak. Simply pan fry a strip steak, cut into strips, and top over the plated pasta. Heck, you don't even need to add in an animal protein if you aren't feeling it, this sauce is good enough to stand on its own. I once had forgotten to get heavy cream and I didn't realize it until I needed it for the sauce. In a moment of quick thinking I omitted the heavy cream, and instead added in old bay seasoning. I was left with a white wine, lemon, and old bay sauce. It was thinner than the original sauce, but the pasta soaked in a lot of liquid. It made the noodles so flavorful! So, how much old bay did I use? I'm not really sure since I just poured it in. But, I think it was most likely around 2 tablespoons. There was a definite kick to the final dish, but it was perfect for summer. You cannot cut corners on the heavy cream on this dish. I have tried to use light cream and half and half to try to reduce the fat content and calories in the sauce. With both the light cream and the half and half the sauce just did not turn out. When the light cream or half and half was added they cuddled instantly. I tried waiting several minutes after the reduced white wine stopped boiling. I made sure the light cream and half and half were at room temperature before I added them. I even tried to temper the light cream by adding a little of the reduced white wine before I added it to the pan. Nothing worked. Each time I was left scrambling to create a new sauce before the noodles became a jumbled mess and the seafood became rubbery from over cooking. For the ultimate experience I recommend shrimp, scallops, and lobster. The langoustine lobster tails do not add much to the overall cooking time and they add a feeling of refinement. © 2021 isharkbait"

889,Canned Chicken and Biscuits,food," My hubby has the sniffles. Since he has been pulling apart our basement shower, all the dust that collected behind it is now located in his sinuses. So, it's time to fight back with a chicken pot pie type of weapon. First, and foremost, the onions, celery, peppers, mushrooms and chicken need to be fried in a pool of melted butter until they are softened, browned and more flavorful. I used canned mushrooms and canned chicken. In another time, and dimension, I may use fresh sliced mushrooms and raw, diced chicken, in the same pool of butter, but for today, I will stick to convenience. The water from the mushrooms and chicken needs to be retained in a bowl. It will get used. The peas and carrots are microwaved with a little butter, until they are thawed and the butter melts. Still retaining their rawness. Open can, but don't remove the lid. Use lid to hold back mushrooms and chicken while you drain the water into some sort of bowl. It might look like too much fluid, but the cream of mushroom soup will thicken up just fine. The cream of mushroom soup is added in and then the retained water is used. Bring the mixture to a boil for five minutes, flipping and stirring. I used a container of biscuits. Those biscuits are scary. First you unwrap the outside paper. Then, you press on the seam with a spoon. The container pops open. I jump every time. You should have located a glass baking dish that is big enough to hold your mixture without being too full. The biscuits are placed in single layer on top of the wet mixture. You will use all eight biscuits. Squish them to fit. Shredded cheese on top of biscuits. You choose flavor. About a tablespoon per biscuit. I used sharp cheddar and parmesan shreds. Bake in a preheated 375 degree F oven, center rack. My oven took 25 minutes to reach golden brown. Then, remove from over. Let cool slightly, then enjoy!"
890,Product Review - Xiaomi Coffee Grinder Bud,food," A systemsitter, wordbender, framebender, streetwise dhamma monk and a starfleet officer. Coffee becomes a thing to me cause it's the only non mineral water we have at the office. I embraced the coffee breaks culture and the rest is history. Since it was involuntary I just grabbed the easiest way with the nicest taste as I can. The former is easy... the later fused with my picky curious personality and slowly I drifted into the coffee nuts community. They convinced me brewing my own coffee beans is better than those plethora sachet coffees in convenient stores. But what about that ""easy"" criteria ? That question held me back every time I am in a coffee shops and encounter gorgeous displays of various coffee beans in premium packaged. Until a friend gifted me with one. I have got to have a grinder. Enters.... Xiaomi Coffee Grinder BUD. It look like a tumbler cause it is a tumbler, except it's NOT just a tumbler. It got this electric portable grinder complete with an expresso filter all high grade aluminums but the one I LOVE most is it's 40 second grinding timer. It relieves me from guessing how long to grind or how smooth I want. Lazy coffee drinker remember ? So this is how it works... Another thing I love is how the grinder container sort of holds a perfect size for the amount of beans needed for an decent expresso. You just pour and level those beans and I have tried it, it's good. You don't need those fancy scales. All there is left is the amount of water. I solved that with this nescafe expresso mug. You don't need fancy scales, but if you must, go ahead and geek it. If you are in between coffee jedi and coffee noob like me, at the price of less than $80 you will find this baby worth to have around for an above standard coffe break.

893,5 Kitchen Gadgets That Actually Help You Lose Weight,food," Despite having a bakery business, when cooking for her family, Abby Slutsky frequently tries to make products that will not pack on pounds. Coffee gives me something to do when others are indulging in dessert. Even if I throw in some cream and sugar, it is fewer calories than any cake or cookies I'd choose. Photo by Dominika Roseclay from Pexels www.pexels.com Okay, perhaps you are wondering how appliances can help me lose weight. Well, if they prevent or divert me from eating high-calorie foods, I consider them weight-loss helpers. These appliances keep me from eating something more decadent, often creating a healthier alternative with minimal effort. Are you wondering what they are? It does not seem to matter what kind of coffee maker I have, but making a cup of coffee and drinking it is often a calorie saver for me. An article published by the Mayo Clinic indicates that coffee may suppress hunger. Nevertheless, even if it doesn’t, I give coffee credit for preventing me from eating sweets, especially after dinner. When I sit at the table with friends and family, I need something to do if I do not want to eat dessert. A calorie-free black cup of coffee or even one with some milk and sugar is a lot fewer calories than any dessert I would choose to enjoy. My coffee gives my mouth something to do, so I am not tempted by fattening sweets. Therefore, I have to praise my coffee maker and the ones at restaurants I frequent for keeping me away from decadent desserts. If I drink coffee when others indulge in dessert, I do not feel deprived. Well, carbs are fattening, but if I insist on eating them, I may as well choose some that are free of salt, oil, and other items that help pack on the calories. My air popper lets me indulge in a carb snack that is not terrible as carbs go. Usually, I measure out exactly two cups of popcorn after it is popped. The pieces are small enough to eat one at a time so I can maximize my enjoyment of the treat and feel full when I finish. Although my Ninja blender can make a wide variety of treats, I use mine for smoothies made with sugar-free almond milk, half a frozen banana, ice, and half a sugar-free yogurt. If I want to splurge, I may throw in a half tablespoon of peanut butter or half a serving of protein powder. I like the LifeTime Fitness Protein powder (the one sold by LifeTime Fitness gym; you do not have to be a member to buy it), which has only 2 grams of sugar per serving. A thick smoothie can satisfy me for hours and is also excellent if I am in the mood for a frosty treat. A home deli slicer can make leftovers perfect for sandwiches and allow you to control the salt and oil in your deli meats. I have owned my Krups deli slicer for more than 20 years. It is easy to set the thickness of the meat. This is one of the most durable appliances I own. I believe it is no longer made (but it is possible to find pre-owned). I have also had the opportunity to use the Cusimax deli slicer on many occasions. It feels slightly sturdier than the Krups and has a similar design. A deli slicer is a must-have for using up leftovers. Slicing leftover turkey, roasts, and ham helps it get eaten before it spoils. Cutting your own cold cuts allows you to save money and control the amount of salt on your meat. Those with high blood pressure will find this an excellent tool, and those who want to lose weight will not have cold cuts made with fattening oils or sauces, and the freshly-sliced meat is a step up from going to the deli counter. As a tip, when using either slicer, I usually slide a piece of foil or parchment under the area where the meat lands when it is cut. This prevents meat scraps from falling on the counter, and it is piled up, ready to wrap. The pieces of the slicer wipe clean with ease. Sometimes I use a toothpick to loosen meat from the blade. An air fryer allows you to make crispy foods with no or little oil. Rapidly blowing heat helps crisp up the food making it crunchy and crisp with no or virtually no oil, depending on how you want to prepare your air-fried food. If you do use oil, only use a tiny bit and toss your product with it before placing it in the fryer. Of course, making your food without any oil is the healthiest option of all. Even if you have limited space, air fryers are available in multiple sizes, so you can find one that meets your storage capabilities. I use my mother's Copper Chef air fryer frequently, and it is simple to clean. Best of all, I use it for frozen and fresh items. Any or all of these appliances can help you maintain a healthy lifestyle while enjoying food.

895,10 Proven Benefits of Chia Seed,food," I am a Fitness Coach and Sports nutritionist.
I love to write articles about health and fitness. Chia seeds are highly ranked among the most nourishing and healthiest foods worldwide. They are packed with essential nutrients that provide enormous benefits to the brain and body. The vast benefits of chia seeds have made their incorporation into many meals necessary for a healthy diet. 10 Proven Chia Seeds Benefits What are Chia Seeds Chia seeds are small black seeds obtained from a desert plant called Salvia hispanica related to the mint family. They originated from Central American countries like Guatemala and Mexico. Chia seeds are considered a staple food in the ancient diets of Mayans and Aztecs. Over the years, unlike Flaxseeds or Hemp Seeds, chia seeds have gradually grown in popularity based on their health and nutritional value. Highlighted below are the vital health benefits the body stands to gain when you consume chia seeds. Chia seeds are the source of large amounts of omega-3 fatty acids and fiber. They are a rich source of protein and contain a wide variety of antioxidants and important minerals. One ounce made up of 28g of chia seeds contains 138 calories. By weight, chia seeds contain 6% water, 34% fat, 46% carbohydrates (83% of which is fiber), and 19% proteins. It is noteworthy that chia seeds are gluten-free, hence are safe to eat by almost all people. 28 grams of Chia seeds (one ounce) contains: Hemoglobin is referred to as the red protein found in the red blood cell. Hemoglobin transports the needed oxygen in the blood from the lungs to all parts of the body tissues. For the longest time, doctors have recommended the consumption of chia seeds to patients suffering from Anemia. Anemia is caused by dietary deficiencies such as insufficient iron in the body, which causes low production of hemoglobin. Chia seeds are a good source of iron and are loaded with significant nutrients for the body. Iron is responsible for the creation of red blood cells and cleansing the body. Eating at least two tablespoons of chia seeds every day nourishes your body with 2.2 milligrams of RDA, which is 12% Iron critical for increasing your hemoglobin levels. Chia seeds are fundamental for controlling and reducing risks associated with heart diseases. The abundance of sufficient quantities of Omega-3 fatty acids in the nutritional chia seeds is fundamental for preventing heart diseases. Chia seeds help reduce triglycerides, lower blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and slow down arterial plaque accumulation. Therefore, it is necessary to include chia seeds as part of your daily diet to sustain a healthy heart Regularly eating chia seeds or drinking water with chia seeds is advised as one of the most efficient ways of fighting cancer attacks. Breast cancer statistically affects a huge percentage of women globally. You can prevent cancer risks by making chia seeds a part of your daily diet. Reports presented by UCSF Medical Center indicate that chia seeds contain alpha-linolenic acid used to prevent breast cancer. Oils from chia seeds help to control the growth of a tumor and inhibit cancer cell replication. Chia seeds are a powerhouse of incredible nutrients that promote amazing changes and improvements on your skin. They are loaded with anti-inflammatory and antioxidants that promote youthful glowing skin. Chia seeds prevent skin damage and promote the occurrence of clear skin. If you are looking to revamp your skin, you will need to consider consuming chia seeds to eliminate acne, skin aging, and redness. Apart from eating this exceptional skin healing food, people have found better ways of using it on the skin by making facial scrubs using chia seeds. Various nutrients exist in chia seeds that promote bone health and strength. Chia seeds contain phosphorus, calcium, proteins, and magnesium which are impressive stimulants of strong bones. Consuming chia seeds supplies your body with the daily recommended nutrients like 18% calcium necessary for bone strength Chia seeds are rich in soluble and insoluble fiber vital for the promotion of a healthy gut. Soluble fiber works to improve digestion and acts as an important prebiotic in the gut. While Insoluble fiber helps reduce constipation and reduce diabetes risks. Chia seeds form a gel-like consistency in the stomach, which heals and soothes the lining of the intestines, making them a significant source of fiber for people with IBS or leaky gut syndrome. A mix of chia seed water and some freshly squeezed lemon help improve gut health. Part of the primary dietary requirements for weight loss is increased amounts of fiber in meals. Foods with high quantities of fiber help promote the feeling of fullness and are often low on calories. A tablespoon of chia seed contains 5g of fiber, and their extensive levels of alpha-linoleic and omega-3 fatty acids make them vital for promoting weight loss. It is, however, important to highlight studies presented in Nutrition Research, noting that chia seeds consumed by overweight adults may have no impact on their body mass. Part of the process of cutting weight involves reducing intake of large amounts of foods and replacing them with a healthy mix of low-calorie meals and smoothies like Oatmeal Apple Chia Seeds smoothie that make you feel full for longer periods. Ingredients that you can use to make this awesome smoothie include: Chia seeds, oatmeal, milk, an apple, almonds, and sliced banana, all blended to make a delicious fine consistency. Vegan and Vegetarians can maximize the number of proteins in their plates by using chia seeds. Chia seeds are a superfood with essential nutrients rich in proteins, omega-3 fatty acids, and fiber. Many recipes offer a delicious serving of nutritional chia seed snacks, meals, and drinks. You can mix chia seeds with oatmeal for breakfast or mix the seeds in your baked foods, pudding, and drink High levels of blood sugars are common causes of type 2 diabetes. Chia seeds are highly ranked, among the top foods that effectively help lower blood sugar levels to help combat diabetes. High fiber amounts in chia seeds slow down the absorption of large amounts of sugar in the blood, which eventually lowers blood sugar levels. Diabetic people should add chia seeds in their oatmeal breakfast or mix chia seeds in their daily bowl of greens, nuts, and fruits. It is paramount to understand the best ways of eating chia seeds to obtain greater health benefits. Chia seeds are best eaten raw by either sprinkling a few tablespoons on your oatmeal, yogurt, cereals, or smoothies. They can also be cooked in stews and soups or baked in muffins and bread. Chia seeds are a perfect substitute for eggs in vegan foods and baking.

896,20 Sumptuous Meals From the Mediterranean Diet You Have to Try!,food," Marlon has been a long time blog writer. He has contributed content to many sites and is also active in SEO and SMM work. Greek Salad When you have the perfect set of circumstances converge in one place, then you’ve got yourself one hell of a tourist destination – and that’s exactly what the Mediterranean is. Perfect climate, awesome food and the best wine makes this region in the world absolutely irresistible. Mediterranean countries include Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Syria, Israel, Egypt, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and Morocco, which simply means that there’s almost an unlimited number of food varieties available here. For most of us, the Mediterranean diet is all about wine and seafood; however, what exactly is the Mediterranean diet?  To find out, you simply have to try these 20 iconic Mediterranean foods that highlight the best dishes that this part of the world has to offer.  1.) FetaFeta is a brined curd white cheese made either from sheep’s milk or from a mixture of sheep and goat's milk – it is developed by the ancient Greeks and is still being used today. It has a whitish color that sometimes has small holes and at other times has none whatsoever. Unlike Swiss cheese and other types of cheeses which are mostly circular in shape, the Greeks make their feta cheese into large blocks and is aged in brine. It has a tangy and salty flavor that range from mild to strong. It has a slightly grainy texture and it crumbles easily. The Greeks enjoy it with their salads, paired with zucchini, or even with just plain wheat bread.  2.) PizzaThis one is the more familiar food item among the lot. While most people think that the Italian cuisine is as a whole in and on itself, it is actually part of the Mediterranean diet. Trust me when I tell you that nothing else comes close to the Italian pizza! But any pizza recipe in the Mediterranean diet is just as good, because it is made with natural ingredients and is therefore loaded with nutrients.  3.) Lentils and YogurtThe lentil is an edible legume. This plant produces seeds annually and its lens-shaped seeds gave it its name. Boiling them is the most common preparation method; however, they can also be eaten soaked, germinated, fried, or baked. With only 5% of the readily digestible starch in this seed and a higher content of slowly digested starch make lentils a recommended food for people with diabetes. Yogurt on the other hand is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk. The bacteria part of this food is actually lactobacillus which has several health benefits. Lentils folded into yogurt, spinach, and basil is a Mediterranean classic that's super easy to make at home.  4.) SpanakopitaThe Greek dish spanakopita is essentially a pie made from spinach. Chopped spinach, feta cheese, onions or scallions, egg, and seasoning are the ingredients that make up its traditional fillings. You may feel weary when eating this savory pastry at first, but once you’ve taken your first bite, then you’ll understand why it’s found in almost all Mediterranean diet food blogs.  5.) Baba GanoushBaba Ganoush is a Levantine appetizer of Lebanese origin consisting of mashed cooked eggplant, olive oil, lemon juice, tahini, spices, garlic and various seasonings (sometimes yogurt is used to make it). You can serve this dish with tomatoes, onions, or other kinds of vegetables that suit your taste. It’s customary to serve Baba Ganoush before dinner in the Eastern Mediterranean area. It creates an atmosphere where the dish becomes a means for guests to socialize before they eat the main course.  Have you Tried Eating any of the Dishes Mentioned Here?Tell us about your Mediterranean diet dining experience. Was it great? Mediocre? Bad? Were the reviews fair and honest or did some of them exaggerated a bit? What about the Mediterranean lifestyle? Did you enjoy your visit to the Med?  6.) HummusHummus is another appetizer famous in the Middle East and the Mediterranean and is considered a dip, spread, or savory dish made from cooked, mashed chickpeas blended with sesame seeds, olive oil, tahini, lemon juice, and garlic. What makes this food particularly interesting is the fact that it is very delicious and its flavor is enhanced even further when paired with fresh bread, fruits, and veggies. How about that? All the best flavors and healthy goodness in one dish!  7.) SaladIt might seem uninteresting but almost all countries that contribute to the Mediterranean diet have at least one salad recipe to boast from their individual local cuisine – and they do have some of the best and healthiest salads in the world. Salads are often dressed, and are typically served at room temperature or chilled, though some can be served warm. One of the most popular salads is the Greek salad with feta cheese. Some salads are easy to make and you can even make them at home like the Mediterranean Cobb salad, fresh tuna salad, a zucchini ribbon salad with fresh balsamic, or even a potato salad.  8.) PaellaA lot of people associate the paella with Spanish cuisine, but the fact is that it is actually a traditional dish of the Valencians (an autonomous community of Spain). Paella is also the name of a Spanish traditional pan that's used to cook the food over an open fire. The pan is wide and has a shallow depth. It’s so versatile that you can make it with almost any kind of meat including chicken, shrimp, chorizo, lobster, and many others. It is believed that this dish has been around since the 10th century AD, which makes it roughly at least a thousand years old!  9.) FishThe Mediterranean diet wouldn’t be complete without fish and seafood dishes to showcase and, as a matter of fact, there are a lot of seafood recipes in Mediterranean dishes. Seafood recipes such as roasted salmon with smoky chickpeas and greens, shrimp scampi, salmon with roasted red pepper quinoa salad, and many more will absolutely delight your palate.  10.) RatatouilleRatatouille is a French Provençal stewed vegetable dish originating in Nice, although most people associate this word with that cute little cooking rat from the 2007 Pixar film. In the Mediterranean though, the ratatouille is known as a delicious dish usually served during the summer. It is made from tomatoes, garlic, onions, zucchini, eggplant, bell peppers, marjoram, fennel, and basil.  11.) Greek GyrosGyros is a Greek dish made from cut chunks of meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie that's similar to the kebab and shawarma from Turkey. The difference between the 2 dishes is that gyros usually come with the same combo of lettuce, tomatoes, and onions; whereas shawarma has a mixture of meat that’s exceptionally flavorful and juicy (the meat are marinated with spices like turmeric, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and garlic). Both dishes are actually part of the Mediterranean diet and are healthy to consume, but if you haven’t tried the Greek gyros yet, then now would be the best time to do it!  12.) Tomato, Avocado, and Basil SaladIt may seem odd since we’ve already mentioned salad earlier, but believe me when I say that this one deserved a feature all to itself. You will find that this Tomato, Avocado & Basil Salad is the perfect side dish for any meal, as the gorgeous ripe tomatoes and creamy avocado will absolutely drive you nuts. Even though it’s already amazing on its own, I recommend that you pair it with chorizo sausage to augment the taste even further.  13.) Tuscan ChickenTuscany is a region in central Italy where cities like Florence, San Marino and Bologna are located. The people here are thriving in their food game and one cuisine that stands out from the rest is the creamy Tuscan chicken. Packed with flavour, the creamy sun-dried tomato sauce mixed in the Tuscan chicken is the ultimate chicken dinner. It is best eaten with pasta, potatoes or just plain wheat bread and peel off chunks to dip into that creamy sauce. It’s also very easy to make.  14.) TapasTapas comes from the Spanish verb “tapar” which means “to cover,” a cognate of the English “top.” Tapas may be cold (such as mixed olives and cheese) or hot (such as chopitos, which are battered, fried baby squid). The dish originated in Barcelona, Spain during the pre-19th century period – today tapas have evolved into a more sophisticated cuisine that they can even be made into an entire full meal!  15.) BaklavaA national favorite in Greece this dessert will make everyone think that you went to a culinary school to become a great chef, but little do they know that it's very easy to make! Baklava has many layers - it's a delicious pastry dessert made from filo with chopped nuts as its filling, and drizzled with syrup or honey as its sweeteners. The baklava was among the most popular snacks in the Ottoman Empire. Today, due to the popularity of this dish, countries such as Greece, Turkey and other Middle Eastern nations all make the claim that the baklava originated in their country. But as for me, I’m just glad that such a dish exists because life would be boring without it.  16.) FalafelFalafel is a Middle Eastern food with a long history in Arab countries, particularly in Libya and Egypt, but these days it is a common dish in the Mediterranean diet. The falafel is made from ground chickpeas, fava beans, or both which is deep-fried and shaped like a patty or a ball. The reason why the falafel is so delicious is because it is topped with salads, pickled vegetables, hot sauce, and sprinkled with sauces that are based on tahini.  17.) CouscousCouscous is a famous dish from North Africa about 0.12 in or 3mm in size steamed balls made from rushed durum wheat semolina that in most North African customs is served with a stew that requires a spoon on top. This dish is made from semolina flour rolled into tiny balls and then steamed. It's a common misconception that the couscous is a grain when in reality it is actually some sort of pasta. It is a nutritious cuisine that can be eaten as the main course meal, side dish, or even as a snack.  18.) TomatoesThe scientific name of the tomato plant is Solanum lycopersicum and its edible berry is also called by the same name. Despite it being famous across Europe, especially in Italy, as well as in the Mediterrannean, did you know that this plant actually originated in South and Central America? In fact, it was the Aztecs who gave it its name “tomatl,” which the Spaniards called “tomate” and is finally translated in English as the tomato. A great example of how to prepare the tomato and turn it into a super meal is the caprese salad.  19.) GelatoNo, gelato and ice cream are actually 2 different dessert favorites that people mistake as being similar. The gelato is uniquely an Italian frozen dessert that's been around for decades and is very popular in Italy as well as the entire Mediterranean. Even though it is made from milk and sugar (among other ingredients), the gelato is lower in fat compared to other frozen delights, which makes it a healthier choice. Compared to the American ice cream, gelato is actually creamier, smoother and silkier - it's also more elastic and denser which makes people fall in love with it the first time they try it. Gelato is served warmer than the American ice cream and with this temperature difference, it ensures that your mouth and taste buds will not feel numb and you’d be able to enjoy all the flavors in it.  20.) WineThe Mediterranean diet stands out from the other diet programs, because of its super healthy foods and also the delicious yet healthy wine selection as well. There are well-established scientific facts that say red wine is good for your health and the Mediterranean diet has several red wine selections that you will find pleasurable. From the rosé in Southern France, sangria in Spain, and red wine from Italy, they speak volumes about the beauty of the Mediterranean cuisine’s versatility.  The Mediterranean Diet and your HealthThe Mediterranean diet has been known to help reduce risk and prevent diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease and even some cancers. This is the reason why it is highly recommended by most health experts all over the world! In case you haven’t switched to the Mediterranean diet yet, then I suggest you start now and prolong your life by 5 – 20 years more through this diet plan. There is no downside to this and it’s basically and win-win situation for you. Encourage you family and friends to do the same. For each question, choose the best answer. The answer key is below.

897,Surf and Turf with Paddles,food," Prepare the shrimp in a small microwavable bowl. Put shrimp, butter, lemon powder and juice, citrus pepper in bowl. This gets microwaved until butter melts. Approximately one minute. Save the cooking of these until the steaks are done. The bread sticks should be started when the steaks are half done. These were baked in our pizza baker, about eight minutes. The steaks were broiled for 10 minutes, then turned over. Then cooked an additional six minutes. Remove tails. Place shrimp in bowl. Add butter, pepper, lemon powder and juice.  Microwave until butter is melted."

899,Making Your First Sourdough Starter: Bread Making 101,food," Andrea has been an online writer for 8+ years. She mostly writes about dating, couples, weddings, travel, interior design, and gardening. I recently got into sourdough bread making, so I wanted to give you a few tips on how to get started. All you need to make your sourdough is: It will take at least five days to get a proper sourdough starter going. The more your sourdough starter ages, the better it will taste in your baking. For the first five days: Your sourdough starter will likely smell bad by day 4. Don't put your nose up to it and take a big sniff. The smell will eventually get better, or you will get used to it. Try adding some pineapple juice into the mix if the smell is really getting to you. Don't use a metal container for your sourdough. The acidity of the starter will attack the bowl, and it will ruin the flavor and texture. Store your sourdough starter in a place that is draft fee. I place mine in the oven: make sure other people in your household know it is there. It will become normal to check the oven before using it. After the first week, you can store the sourdough in the fridge, which will slow down the growing process. This means you won't have to feed it as often. All you need to create a sourdough starter: a bag of wheat flour, lukewarm water, a glass container, and time. You should feed your sourdough mixer daily for the first week or so. Every 24 hours. When you feel you have a good understanding of your starter, you can relax a little. Feed it every other day, or twice a week. (I recommend daily or every other day.) To feed your starter add 1/2 cup of wheat flour and 1/4 cup of lukewarm water. Make sure to completely mix it. If you want your starter to have a softer texture, add more water: 1/2 cup of wheat + 1/2 cup of water. If you want your starter thicker, add more wheat. Hint: if your starter isn't bubbly, you can add more feedings. Try twice a day. No. Throwing away starter isn't the most economical option. You should first consider getting a larger bowl. You should be using your sourdough often enough that your starter isn't getting too big. There are also discard recipes you can find online. Try to slow down on feeding it. Also, put it in the fridge where it will slow down the growth process. It will harden it, but you'll only have to feed it once a week. When you feed the starter, you want to spend about 2-5 minutes making sure everything blends together. I prefer to use a whisker and do it by hand. I find using a spoon makes it way too easy to accidentally flick out flour and get it everywhere, to my husband's annoyance. I push the whisker slowly into the starter. As things begin to meld, I move it around more. I use a knife to get the starter off the whisker. When done mixing, it is important to clean off all the starter from your utensils immediately. Dried sourdough is hard to get off objects. My dishwasher tends to cook the starter onto the utensils, making it even hard to get rid of all the residue. Most likely, no. If you left it out uncovered for weeks at room temperature, then yes, you probably destroyed it. Sourdough starters are fairly resistant. Some signs that something went array: Remember: you can start the process over simply with wheat flour and water. Of course, a longer lasting sourdough has matured and tends to have a better taste. It's not the biggest deal if you have to start over with a new starter. Just remember: the first five feedings should be with wheat flour, not other types. Sourdough bread is easier to make than you think. It all starts with making your starter. You have to plan well in advanced to make your bread: it takes a minimum of five days to create the starter. My first book that I used to begin a sourdough starter was: Starter Sourdough: The Step by Step Guide to Sourdough Starters. It was given to me as a wedding present. The author is Carroll Pellegrinelli. I recommend buying a book or two at first and experimenting from there. This way you have a nice collection you can rely upon. These books often have tips that can help sharpen your skills. I use recipes online too. I save the ones I really like. The problem with electronic recipes is that baking is messy, and you don't want to ruin your phone or computer with your flour encrusted hands. I recommend a bread recipe for your first bake. One with a low amount of ingredients, especially if this is your first time ever to make bread, sourdough or otherwise. Follow the directions carefully. You may have to add more flour or water if your dough isn't coming together. If your dough is turning into crumbs: you need more water. If your dough is really sticky: add more flour. I find in winter when things are dry, I need more water for my dough. It's okay to keep adding flour and water until you get the right consistency. With baking sourdough, there is one important ingredient you can't neglect: time. These recipes can take several hours and even multiple days. It's a good idea to plan ahead rather than spontaneously decide you're going to bake with sourdough. Consider the timing carefully. You don't want to be up at 4:00am trying to proof a loaf. Read the whole recipe first for time cues. Sometimes those time prep indicators at the start of a recipe lie. Also, unless you are a professional, it will likely take you longer than what it says. When you get a little more confident after trying bread a few times, then you should experiment with other baked goods. You don't just have to use sourdough for bread. You can also use it for desserts. Try making a chocolate cake with it. The lactic acid produced in the starter process will give the bread a more sour, earthy taste. Sourdough bread is made by fermentation of dough and naturally occurring lactobacilli / yeast. It has a low glycemic index compared with other breads. The enzymes during fermentation affect the absorption of dietary minerals. The fermentation process reduces wheat that may contribute to non-celiac wheat sensitivity. Another big plus: there is less chance for irritable bowel syndrome when eating sourdough bread compared to white bread. Sourdough is an excellent source of antioxidants. The peptides found in the bread can lower the risk for some cancers, signs of aging, and diseases like arthritis. That's according to webmd. Moral of the story: sourdough bread actually nourishes your body. It's natural, it's easy to create at home, and it'll impress your friends and neighbors. Sourdough baking is versatile and can protect you from serious diseases. Sourdough bagels will impress your friends. The first step is getting the right starter: you want it fluffy and light. © 2021 Andrea Lawrence"
900,The Spice Trade,food," I am a middle-aged woman that loves to write articles describing my life. I am Italian but I speak English fluently. I love HubPages. dreamstime Spice trade in Europe  It all started in the late 1500 when the first traders had the desire to find a small but tasty flavor to add to their foods. The spice trade changed so much the wealth and people's attitude toward power over time. People fought for richness and to keep trade going...but was it always worth it? Traders began traveling a lot of time ago, and with the discovery of America, new people joined boats to see the riches around the world. One of the biggest trade markets developing at the time were spices. The price to buy spices was raised daily and most of the poor people couldn’t afford it, believing it or not something meaningless since then became an innovation, which didn’t only took riches but also developed people's ways of thinking and acting towards each other mostly in a bad way. It’s here that the spice trade began to grow and created a bullion of money over time. Bullion, was the coin used once the spice trade and trade in general, developed so much that the old coins or “trade for trade” (trade an object for another) were not enough to buy resources because the spices had become so expensive and hard to achieve. As mentioned above people traveled around the world to just get that spice that everyone wanted. A good aspect that trade took even though it was bad is that as small companies grew they were helped to free from state costs and money keeping. Trade became over time a true job.  But now let’s go back to where everything began. It all started with travelers such as Christophorus Columbus finding accidentally America but one fun fact that nobody ever told is that he lost his way to India and got to Jamaica, so finding spices. Other two travelers like Vasco da Gama and Magellan contributed to circumnavigating states or even all the globe. (Tran A) Spices overall were found accidentally by explorers trying to discover the world. A big contributor was Marco Polo who was the first one to try out pepper from Pepperland (WH9 Booklet). As more people found out about the spice trade, new explorers started going to India and to the main spice trade places to get spices. Before spreading the spice trade in Europe as well, Arabs were the controller of the spice trade from the east. Arabs also made up stories to hide spices' position. “To satisfy the curious, to protect their market, and to discourage competitors, they spread fantastic tales to the effect that cassia grew in shallow lakes guarded by winged animals and that cinnamon grew in deep glens infested with poisonous snakes.”(Alam, M). These stories became legends over time but they were not effective because Europeans got to find spices anyway.  This continuity of spreading in Europe got wars started, mainly for the power over spices island(source). These wars also lasted for more than 200 years. One of them was from Spanish and Portuguese fighting against English and Dutch. Even though wars kept going, trade continued around the world, and missionaries (Spanish and the Portuguese) started spreading again Christianity and in the meantime finding trade markets for gold. As more people joined boats new companies were founded and monopolies created as a center of trade. One of the biggest monopolies was Venice, Italy. Which over time took all the control over the east markets. Usually, monopolies were chosen for their position and how easy they were to be reached from all over the places(WH9 Booklet). With wars or not communication between people was really important to perceive with the spice trade. And by not having good communication trade might have stopped. And even though communication lack did not affect people directly then it did over time.  Overall communication was a meeting point between cultures but sadly caused people wanting to always win this passage of time did not improve communication between people. Although if people would have communicated with each other some misunderstandings between people would not be happening by now. Moreover, a huge effect on this problem was also caused by Portuguese and Spanish continuity in wanting everyone to become Christians. The treatments used sometimes made people feel obligated to join the religion and not want to. Furthermore, although there was no communication and greed and wealth took over, the spice trade took great moments and happiness to the world and became a really important factor over time. The greed that took people to act differently toward spices that in this case became gold led to different consequences which were useless because people died and/or fought for no reason. Is understandable that spices were like gold and took the money, and everyone would like to be rich, to be able to afford everything they would not but fighting was not worth it at all.  In conclusion spice trade over time changed people’s beliefs and took many richnesses from all sides. The spice trade was not good for people because being wealthy is the main goal of people and this caused them to fight with each other and not be able to trade, share and communicate and maybe learn new cultures and see others’ perspectives. But if those traders did not find anything about the spice trade in today’s world we would not be able to see how significantly the spice trade impacted our communities and peoples.

901,What Type of Herbal Plants Would You Have in Your Herb Garden in Spring,food," Devika enjoys sharing her work  with a friendly community. Writing opens the mind. I live in a foreign country learned a foreign language . Herbal gardens require time, patience, space and good drainage soil. I had no idea where, to begin with, a herb garden. I didn't follow a guidebook to improve on my herb garden. I love this time of year when I allow the thoughts to flow through my mind about planting the different herbal plants. I began with the earliest planting, Coriander, a few different types of Basil and Sage. To begin with I need to focus on the earliest herbal plants. Sage reseeds so not much to be concerned about this herb. In the autumn to winter seasons the seeds of the Sage flowers grow along the stem and the dark brown bell-shaped seeds are clearly visible. I notice the seeds turning dark in colour and the flowers turn brown. I cut the flower stalk and place the seeds upside down in a brown paper bag. It doesn’t matter what colour the paper bag is. Seeds ripen and fall in the bottom of the bag. I don’t often do this, and know the seed lasts up to three years. Sage needs a sunny spot in the garden and grows well in the Mediterranean region. Sometimes it grows well in pots. Gray coloured leaves with a velvety touch give lovely purple flowers. From these flowers, we ferment in the local traditional drink called Rakija. I like spring gardens always interesting ideas for me. A dark colour forms and is a tasty appetizer. I first planted Coriander, or Cilantro, as many would call it, used for garnish or in an addition to meals. This herb grows in Southern Europe and in Northern Africa, going on to Southwestern Asia. I didn’t know where it grows and what type of climate suits Coriander. I discovered this on my own when I decided to plant Coriander in a small patch of garden. I planted a few seeds, to see how it would adapt to the Croatian climate. It grew very well. Unfortunately, snails and slugs ate all of it. Ground with a lot of stone is best for the Coriander to grow without pests. I decided to plant more seeds in the rough ground with stone and it has taken and grown in most parts of the ground with small stones. The stones are rough and snails don't like the edges. I am impressed and have many coriander plants. Every season, I plant a new batch I go on long walks to search for the wild thyme. The aroma of wild Thyme is different to the cultivated Thyme and the leaves are rougher on the wild thyme. Thyme is a good choice of herbs to use in kebabs and lamb roast. It may not be a choice for everyone, but I prefer it. Thyme likes rocky areas and chalky ground also, self-seeds. In my experience, Mint didn’t grow on the first attempt. I tried to grow Mint at my first attempt and it didn’t grow until the third or fourth attempt. I wasn’t sure why it wouldn’t catch on to all the attempts. A perennial plant and a green herb that has been used for centuries, there are many varieties of this aromatic plant, with peppermint and spearmint flavours and a refreshing taste. Mint is used for many purposes, with vegetables, mint sauce for roasts is one of the most popular ways in a sauce, and the leaves are used in salads and mint tea relaxes you on a summer’s day. Used in most foods, and grown worldwide, the peppermint and spearmint herbal plants were discovered in the early eighteen hundreds in the European regions. Mint is used as a stimulant, is good for colds, flu, digestion, hiccups, stings, earaches, sinuses and other minor ailments. I realized that Mint prefers warmer weather. A herb worshipped by many people in India and is recognized as a sacred green herb. In parts of Mexico, Basil is thought to attract money and keep your partner faithful. Traditionally Basil is used as a good luck charm. Amazingly, but the truth of what people believed in medieval times, and some still do. The taste and aroma of Basil should be used with caution when picked freshly. When dried sweet basil leaves don't have their strong fragrance. A choice of many cuisines, a garnish in salads, especially, with tomatoes is a great combination. Fresh Basil, when added to the flavouring of foods for a few minutes at the end of your cooking is most appropriate just to release the flavours. Asian cultures use Basil for many kinds of foods, including stir-fry dishes and curries. This herb is used for coughs in the Far East, while in Africa it is used for expelling worms and it was believed that some people used it as an essential ingredient for snuff to ease headaches. A herb used in creams for insect bites, ringworm, tired eyes, as a mouthwash, and to increase energy after bathing. The essential oils of Basil are used for abdominal pains and contain camphor. A perennial plant, which grows in the tropical regions, they are best grown indoors from seed. It shouldn't be kept in cold weather, sunny spots are better. Rosemary, a herb commonly found in your back garden, and used in cooking from an evergreen plant with small narrow leaves. There have been old beliefs of this herb, and most people still believe in their traditional thoughts, especially those in the Mediterranean region. With strong flavours, used in the flavouring foods at the end and discard before eating, in soups, or any other foods in your daily menus. Rosemary enhances flavours in salads and goes well with tomatoes. Leaves and flowers are used for cooking or in salads. Rosemary is used as a herb and a tea. Rosemary can be used as a laxative; anyone can have this herb as a tea, if you have allergic reactions, control your intake. I In Croatia, I have noticed that Rosemary is grown everywhere.

It's great to be able to use your own ingredients when cooking. Great article, Devika. Ann"

908,The 3 Waves of Coffee in Malaysia & Singapore,food," Besides cooking, the writer is also a Barista with The Bulb Coffee, with 3 years experience as a Barista. The 3 different waves of coffee KLFoodie.com, Unsplash.com &amp; Decaloutlaw.com In my previous article, Coffees Loved by South East Asians (Link below), I’ve mentioned that Malaysia and Singapore are like two separated brothers. The two countries in South East Asia share a lot of cultural similarities, even our coffee culture is somewhat similar. Malaysia has the “Kopi” and Singapore has the “Kopi”, we have our morning cuppa with a plate of “Kaya & Butter” toast with a side of Half boiled eggs and we even have our own respective “indie coffee” scenes. Lets get to know the coffee culture of both Malaysia & Singapore in today’s Coffee Culture article. But before that, the translations which will be important to your read: “Kopi” = Coffee “Kopitiam” = Coffee house “Kaya” = A type of spread made from “Pandan” leaves, coconut milk and sugar. Instant coffee, also known as the first wave. BuyJapan.com Frappe, made famous by Starbucks, which is 2nd wave. Bellyfull.net The First Wave = More commonly known as the boom of Instant coffee, which dates back to the late 1800s where entrepreneurs saw a growing market in the affordable and “ready-to-make” coffee production, hence why brands like Maxwell house or in Malaysia and Singapore’s case, Nescafe, became household brands during this period. It was during this period where Instant Coffee or any large production coffee grounds were the “hype” of the time for Malaysians and Singaporeans, which was when “Kopi” and “Nescafe” were the favorites of the time and arguably, the time where “Kopitiam” was invented. The Second Wave = This was when Coffee was further developed into Speciality coffees, which is a reaction to the “bad coffee” market during the first wave. It is during the second wave where consumers start to wonder where origin of their favorite coffee beans was and were interested to understand further about the roasting styles of these beans. The second wave was influenced heavily by the wine culture where the principles and the applications are now applied to the coffee industry. Words like espresso, latte, cappuccino and Americano start to appear during this period. Arguably, this started the boom of major café chains such as, Starbucks, Coffee bean and others during the late 1970s and made its way around the world and to Singapore in the year 1988 and Malaysia in the year 1999. Latte art, something that represents the third wave. ChefSteps.com The Third Wave = The third wave is quite new to the group, its term was first used by Trish Rothgeb, in her 2002 article “The Flamekeeper”. The third wave of coffee is how consumers were more and more interested in the characteristics of the coffee. For instance, the first wave was more of making coffee available to the masses while the second wave was when coffee became better but it was the marketing that was the driving force while in the third, both product and marketing is put aside and there is more emphasis on the production. This is where the origin and its coffee taste start to be in the center stage of coffee shops, which gave birth to the “Niche Market” cafes or in layman terms, the indie coffee. Indie coffee shops have made its way to Malaysia and Singapore and has now became hangout spots for most Generation Y/Millennial people. A typical ""kopitiam"" in Kuala Lumpur. The setting is similar in Singapore. Timeout.com The “Kopitiam” culture still exists in today’s Malaysia and Singapore and it is still considered a national culture by the people of these countries. We still love our “Kaya” & Butter toast, half boiled eggs and “Kopi” from time to time. Although “Kopitiam” culture is an old-fashioned way of life in today’s world, we can’t help but to savor the food and beverage we loved since our childhood. “Kopitiam” culture is still evident in our culture as it is still fresh in the minds of Malaysians and Singaporeans. “Kopitiam” was once known to be the place where everyone gathers for a business discussion, gather for a chat or just a good old family gathering on a weekend morning. Besides going for Coffee, the “Kopitiam” is where Malaysians and Singaporeans gather for breakfast, which is still a cultural norm followed by the people. The interior of a Starbucks Chain which most of their shops look similar. Pinterest.com The introduction of Starbucks and Coffee bean to Malaysians and Singapore has created a significant change to Malaysian and Singaporean coffee culture and the behavior of the people towards coffee. In 1988, Starbucks opened their first store in Singapore and in the year 1999, Starbucks opened their first store in Malaysia. The people of Malaysia and Singapore start to gain an interest in knowing what the origins of the coffee beans are and were eager to understand further what specialty coffees are. It is at this point of time, Malaysians and Singaporeans are introduced to Espresso, Latte and French Press culture. Second wave coffee shops are a major meeting location for many people of Malaysia and Singapore. I’ve worked in Starbucks before in the year 2015 and I noticed that many people conduct business talks or do their work in these places because of the service they offer, which is why Malaysians and Singaporeans are attracted to Second wave coffee shops. As said in the previous section, Second wave coffee shops are not just about improving how we consume coffee, but it is the work of effective marketing. A setting of an Independent Cafe in Penang, Malaysia. Penangfoodie.com Based on the study conducted by Faculty of Business and Management, Arshad Ayub Graduate Business School, of Universiti Teknologi MARA, it is now a trend among the younger generation (Most commonly, Generation Y) Malaysians to meet with family, friends and colleagues over a cup of coffee in cafes, the same with Singapore. Continuing from their study, this has led to many western and local themed cafes popping up around the countries. Themed cafes are the work of Third Wave coffee shops, sometimes known as Independent coffee shops, which is an improvement to the previous second wave in terms of understanding deeper into the production of the coffee. This is where coffees made using hand-brew and aero-press start to gain a following. Coffee in Malaysia and Singapore has evolved from drinking unknown coffee beans to knowing the origins, taste notes and production of the beans in the cuppa of the day. Intercontinental Coffee Trading Besides the changes in coffee consumption culture, these waves of coffee cultures have changed the way of Malaysian and Singaporeans coffee consumption style. From having a basic coffee with condensed milk and evaporated milk, to a cup of Ethiopian Citrus flavor and smoky after taste Americano. However, one similarity that remains throughout the wave changes was the importance of Coffee when it comes to socializing. We continue to meet and enjoy coffee together as a community. © 2021 Nigel Koay"
909,Cherry Tomatoes vs. Grape Tomatoes: What's the Difference?,food," Margaret Minnicks is a health-conscious person who researches the health benefits of foods and drinks. Which is Which? Cherry Tomatoes or Grape Tomatoes? Most people think tomatoes are vegetables, but they are fruits. Actually, the word ""tomato"" means ""the swelling fruit."" According to botanists, a tomato is a berry because it consists of an ovary and seeds that come from a flowering plant. Therefore, they refer to tomatoes as berries. On the other hand, cooks consider tomatoes to be culinary vegetables because they have a much lower sugar content than fruits. So, don't think I have made a mistake when I refer to the red produce from the garden as a fruit in this article. Tomatoes can be eaten raw as well as are used in many dishes. They can be used raw in salads, on sandwiches, cooked in sauces, soups, and side dishes. They can also be consumed as juice or in drinks. All tomatoes are rich in lycopene, the cancer-fighting agent. Tomatoes contain vitamin A and vitamin C. They help to maintain good vision, healthy skin, a strong immune system, and a healthy heart. This article is about cherry tomatoes and grape tomatoes that are named after fruits. Their terms should not be used interchangeably because they are different. They are described and compared in this article because there are major differences that most consumers fail to notice. Cherry Tomatoes Photo via commons.wikimedia.org Cherry tomatoes get their name because they are the size and shape of cherries. These little round tomatoes are juicy, sweet, and have thin skins. Since they have a high water content, cherry tomatoes are known to squirt when you cut and bite them. Many cooks have found that adding cherry tomatoes to a tortilla wrap will make the finished product soggy. The juice from the tomato drips through the contents and all over your hands. Cherry tomatoes are one of the most versatile of all the tomatoes. For that reason, they are favorites for tomato lovers. You might be familiar with only the red variety, but cherry tomatoes also come in orange, yellow, pink, and brown. Cherry tomatoes are sweet and tangy and can be eaten raw, cooked, grilled, sauced, cooked in soup, put on sandwiches, and in salads. Grape Tomatoes Photo via commons.wikimedia.org Grape tomatoes are oblong and shaped like grapes. They’re about half the size of cherry tomatoes, with thicker skins. Grape tomatoes aren’t as sweet as cherry tomatoes, but their flesh is meatier with a chewier texture and less watery. That means they won't squirt when you cut or bite into them. They are crisp and crunchy with a taste that ranges from sweet to tangy. They can be eaten raw, grilled, roasted, tossed into pasta, put on a sandwich, into soup and sauces. Grape tomatoes last longer than cherry tomatoes. They are less fragile, which makes them easier to pack. store. and transport. If you don't plan to use the tomatoes as soon as you purchase them, it is best to take home grape tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes. Size and Shape Round with size and shape of cherries Oblong and shaped like grapes, but half the size Skin Thin skin Thick skin Taste Sweeter than grape tomatoes; meatier and crunchier Not as sweet as cherry tomatoes Uses Salads, soups, sauces Salads, soups, sauces Colors Red is the most popular color, but they also come in orange, yellow, pink, purple and brown Red is the most popular color, but they also come in orange, yellow, pink, purple and brown Shelf Life Shorter shelf life Lasts longer than cherry tomatoes Nutritional Value Same as grape tomatoes Same as cherry tomatoes Other Distinctions Juicier than cherry tomatoes; higher water content Lasts longer than cherry; less fragile and easier to pack and transport Cost Cost is about the same as grape tomatoes Cost is about the same as cherry tomatoes Mixture of different colors of cherry and grape tomatoes.

The easiest way to remember the difference between cherry tomatoes and grape tomatoes is to remember their names.

912,5 Superfoods That Reduce the Risk of Cancer,food," Serena is a digital nomad who writes about work, emotions, and self-improvement.

Fortunately, eating super foods is one way to prevent the risk of cancer. Here are five superfoods that can reduce your risk of getting cancer: This superfood a great way to prevent the risk of cancer. They contain antioxidants which are known to guard the body against damage from oxidants, which are molecules that can do damage to a person's cells and body by causing inflammation and disease. Common factors of harmful lifestyles and environmental stress can cause oxidants to form, such as smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, and high blood sugar levels. Eating a berry here and there is a great way to battle the negative effects of these actions and helps to prevent damage in the body. Vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, kale, and brussel sprouts can help prevent cancer as well. In fact, there are many studies backing up this claim. These types of vegetables are packed with vitamins and minerals, and also contain sulfur containing elements called glucosinolates, which when broken down have been found to prevent DNA damage, tumor growth, and also have antibacterial and antiviral effects on the body. Eating fat dense fish like salmon can also help with preventing cancer. This type of fish has components called omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to have antioxidant properties, help protect the heart, reduce tumors, and in some instances, have shown to cause dangerous cancer cells to self-destruct. In one lab study, omega-3 fatty acids helped to slow down the development of breast cancer in mice. This super food is a good part of a cancer preventative diet. They contain polyphenols which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and also have phenolic acid in them, which can help improve gut microbiota. This helps to create an anti-cancer environment in the body. Eating a couple nuts regularly also helps to prevent cancer because they contain melatonin, which is known to help with antioxidant defenses and DNA repair, which inadvertently helps to prevent cancer-forming cells within the body. This super food includes lentils, beans, and peas, which are helpful to lower cancer risk. They contain high amounts of fiber which can help prevent certain types of cancer, and other studies have shown that eating them regularly could reduce the risk of tumors and colon cancer as well. In addition to these amazing cancer-preventing benefits, eating this super food more frequently can help regulate heart rate, support the prevention of heart disease, and also help to prevent diabetes. Incorporating these cancer-preventing super foods into your diet is a great way to guard against disease and to help keep your body healthy and supported in the long-term. Research has shown that eating a variety of these super foods instead of just one type can help increase the effectiveness of them all, so don’t be afraid to try all of them and more This content is accurate and true to the best of the author’s knowledge and does not substitute for diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, prescription, and/or dietary advice from a licensed health professional.

914,How to Make Sushi Bake,food," Charlette is a Mom of 2 and a devoted wife who loves to cook and experiment with food. Sushi Bake Covid-19 brought out the ingenuity of my fellow Filipinos in cooking. One of these is the famous Sushi Bake. But this dish dates back to 2015. It was popularized again last April 2020 by a Filipino nail artist because of the quarantine. So what is Sushi Bake? It's a deconstructed sushi in a pan, baked and served with nori sheets. But before I give you the recipe for this dish, let's talk first about sushi's history. Around the 16th to 19th century, or what they call the Edo period, Yohei Hanaya popularized the dish made with a raw fish press on top of mixed cooked Japanese rice, vinegar, salt, and sugar and eaten in one bite. Going back to the recipe, the Sushi Bake that I will introduce has no raw meat, and it's a more flavorful version of the said dish. For this recipe, we will be using a 5.5 inch(W) x 7 inch(L) x 2 inch(HT) pan. You can adjust the ingredients according to your pan size. 1&1/2-C cooked Japanese rice 1-tbsp rice vinegar 1-tbsp sesame oil nori sheets 3- sticks Kani or crab meat (shredded) 3-tbsp cream cheese 5- tbsp Japanese mayonnaise (do not use just any other mayonnaise as the taste may differ. Preferred brand Kewpie) 1/2-tbsp Sriracha sauce 1-pack Furikake ( you will not be using all) You can also experiment with other flavors like putting mangos to make it taste like California Maki, or you can even put some baked salmon on top and Ebiko eggs. Below is a recipe for the California Maki Sushi Bake and Spicy Wasabi Tuna.

915,Delicious Buttery and Crumbly Pineapple Tarts,food," Brian loves food and enjoys exploring various cuisines. He is a keen experimenter in the kitchen and finds cooking therapeutic. Golden Pineapple Tarts The pineapple is a tropical fruit and its origin can be traced back to South America, predominantly from the region between Southern Brazil and Paraguay. Nowadays, the handsome fruit can be found in almost all tropical and subtropical countries in the world. Hence, the products have also been diversified and commercialized widely. Most people are familiar with the pineapple as a fruit either consumed on its own or blended into a deliciously refreshing concoction to quench thirst on a hot day. However, do you know that the fruit can also be turned into a delectable jam paste, used as a spread or even filing for pastry? In Asian households, primarily in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore, pineapple jam is commonly used to make pineapple tarts. These buttery morsels are usually consumed during festive periods such as Hari Raya or Chinese New Year. From a commercial standpoint, some businesses mass produce these treats and offer them as a festive gift package. You may find different variations of this pastry, and one extremely popular version is the Taiwanese Pineapple shortcakes, which literally is the same thing but presented differently. Some may be put off at the thought of making this decadent treat, as it is quite time-consuming; from making the jam filling to preparing the pastry dough. However, nowadays, the preparation can be simplified. You can get ready-made pineapple jam that is just the right consistency and is readily available at stores and baking shops. I personally prefer to make my pineapple tart using store-bought pineapple jam. For me, it is not so much for the sake of convenience, but, I find that the pastries turn out better instead. I have tried multiple times to make my own pineapple jam filling but can’t seem to get the texture right. Mine usually turns out too moist and it affects the outcome of the tarts. Moist fillings can shorten the shelf life of the goodies, more so for homemade batches as no preservatives are used. The common problem with moist fillings is that they can lead to mouldy tarts in a short period of time. So this recipe here will emphasize more on the composition of the dough, combined with store-bought pineapple jam to produce the most buttery and crumbly pineapple tarts which go well with a cup of English tea. Let’s get baking! 1 hour 35 min 1 hour 35 min 60 tarts Mixing the dry ingredients 1. Sieve the flour and milk powder in a large mixing bowl and set aside Making the pineapple tarts 1. In a large mixing bowl, add in all the butter and icing sugar and beat at low speed using a mixer 2. Once you notice the icing sugar has combined with the butter, increase your mixer to high speed and whip until the mixture is light and creamy 3. Slowly add in the egg yolks (one at a time) and then lastly the egg white 4. Work the mixer until the eggs are combined into the butter mixture 5. Add in the dry ingredients slowly. You may do it in separate batches of three or four. Continue to mix just until the dry ingredients are fully combined into the wet mixture. Make sure to not overdo the whipping Time to Wrap the Tarts! 1. Roll the pineapple jam into balls of about 8g each. For this, you will need a dough of about 12g to fully enclose the golden filling 2. Flatten the dough on your palm and place the jam on top. Roll it into a ball and place it onto a baking tray lined with baking paper 3. Preheat the oven at 180 degrees celsius at least 30 mins before baking 4. While waiting for the oven to heat up, use the back of a fork to carve ""tic-tac-toe"" lines on the tarts. What we are trying to achieve here is the look of a pineapple (This step is optional. Some like it plain without any fancy design) 5. Once the oven is hot, put the tarts in to bake for about 15 minutes to set the design 6. Bring the tarts back out and lightly brush them with egg wash 7. Pop the tarts back into the oven and allow them to continue baking for another 15 to 20 minutes 8. Once done, bring the tarts out from the oven and allow them to cool completely before storing them in an airtight container  Butter and icing sugar mixture You may serve the tarts for tea time alongside with a cup of hot traditional English Breakfast tea or Early Grey tea. These two teas are suitably paired with tangy and citrusy desserts 1. The origin of pineapple tarts - The Peranakan people actually gave birth to this delicacy. The Peranakan Chinese believe that it’s auspicious to consume tart during Chinese New Year due to the connotation of the pineapple fruit in Hokkien, called Ong Lai, which a call for fortune to come 2. The calories - An average pineapple tart amounts to about 84 calories per delicate morsel due to the butter and sugar content. So, do not underestimate these 'mighty' tarts. As addictive as it is, be sure to control your intake. © 2021 Brian Brian (author) from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia on February 26, 2021: It is indeed a tasty treat, Liz! A good tea time selection for the sweet toothed. Liz Westwood from UK on February 26, 2021: This is a tasty recipe. I appreciate the detailed instructions. Pineapples are much more widely available these days."

She loves to try tips and tricks in her kitchen. closeup of a portion of lasagna B By Bernd Juergens Lasagna is a classic first course of Italian cuisine, now famous all over the world they can never be missed on the tables of Sundays spent with the family. Preparing lasagna is not difficult, but like all recipes, it needs a little attention, just enough not to make any mistakes that could ruin this very tasty first course, loved by everyone. Fresh pasta or dry pasta? To obtain a soft and compact lasagna, it is preferable to use fresh egg pasta sheets. If you do not have time to prepare them at home, you can remedy them with those you find in the supermarket refrigerated counter. In that case, the advice is to blanch each sheet for a minute in salted water: help yourself with a skimmer and, once the stamp is finished, immerse each sheet in cold water so as to stop the cooking process. Your sheets will be softer and will keep cooking in the oven better.  In the kitchen, we know that the eye also wants its part and a tall and compact lasagna satisfies the sight and taste, but how high must the perfect lasagna be? How many layers do you need? There is no precise rule, but a self-respecting lasagna must have at least four layers — even better if 5. italian lasagna on a square plate By Bernd Juergens For a self-respecting lasagna, be careful to distribute the filling evenly. Arrange the sauce evenly, both in the center and in the corners. In this way, the cooking will be uniform and your guests will not fight to grab the most seasoned piece of lasagna! In the kitchen, patience is an excellent ally. When you have finished composing your lasagna, let it rest for about 40 minutes before baking it. In this way, the pasta will absorb the flavors of the filling and the cooking will be more homogeneous and the taste richer. Parchment paper is an excellent tool for oven preparations, but every rule has its exception. For lasagna, it is preferable not to use it. You risk it sticking to the first layer of pasta, thus ruining your dish. It will certainly be a little more tiring to clean the pan, but a layer of seasoning well-distributed on the bottom of the pan is preferable as a ""base"". Before starting to compose the layers of lasagna, butter the bottom of the pan and make the first layer of sauce: in this way you do not run the risk of the bottom sticking to the first layer of pasta.

918,Quick Apple Chutney - Indian Style,food," Umesh is a freelance writer contributing his creative writings on varied subjects in various sites and portals in the internet. Self In India, chutney and pickles are an integral part of meals and snacks. There are many food items that are used to prepare chutney in India. People use various methods and styles for the preparation of these different types of chutneys. Some of the common items used in making chutney are mango powder, lemon, raw fruits of various kinds, mint leaves, coriander leaves, the combination of tomato, garlic, onion, ginger etc. Some chutneys are consumed raw while some are to be cooked before consuming. The apple chutney described in this article is to be taken after cooking. In this version, we will be using a microwave for cooking it though people having less familiarity with a microwave can go with traditional cooking over a hot plate or gas stove. For making apple chutney, raw and unripe apples are prefered. Though ripe apples can also be used their taste will not be as appealing as raw ones. Another thing is that traditionally these chutneys are prepared in pans over gas stoves or hot plates but in this version we have used a microwave instead. The quality of chutney is as good as that of prepared traditionally. Microwave cooking requires some cautions and care and that we will discuss subsequently in this article. Due to its special taste, apple chutney is invariably prepared in some parts of our country during a religious or other function. This is more common in villages than in the cities. In the Northern territories of India in some hill areas, this chutney is quite popular because of easy availability of apples there. Before going to prepare this delicious chutney let us go through some basics about microwave cooking so that the chutney making process gets easy. This type of chutneys can be cooked in the traditional way that is cooking in a pan on a stove or hot plate but here, I have used the microwave as one can cook in the microwave in a hassle free way. Many people are not well versed with microwave cooking so it would be worthwhile to go through some of the fundamentals of cooking in a microwave. Microwave has generally 4 or 5 cooking ranges starting from very high to very low heat (very high, high, medium, low, very low). For example, for cooking vegetables, one can use 'very high' or 'high' option. For keeping the food warm one can use 'very low' setting. One of the most important thing in microwave cooking is that one has to mix or add a calculated quantity of water to the dish before cooking and it should be sufficient to cook it and absorb and evaporate in the process and the dish becomes just dry as planned. For making curries, there is no such precision required and one can add 3-4 cups of water depending upon the number of people going to have it. Adding the required amount of water is the most important thing in microwave cooking and one learns it with experience. Those who are not comfortable with microwave cooking can go for the traditional saute and cook mode using their own basic culinary skills. We have prepared this chutney using half a kilogram of unripe apples. The chutney prepared with this much quantity of apple is sufficient for 3-4 people for 4-5 meals as normally it is taken 1 or 2 spoons per person during a single meal. Please note that chutney is not a main side dish. It is just like pickles that are usually to be taken in a small quantity. The chutney takes about 25-30 minutes time in getting ready including the preparation time. The ingredients used in this chutney were - Note: If you do not have all the spices available and do not want to go in that hassle then alternatively in place of the spices you can add 2 tsp of Indian Garam Masala powder which is available online across the world. Wash the apples and peel them and grate or cut into small pieces. I have cut them in small pieces this time as evident from the picture of the prepared chutney shown in the beginning of the article. Remove the seeds from it beforehand. Peel the ginger and chop it in long and thin sticks. Chop the dry dates also in long and thin pieces. Wash the raisins and keep them aside. Take a microwave bowl and place the grated apple or its small pieces and ginger pieces in it. Add sugar, salt, and half a cup of water. Keep the bowl in the microwave and set the heat range as Very High or High. I would prefer High. Cook this for about 6-7 minutes and take it out. Now add sugar and all the spices to it and mix well and again put back in the microwave. Cook it in the same settings for about 4-5 minutes and take the bowl out. To preserve it one can add half a tsp of vinegar preferably apple vinegar. In cool places, it might not be required. Please do not cook this for a long time just to reduce water or anything like that as that would lead to thickening of the sugar syrup leading to solidification and spoiling the fluid taste. Of course a 3 to 4 minutes extra cooking would not do any harm. Normally the colour of this chutney will be light brown to blackish brown but if we use jaggery in place of sugar then the colour of this chutney will be more brown or blackish. The prepared chutney can be kept in a small bowl with a serving spoon and one can take it as per one's liking. Normally one spoonful is sufficient to make one relish it. The chutney can also be kept in the fridge for using it later. One tablespoon of this chutney when ready to eat consists of about 25 to 30 calories only. The main source of carbohydrate in the chutney is sugar, sugar in apple, sugar in dry dates, and sugar in raisins. Those who wish to reduce this carbohydrate might think to reduce the sugar to be added to the chutney though it will be compromising with its taste to a good extent. Apple is a fruit that is used in jams and jellies of all kinds but this chutney tastes very delicious and different from them. Basically it is happening due to the use of specific Indian spices. In essence, it is an interesting part of Indian food to relish pickles and chutneys with main meals and snacks and from that perspective, one can try this recipe for preparing this delicious chutney. 1. https://www.healthline.com/nutrition 2. https://recipes.sparkpeople.com This content is accurate and true to the best of the author’s knowledge and is not meant to substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional. © 2021 Umesh Chandra Bhatt Umesh Chandra Bhatt (author) from Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, India on February 26, 2021: Vanita and Ravirajan, thanks to both of you for your visit.

Smoking Up Some Spare Ribsfirst thing we need to do is remove the membrane, the membrane is the thin clear thin light cream-colored skin that is on the backside of your rib, now some people keep it on but like to remove it because it gives me an even more tender piece of meat. Now to remove the membrane at one end on the ribs slide a boning knife under the membrane and lift to loosen then place the knife down and using a clean dry kitchen towel grab the membrane and pull it off slowly, just remember it may tear while pulling but just grab and continue to pull as much as you can.

This mix is a simple mix you can use on other types of meat as well.  Rub Mixture for Ribs Applying the Rub to Your RibsWhat I do is mix up my rub mixture very well then, I apply very well over the top side of the rib then rub it in just like you're massaging something then flip it over then do the same now remember you can be generous with the rub.

920,"Cauliflower Bites: Quick, Easy, Healthy and Inexpensive Recipe",food," Margaret Minnicks is a health-conscious person who researches the health benefits of foods and drinks. If someone handed you a head of cauliflower and tell you to eat it all, no doubt you will think it was a crazy idea. However, you would not find it strange to eat the head of cauliflower after it had been cut into florets and prepared into cauliflower bites. Cauliflower bites are so delicious that some people could eat the whole pan of them that would actually be a small head of cauliflower. Cauliflower is not on everybody's favorite list of vegetables to eat. Skeptics who confess they don't like cauliflower often find that they love roasted cauliflower bites. Here is a quick, easy, healthy, and inexpensive recipe that will turn cauliflower skeptics into cauliflower lovers. A cauliflower is a very versatile vegetable with a pleasing texture and fiber that is filling. It is low in calories and easy to sneak into casseroles and side dishes. Cauliflowers can be eaten raw, boiled, steamed, roasted, grilled, fried, air fried, or pickled. A lot of people use the vegetable as a low-calorie, gluten-free alternative to flour, rice, and white potatoes. Nutritional Value An average serving of cauliflower is about 44 calories. This is a healthy treat for diabetics who say after eating the florets, their blood sugar level is at a normal range. : http://www.freefoto.com/images/09/11/09_11_15---Ca... The video below shows how to cut a cauliflower into bite-size florets after removing the leaves and core. It takes only a few minutes to turn the head of cauliflower into florets for the bite sizes that are used in the recipe listed below. There are many different recipes for making cauliflower bites. Some people take some ingredients from different recipes to come up with a recipe of their own that contains the ingredients they like. Most variations depend on the sauces and seasonings used to coat the florets. The recipe for Parmesan Cauliflower Bites below is one made up of ingredients from other recipes. It is missing the bread crumb coating as some recipes have. Some cooks use a batter made with Panko bread crumbs, but they don't have to if they want a low-carb and gluten-free dish. The recipe in this article does not include bread crumbs. Muffin tins can be used instead of cooking the florets on a baking sheet. That might be a good way of making sure there is enough space between the florets. Florets can be cooked in an air fryer, but they will be chewy instead of crisp and crunchy. Therefore, this writer prefers those cooked in an oven. Cauliflower bites are best eaten soon after they come out of the oven. If any are left over, they can become crisp again when they are reheated in the oven at 350 °F after about 5-10 minutes. Do not reheat in a microwave because they will be soggy. Bites can be eaten as a snack, an appetizer, or a side dish. No matter what you call them, they are delicious and a welcomed treat. Some people favor blue cheese or ranch dressing while others favor catsup, barbecue sauce, or another sauce for dipping. Margaret Minnicks (author) from Richmond, VA on February 24, 2021: Sp Greaney, Since you already like cauliflowers, you will simply LOVE this recipe. Try it and keep me posted. Sp Greaney from Ireland on February 24, 2021: I would totally try these. I actually like cauliflower steamed. But this is such a different dish and it looks delicious. Margaret Minnicks (author) from Richmond, VA on February 24, 2021: Linda, trust me. The cauliflower bites are easy to make and so delicious. Besides, they are healthy. Try them when you get a chance! Linda Crampton from British Columbia, Canada on February 23, 2021: The cauliflower bites look and sound very tasty. I think your recipe is a great way to prepare the vegetable. Margaret Minnicks (author) from Richmond, VA on February 23, 2021: Cheryl, that was my first time making them, but I will make them again and again. They are really good, and my blood sugar was at a good level the day after eating them. Thanks for reading and commenting. Cheryl E Preston from Roanoke on February 23, 2021: Looks delicious"

922,Modern Way to Prepare Tasty Noodles,food," Justin is an experienced advisor who has a great experience on healthy foods and cooking tips. Everyone has a different taste on how they need their noodles done. Some prefer a spicy meal, whereas some consider a less spicy meal to be the meal they would prefer to consume. Therefore before preparing noodles, it is important to consider what the said people will prefer to consume. First and foremost, ensure that you've enough noodles that will serve you well. Due to various reasons, noodles are always best when served while hot. Boil water on your pot until it is warm, add then add the contents of the noodles. Plan on cooking your dry noodles anywhere from 8 to 10 minutes, depending on the type of pasta. However, start checking it after four minutes because it can vary based on the size of the noodle. If you've made fresh pasta noodles, you may only need to boil for a minute or two, sometimes three. It is also important to note that there are different types of noodles. There are vegetative noodles, beef noodles, and chicken noodles. Having taken this into consideration, this means that there are different types of preparations and specific ingredients to use. Therefore, before purchasing any type of noodle, ensure that you're certain that you will like them. People have different choices and preferences, therefore choose the best type of noodle. Beef and chicken noodles have similar cooking procedures, based on there names, you can choose to add beef or chicken to the noodles to taste. You will require the following ingredients: In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, oyster sauce, brown sugar, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, red pepper flake and ground black pepper; set aside. In a large pot of boiling water, cook udon noodles according to package instructions; drain well. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add beef and cook, flipping once, until browned, about 3-4 minutes; set aside. Stir in mushrooms, broccoli and carrots to the skillet. Cook, stirring frequently, until tender, about 3-4 minutes. Stir in udon noodles, beef and soy sauce mixture until well combined, about 2-3 minutes. Remember that at the beginning i noted that noodles are tastier when served while hot, therefore Serve immediately. Put down that box of pasta and try vegetable noodles instead. With a spiralizer or vegetable peeler, you can create ribbons or strands of nutrient-packed veggies that are lower in calories than pasta. Firm vegetables, like carrots, beets, winter squash or sweet potatoes, hold their shape best. Eating more vegetables is just a twirl away with delicious recipes like Zucchini Noodle “Pasta” Salad and Carrot-Peanut Noodle Salad. I will also share about preparing Carrot peanut noodles. This crunchy salad is made with spiralized carrots instead of noodles. Make sure to use unrefined peanut oil, which is way more flavorful than its refined counterpart and is one of the trio of peanutty ingredients that makes this simple salad stand out. Look for it with other specialty oils or in the Asian section of your grocery store. Below are some of the ingredients you will require; The formula for pasta seems oh-so-obvious. Water + pasta = dinner — right? But sometimes the supposedly simplest things prove to be the trickiest. It turns out the window for pasta perfection — not stuck together, and neither mushy nor hard in the center — is slim. And then there are all the other factors to consider. Should you add salt to the water? Or oil? What about a cold-water rinse at the end? If your head is spinning, take a deep breath and let go of the pasta panic. We’ve assembled the best, and easiest, tips for cooking excellent pasta every time. When you’re hungry and want to get to spaghetti time stat, you might be tempted to use less water, so it boils quicker. Don’t. Just like pasta needs a roomy pot, it needs plenty of H2O to totally submerge every strand. Here’s a tip for making the water boil faster. Put a lid on the pot, but keep it partially uncovered so you’ll hear when the water starts to boil. Leaving a gap will also help keep the water from boiling over before you turn it down.   8 min 15 min 23 min Serves three to six people depending on amount Justin Ondieki (author) from Kenya on February 22, 2021: great content Justin Ondieki (author) from Kenya on February 22, 2021: great content"

924,Chocolate Covered Cherries - the Pro's and Cons of Homemade,food," I watched a youtube video the other day, on how to make homemade chocolate covered cherries. It was interesting. The man was sitting there, and had a large jar of cherries. Then, he had some chocolatey syrup cooking on a stove. His wife was sitting there doing her thing, and his son was filming. The conversation went to child rearing, and the father started spooning the maraschino cherries into a bowl of powdered sugar. In front of him, was a board that was probably coated with waxed paper. As he spooned the cherries into the bowl of powdered sugar, he would chat and smile..He'd lift the bowl and shake the cherries around, coating them with sugar. You know, they are wet, so it sticks. The son asks how he knows when they are done. He replies, you just know. Well. They get bigger and bigger, just like a snowball gets bigger when you roll it through fresh, sticky snow. Same difference. Then, he'd take a half cup measure and dump some more confectioners sugar on the cherries that he was shaking in the bowl. Then, he'd add a few more spoonfuls of cherries. He had a quart of cherries in the bowl by the time he was finished. All looking like a bunch of snowballs. Then, he brought over his pan of chocolate, and smeared some on a special pan. The pan probably had some sort of warming unit, as if you let chocolate sit, it will harden... He'd swirl the chocolate into a swirl, then he'd pick up a snowball and start rolling it in the chocolate in his hand. [wearing a glove, of course] Then, he'd plop the chocolate covered cherry onto the waxed paper surface. Grab another cherry and repeat the process. All the while, he was listening to his wife and son chirping about child raising. He'd just smile. He didn't say much. [Wise man] I had a thought. A ""why not"" type of thought. I saw three things at the store that I put in my cart: Maraschino cherries, powdered sugar and chocolate shell coating. On one hand, the idea was successful. On the other hand, a miserable failure. Yes. Chocolate shell creates the illusion of success. Powdered sugar is an enabler. The maraschino cherries played along. They knew all along that the idea was ridiculous. But, nope, not a word. By its very nature, shell coats and hardens. However. It also melts the exact second you touch it. Room temperature is ok. Body temperature is way too warm. So. Here we go. Got my wax paper ready. I squirted chocolate dots across the wax paper. Placed a snowball on each, then dripped enough chocolate shell to cover. Went on to next. Coat, coat, coat. Went through two bottles of coating with one tiny bottle of cherries. Thought about adding extra cherry juice to tops of snowballs, but it just makes a mess. Also thought about dripping brandy on them. Voted. No. Then, put tray in refrigerator. Tried one the next day. Magic shell coating, cherries and sugar tastes amazing, but again melts quickly.

926,Factors Behind Lack of Food Security,food," food availability which is considered difficult to at least match the capacity of the population. Today, food security is the most discussed issue in the world. How not, food becomes one of the primary needs that have an important role in human life. In fact, food becomes a condition for people to be able to maintain their lives. It is not uncommon for food security to be the most highlighted sector in the world. In addition, the food crisis has spread to various countries in the world to become a global problem. When talk of a food security crisis is hotly discussed, another thing that is also in the spotlight is agriculture. Agriculture is one of the largest sources of food for human life. Certainly, from year-to-year food productivity from agriculture is required to be increased. This is because the growing population makes various food producing sectors in each country must be able at least to compensate for the capacity of their respective populations. On the other hand, the increase in food needs that occur every year will certainly cause also an increase in the price of food commodities so that as a consequence, the number of poor and starving people will increase. The World Food Organization, FAO (2009) estimates that around 1.02 billion people worldwide are currently experiencing food shortages and hunger. This argument is reinforced by a statement from the Population Fund (2000) which predicts that by 2050 there will be an increase in the population of about 2.32 billion people spread around the world. Looking at the data, of course, this makes every country have to turn their brains so that food needs can be met for all people. However, if we look at the facts, land that should be used for the growth of food commodities, precisely now many are made into various infrastructures for industrial purposes. If this is constantly allowed, it is not unlikely that the world's food productivity will decline. When food productivity decreases, this can make the problem more complex because it will also affect other sectors such as economic, social, and political problems. What is to worry about here is when food sufficiency becomes an unsecured thing as food availability in a sustainable time. Moreover, food development in recent years is in a situation of concern that makes various countries forced to import from other countries to meet the needs of food. A real example of this can be seen from the situation in Indonesia. Indonesia, which is famous for its agrarian country, has now started importing rice and other food commodities from outside. When Indonesia began to import, in this case rice imports, it would certainly affect the welfare of farmers where this situation allows them to lose their livelihoods and have difficulties in economic matters. land conversion From the above exposure, we know that food security in a country becomes a thing to be taken into account because it has influence to various other sectors. However, we all must realize, sometimes food security is difficult to be stable and still provide sufficient availability for every human being. There will always be a variety of disorders or things that become obstacles to this food security. Here are some factors or arguably triggers of a lack of food security globally, including: 1. Population Growth Rate As explained above, population growth is one of the factors that can lead to decreased food security. It can be said that the rate of population growth should be proportional to the demand for food needs. The question is whether food supplies can keep pace with the population? Logically, when the population is increasing, then the arable land will also be widely used for the needs of the population, say housing. If the arable land is even more diverted for development, automatic land for food purposes or in other words for farming will be less and can cause food supplies to decline. 2. Land conversion Today's industrial era makes development happen everywhere. Increasingly advanced technology allows the creation of infrastructure to be developed. Undeniably, the goal to advance a country can be done through the development of this infrastructure. However, overdevelopment and without thinking about the impact on the surrounding environment can be fatal. Erosion can be a side effect of this development. When the transfer of land function results in erosion, it will affect the quality of the soil that becomes degraded or even make the soil infertile so it is not suitable for agriculture. Even if you force the polluted land for planting, maybe the crop will fail. 3. Price Instability The amount of food supply is inversely proportional to the population, in which case the number of people passing through food availability can cause price stability to be disrupted. This is because when food supplies are limited or even in decline, the foodstuffs will be a rare thing that makes residents as consumers vying to get the food for their needs. This condition makes the production actors increase the price of food, food supplies are difficult to obtain. 4. Climate change In recent years, global warming has become an inevitable disaster for the world. The increase in the earth's surface temperature causes extreme climate change. This is a result of continuously increasing greenhouse gas emissions. If these conditions do not change, then the food grown will be difficult to adapt and most likely failed to harvest due to the extreme climate. In fact, Indonesia, which has a tropical climate, is currently experiencing difficulties in terms of food productivity because the weather is now difficult to predict. Sometimes high rainfall can result in flooding due to the lack of water catchment areas. When flooding occurs, the land for agriculture becomes submerged so it cannot be used for planting. On the other hand, drought is also a factor that should not be forgotten. The amount of illegal logging leads to a decrease in water resources that ultimately makes the land dry and barren. 5. Bioenergy expansion Energy is one of the basic needs to sustain human survival. Unfortunately, given the depletion and diminishing availability of fossil fuel resources, this forces every country to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. With the increasingly limited availability of energy from fossils, it will certainly be sought other alternative energy sources, one of which is utilizing foodstuffs. The impact is when the fulfillment of food needs is not a top priority in the utilization of foodstuffs and the formulation of policies and the development of bioenergy becomes a disruption in the running of food supply needs.  © 2021 Farhan Saidi"

931,Cornstarch: Amazing Uses Outside the Kitchen,food," Margaret Minnicks has been an online writer for many years. She writes articles that are interesting to her readers. Photo via commons.wikimedia.org Most cooks know that cornstarch can be used in the kitchen. It is used to thicken soups, sauces, gravies, marinades, glazes, casseroles, custards, puddings, and other desserts. It is also used to coat meats. It can be used to make corn syrup and other sugars. You won't see or taste cornstarch in your dishes, but it's one of the best and least expensive thickeners. Cornstarch and water can replace an egg in many baked items.

The hair is hard to manage, especially if it is long and curly. If you pull hard on the hair, it could be painful for your dog. Rub a generous amount of cornstarch into the dog's coat, brush gently from the bottom to the top to detangle the hair. Cornstarch is ideal for you to use between shampoos because it soaks up oil. Mix two parts cornstarch with one part of baking soda. Dab the mixture close to your roots and brush through thoroughly. The dry shampoo will do the job until your next wet shampoo. If you ever run out of deodorant, use cornstarch as a substitute. Mix equal amounts of cornstarch and baking soda in your hand. Use an oversized makeup brush or cotton balls to apply to your underarms. This is also a great deodorant for those whose skin is irritated by regular deodorant. Photo by A.

932,Cookie Tips To Make Better Cookies,food," Chris enjoys sharing his experiences and thoughts with others in the hopes that by sharing, they will help someone else. If you look at recipes for any cookie, most of them are fairly close to another recipe for the same type of cookie.  The difference in ingredient amounts is usually small or simply a specific brand.  This is because a large portion of a cookie being good is in how the cookie is actually baked and/or prepared. We will take a look at ways to change how a cookie turns out.  This is good when you know who you are baking for.  If baking for the general public then you don't want an overly doughy cookie or a burnt cookie.  But if you're baking for aunt Glenda who likes slightly burnt cookies, you will probably bake them differently than you do for a classroom of kids.  Most things that are baked for the general public are middle of the road, not too crispy but not too soft, and so on and so forth. There are things that are easy to adjust to bake cookies differently. Many of the factors that change how a cookie turns out, a lot of people don't consider too much. This is because they are small matters that we take for granted. Let's dig into a few of these things and put a little more focus on them in order to understand them a little better. We will look at mixing, chilling, consistency, freshness, and coloration. Mixing dough is obviously important for the ingredients to be mixed and not have pockets of flour, sugar, etc. inside the cookie. This would not taste good at all. But mixing is also important for cookies to keep their shape. There is a range of mixing cookies from just until all the ingredients are combined to well after and making the dough tougher.  With this range of mixing is also the plumpness in cookies.  If you mix very little the cookie will spread out easier and flatten while baking, and sometimes the cookie will also be a little softer. By mixing more, you are actually breaking the gluten down and making it tougher.  This helps the dough keep its shape better so that it doesn't flatten as much during baking.  This also makes the tough tougher in many cases as well.  This is why pie crusts often say how many times to stir or how long to mix, so they are flakier or crumble easier. There are additives that can be added to replace this holding power of gluten, but we won't worry about putting additives into our cookies. If you mix your cookies up and bake them right away, it is a nice immediate reward. But if you chill the dough afterward, the cookie will hold its shape slightly better. I also like to let it chill so that the flavors combine a little better and make a smoother tasting cookie. If you do chill your dough, make sure to wrap it. I make the dough into a ball and put it back into the mixing bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and place it in the fridge for at least a couple of hours.  It should be cool throughout and firm. Measuring and not guessing gives you the same results and when it comes to baking anything consistency is essential to producing the same dish every time or changing the things you want to adjust with a recipe.  This is easy enough and doesn't need too much explanation in regards to measuring. Another aspect of consistency is using the same equipment.  Each oven is slightly different and pans heat differently.  Know your equipment or use the same equipment for the same results.  One of the things I have noticed many home bakers do not think about is measuring dough.  They use a spoon and guess at the amount or just eyeball it. Finding a scoop to use makes forming your dough and laying cookies out much easier and quicker with more consistent results.  There are different size scoops, I would recommend a #40 for most cookies.  This makes the results more standard and instead of some cookies on a tray being cooked differently, you have control of how the cookie turns out by using temperature and bake time.  A scoop gives you more control over what you are baking and how it turns out. This is in regards to ingredients.  Fresh ingredients generally have better flavoring as well as leaven better.  Most of the time people have old ingredients that may not be as effective.  Baking soda is one such example of this, most people purchase a baking soda and it sits in the cupboard for a long time and expires.  With sugar, it dries out over time, and unless sifted your cookies may have sugar lumps that do not dissolve and you have hard sugar bits in your cookies. Some of the results do come with knowledge though.  As a side note, if you look at ""The Best Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe"" you will notice that the recipe uses hot water and baking soda.  This is to help leaven the cookies because baking soda needs liquid and acid to activate and leaven.  The molasses in brown sugar is the acid and most recipes depend on the butter to be the liquid.  Having fresh ingredients makes sure that they function how they are supposed to as well. This term could be used in two different ways. If I say a burnt cookie, images come to mind and the most prominent part of that may be the color of the cookie as well as the smell. So the color of a cookie is important and this will be a personal taste for how baked you want your cookies to be. One thing that helps with this is the coloration of your pans though. A light pan reflects heat more and a dark pan absorbs heat more. If you want a cookie to be darker on the bottom, then use a darker pan. The color of the pan you use may also change the baking time you need. A darker pan will be hotter, so sometimes you can actually turn the heat down and lower the temperature compared to a light pan. This is one reason that I use a baking mat with cookies.  It acts as a small buffer against the pan. I also appreciate that it is less clean-up than using a pan directly and is less expensive than buying parchment paper and throwing it away. I hope that these tips help you make a better cookie.  For all those that say baking is an art, there is definitely creativity to it and a lot of science.  I would love to hear tips that you have, please put them in the comments.

933,Wholesome Avocado,food," Sadhana Mahato, 29, is a fervent enthusiast for cooking innovative recipes since she was 15 without compromising on taste and health. The competitive, computer and technology driven life had already left us with no time to take good care of our health and provide balanced nutrition to our bodies and now due to the current outburst of a stronger variant of the Covid-19 virus (SARS-Cov-2), we have no other option but to eat home cooked meals. This could be an advantage for all of us worldwide to provide our bodies with better nourishment than the much resorted to 'to-go' meals from restaurants which are full of empty calories, unhealthy fats and refined ingredients, or the frozen food which is prepared many months ago and is just a nutrition-less dead body with hardly any taste. While this is a positive, many people resort to eating packaged foods that are heavily processed and are full of sodium and refined oils with either additional refined sugars or just an overload of spices that exceed and overpower the main base of the food. Hence I have come up with a recipe for my dear readers from all around the world that would satisfy your taste-buds as well as leave you with no guilt or cause stress to your digestive system. This recipe could be used when you have no time to cook and still need an essential balanced diet to fulfill nutritional requirements for your body and this recipe works for everyone, even if you're a beginner and absolutely have no idea on how to cook. It can be used as a meal as well as a snack, or after a workout as a protein supplement for preventing muscle loss. It can be used to gain muscle mass and healthy weight and with some changes it can also be used as a diet food. You can also use this recipe as a lunch box snack or as a meal for your growing kids and prevent them from snacking empty calories from Doritos or chips and nachos, or to nourish yourself after a long, tedious day of working. 15 min 20 min 35 min 250 grams of avocado will serve 2 adults Avocado 1 medium of about 250-300gms  Onion 1 medium  Tomatoe 1 medium  Garlic cloves 2 You can add 1 or 2 more if you want a strong garlic flavor but I suggest to not overpower the base with spices    Smoke paprika powder 1 tsp  Tomato ketchup or 1 tbp  lime juice and sugar 1/2 tsp and 1/2 tbsp each respectively If you don't like ketchup and prefer lemon juice.    Extra virgin or classic olive oil 4-5 tbsp or 3 tbsp If you want to gain weight and like your onions to be roasted to a perfect brown- add more oil but if you're a weight watcher or like your onions a bit half cooked and light pinkish- add 3 tbsp of oil Salt As per taste, I used 1/2 Tsp     Cheddar cheese grated As per the taste requirements, about 50-100 gms To garnish Tomato ketchup  For garnishing Pine nuts & cashew nuts (roasted or raw, according to your taste preferences) about a fistful, finely chopped To give a crunch to the creamy mixture of avocado and cheese You can add green chutney (if you can but it from a Indian store or know how to make it) to the scooped avocado to make it more green and delicious. But it's completely optional* Sautéing garlic, onions, tomatoes in olive oil 7. Mix properly the avocado mixture so that the salt and spices are incorporated perfectly in the scooped avocado. 8. Now add a bit of tomato ketchup or lemon juice with sugar to it so that the slight bitter and smelly taste of avocado is offset by a bit sourness and sweetness to make it palatable.  Pouring the tempering over scooped avocado. 9. Now take some wholegrain, roasted crackers (I used khakhras- an Indian roasted whole wheat crisp that comes in varieties of savory flavors). 10. Now spoon some prepared avocado mixture on it, covering the cracker generously with it. 11. Add some grated cheddar cheese on it ( As avocado is very bland and buttery, a savory and salty cheese like cheddar would go well with it). 12. Add some finely chopped pine nuts and cashew nuts on it. 13. Finally drizzle some tomato ketchup on it. *Optional*- If you can, visit an Indian store and buy fine gram flour noodles called 'nylon sev' which will give it the final crunch and also buttery savory texture. And voila! You have a perfect post- workout/ post work meal or snack at home which is nourishing, nutritious, light yet filling and satisfying to your gut health. Note: Scoop the avocado just when you are about to eat so that it stays fresh, doesn't lose it's color, taste and smells good with all it's nutrition intact. *If you are a weight watcher, avoid drizzling ketchup over cheese and also in the avocado mixture as 1 tbsp of Heinz ketchup has 20 calories* *If you don't eat fried food, avoid sprinkling the fine gram flour noodles for garnishing* Assembling all the recipe components to prepare the Wholesome Avocado meal Tasty and healthy avocado meal ready in a jiffy! This recipe has avocado as a base and hence is rich in healthy fats coming from avocado and nuts, extra virgin olive oil but do not worry as it is a perfect nourishment to your body. It provides all the adequate nutrients and healthy fats needed to sustain a healthy muscle mass and prevent muscle wasting occurred due to exercising in the gym. It also helps in relieving fatigue and stress from the daily life. After all, to sustain a healthy life and to be energetic throughout your life, a proportionate amount of healthy fats are necessary.

934,The Best Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe,food," Chris enjoys sharing his experiences and thoughts with others in the hopes that by sharing, they will help someone else. Many chocolate chip cookie recipes are good, this one has the best consistency of any that I have made and tastes great. The consistency that this recipe offers allows you to make the best chocolate chip cookie ever. Because it gives you the foundation to change the recipe slightly to suit your tastes. This is important to make recipes to suit you and your family and friends. 20 min 10 min 30 min Dependent on Cookie Size The original recipe called for 10 minutes at 350°F. Here is what I have found, with my oven: My family prefers the 10 minutes at 350°F, but I prefer 10 minutes at 375°F. This cookie is best about an hour after baking. It has a firmness throughout but still remains slightly soft. This is a cookie that is firm that your teeth sink into and melts in your mouth slightly.

935,"10 Kitchen Essentials That You Might Not, but Should Have in Your Kitchen",food," Even though Abby Slutsky owns a bakery,  she enjoys finding a balance between nutritional foods and sweets when making family meals. Even if, you not the finest of cooks, certain items are essential for your kitchen. However, this list may also be helpful for those who love to cook  because sometimes fancier does not get the job done. Here is my list of kitchen essential that I would not want to be without. Keep in mind that some of these items are useful to help your cooking and others are items that you will want because they save space or are convenient. You may think it is ridiculous to put this one on the list because everyone has one; however, many people opt for an electric can opener. Having been in the position to lose my electricity for several days at a time, I can tell you that a hand can opener is an essential you do not want to be without. Even better, it does not hog counter space and can be conveniently tucked into a drawer. These little basting brushes come in various sizes. Choosing a silicone one will allow you to brush food with sauce, butter, egg, and other marinades without worrying about little hairs shedding on it. Mine also wash beautifully. These inexpensive items are really ingenious. I have used mine for years, and it was actually a free giveaway at a food show. However, I have to admit that if you can’t find one and happen to workout with loop bands, they will work the same way in a pinch to help you grip your jar. The accuracy of a kitchen scale just cannot be matched with a cup. This is because the weight of dry ingredients varies. You can use strainers for pasta, vegetables, sifting, and other purposes. Special thanks to Katerina Holmes from Pexels for your lovely photo. www.pexels.com This is really a multi-functional item as I use mine to rinse lettuce and berries, sift flour, and strain pasta. Not only do these cups save you money if you use them in lieu of individual coffee pods, you can also use them to make other items in your coffee maker. Try filling one with loose tea. Put a mini muffin paper or a piece of paper towel in the bottom to make cleaning these little treasures a breeze. Jazz up ice cubes for a party with edible flowers, herbs, citrus fruit and other embellishments. With little effort, your drinks will look special. A note of thanks to   cottonbro from Pexels for your lovely photo. www.pexels.com You probably have an ice maker in your refrigerator, so you may be wondering why you would want ice cube trays. These are perfect for making frozen bouillon cubes or creating fancy ice cubes by freezing water around mint or lemon. They add a festive touch to a party without a lot of work. Best of all, if your ice maker happens to break, you won’t be stuck buying bags of ice which can take up a lot of room in your freezer. Believe it or not, a straight edge razer blade is an essential in my kitchen (and not for shaving). Have you ever had splatters of burnt debris on the glass door of your oven? Gently scrape the debris off the oven with the razer blade. If desired, spray some hot water on the debris to loosen it slightly. You will be amazed at how effectively this little and expensive tool can help make the glass on your oven look clean. It is also terrific for scraping dried debris from your refrigerator or freezer shelves. It is easy to find these at hardware or paint stores. Most people keep bandages and antibiotic ointment are an essential for any kitchen. Commercial kitchens almost always have them, but home cooks are more likely to store these items in a bathroom medicine cabinet. Given the sharp knives and other dangerous items in a kitchen, it is convenient to have these items readily available, so you do not have to search for them if you need them. No matter the size of your kitchen, drawer and cabinet space is probably at a premium. A canister style utensil holder allows you to keep large utensils that may hog drawer space out of your drawers. Best of all, you can position it near your stove, so spatulas, soup ladles, and other necessary utensils are within easy reach. You can find these fabulous space savers at discount stores.

937,5 Recommended Halal Places to Eat in Singapore,food," I have been living in Singapore for the past 28 years! A seasoned traveller. I’ll help you fully discover Singapore. Singapore cityscape Would you look at that image? Isn’t Singapore beautiful? There is no doubt that Singapore is on the list of recommended travel destinations. Even if you are not a tourist, here are 5 amazing halal eating places that I recommend. Address: 697-699 North Bridge Rd, Singapore 198675 Opening Hours: 7am — 11pm Located near Sultan Mosque, Zam Zam is one of the well-known Indian Muslim eating places in Singapore. They offer a wide variety of Indian cuisine ranging from Prata to even Maggie Goreng. And their Murtabak is just amazing! Head on down and try some of their items. I’m sure you will not be disappointed with any of them. Address: 791 North Bridge Rd, Singapore 198759 Opening Hours: Monday 11am–3pm, 5:30–11pm Tuesday 11am–3pm, 5:30–11pm Wednesday 11am–3pm, 5:30–11pm Thursday 11am–3pm, 5:30–11pm Friday 11am–3pm, 5:30pm–2am Saturday 11am–2am Sunday 11am–11pm Finding good quality halal dim sum eating places in Singapore is no easy feat. This is because one of the key ingredients of good dim sum is pork, which Muslims are not able to consume. Fret not though. The Dim Sum Place is amongst one of the best halal dim sum restaurants you can ever find in Singapore. The menu is quite extensive Too. Whatever type of dim sum you are craving for, they have it. Not just dim sums, they do have congee and even noodles too. Fancy some burgers? Then look no further than Fat Papas offers some of the best burgers you can get at an affordable price. Their burgers are simply out of this world. The patty is juicy, tender and very well seasoned. For myself, I am not a huge fan of cheese. Despite not being a fan of them, somehow the cheese they used in their burgers are different. They are not as cheesy as normal cheeses. The kind that even I personally dislike. For all you truffle lovers, they even have a Parmesan Truffle Fries. For me, I’m no fan of truffles, so this item is something I will never try, so I can’t really feed back much about it. They do have a beef chilli cheese fries which compliments any burger that you order. It is a must-have if you ever decide to dine in Fat Papas. Doesn’t this look appetising! When one burger is not enough Main entrance to the restaurant Here’s some fine tasting Italian cuisine for you. If you ever have the craving for pasta, simply head down to this restaurant, and they will satisfy all your Italian cravings. They have pasta, pizzas, gnocchi, and many more. They even offer halal wine for those of you who fancy a little wine with your pasta. What makes this restaurant stand out compared to other halal pasta outlets in Singapore is the flavour which you are getting. For almost the same price as other pasta restaurants, you are getting a much better deal due to the flavour. And not forgetting the knowledgable and friendly staff. For us Muslims, we tend to not have much knowledge about wine pairing, the staff there have quite an in-depth knowledge of wine pairing. So, feel free to ask them if you are uncertain which wine will go best with your pasta of choice. Address: They have a few outlets around Singapore. The ones I went to were located at Bussorah Street, Suntec City and Paya Lebar Quarter. BUSSORAH STREET 45 Bussorah Street, Singapore 199463 Daily: 11.00am to 10.00pm (Last order 9.30 pm)  PAYA LEBAR QUARTER #B1-15/16 10 Paya Lebar Road, Singapore 409057 Daily: 11.00am to 10.00pm (Last order 9.30 pm) ​ SUNTEC CITY #B1-135 North Wing, 3 Temasek Boulevard Singapore 038983 Daily: 11.00am to 10.00pm (Last order 9.30 pm)  Of course, I have saved the best for last. You don’t have to be a fan of Japanese cuisine to enjoy dining here. Their ramen selection is top-notch and the value you’re getting is top notched too! As with any Japanese restaurant, you are offered a few choices of sitting arrangements. You could either dine solo in front of the cooks, settle down on conventional chairs, or you could even settle down on their Zashiki. What this means is you are basically sited down on the floor with your shoes off and enjoying your ramen. I had the opportunity to try out 2 of their ramen, and they are indeed amazing. I had their Ichikokudo Ramen Extra Rich and their Ichi Garlic Ramen. Both of these items were extremely flavourful. The garlic however may not be suitable for those of you who do not appreciate too much garlic in your meals. They added tons of garlic in this ramen. We even tried out their fried gyoza which was superb. One thing to note though, their green tea at the paya lebar outlet for some reason was way too diluted. The suntec city outlet and bussorah street were acceptable. Perhaps they off form for that day.

939,How to Complain in a Restaurant,food," Going out to a restaurant is an inescapable part of being today’s average millennial. Some enjoy the meal cooked by anybody else rather than themselves, others simply check-in and make Instagram-stories for their followers. However, spending your precious time in a good restaurant may be ruined by nasty food, a noisy atmosphere, or poor customer service. According to eatanddrink.co.uk, 38% of people would not complain in a restaurant. Dory Brown, a former restaurant manager for the Chart House Chain says: ""A lot of people will just not come back and never say why."" It seems that people are just unaware of how to do it properly, or simply afraid of doing this publicly. Basically, all restaurant complaints can be divided into three types: Pixabay No matter whether it is hair in your food, or a rude server with a lack of communication, the #1 rule is that complaining in a restaurant should be delicate and polite. ""The hardest part of owning a restaurant is dealing with staff"", - says Lorri Mealey, a former restaurant owner. Fotolia If you feel that your complaint against the restaurant has not been taken seriously, you may go and start an online battle. Companies who take care of their online reputation already know the power and influence of online reviews. So there is more possibility, you won’t be ignored. To make your review informative make sure to include the following information: To make your review even more ""powerful"", do not forget to share it via social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. According to J.D. Power, 67% of consumers have used a company’s social media channel for customer service. Statistics show that direct questions or comments on the official company page are more likely to generate a response from the staff than any @tagged mentions. Let’s compare two examples of good and bad customer service on Social Media. While waiting for takeoff in Tampa, Florida, Peter Shankman jokingly asked Morton’s Steakhouse to deliver a porterhouse steak when he landed at Newark airport. Twitter While departing the Newark airport to meet his driver, he was greeted by a Morton’s server with a 24 oz. Porterhouse steak, shrimp, potatoes, and bread – the works. A full meal and no bill. Twitter Marc Orfaly, the chef of Pigalle in Boston, ignored the fact that social media have a way of going viral very quickly. And never, ever being forgotten. After a customer complained about her Thanksgiving meal on Facebook, the chef responded with a ""go f*** yourself"".  Facebook To make things even worse, Pigalle Boston posted the following status on Facebook. This is actually a good example for companies how not to respond to their consumers’ complaints. Facebook If you suspect that food was contaminated and now you became ill after eating in a restaurant, it is better to immediately report this. In order for the USDA to investigate a problem with meat, poultry, or egg products, you must have: Information you should be ready to tell the Hotline on the phone includes: If you would like to report a restaurant you should contact the local (county or city) health department. Each particular state organization has its own website and phone number. Let’s imagine we would like to report a restaurant in Florida. Go directly to the website of the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation and find the object you would like to file your complaint against from the list. After filing your complaint form, wait until someone from this department reaches out to you. Usually, such organizations have a customer contact center in case you have any questions or need assistance in completing this form. I hope the tips above will not only help you to complain in a restaurant properly but will teach you how to leave it with free champagne and a dish named after you as an apology.  © 2021 Helen D"

941,The Art and Science of 'Ghevar' - Rajasthan's Traditional Sweet Delicacy,food," Chef Susheel Joshi
Chef Instructor
Culinary Academy Of India India has an extraordinarily diverse food culture – be it sweet or savoury. And sweets are integral to any and every celebration in the country. From birthdays to festivals, sweets help bring out the essence of celebrations in any region. There’s also another thing to keep in mind about desserts, this being, traditional recipes are complex in terms of technique and require a lot of practice to get right. This means that the ‘Halwai’ who makes the dish the correct way, is treated as a master craftsperson who spend years working on their skills. Though there are many easy to make desserts, traditional ones require a lot more skill. Ghevar, is one such dish. But before we get into the details of this traditional recipe, let’s know a bit about this mouth-watering dessert. Now is a great time to point out that Ghevar is not just a simple dessert picked up from the local Halwai at a bargained price, but one of international culinary prominence. In fact, it is one of only conventional Indian dishes that looks at culinary molecular gastronomy and tries to build on its scientific principles. This was highlighted by Chef Gaggan Anand, a Michelin-star chef serving progressive Indian cuisine who used a ‘Savoury Cheese Ghevar’ in his 15-course tasting menu. This process involves pumping the Ghevar batter using a siphon gun, frying it and topping it with grated cheddar. Originally from Rajasthan, and made using common ingredients like flour, ghee, sugar, water and at times, milk, Ghevar is popular among other Indian states as well like Haryana, Delhi, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh – each of whom have their own take on this dessert. This dish is primarily made during Teej or Raksha Bandhan. If you’re wondering why it’s made during this time, then the answer is sure to leave you puzzled. Ayurveda. Yes, you read it right, ayurveda. Teej usually falls between July-August when the seasons change which can make humans irritable, restless and eat less. The highly sweet Ghevar, alongside Rabadi provide relieve from acidity and help the mood during this weather change. After all, who doesn’t feel nice after eating deliciously rich dessert? Coming to the process, the ingredients are basic which means it all boils down to how well you can get that honeycomb-net like structure with a proper hole in the centre. Ghevar batter is a mixture of cold ghee, water/milk, and refined flour. As a quick trick, you can cream the butter with some ice cubes until it becomes creamy, light and fluffy. This method results in an emulsified batter. The runny batter is then poured into the hot ghee 7-10 inches above the ghee surface. The high moisture ratio in the batter helps in creating the honeycomb like structure as the water evaporates leaving the flour based body with air pockets. As the batter continues to fry, the discs attain a golden brown colour which make this recipe look even more appetizing. This may sound like a cakewalk, however, it is anything but. And so far, we’ve only made the traditional disc base … so how do we make this extra mouth-watering? Pretty simple really. Stack the Ghevar discs on top of each other and pour thick sugar syrup all over it. Traditionally cardamom flavoured sugar syrup is poured, but a lot of modern variations are available in stores today. Talking about variations there are many different yet traditional versions of the Ghevar like Mawa Ghevar or Malai Ghevar, where the base and the sugar syrup remains the same but a topping either made with malai or khoya is added. To add more visual appeal, ingredients like saffron, dry fruits and edible silver warq/leaf are commonly used. Today, Ghevar is tremendously popular across stores as more Halwai’s commercialise the dish. This shift has made culinarians create, innovate and play with the flavours and the presentation style. From a bite-sized Ghevar to a thalli size Ghevar with unique flavours like rose, berry, mango or custard. In fact, even savoury ghevar is something people are willing to try Sounds interesting right! Well, what’re you waiting for, Rakshabhandan is round the corner so try your hand in making this exceptional dessert at home for your family! © 2021 BrandCai"

943,Cheese Dip - Char's Best Recipe,food," This is quite tasty with Doritos dipped. I have had dollops on a piece of bread. It also tastes good on club crackers. I had a one pound package of frozen ground beef. I put it in the microwave for 30 seconds. It seemed softened. Another 30 seconds and it was ready for the frying pan. I sliced off three slices of onion. I minced the pieces and added it to the ground beef. Then, sprinkled Mrs. dash and seasoned salt across the surface of the beef. Then, I let it dry. There were a few large chunks which I broke smaller with a wooden spatula. Cook it until the beef has completely changed color from red to a grey. Browned, they call it. Once the beef is cooked. Get rid of excessive grease. This did not have any, so there was no draining. Mix in salsa and cheese sauce. Bring to  bubbling boil, stirring the bubbles around. The cheese will merge with the tomatoes and will become a rusty color. Then let cool, and eat with your favorite cracker or chip."

946,Is Canning Food Healthy?,food," Misbah loves to cook — she Is a home cook, who hates to waste food. She loves to try tips and tricks in her kitchen. Canning Photo by Brooke Lark on Store stalls are stocked with a wide variety of canned products, but they often find it difficult to surpass their handmade garden, orchard, or forest goodies. At the moment, nature has pampered us abundantly with them, so the host often has questions: what not to forget when preparing vegetable stocks for the winter and what method of preservation to choose? Canning promotes good bacterial growth. ""We are used to ferment the cucumber and cabbage, but the range of fermented vegetables can be much wider: carrots, zucchini, pumpkins, tomatoes, and beets are also suitable for fermentation,"" says Vaida Kurpienė, a specialist in healthy nutrition. Canning is one of the most effective and healthy ways to preserve or even enhance the good qualities of vegetables. Pickled vegetables contain more vitamins and antioxidants. For example, sauerkraut, according to a health nutritionist, contains even more vitamin C than fresh. Eating vegetables, treated in this way enhances the immune system, improves the absorption of various substances, reduces inflammation in the body. Canned foods are a convenient and affordable source of essential nutrients. The specialist assures us that by eating at least some fermented food every day, we can help protect against various diseases. ""It is said that a good balance of intestinal bacteria can even improve the mood, which is relevant in the run-up to autumn when people are often overwhelmed with nostalgic moods,"" says the specialist, who admits that so far only isolated studies have shown this. The interlocutor emphasizes the uniqueness of sour vegetables: “They contain probiotics and prebiotics, also known as good bacteria"". Our microflora in each body is different, individual, like a fingerprint. It is recommended to grow as many vegetables as possible and eat them frequently but in small quantities. ""Canning requires salt, so for those who are prone to swelling, have higher blood pressure or other cardiovascular or kidney diseases, a large amount of salt consumed at one time can harm, do more harm than good to these good bacteria."" In any case, according to V. Kurpienė, the benefits are provided not by a single consumption of fermented food.""This is better, more often, but less like a spoon,” he says. Food Preservation A friend of all vegetables ""We are used to ferment cucumbers and cabbage, but the range of fermented vegetables can be much wider,"" says V. Kurpienė. The interlocutor mentions carrots, zucchini, pumpkins, tomatoes and beets as particularly good fermenting vegetables. True, when it comes to vegetables and greens, it’s hard to name at least one that couldn’t be fermented. It is only important to remember that the condition of freshness is very important for this method of food processing, so it is necessary to carefully inspect for any spoiled or softened vegetables among the harvested vegetables. The fresher the vegetables, the more likely it is that your yeast will succeed perfect. The important composition when buying ""When buying fermented products, attention should be paid to the composition”. A New York Times blogger, discussing the 2007 study, said: “Despite their reputation, canned fruits and vegetables retain many of their nutrients, in some cases better than fresh produce does.” During industrial fermentation, sugar is often added to the fermentation, and vinegar is added,” says the specialist. True, we also notice that some people who prepare vegetables for the winter at home also do not avoid these two harmful ingredients that speed up the canning process. Rock Salt Facts you need to know 1) Too much sodium can lead to health problems like high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease and kidney disease. 2) Healthy adults need only 1500 mg of sodium per day. 3) Healthy children need only 1000 to 1500 mg of sodium per day. Rock salt is best suited for the preparation of yeast, which not only flavors, but also gives the vegetables an appetizing crunch. Another important recommendation is not to use chlorinated water. The ideal choice would be a clean spring, borehole, or tap water. To prevent fermented vegetables from rising to the surface, do not forget to press them. It is not necessary to ferment vegetables in barrels or cans. Vegetables can also be added to jars of various sizes. “Even before the canning process, the vegetables can be placed directly from the jar into the plate. If the jars are bigger, the vegetables can be layered. And if their capacity is small, you can add less, but more different vegetables, which will not only be delicious, but will also decorate your home,"", the woman shares kitchen tips  AARP Magazine.

948,"What Is “yee Sang”, the Malaysian Appetizer for Chinese New Year",food," Before pursuing his education, Nigel was a cook for two years in several restaurants specializing in Malaysian and international cuisine. Homemade ""yee sang"" Kellysiewcooks.com Chinese New Year falls on 12 and 13th February in 2021, the first cultural celebration of the year in Malaysia which is celebrated mainly by the Chinese but everyone else participates in the celebration as well. “Yee Sang” was a dish brought over to Malaya during the influx of Chinese migrants. However, you won’t expect that this modern Chinese dish is created by a person from Seremban, Malaysia in the 1940s by a man named Loke Ching Fatt. Back in China, raw fish cuisine was a popular dish thousands of years prior which died down by the early 20th century. To cut the story short, Cantonese and Hokkien people of China brought the reminiscence of the dish to Malaya (the former name for Malaysia) and created the “Yee Sang” we know today. There are other origin stories as well, some say that the “Yee Sang” were created by Singaporeans instead. Several news articles wrote that Singapore created the “Yee Sang” by Singapore’s four master chefs nicknamed “Four Heavenly Kings” which made its official debut in 1964 in Lai Wah Restaurant in Singapore. However, its safe to say that this dish was created in the South East Asian region when Chinese Migrants moved to Malaya and Singapore and it is loved by the communities of both multi-racial countries. Several ways ""Yee Sang"" is prepared Klook Here’s a short section, before we begin, let’s start with translating the two words of “Yee Sang”.  Yee or Yu means fish and Sang or Shang means raw, so the full translation is Raw Fish. “Yee Sang” is basically a Raw Fish salad. Besides being raw fish, the dish is also known as Prosperity ""Yee Sang"" as the whole dish itself consists of meaning behind its ingredients, which i will explain more later. The ingredients of Yee Sang Mashable SEA When it comes to ingredients in a “Yee Sang”, it’s pretty much versatile as different restaurants serve different versions of the “Yee Sang”, for instance, a Japanese Restaurant has their own version of “Yee Sang” seen in the picture above. Well, here’s a breakdown of the usual ingredients we’ll find in a “Yee Sang” ""yee Sang"" being tossed Mashable SEA Raw Fish Is added as a symbol for an abundant year ahead, fish is the main star of the show hence why it is associated with abundance. Pomelo fruit or Lime is usually added to the fish as a symbol to add luck and auspicious value to the year, directly translated from the Chinese term, it means, Good luck and smooth sailing. Pepper is dashed all over the dish as a symbol of hope in attracting money and wealth for the year, after directly translated from the Chinese term, it means, Attract wealth and treasures. Oil is poured all over the ingredients in circles as a symbol of encouraging money flow from all directions which after translating from the Chinese term, it means, numerous sources of wealth. Carrots are considered blessings of good luck, carrots are added to the dish to say, good luck to everyone, it means good luck is approaching in the Chinese term. Shredded green radish is a symbol of youth and it is added to represent youthfulness. In the Chinese term, after translating, it means, forever young. White radish symbolises prosperity, for which, the significance of white radish in this dish is to wish everyone prosperity in business, school or work. In Chinese term, it means, Progress at a fast pace or reaching a higher level with each step. Flour crackers that are served alongside the Yee Sang Kum Thim Food Industries Peanut Crumbs are added to the dish as a symbol of a household filled with gold and silver. Sesame seeds are added to the dish as a symbol of wishing everyone a flourishing business and a prosperous year ahead for one’s business and other endeavours. The sauce of this dish, also known as the “Yee Sang” sauce is made from Plum Sauce which will be drizzled all over the dish as a symbol of wishing someone may life always be sweet. The last component to this dish is the deep-fried flour crisps in a shape of pillow, which symbolises the wishes of everyone having a floor filled with gold. IOI City Mall Since “Yee Sang” is a type of salad, therefore, it is commonly served as an appetizer right before a heavy meal. So, “Yee Sang” is a seasonal dish and it is only served throughout the Chinese New Year Period which usually falls on January or February once a year. Traditionally, “Yee Sang” is served during reunion dinners the day before the first day of Chinese New Year and throughout the 15 days after the first day, however, many people have at least 4 rounds of “Yee Sang” a year, with their families, friends, colleagues and more friends. Most companies in Malaysia hold Chinese New Year gatherings right before the New Year Eve, so most restaurants start serving “Yee Sang” at least a week or two before the first day. Besides that, many people do homemade “Yee Sang” to be sold to anyone throughout the period. © 2021 Nigel Koay"

950,Coconut Uses,food," Coconut (Cocos nucifera) is a fruit which comes from the coconut palm and many uses, both as a nutritional health food and for medicinal purposes. Coconut is rich in fibre and vitamins and minerals including copper, calcium, iron, manganese, magnesium, and zinc. I personally love anything coconut, although it seems to be one of those foods which people either love or absolutely detest. Coconut meat tastes lovely, it is slightly sweet, and it can be eaten either raw or dried. There are many products that are produced from using coconut, including water, cream, milk and oil. There are so many uses for coconut, the list is almost endless! Let’s take a look at some of the features and benefits of coconut and coconut products 1 Coconut Water Coconut water is the clear liquid found inside immature coconuts. As the coconut matures, that water then is replaced by the coconut meat. Coconut water isn’t the same as coconut milk – the milk from coconuts is produced from the grated meat of coconuts that have already matured. The water from coconuts is used as a beverage and as a solution for treating dehydration related to diarrhoea or exercise and is rich in carbohydrates and electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, and magnesium . 2 Coconut Oil for Skin Coconut oil is derived from the kernels, meat, and milk of the coconut palm and fruit. The oil has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties and even works well as a skin moisturizer and can help with rashes or inflammation or small cuts. There are even reports online that coconut oil can help with earaches, although it’s best to visit the doctor first for a consultation, of course.  #3 Coconut Oil for Skin Coconut oil is derived from the kernels, meat, and milk of the coconut palm and fruit. The oil has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties and even works well as a skin moisturizer and can help with rashes or inflammation or small cuts. There are even reports online that coconut oil can help with earaches, although it’s best to visit the doctor first for a consultation, of course.  4 Coconut Oil for Teeth If you would really love to help whiten your teeth, coconut oil is great. It can be mixed with bicarb soda into a paste for brushing, and you can also perform what’s known as oil swishing (or oil pulling) to help with teeth whitening and fresh breath. It’s very healthy for the mouth as it helps to kill bacteria along the gum line. Swishing is done by putting a spoon of coconut oil in your mouth and simply swishing it around for 10-20 minutes. When you’re finished, spit the oil into a trash bin (don’t swallow it, because while you’re swishing you are also pulling toxins from your body.) Don’t spit it out into the sink because once it is cold it will harden and may cause clogging.  #5 Coconut Oil for Cooking and Baking Coconut oil may be used as a substitute for butter, margarine, shortening, or vegetable oil in cooking and baking. It’s great to grease your cooking pans and has natural health benefits compared to saturated fats. #6 Coconut Flour A unique alternative to wheat flour, coconut flour is popular people who cannot tolerate gluten, and also among low-carb enthusiasts. Aside from being nutritious, coconut flour can also be beneficial in promoting blood sugar stability, better digestion, heart health, and even weight loss. #7 Coconut Milk and Cream A great alternative to cow’s milk, coconut milk and cream is fantastic for those who suffer from lactose intolerance. I love it in cereal and even use it in my coffee, I actually prefer the taste compared to cow’s milk. I’ve made delicious coconut ice cream in my ice cream maker, and it’s just the perfect match for strawberries. #8 Coconut Shampoo, Soaps and Lotions Shampoos and soaps that are made with coconut ingredients are also a favourite of mine. They usually have a deliciously sweet scent and I find they are a great moisturiser for hair and skin as well. Body lotions and hand creams are also available that are made form coconut – even lip balm made from coconut is a great alternative to those who might suffer allergies to bees wax products on their lips. Coconut oil, used on its own, can also be a great moisturising treatment for dry hair. Instead of using a store bought oil treatment for your hair, try using virgin coconut oil instead. #9 Coconut Oil Protective Skin Barrier I have a family member that currently is required to wear a mask during work hours, and she was experiencing problems with her lips becoming inflamed. Since coconut oil has anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties, I suggested she try rubbing the oil around her mouth to act as a barrier, and it has made a world of difference, she is no longer having issues with inflammation, so for people who might suffer from something similar, it’s worth a try."
951,"How Humidity, Moisture and Temperature Affect the Baked Products",food," Chef Gnanesh -Chef Instructor
working at Culinary Academy Of India The production of baked items such as bread, cakes, biscuits, and pastries is a multi-step process between which significant activity happens. The stages of mixing, forming, proving, baking and cooling are chief among them. Bread and other baked goods are hyper sensitive to changes in temperature and humidity. Humidity and temperature are critical factors to keep in mind while baking as these help determine the overall quality of the product. Thus, it is worthwhile to be knowledgeable about the various effects of humidity and temperature while baking. Energy, in the form of heat, is transferred to the product which causes the dough/batter temperature to rise. This results in physicochemical changes such as water or ethanol evaporation, expansion of gases, starch gelatinization, protein denaturation and Millard browning. Owing to the drying nature of the baking step, water migrates from the product’s interior to the dough surface. Evaporation in the baking chamber increases the humidity. Improper temperatures can negatively impact the quality of the baked product. During bread cooling, a large temperature gradient can develop between the crust and the crumb. As cooling continues, this gradient reduces gradually and eventually reaches zero. Temperature for variety bread such as rye breads should be lower, around 90°F (or at 32°C). Such temperatures are recommended due to the product’s tendency to turn gummy.. After blast-freezing, frozen dough pieces should maintain the product’s core temperature within the range of 10°F to 0°F (or at -12°C to -18°C). Oven temperature is the other key baking parameter in addition to humidity. It can be measured, modified, and controlled in order to influence process conditions directly; thereby, having a direct bearing on a product’s final characteristics. Oven temperature causes physical transitions and chemical reactions to occur in the dough/batter. The following stages are temperature-dependent, which participates in the sequential transformation of bread dough: In addition to temperature, if the humidity level prior to the molding process was too low, a skin of dry dough can form on the outer surface. This skin makes it harder for the dough to increase its volume during its subsequent process called proving.

962,Cold Food Plating: Techniques and Tips,food," Chef Ravi Kumar Reddy Varikuti  works as a Garde Manger-Chef Instructor at Culinary Academy Of India Artistic, appropriate placement of foods, accompaniments and garnishes on a food plate – this is what food plating is about. And a creative plate of food can sometimes be all the difference between a good meal and a great meal. Food plating requires a creative, calculated approach and a lot of care goes into this process of creating the right look. But why do we plate food? What are the goals? Simply put, food presentation can greatly elevate or deflate your dining experience. At a core level it boils down to this - a neatly decorated plate of food increases the visual appeal, thereby stimulating appetite and increasing the satisfaction derived while eating and once done. However, it’s not only about looking good. One has to consider all different human senses at work and the food plate needs to add harmony across all these senses. In short, food plating always follows a very strong culinary logic.  Now let’s take a look at how food plating impacts all our senses: 3.Taste: Everyone wants to eat food that tastes amazing. But there’s also hard lines chef need to draw to assure palatability and presentation. So while plating, you can’t simply put things that look good and colorful. There needs to be a taste and flavor balance across the dish as well. 4.Touch: Sticky cutlery and crockery reduces the appeal of the entire plate, even if you’ve cooked the best looking meal and presented it well. And while plating, removing grease, sauce and oil stains and other splash marks goes a long way in reducing this unappetizing sensation. 5.Sound: Slightly away from the core of plating but equally important in restaurant behavior, especially when you consider guests order what “sounds good”. Detailing a recipe can go a long way in increasing its appeal and order rate. To cater to your senses, there’s a lot of different ideologies you can apply. Below are a few basic ideas and techniques you could try while plating cold food: Service Plate – Choosing the right style of plate is essential. The plate should not be too big or small. It shouldn’t be dotted or really colorful either. Table size and shape matters too. Color – A cornerstone of good plating, fresh and vibrant colors go as far as affecting the human psychology of hunger. A unique, never seen before colored plate always looks like a must try in front of colors you’re used to seeing commonly. So be sure to add beautiful colors to your plate.. Texture – The “tongue-feel” of your plate is super important and that’s where textures come in. Texture is how one differentiates between a potato mash and potato fries, and using the same ingredient in different textures makes the plate look and taste more appetizing. Focal point – Build your plate around a focal point. Constructing the rest of the dish around this means you’ve a great starting point to begin with.  The best part, there’s no set rules about this so you can keep it where ever you’d like in whatever shape you want. Garnish – A garnish acts as an accent to the focal point, and is always edible. Here’s where the principle of “being there because it looks good” comes in. A garnish must be present to first enhance the flavor of the dish, and never for decoration alone. Portion Size – Never serve more. A good way to calculate this is by using the plate logic which goes, 2/3rd filled and 1/3rd empty. Serving too much, or too little can take you away from the food experience or make you love-regret each bite you take respectively. Never serve less either. Temperature – Temperature is of paramount importance for cold plating. Keeping plates in chillers and laying out meats on ice beds can go a long way in ensuring longevity and safety of the produce. Research has shown that the human body experiences the world sight first, and then uses the other senses to confirm or contradict what it has seen. When food is approached this way, plating becomes significantly important – and this science is why individuals are willing to pay unreasonable prices for simple foods. It must also be said that no plating technique is perfect on its own and there’s no only correct way to plate a dish. Iterating and innovating are supremely important here, and by visualizing and drawing out a rough sketch, you can get an idea of the direction you’re heading with your plate. Just remember to keep it simple and creative.  And don’t get too attached to preserving your plating. Remember, “It’s only when plates return empty that a chef knows they’ve done a good job.” This content is accurate and true to the best of the author’s knowledge and is not meant to substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional. © 2021 BrandCai Shivthakur27@yahoo.co.in on February 06, 2021: This is i an eye opener....very academic approach and good for students who will learn the art of making cold plates.

966,Crayfish or Crawfish?,food," Kenneth, born and raised in the South, resides in Hamilton, Alabama. He enjoys sharing his unique perspectives on life through his writing. Crawfish can be somewhat mean if pushed too far. Crayfish are fresh water crustaceans resembling small lobsters. In some parts of the United States, they have various names such as crawfish, craydids, crawdaddies, crawdads, freshwater lobsters, mountain lobsters, mudbugs, or yabbies. I'd say that crayfish are so famous that they have this many names. Obviously, these ""critters"" are found in many seafood restaurants across the nation and the crayfish have almost-numerous fans in this complex query: is it CRAY-fish or CRAW-fish? I'd like to know. To-MATO or To-MAY-to, let's call the whole thing off! That is what it amounts to. But do not try to convince fans of this fresh water crustacean that it is a snack food. No. Cray or Crawfish can and does make an entire meal by those who drive for miles to get to eat some of these delicious crawdaddies, just wanted to honor them by using one of their many names. This is getting out of hand. Some days we have to decide. Our country is spread with Democrats and Republicans, so let's divide-up. You take the CRAY-fish and my team and I  will take the CRAW-fish, we can have this huge crawfish boil and have one great time. We can eat until we pass out on ""Mr. Lawson's"" perfectly-manicured front lawn. Crayfish can be cooked in an iron skillet. ⦁ Secure the crawfish on both sides of the tail joint. Thumbs should be on one side of the crawfish's shell and the index fingers need to be on the opposite side.⦁ Now with a twisting movement, snap the head from the tail.⦁ You can, but it's not required,: suck the yellow material, named as ""crawfish butter,"" from the crawfish head.⦁ Trash the head, using your thumbs, peel the shell from the widest part of the tail, the same way as you peel shrimp.⦁ With one hand, hold the tail, pull the tail meat with your other hand. Enjoy! You can boil the crawfish and it is the easy way to cook the tiny crawfish to excellence of taste. Simply bring a large pot of water to boil, then stir in a package of mixed crawfish boil spices, which are available at most grocery stores. Add crawfish to the pot, boil the crawfish for 15 minutes. Heat needs to be turned down to simmer then cook the crawfish another 15 minutes. Be pateient! Add potatoes, corn, cut-up spicy sausages, to the boiling water when you add the crawfish for a w It's Time to EAT! Q.) Will my friends think that I am a dork for eating crawfish? A.) Some, yes. But overall, no. My advice is for you to grit your teeth, peel your crayfish if you are with friends in a favorite seafood restaurant and have fun. Maybe some of these throwing insults at you will become ""Crawfish Lovers."" Q.) If I am a first-time crayfish eater and do not know how to peel or eat them, should I go ahead anyway knowing that my steady girlfriend, who is a pro crayfish eater, will take a dim view of my first-time to eat these delicious redbugs? A.) So what if she does take a dim view of you being a first-time crayfish eater. Just remember, ""there's a lot more crawfish in the river."" Q.) Do you think that I will be silly in buying myself some crayfish and giving them names and not eating them? A.) Yes. on the care and feeding of crayfish and to be totally-respective, crawfish, but honestly, I am not. I recall that the very first crawfish that I ate, I messed-up terribly. Family members around me at the table looked in amazement at how I was fumbling to peel these delicious crustaceans, and I am grateful that they loved me more than they laughed at me. On the second trip to this seafood restaurant, I ordered the seafood buffet and when the many aluminum serving trays of crayfish were handed out . . .I stopped and looked for a moment, then walked on to pick-out a couple of fine, whole catfish. No problem. No peeling. No learning how to eat. January 31, 2021 . . . .Happy 1st Day of February Came and Went! Wow!

968,Building Salads,food," Author is  Chef Syed Abdul Attique 
works  as Chef Instructor at
Culinary Academy Of India A 'plate of mixed greens' is the sole food or a blend of various nourishments that go with or held along with a dressing. The fundamental parts of a plate of mixed greens are the base, the body, the topping, and the dressing. Salads can be served as appetizer, accompaniment, main course salads, and separate course or even as dessert. It's predominant to eat an assortment of new foods grown from the ground, in whatever number various shade as could be allowed. Consolidating them in a plate of mixed greens is both simple and scrumptious! Stacked with nutrients and minerals, eating a plate of mixed greens a day will likewise build the degree of amazing cell reinforcements in your blood and nutrition. Serving of mixed greens assumes a significant job in any feast. Any Indian meal is incomplete without serving healthy salad dishes. We devour different food things on everyday schedule and none of them is as significant as salad. That’s why salad is considered as a very important part of our meal. It is advised to eat a healthy salad on daily basis; it may be vegetable salad, fruit salad, mixed salad, etc. People are living a strenuous life and healthful food is a fundamental marvel that gives multivitamins to our body. Everyone has different tastes and palate for food, when building a salad one has to follow and adhere to cuisine ethics and basic norms for which a salad is created. Plate of mixed greens is a stunning treat to the taste buds. If we observe there are certain nations where people refuse to eat on dining tables, if serving of mixed greens are not offered in their dinner. You can make assortment of solid and delectable servings of mixed greens, it is consistently prudent to go with the dietary and diet plate of mixed greens in your daily feast. Everyone has different tastes and palate for food, when building as salad on has to follow and adhere to cuisine ethics and basic norms for which a salad is created. Culinary ethics and fundaments have to be in place for any food creation or building for example, basil, pasta, tomatoes, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic or zucchini which typically relate to Italians and a salad made form them should predominantly have those ingredients which are typical Italian. Similar if one uses Lavash and fattoush herb spring and so on with the salad, it can be identified as Lebanese or middle eastern salad. Whereas if blue cheese, brie if used in dressing would make a salad French. Sweet chili sauce, shredded coconut, blue swimmer crab is Thai in its nature. So it is significant to follow certain ethics of the original cuisine while making salads. Next important thing to keep in mind while building salad is that and an appetizer salad should stimulate the appetite and have fresh, crisp ingredients such as cheese, ham, salami, shrimp, or vegetables lightly coated with flavorful dressing, Appetizer salads should be substantial, but not filling. Complementary salads should be tasty and should balance and complement the rest of the meal.  On the other hand a main course salad should be large enough to serve as a whole meal.  It should contain protein ingredients, such as meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, legumes, or cheese etc.  It should also contain a variety of vegetables, greens, and /or fruits and has to be filling in nature. Separate course salads would be used to cleanse the palate after a rich dinner and before dessert.  This means they are built to refresh or stimulate a person’s appetite for the dessert or next course. They are often served in classic French meals. Heavy dressings made with mayonnaise or sour cream should be avoided for separate course meals as the dessert is yet to follow in the meal. The salad can also be served as a dessert course for which dessert salads are usually sweet, often containing fruits, sweetened gelatin, nuts, cream, and or sweet cream Select the right size dish / plate / bowl / food surface and keep the salad off the rim if possible. Keep the arrangement simple. Try to add some height or mounded ingredients to your plate so that all colour of ingredients are not only visible but they look excellent and very appetizing to eat. The chef has to be very creative in building his own combination of ingredients as to what should be the base of salad, body, dressing or even garnish. Practice should be to maintain a good balance of color.  Too many colors are sometimes unappetizing. Cut the required ingredients pieces neatly and uniformly, in pieces that are easily recognizable. Overlap slices or wedges and making it exclusive meal an experience for the guest. The salad dressing is a liquid or semi-liquid, sauce or even gravy which is used to flavour, moisten, or enrich the salad. It should upgrade or supplement the plate of mixed greens fixings, yet not overwhelm them. Since most serving of mixed greens dressing is served new, instead of cooked, the nature of the dressing relies upon the nature of ingredients and the available standard material. Dips and condiments can also be given separately allowing people to construct their own salad and dressing, this gives more personal touch and this can be more specific to their taste and preference. Salad bars have become very popular now a days as they provide lettuce, chopped tomatoes, assorted raw, sliced vegetables, cucumbers, carrots, celery, olives and green or red peppers , dried bread croutons, bacon bits, shredded cheese, and various types of salad dressing so the salad can be built by self as per his / her need and requirement.

Although it can be filled with anything, one of the most famous options is the pierogi ruskie (""Russians"") that we are going to make.  === for padding === 500 gr white cheese (cottage cheese I used) 500 gr potatoes 3 onions 1 tablespoon Butter 2 teaspoons Salt Pepper  === for mass === 500 gr flour 80 gr Butter 200 ml Hot water 2 teaspoons Salt 4.Peel the potatoes, cut them into thin slices and boil them in plenty of salty water. 5.Meanwhile, we peel the onions and chop them in ""brunoise"" in not very small pieces. In a pan we put a little butter and brown the onion over medium heat. We brown it a point more than normal, that some pieces are dark. We set aside some in a small bowl to decorate the finished dish. 6.The moment to stop cooking the potatoes will be determined by their hardness. We need them a little harder than for mashing; We can mash them with a fork but not completely pulverize them. 7.In a large bowl we crumble the cheese, and add the onion, potatoes, two teaspoons of salt and pepper to taste. 8.Remember that almost all the flavor of the dish will come out of the filling, so do not cut yourself by giving it one more pinch of salt or pepper if it needs it. When the filling is ready, we reserve. 9.We get the dough for the wafers by putting the flour in a bowl, and making a hole in the center (volcano). We put the butter inside and pour out the hot water. Then with a fork we begin to mix from the inside out. 10.When the fork is no longer useful due to the solidity of the mixture and the water no longer burns, we remove the entire contents of the bowl on a very clean table and work on it, kneading with our hands until we have a homogeneous paste. 11.The dough is too large to roll out in one piece. We make two halves and each of them we spread it on the table with a rolling pin as much as we can. The thickness of the wafers should be less than one millimeter. 12.From this moment until when we boil the pierogi it is very important to conserve the humidity of the dough. For this we will work quickly and we will always keep any portion of dough and wafers with which we are not working covered with a clean cloth. 13.Then, with a glass of about 9 cm at the top, we cut the wafers making the most of the spaces between them to waste as little mass as possible. We reserve the already cut wafers always covered with a cloth. 14.With a teaspoon we are calculating the amount of filling that fits in each wafer. It is important that the filling does not overflow! Remember that each pierogi has to survive cooking and then pan. Therefore, the edges of each wafer where we close the pierogi must be clean. 15.The wafer folds and closes. The closure is done by pinching the upper end of the edge with the thumb and index finger, moving the fingers one over the other with light pressure, and repeating this gesture along the edge of the pierogi. Besides closing the pierogi, it gives it a very nice shape. 16.Now you have to boil the pierogi for 10 minutes over medium-high heat in a saucepan that we cover. Before we will have salted the water and added a drizzle of oil. I advise you to put the pierogi in the water before it boils hard; it will help to keep them from opening. 17.They are removed and drained on a cloth that does not release thread (better cotton). 18.Put a little butter in a pan and when it is hot put the pierogi to brown on both sides. 19.They are placed in a bowl and garnished with the reserved onion. 20.You have to eat them hot. Bon Appetite! Or as they say in Poland ... Smacznego © 2021 Disha"
972,Corn on The Cob: It's What Eating You,food," Kenneth is a rural citizen of Hamilton, Ala., and has begun to observe life and certain things and people helping him to write about them. a dinner choice for beef. I believe this one can rval that one. It's the all-American food, the girl next door eats this food, people love this food so much that they almost stand and put their right hand over their heart and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. Maybe not that much, but close. I do have to use realism here. Corn on the cob is one of America's best food items that one can eat. It/s been around since Biblical times. The boy, Joseph, who wore the coat of many colors, taught the (early) Egyptians how to cultivate and save corn in case of a famine. The Egyptians were so grateful and beholding that he was made second in the kingdom. So you see how corn on the cob is so powerful. All that I can say is yummmm. Experts discovered that people living in central Mexico started using corn at least 7000 years ago. Corn was started from a wild grass called teosinte. 7000 years! I told you that corn had been around a long time. If time travel is ever developed, I would lie to travel back just to see how corn was first used and for what. That's just me. As a personal note, I recall the first time that my mom started preparing corn for us and let me tell you, it was one of her finest creations, She would cut the yellow corn into a pan, then put a pat or two of margarine into her iron skillet and allowed the texture of the corn to be soft or what is called, ""creamed corn,"" and I love to this day. But her favorite corn-related item was the corn-on-the-cob. Yes, I loved that as well. Mom would prepare this ""manna from Heaven"" frequently, but especially on the Fourth of July, because as she read somewhere, that it was a traditional dish (among many.) And sure enough, I loved that as well. My thinking is today: show me a pretty girl who eats corn-on-the-cob without gettng any of the kernels or juice on her chin or clothing, and I will show you an industrious woman and someone who needs to be in a leadership position. I mean this, ladies. I'm talking CEO's, judges, publishers, locomotive engineers, principals and many others. and I do not mean to scare you. But if you are a nervous, squeamish, and timid individual, I advise you right now to stick to the creamed corn, and stay away from corn-on-the-cob. I can see this happening. You are a guy, about 22, single and with a college degree working for a major ad agency in New York City. One day, your eyes meets the eyes of this gorgeous brunette and bam! It's love! Just looking at her causes you to make several errors on the projects you were working on. The boss walks briskly to your desk and holds the reports with your errors and before you are cursed-out, you tell him, it's my fault for making these errors, but you see, sir? That gorgeous brunette over there caught my attention, and well, I was shaken-up."" The boss laughs like a wild donkey that has swigged tequila. ""well, son. That is okay. This time. But watch those errors or it's your job, girl or not,"" the boss advises and rebukes you at the same time. You straighten up. It's your career after all. You find out later that the girl is really the boss' grand baby who is on summer vacation from Brown University, and the boss does not know that she is working in your company. You ask no questions. Then proceed to do some chit, chat, small talk and bam! You and her are set for Saturday night at Chicago's finest restaurant. You do not worry. You always carry cash. And you really have it bad for this girl. Fact is, you were shaving before your date and cut your jaw and it bled so much that it made you faint. (Friend, remember what I have just said about bleeding so much that you feel faint.) to be a he-man and not show fear. But the gorgeous bruette has a trick up her thick hair. She starts the contest as she asks, ""do you like corn-on-the-cob? I love it!"" You are stunned. ""Uhhh, sure. I guess,"" you halfway answer. ""Oh, I did spend some time when I was a boy on my grandpa's farm, and he grew corn and I ate some that grandma made for me, so yes, I pride myself on knowing about corn."" ""But, sweetie, what about corn-on-the-cob? You said that you knew about corn, so I challenge you to a corn-on-the-cob eating contest, and the winner not only pays for my dinner, but promises me that you will not call or come by my house because during the first minutes when you picked me up, I pegged you as a true panty-waist, afraid of his shadow, so let's get started,"" The gorgeous brunette snaps. She demands that the waiter bring you and her a dozen cobs of fresh corn-on-the-cob , so she can show you just how good of a corn-on-the-cob eater that she really is.riHonestly, for someone who hasn't had that much experience with corn-on-the-cob, you start out like a pro. You finish your first cob of corn in less than two minutes. Gorgeous brunette winks at you as she finishes her first cob moments after you. Truthfully, do not feel so supreme. She is setting you up and you are going to lose then head home alone. less than you know about corn-on-the-cob and this eating contest. By now, the entire restaurant is standing around your table--some cheering for the gorgeous brunette and a few for you. (I told you that you need to be ready to lose.) You feel strangely confident as you reach for the second cob of corn and manage to take one bite . . .then it happens! You notice that the gorgeous brunette is slowly licking her second cob of corn and looking at you with those eyes of love and you are about to melt. Don't feel bad. She's a pro. Her exhibition continues as to hypnotize you and she does. But she allows all of that buttery sauce to dribble on her expensive blouse, chin, and what hair she lets fall over her face. And you? You are almost ready to faint. She is now on her sixth-cob of corn. You? Your second cob has yet to be eaten. Poor boy. You should have seen this coming. Your hands shake as you reach for your third cob of corn, only to see gorgeous brunette finish her 12th corn-on-the-cob and as she drops the empty cob to the plate on the table, she looks at you and winks again. Then gives you an air kiss and now, her lower face is thick with the corn juice, but the people who have witnessed you to be beaten like a mutt dog, by this beautiful girl with corn juice and butter all over her face, hands, and the hair she let fall over her face applauds her even louder as she slowly stands up and bows. ""I wish that I had a plate of yellow corn-on-the-cob right now."" — Kenneth Avery The gorgeous brunette is very gracious in her defeating you worse than anyone has ever lost in a contest. But she is not arrogant. She is busy taking her napkin and rubbing her face and hands clean of the corn juice. You do not have to rub on your face that much because you only ate one cob of corn. And to make things worse, the terms of the contest as laid out by gorgeous brunette is honored without you saying a word of complaint. As you slowly shake her hand, you tell her that it was nice to be with you even though it ended badly for you, and you will never call or come by her home. Now you are hoping that because you are being so humble that she will change her mind and let you ask her out again. Sorry.But a bet is a bet after all. P.S. what was the gorgeous brunette's name?

Peggy Woods from Houston, Texas on January 31, 2021: Fresh corn on the cob, when it is in season, is a treat.  Combine that with fresh-grown tomatoes, and it was one of my mother's favorite meals. DW Davis from Eastern NC on January 31, 2021: I always dislike gainsaying you, my spirited friend, but I am nearly certain the grain Joseph convinced the Egyptians to save was not corn. Had it been, they would have discovered bourbon and moonshine. The result would have been a much more laid back empire."

There are also hundreds of names for different rice recipes in different regions. For cooking techniques, some people use bamboo shoots, pitcher plant cups, and banana and coconut leaves. Aside from boiled rice, there are many rice recipes in the Philippines. Six of them are listed below. (The videos include ingredients and instructions on how to cook them). Champorado is a chocolate rice porridge similar to the champurrado of Mexico but the difference is that Mexican meal is a thick beverage and made of masa instead of rice. Champorado was invented by the Philippine national hero, Dr. Jose Rizal when he was a child when he accidentally spilled a cup of chocolate drink onto the rice that he was eating. It is just easy to cook. It just consists of chocolate or cacao powder, sticky or nonsticky rice, sugar, and evaporated milk. Some people pair it with salted dried fish but it is optional. Bibingka is a baked rice cake traditionally consumed during the “ber months” or Filipino Christmas season. It is usually sold alongside and churches after mass. It is consists of sugar, baking soda, coconut milk, egg, butter, and ground stocky rice or rice flour and top with salted egg, cheese, and coconut strips.

974,"Punjabi Cuisine, Love Of My Life",food," This is Lubnaa ....I am a passionate blogger and I love to write about all beautiful things that Life has given to us. Love of my life.... Punjabi cuisine Pexels Punjabi culture is one of the oldest and liveliest forms of Indian culture. The Indian state of Punjab has a unique cultural landscape characterized by traditional and utilitarian aspects. For unforgettable experiences, it is necessary for a person to immerse himself in the atmosphere of this landscape without fear and vigor. The locals are characterized by their demeanor, their strong ego and eccentric behavior. It will surprise you mainly with a great appetite to eat , strong and warm arms with a sense of great fun. Immediately after my arrival, the locals invited me to their homes. Grandmothers, aunts were not torn as they pulled me by the cheeks and invited me to the family celebrations, which are held here blessedly. In Amritsar , it is translated: First merriment and then work! Proof of this are the local restaurants in the style of canteens, called dhabas. They are full of local families, including children. Everyone has fun, for example, until midnight during the whole week, regardless of working days. In the morning until about 11 o'clock you will not find any open shop. And if you are lucky enough to find an open shop, the salesman will not be thrilled with you. Too much stress like this early in the morning! The Golden Temple Pexels ""So no one in the Punjab will ever starve to death,"" one gentleman explained. And as he said it, so it was. Punjab is home to Sikhism and the world's fifth largest religion. The main principle of Gurdwara, the Shikha temple, is Langar. It means a free dining room, open to all regardless of faith, nationality, race, gender or caste. It is subsidized from voluntary contributions in the form of food and money. Gurdwara of all Gurdwara is the Golden Temple or Golden Temple. Langar is the largest dining room in the world, which is visited by 100-150 thousand people a day and everyone gets to eat completely free of charge. Langar is one of the greatest spells of the Punjab, and all the staff of the Golden Temple are exclusively volunteers and have a duty to take care of everyone at all times. How many times do you see visitors with sacks of sugar, vegetables, or potatoes. Hindus, rich, poor, old, young sit together, share a common space but also a common meal, which is prepared and served by local volunteers. For visitors, there is also the possibility of accommodation in nearby hostels and also completely free. You can just come here for a cup of tea. Samosas..... Pexels Amritsar is the center of the Punjab, but also food. The tradition of Indians from the far south is the so-called Family Culinary Weekend in Amritsar. It is held once a year and exclusively in the non-commercial and smaller town of Amritsar. You don't have to go far for local goodies, in one place there is something to eat, drink, but also to experience. The weekend is characterized by countless street and traditional food. However, get ready for the constantly forming queues at the stalls, which will also confirm you in the very good quality of the food on offer. The most important event of the day is breakfast and dinner. Local cuisine is incomplete without butter, oil and tea. Amritsari kulcha- the most typical Amritsári breakfast is Nutri Kulcha- soy with toasted Punjabi bread and Tandoori Chicken prepared in a traditional Tandoor oven. The most famous Punjabi dish is Chole Bhature, a combination of chickpeas and fried bhature, along with Butter Chicken-butter. A typical food you must taste is Phirni. It's similar to our silver edible paper pudding, Soya chaap- soy cubes in sauce. It's just a short list of authentic local dishes that are part of a typical menu, whether we're talking about a politician or a farmer! You can almost always get local specialties, street and small delicacies stylishly wrapped in newsprint. One of the most famous is Samosa, fried triangular shape patties filled with patties, onion and spices. The second known delicacy is fried vegetables Pakoda. Indian pancakes stuffed with potatoes or vegetables and fried in butter, so-called Parathe, are also very tasty. Punjabi cuisine is very sweet and is dominated by fried foods. The locals do not deny the love of food and their figures are rounded and have large navels. Amritsari kulcha-one of it's kind Pexels Tandoori chicken....is love Pexels Spicy Chole..... Pexels North Indian food has one thing in common and that is Tandoor. Why Tandoor? Tandoor is the oldest type of oven that gives food a very specific taste. Furnaces are in the form of clay pots of various sizes. Wood, coal and / or biomass serve as fuel for heating in them. If you find Tandoori chicken in the menu ....Just Go For It!!! - it is a dish baked or cooked in Tandoor. The preparation of various dishes in Tandoor is determined by the local recipe. Naan,Kulcha-bread pancakes are always baked on the inner walls of the Tandoor. The meat is also specially prepared, which is marinated in several mixtures of spices. Roasting meat in Tandoor with the right combination of spices will give it a unique taste and a mix of colours from yellow, red and green. Indo-Chinese love... Pexels China is not like China! Punjabi cuisine is a combination of the tastes of Tibet and China, because Punjab is located in the northern part of India. However, the Indians created their own form of Chinese noodles or even Dim Sum. Tibetan momo dumplings are a popular dish. The balls or sachets are formed, filled with vegetables or minced meat with Indian meat. Nutella as a filling is a current hit. Somewhere it is replaced by chocolate, although it sounds strange, just taste and you will understand! You can't miss Momos stalls during your visit to northern India. They really stand on every corner and I don't know anyone who wouldn't taste them. Momos are steamed, but also fried in oil. They are traditionally served with hot sauce and mayonnaise. Frequently asked question by every traveler. Food in India is not just about food, but above all about the lifestyle of the local people. Where to eat? Simple answer: on the street! In India, you will soon find that life and everything around it takes place on the street. The streets are busy 24 hours a day, and one of the reasons is that hundreds of people address the streets. The more the local people are more sociable. But remember one basic rule: the more people at the stand or. in a restaurant, the safer the food is. The sooner you adopt the eating habits of the locals, the sooner your intestinal microflora will change and the sooner your body will recover. Keep in mind, only the locals themselves know best how to live in their environment! Be sure to avoid beautiful restaurants without guests. Even at home, you can't order food in an empty restaurant.

Now mix everything together with the chicken and leave aside to marinate for 20 minutes.

Next add in the chillie peppers along with the broken cashew nuts. 4) Once the tomatoes and onions are a little soft, transfer them from the pot into a food processor or blender and turn it into a paste. 5) In a pot, add in 5 tablespoons of oil and place the chicken to fry until almost cooked and remove from the stove. 6) Now in the same pot or different pot ( whichever you prefer), put the onion paste in and add 2 tablespoons of chilli powder, 1 teaspoon of turmeric, ½ tablespoon of ginger garlic paste and salt to taste. Cover the pot and leave for 2-3 minutes. 7) After 2-3 minutes, add in 3 tablespoons of butter and mix.

Lastly add in the coriander and voila you are done with your tasty butter chicken dish. This dish is served best with rice or naan.

978,What's Cooking? You Mean How's Cooking?,food," Kenneth Avery is a Southern humorist with well over a thousand fans. The charm and wit in his writing span a nearly a decade. The Super Skillet can cook anything and stand the work as well. it was as simple to cook a good meal as it was to eat it? I do. Matter of factly, to look at me you would conclude that I have ate several meals. I am what one could call a ""non-discriminate eater,"" because I hardly turn-down any food that I am offered. To bring it down to you, it was like food and I struck up a relation when I was young, and we never parted. There were times when ""I"" thought that I was much in-need of a slimmer, trimmer body. You see? I was in my late 20's, and with my work schedule, I made up my mind to lose a few pounds of weight. My ""few"" pounds ended up as 81 pounds and this affected my nerves today and this ""Diet Encounter"" took place in 1981. My wife is quick to remind me this ""tragic"" time every time that I ask for seconds when I eat a good plate full of great food--and with my wife manning our ktichen, I have never ate a bad meal from her talented hands. Oh, enough about my wife and I because now, I am growing hungry. when I was eight and had first-grade under my belt, so really, besides using my imagination to spend the time outside (when my school was out for summer vacation) and I did not have many toys to play with, so it was imaginary games, talking with my dogs, and meal time. You can guess which of the three things that I loved most. How I would be amazed at watching my mom (and dad at times) stand over the wood stove and put bacon in one pan; cornbread in another one and another vegetable in the third skillet. The aromas emitting from the food cooking was too much for me. I almost ran like a wild boar to attack the stove, but I just sat still at our dining table. Finally, my mom began serving the delicacies to my dad and mom and me for the evening meal. All was right was my stomach and the world when mama did the cooking. Yummm.  Orange juice that was juiced from a real juicer. things changed. All except mom and her cooking. This stayed consistent and how I thanked God for giving her such a vast array of cooking talent to go with those gifts that He had already given her. No matter what was happening around us, we could always count on mom and her skillets. But when my dad bought her an electric stove, it was as if she had went to Heaven because she was so glad to just cook with elecgricity and not wood. Still, she kept her love for her skillets near. Sometimes she would uset hem instead of baking pizza's, frying fish and making southern-based tea. I said all of these things out of appreciation for my mom and dad, because I am leading up to something. And I promise, you will hopefully agree with me on the points I make. on the evening of two Thursday's ago. My wife and I had a good day, but it was nevertheless, uneventful. Sometimes these days are the best. We ate dinner, turned-on the evening news at a big network news corporation, and after that, there was this man claiming to be an expert chef from England. I knew that he was English, from the accent he used. I apologize for not being impressed, but what he was selling made-up for it. To add to the suspense of this purchase, he told me several times that his skillet sets and other smaller pieces of cookware were only five easy payments of such and such and if I acted tight then, he would make one of the payments himself. What a great guy. Not many infommercial emce's would do that. Unfortunately, my wife saw what I was doing and before she could let her voice grow higher, she told me with (one) easy sentence that I was not going to use any credit card for these skillets although she did agree that she would love to have them. I did not even scratch the surface of this ""cookware adventure,"" and the term, 'scratch the surface' made me think of what the English emcee kept saying about the ""Super Skillet,"" you could use a mixer, drill, spoon, fork, and hit the surface very srong and no scratches would surface. Okay. Why didn't this guy sell the surface to our Armed Forces? A lot of lives could be spared simply if a bullet will not puncture the skillet, the material that was used to make a bullet-proof shirt would not stand a chance with any bullet. Okay. I have minimized the ""Super Skillet,"" which I gave this all-around do-it-all piece of cookware because I started to imagine that if a 10-pound turkey can baked in this skillet, or a huge pot roast and hundreds of cakes, well, I may save up my dollars and call the company which makes this ""Super Skillet,"" and if the food looks this good in the infommercial, then I'm all in. But there was a rock in the road. I had settled on the ""Super Skillet,"" but when I turned-away to head to Sports Center, I accidentally-landed on another low channel and you know what? That very same English salesman was hawking ""another"" brand of skillet that, as he said, so hard that it can be hit with pieces of cement then just take a paper towel and wipe it clean. I saw that happen on this presentation. But the price of ""this"" skillet was about the same as the ""Super Skillet,"" so what should I do? Would you please comment at the bottom of this hub and let me read your advice. Fresh salad made by you in your own home. I witnessed a pretty girl and an American guy talking about a salad maker that would save the wife or husband in the family a ton of time. Yaay! A novel idea for once. It was time to create something that would save work for the housewife because only God knows as much as they do, this ""Sir Salad,"" would be right up their alley. It was very  simple. You take (a) cucumbe and place it inside the holder where two very sharp blades are fixed and wihen the handle is shut down, within 1 millionth of a second, bam! You have a completely-cut-up cucumber. The ""Sir Salad,"" is not the thing's real nme (because I am not going to use real names and get into trouble,) but anything from a red potato to an apple can easly be hacked to use on salads, but I did find out that you cannot use a watermelon or canteloupe inside the salad maker because of the size. Yes. Clean-up was an easy time. All a person had to do was hold ""Sir Salad"" underneath tap water and within seconds, bam! A clean ""Sir Salad"" for you to store for the next time. This was all that I could stand on the one night that I watched two of the miracle skillet and the produce cutter for salad. I though that I was finished. Not so. I went back to another high channel--way above the major networks and beyond the foreign tongue speaking song channels, to hopefull learn more about the things that we could use in our kitchen when we wanted a change from eating-out to making our meqls ourselves. Soon as I thought that, another guy, a slim guy, and another pretty brunette girl were both singing the praises of this frying machine that could cook a whole tukey in less than two hours; a package of hot dogs in less than three minutes. These are but two fantastic examples that the male emcee said in his presentation. And as he was talking, the pretty brunette would just reach in and grab a hefty bite of whatever he was cooking. Then I realized how the pretty brunette kept her perfect figure: she did not eat the baked turkey, chocolate-filled dough nuts and such. Guess that the bake machine inventor demanded that a pretty, slim woman be on the screen with the male emcee or he would shop for another high channel to shop his machine. My charming assistant. about all three of these ""skillets"" made with the material that even Super-Man would be proud, I am going to get into the utensil inventing game and see if I can score an infommercial and get myself a deal on another one of those high channels, oh, and I have to hire myself a pretty brunette to help me sell the utencil/appliance that you will soon read about. But my infommercial is not going to be a garden variety commerical, no, sir. Along with the pretty brunette (not the one with the Englishman), I do want her to be able to twirl two batons which are on fire to keep viewers' attention. Plus, I want a host of several rock 'n rollers from the 70's and 80's with whomever is left in their bands and between my sales pitches, the original band can do their biggest hits. Wouldn't you like to see, Vince Neal and Tommy Lee of Motley Crue; Eddie Van Halen and his brothers doing their hit songs and then bring on the ""Little Band From Texas,"" ZZ Topp. And these guys will be able to sell their CD's, 8x10 colored, ,autographed photos with the viewers' names on them when they call me to buy my invention that is coming up. I will be selling an All-in-One Cooker, Fryer, Juicer, Cake Mixer, which will be very space-friendly to whatever kitchen where it will be used. My invention will be named: All For One, and that name will be on the lips of every household in the U.S.A. Along with the time-saving apps that I have on the All For One, are two Military-based unbreakable flashlights and sunglasses that you can see in the dark. You can use these if you ever want to take your One For All on a camping trip.The All For One also plays music by the bands of the 80's because I want to help these guys some for I know that most of them are broke, so the All For One will be like a dream come true. When the All For One is not being used, just flip the handy door on the front and out pops a huge plasma TV that is solar-powered because I have also put an entire set of outside house lights that when you park the All For One, it will drive-away the raccoons, pesky salesmen, (oops!) and the last thing I am giving you is that thing that this elderly man is selling that says I can get inside, buckle my feet and stand up with my head on the bottom--all to bring me almost perfect health. The guy jumps and says, ""Look! I look 88, and kind of feeling great!"" Okay. This one does exist, but I had to change the main sentence of this man. So when my commerical is filmed, I want to be seen riding my All For One just like a Harley (I have the same motor in my All For One too) and when I roll up, I will hand the viewers a plate of perfectly-roasted chickens, taco's, fried eggs, sausages, and orange juce which I have made inside my All for One. I will jump off of my All For One and say, ""I am 67! Well-fed and I feel full!"" How's that? Oh, you can stop gazing at my brunette assistant now.January 25, 2021_______________________________________________ My other orettt brybette assustabt, Presenting my One For All!

Maybe I’m hyping this recipe up too much, but I think you will be agree with me that it will be your new family favorite. What I like best about this recipe is that I can start it early in the morning and let it cook all day while doing laundry and running after my toddler. It’s something you can start before work by just setting a crock pot on low and cooking 8 hours instead of 4-5 hours on high. You can serve this at any family function or gathering because it is so flavorful and in my experience most people have never even heard of this so it can really be a conversation piece and gourmet alternative to normal tacos.

Garlic cloves minced about 1 tablespoon Green onion -2 bunches Limes-2 cut into slices Cilantro -1 bunch is plenty Taco cheese or shredded Colby jack Taco seasoning -1 package Cooking oil (vegetable, canola, olive oil or whatever you have on hand.) Garlic powder Salt Pepper Corn or flour tortillas Optional Sour Cream “The smell of meat, cilantro, and seasonings in a slow cooker is enough to make your mouth water all day.” 15 mins 4-5 hours on high or 8 hours on low. <20 servings 1.) Season the chuck roast with about 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper on both sides. Rub the seasoning into the meat. 2.) Sear the meat on all sides by heating up a tablespoon of cooking oil in a skillet and browning all sides. This ensures the meat will hold in the juicy flavors and gives the roast a beautiful browned look. If you are not familiar with how to seat meat please check out the video below. 3.) Remove from skillet and place in the bottom of a crock pot. Top with 1 tablespoon of crushed garlic, the chopped green onion from two bunches, and juice from half a lime. 4.) Add 2 cups water to the bottom of the crockpot and let cook for approximately 4 hours on high heat or 7-8 hours on low. 5.) After that time has passed, you may now shred the roast by using two forks. It should be falling apart by now and be easily shredded. 6.) Add 1 package of Taco Seasoning, and around 3 tablespoons of chopped cilantro and mix. 7.) Cook under medium heat approximately one more hour. You may turn the setting to warm or low at this point in time if need be. 8.) Serve over warmed Tortillas. You may use corn or flour. Top with cheese than fresh cilantro and serve with lime wedges on the side in order for your guest to squeeze his/her own fresh lime juice on top. Sour Cream is also good if you like it and a pinch of salt on top is also very satisfying.   Ingredients added to crock pot. Author After shredding the meat and adding taco seasoning. After the end to a long day nothing is better than a good meal. When you bite into these Carne Assada Street Tacos it’s almost enough to take the stress away if only for a moment.

982,Kitchen Sink Cookies: The Perfect Balance of Salty and Sweet,food," I love Mexican cuisine and I enjoy sharing a variety of cooking and baking recipes with others. Kitchen Sink Cookies made with chocolates and pretzels. Jackie Zelko It’s called a Kitchen Sink cookie because it has ""everything but the kitchen sink,” — basically a bunch of random stuff from your pantry that baked together is absolute cookie perfection. — The Salted Cookie: Sweet & Salty Synergy I tried these cookies for the first time through a friend. I thought they were going to taste like any other cookie, but I wanted five more before I could finish the one in my hand. I immediately told my friend that I had to have the recipe; thanks, Nancy! This recipe is a Panera Bread copy cat recipe that was modified and altered to my friend’s liking. I chose to leave out the toffee this time just to see if there was a difference. I also decided to swap milk chocolate chips to dark chocolate chips as dark chocolate is my favorite. Although my batch was still very good, I have to say Nancy’s was way better! I look forward to swapping more recipes with her in the near future. This one is definitely a keeper! 20 min 30 min 50 min About 32 Cookies Break up the pretzels into bits and put in a small bowl.

Jackie Zelko  Kitchen Sink Cookies made with chocolates and pretzels. Jackie Zelko If I was to make any changes for next time, it would have to be with the toffee and the pretzels. I would be interested in incorporating the toffee and breaking the pretzels into larger bits. I think I broke the mini twisted pretzels up too small because the cookie wasn't as salty as I would have liked for it to have been. There is also a lot of chocolate in this cookie between the chocolate morsels and the M&Ms, so the toffee could make it too sweet for your liking if you choose to add it. Regardless of what you pick though, it truly is hard to go wrong with this fun recipe. © 2021 Jackie Zelko Peggy Woods from Houston, Texas on January 24, 2021: Thanks for sharing your friend's cookie recipe with us.  It does sound salty because of the pretzels and sweet with the other ingredients. Chitrangada Sharan from New Delhi, India on January 24, 2021: These cookies look unique because of the combination of ingredients. And they sound tasty too. Would love to try this. Well presented and helpful pictures and details. Thank you for sharing. Pamela Oglesby from Sunny Florida on January 24, 2021: This sounds like a very different cookie, and I would love to try them, Jackie.

985,Different Kinds of Indian Dishes,food," It may seem daunting to cook your favorite Indian dishes at home, with the cuisine's unusual and complex spices. But, if you stock your kitchen with some of the essential ingredients found in Indian cuisine, you can easily prepare these dishes and enjoy that lively, spicy taste any time you want. From tandoori chicken to palak paneer, the recipes are relatively simple. You can even learn to make your own naan, the tasty flatbread ideal for scooping up rice and sauce.  At its core, chole bhature is a combination of two dishes: chole - a spicy chickpea curry, and bhature - a type of fried bread made with maida flour. Popular throughout North India, the dish was invented in Delhi in the 1940s. It is commonly accompanied by onions, pickles, mint chutney, and chilled lassi. Chole bhature can be found at most street carts in North India, but it can also be easily prepared at home. Although it can be eaten any time of the day, chole bhature is especially popular in the morning, when bhature are filled with potatoes or cottage cheese, making it a heavy, nutritious breakfast. 2. Bharwa Bhindi Bharwa Bhindi is a popular Indian side dish where the okra (bhindi) is stuffed with a spicy filling. This vegan dish goes really well with flatbread like roti or paratha. Bhindi aka okra, is one of my favorite vegetables. In India, we cook okra a lot and almost everyone likes it. Sarvesh is a huge fan and so whenever I go to the Indian store here, I make it a point to buy some fresh okra to cook at home. At my home, bhindi was usually cooked in a very simple way with little spices. Mom always served that with roti and dal and it made such a comforting and healthy meal. 3. Kulche Kulcha is made from maida flour, water, a pinch of salt and a leavening agent (yeast or old kulcha dough), mixed together by hand to make a very tight dough. This dough is covered with a wet cloth and left to stand for an hour or so in a warm place. The result is a slight leavening of the flour but not much. The flour is pummelled again by hand and then rolled out using a rolling pin into a flat, round shape. It is baked in an earthen clay oven (""tandoor"") until done. When baked, it is often brushed with butter or ghee, although this is not necessary. It is then eaten with any Indian curry. In particular, a spicy chickpea curry known as chole is the dish of choice for being eaten with kulcha.[1] 4. Jaldi Jalebi, also known as Jilapi, zulbia, mushabak and zalabia, is a Middle Eastern sweet snack popular all over South and Western Asia. It is made by deep-frying maida flour (plain flour or all-purpose flour) batter in pretzel or circular shapes, which are then soaked in sugar syrup. This dessert can be served warm or cold. They have a somewhat chewy texture with a crystallized sugary exterior coating. Citric acid or lime juice is sometimes added to the syrup, as well as rose water. Jalebi is eaten with curd or rabri (North India) along with optional other flavours such as kewra (scented water). This dish is not to be confused with similar sweets and variants like imarti and chhena jalebi 5. Masada chai Masala chai is a tea beverage made by boiling black tea in milk and water with a mixture of aromatic herbs and spices.[2] Originating in India,[3] the beverage has gained worldwide popularity, becoming a feature in many coffee and tea houses. Although traditionally prepared as a decoction of green cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, ground cloves, ground ginger, and black peppercorn together with black tea leaves, retail versions include tea bags for infusion, instant powdered mixtures, and concentrates. The term ""chai"" originated from the Hindi word ""chai"", which was derived from the Chinese word for tea, cha (see: Etymology of tea). In English, this spiced tea is commonly referred to as masala chai,[4] or simply chai,[5] even though the term refers to tea in general in the original language. Numerous coffee houses use the term chai latte or chai tea latte (lit. 'tea tea milk', if each word is translated in a different language, Hindi, English, and Italian,[6] respectively) for their version to indicate that it is made with steamed milk, much like that used to make a caffè latte, but mixed with a spiced tea concentrate instead of espresso. By 1994, the term had gained currency on the U.S. coffeehouse scene.[7] These are some most popular Indian dishes. If you have tried any of these recipes,

986,Recipes Based on Boxed Macaroni and Cheese,food," We all fix food and have our favorite meals to prepare. I'm sharing some of mine. Have fun cooking! Yummy, cheesy macaroni! Pixabay We bought a case of boxed macaroni and cheese when we stocked our pantry at the beginning of the pandemic. I figured if we ran short of food, we could always fix a box of it for dinner. I loved it and it reminded me of childhood days when Mom would cook it for our supper. As time went by, we wanted different ways to fix it so we wouldn't get bored having it too often. I found a helpful group on Facebook called Recipes for Hard Times and put the question to them. Over 200 replies showed me how creative people can be with a simple box mix containing powdered cheese and macaroni. The food pantries needed donations of canned goods and boxed food, so we donated some locally. Later, a friend told me about a time when all they had for weeks was macaroni and cheese to eat. I bet she would have appreciated some of the varied recipes I'm sharing below. Cook the macaroni, but don't add milk or butter to it. Take the cheese packet and mix the powdered cheese with mayonnaise. You can add in your favorite seasoning like Lawry's Seasoned Garlic. You can add hard-boiled eggs, ham, onions, black olives, or cheese cubes. Keep it in the refrigerator until time to eat. It's great to take to a barbecue or a picnic. Start with your basic box mix and add any of these meats to get a different meal for the family. It's a good way to use some leftovers from the fridge. When Donating Macaroni and Cheese to a Food Bank, choose the kind that can be made with water. Families experiencing hard times may not have the butter and milk to use for this. When the kids say, ""Oh no, not macaroni and cheese again,"" tell them you're fixing it the way cowboys like it. Ingredients: Brown some hamburger and chopped onion and drain off the excess grease. Boil the macaroni and mix it in with the hamburger in the skillet. Add cream of mushroom soup, some corn, and the powdered cheese. Simmer until the flavors blend. Variation: Substitute a 6 ounce can of tomato paste and a 10 ounce can of tomato sauce in place of the mushroom soup. Either of these can be put in a casserole dish and baked in the oven to brown the top.   You know what veggies your family likes, but you might find they will eat other choices if you mix them in with your cheesy macaroni. Possible Vegetables to Add You Can Separate the Ingredients Instead of the same old meal made according to the package, split up the ingredients. Use the macaroni for some other recipe and save the powdered cheese packet for something else. For Mexican Mac and Cheese: Brown hamburger and add a small jar of salsa. For Green Chili Chicken Mac and Cheese: Cook the macaroni, then drain it. Add diced chicken, sour cream, and a can of mild diced Ortega chilis. For Taco Style Mac and Cheese: Brown some hamburger with chopped onions then stir in taco seasoning, the cooked macaroni, and the powdered cheese. Add canned corn, black olives, a little bit of salsa, and sour cream. Sprinkle shredded cheese over the top when served. If you want to turn it into a taco salad, put some taco chips on a plate, add some lettuce, and then the taco mac and cheese on top of that. For Chili Mac: Prepare the package ingredients following the directions on the box. Then mix in a can of chili and finish cooking until hot. Alternate method: Prepare the macaroni and cheese according to the box instructions. Layer it with chopped onions, chili, mac and cheese, and cottage cheese. My husband's family calls this American Chop Suey. You would use several boxes of mac & cheese for a big batch like this. The cheese powder gets added in at the end. Virginia Allain Use 2 packages of macaroni and cheese. Add some diced (or shredded) cooked chicken. Instead of the milk and butter called for on the package, add sour cream (up to a 16 oz container), and a packet of onion soup mix. Mix it all together well. It's ready to eat or put it in a buttered 9x13 dish and sprinkle crushed plain cornflakes over the top. Bake that at 350 degrees until it is bubbly around the edges.

It can be a very inexpensive meal. Travel Chef from Manila on January 20, 2021: One of my favorites pasta recipe. I would love to try the cowboy macaroni. Peggy Woods from Houston, Texas on January 19, 2021: Boxes of macaroni and cheese are generally inexpensive, and you have shown many ways to vary the ingredients and make it a full meal.  I am sure that many people will enjoy reading your ideas.

988,Curry Masala Gravy Base,food," Lemonkerdz On a visit home to England, on a trip out to pick up a curry fix from my sisters local takeaway, I noticed a huge pot bubbling away at the back of the kitchen restaurant. I inquired, to their surprise, “is that your curry masala gravy base?”. That question and the following conversation led to an invite to return one evening during a takeaway service to learn a few tricks, ask some questions from the experts and an opportunity to make the curry of our choice. Hubby and I have been making our own curries for years and now we get to learn from the people who know!   One thing I knew they wouldn't share was their recipe for curry masala gravy. Its the curry houses equivalent of a secret sauce, its what makes their dishes unique. That my friends is one of the reasons why you love a particular curry from one restaurant  and not like it from another. Two important things we learned - (1) your curry masala gravy takes your curry to another level. (2) It really is just another mild curry. So what's the big deal? Think about a great stock and how much better that makes a soup rather than just a stock cube. Both are ok, but the one made with stock is oh so much better. The same applies to some of the curries we make, this stock/curry masala gravy is one of the keys to achieving a great restaurant tasting curry. At home I nearly always make chicken curries. Why? because they are consistent, the meat is always tender. Beef or lamb however can be more difficult. The rare occasion we are back in England and of course in our favourite curry house, Hubbys first words are ""meat for me please!"" I needed to learn, enter lesson number 2 from our short masterclass. The second thing we learned is if you order a meat curry, the meat is already prepped and precooked. Red meat is so unpredictable and a curry is soooooo disappointing if the meat is chewy. Slow cooked meat is the way to go. The curry house had huge Tupperware's of precooked fall off the bone delicious meat. Ever wondered how you can walk into a takeaway restaurant and have a beautiful rich curry gravy with tender meat served within half and hour? Its all in the prep. When you arrive and make your choice, all that's left is to stir-fry your order. .   I'm really selling this guys, I know! That's because when you first look at the steps you might cry ""I'm making a curry before I make a curry!!"" Lets say it might look a bit too involved and instead you find yourself reaching for the takeaway menu.... I don't want to loose you, stick with me...Its worth it...its time well spent. Get some music on and start prepping! I'm sharing the recipe we use from Pat Chapmans wonderful book ""250 favourite curries"". We love this book and make no apologies for sharing his wealth of experience and wonderful recipes with all our own hints and observations. We want to get all these great recipes out there to friends and family and all those people out there who love curry night but cant find or afford a takeaway and who just love to cook. Enjoy! Pat Chapman available for purchase on amazon.com Ok, so you've seen the quantities and are thinking..that's a big recipe! I get it. For those of you who want to ""try before you buy"" I'm also including a small batch recipe. Use half of the masala gravy to make a curry  and freeze the other half for another time. Here goes. mix the spices with water to make a paste and leave to stand for 10 minutes Lemonkerdz prep the garlic and ginger Lemonkerdz getting the ingredients together Lemonkerdz Basically we will chop and blanch. Onions can be quite bitter and a quick blanch in boiling water really improves taste. finely chopped onions ready to blanch to make onion puree Lemonkerdz ready to start Lemonkerdz • Mix together the curry powder, paprika and turmeric with a little water to make a paste.

989,Roghan Gosht Authentic Indian Restaurant curry,food," Lemonkerdz Find yourself disappointed with the takeaway curry you just ordered? Or is it just getting a bit too expensive? No great takeaways near where you live? Hubby and I have years of experience making authentic Indian restaurant style curries (shout out to the UK curry house) because where we live we have no takeaway options for a curry. So needs must. That craving we all feel for an authentic curry just makes you learn! Here's one of our favourites Rogan Gosht. Gosht means meat, so this is traditionally a meat curry. But hey you can use chicken too or just make the sauce and add veggies at the end. I mostly use chicken as meat ones are hit and miss with either tender or chewy meat. Recently I've been slow cooking my meat first and then adding it to the curry. Winner! First of all you need to make the curry base. Trust me this is worth it. The authenticity of this dish comes from the curry masala gravy - the large pot you observant ones will spot bubbling away on the stove at the back of the takeaway kitchen. This is one of the processes that allows a restaurant to cook you a meal in 20 minutes that tastes like it took much longer. It adds layers of flavour to the dish. See my Curry Masala Gravy recipe In the link below. Gather ingredients & prep Lemonkerdz Quick note. This recipe begins in a pan and ends in the oven. We begin with frying some ingredients and then transfer to an oven proof dish and slow cook for an hour adding in other ingredients in stages. To begin, pre heat your oven to 375F/190C/Gas 5 Lemonkerdz Lemonkerdz"
990,Appetizers for Valentine's Day,food," Teresa is from the Southern state of Alabama. Raising a large family on a small budget, she's learned to cook delicious food efficiently. Image by RitaE from Pixabay If you don't want to ruin a romantic moment make sure to plan ahead. Select recipes that can be prepared slightly in advance and kept warm. Otherwise, running off to check the food will leave that special guest on their own.  You don't want to have any distractions or interruptions. This is a special night for lovers. The old saying goes “the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach”--with these yummy appetizers, you may make it before the first course is served!! Prepare this appetizer ahead of time and create a batch of elegant looking Asparagus Appetizers. These appetizers are a combination of ham, asparagus, and dinner roll dough. 10 min 20 min 30 min 16 servings Image by silviarita from Pixabay    Image by Igor Lukin from Pixabay These are just a few suggestions of what to serve as the main course.  Red or Pink balloons or red heart garlands that can be found at almost any party supply store will add to the romantic setting. Adding flowers should, also, be a priority. Get creative by making your own bouquets using red, pink, and white flowers in decorative vases. Place these in the room that you'll spend the special evening in with your loved one. Candlelight is a romantic way to set the atmosphere. Red cinnamon fragrance candles can be placed on the table, but don't stop there. Place the candles all around the dining room. Once you have set the scene for the ambiance, setting the table is the top priority for a romantic Valentine's Day dinner. Create a centerpiece using a decorative bowl filled with water. Place red and white rose petals floating on top. Look for Flower-shaped floating candles at your local stores as they are another romantic idea. Choose the smallest ones you can find and add two to your rose bowl. Scatter rose petals on the table to add a nice touch, but you can also decorate your long-stemmed glasses with small satin or velvet ribbons to serve romantic red cocktails for Valentine's Day.   Declutter your living room and bedroom. Remove any pictures that don't feature you and your loved one as a happy couple. You can also alter the lighting in any room by placing a thin red scarf on top of any lamp, just don't let it touch the light bulb directly for fear of starting a fire. Once you've set up the romantic dinner for Valentine's Day, just relax and enjoy the chocolate covered strawberries and other goodies you've lined up for your special date.

991,Difference between Onion Granules & Onion Powder,food," Loretta loves to write about best practices in health and wellness as well as the great job opportunities in the growing wellness industry. There might not be very, much difference between onion granules and onion powder; besides, they are both made using almost the same process and dehydrated onions. Both types have their culinary uses and best recipes where one would be preferable to the other. I love using both, but my favourite is onion granules, which is just onions that were finely chopped and dried out. However, onion powder takes the processing a step further because it is finely ground into powder after drying. Some people prefer to use onion granules or onion powder because they don’t want to go through the hassle of getting teary while chopping a fresh onion. The moisture in the onions, which causes this reaction is removed during the drying process of onion granules and onion powder. Onion granules are perfect for recipes that desire onion flavour, but you don't need too much of the onion texture that freshly chopped onions would bring in the meal. It gives your dish the sweet taste of onion. It can also be rehydrated and used as finely and freshly chopped onions or garnish. Onion powder is also great for recipes that need onions flavour, the powder adds the flavour and cannot be seen. Both the granules and powder can be sprinkled and rubbed on meats with other spices before cooking. Granulated onion offers more texture in addition to flavour and taste. Traditional dishes like meatloaf and casseroles would do better with onion granules instead of powder. The powder is used in soups, eggs, sauces, dips, dressings and spread on other dishes that you want to add that distinct but subtle onions flavour. The difference in taste and efficacy between the onion granules and onion powder is a lot. Granulated onions give texture and a richer onion taste when used in cooking; however, since onion powder is finely ground, it is more compact and has more concentration than the onion granules. So when cooking with onion powder, you would use less than the amount you would use if it were onion granules. For example, where one tablespoon of onion granules is equivalent to one onion, one teaspoon of onion powder is equal to one onion. If you are thinking of getting both but considering the cost, you could always get granulated in your kitchen cabinet, and when you want powder, you can ground it into a fine texture to get what you want.

993,Fried Okrie,food," Teresa is from the Southern state of Alabama. Raising a large family on a small budget, she's learned to cook delicious food efficiently. Image by Sandeep Handa from Pixabay While growing up here in South Alabama, I learned to cook from my mother and grandmother. As an adult, I discovered new ways of cooking the same foods. When I married my husband, Stan, I wanted to cook perfectly for him. We were no different from any other newly married couple. We both had been married previously and brought children into the new marriage from previous ones. Both of us worked and had little time to spend many hours in the kitchen. I remember the first time I decided to cook him a home-cooked meal right after the brief honeymoon was over. I chose to cook white peas, ham, boiled potatoes, and stewed okra. I stayed right by the stove while he played with the kids outside. I occasionally glanced out the kitchen window to get a glimpse of the baseball game they were playing in the front yard. I was determined to get this meal perfect. I wanted to show him what a great cook I was. After a while, it was done and ready for the family to eat. As my husband sat down at the table, he said, “Oh great! I love Okra. My Mom used to make it for me a lot.” Now if that didn’t make a new wife nervous about her new husband liking her cooking then nothing would. I watched him take the first bite of okrie, and then he took a bite of the ham, then the potatoes, another bite of ham. I began to notice that his okrie wasn’t being eaten. I asked him what was wrong with the okrie. I could see the hesitation on his face. He was thinking of how to tell me he didn’t like my okrie. All he could come up with was “there’s just something it needs, but I’m not quite sure what it is. My mother’s Okra isn’t as slimy as this. ” Could you believe that? Okrie Not Slimy!  Several months passed before I tried to cook Okrie again for him. It wasn’t until my son asked me to cook it. Only this day was a hectic day. I had just gotten home from work and I didn’t have much time before my husband would be home from work too. The kids needed help with their homework. After setting the kitchen table up so I could cook supper while I helped with homework. I started the okrie in the skillet on the stove. Put on a boiler of water on the stove for rice and checked the chicken I had started that morning in the crock-pot before turning to the kids. Every so often, I would stir the okrie. I added rice to the boiling water and turned it down to low. With homework finished and the kids outside, I decided to gather a load of dirty clothes to throw on to wash while supper was finishing. When I came out of the laundry room, I smelled the okrie. It was scorching! After checking it, I decided that it was only a little brown and still edible. After all, this was the way, I ate it growing up in my mother’s house. When we all sat down at the table, my husband reached over, took a small spoonful of the okrie, and put it on his plate. After tasting it, he asked, “Did my mother tell you how she cooks okrie?” “No. I haven’t seen your mother to ask her. Why? ” I inquired. “Cause this taste just like hers!” he said, reaching over the table to help himself to more. With the idea going off in my head and the picture that lit up in my mind, I laughed aloud. “What’s so funny?” he asked. “Your Mama burns the food too!” Here I was trying to do everything perfectly and didn’t realize that his mother had been a working mother too. One who rushed to do everything and often burnt the food she was preparing for her family. In my family, the children didn’t know that the food wasn’t supposed to be scorched and had developed a taste for it. My husband and kids think I am the best cook in the world, which is how I thought of my mother when I was growing up. I have decided to share some of our favorite recipes. Enjoy! Image by Santanu Manna from Pixabay 1 qt. of sliced fresh or frozen okrie 1 teaspoon of salt 1/8 teaspoon of black pepper ½ cup of water ½ cup of bacon grease Heat grease in skillet to a sizzle (that’s where you sprinkle a drop or two of water in hot grease to make sure it’s hot enough. It will pop and sizzle).  Add the okrie.  Stir slightly.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Stir okrie to mix the salt and pepper in well. Add ½ cup of water.  Bring heat back up.  Stir okrie again. Turn heat down to a simmer.  Cover with lid.  Stir often.  Okrie is done when it can be easily smashed with a fork, around 20 or 30 minutes. My mother always added a little more character by letting the okrie absorbed all the excess water and grease by lightly scorching the okrie itself. Well, I guess some people would call that browning the okrie.

994,Egg and Avocado ~ A Perfect Combination and Nutritious Breakfast,food," John loves to eat and this subsequently led to him teaching himself to cook. His eldest son is also a qualified chef and passes on tips. A more stylish presentation: Katja Grainger Unsplash Free Photos Being known in some circles as 'The Cackleberry Farmer' because I bred and cared for a menagerie of chickens, I am a true fan of the humble egg. It is an essential ingredient in many recipes and is ideal and much loved breakfast food. Eggs are so versatile and there are so many ways to enjoy eggs: boiled, poached, fried, scrambled, as an omelette, or even French toast. One of my favourite, and simplest, ways to eat eggs is boiled. For many, boiled eggs on toast may seem quite a dull and boring breakfast, but I have a way to add a bit of zest and excitement to this dish. Avocado and eggs John Hansen 2021 One egg has only 75 calories but 7 grams of high-quality protein, 5 grams of fat, and 1.6 grams of saturated fat, along with iron, vitamins, minerals, and carotenoids. The egg is a powerhouse of disease-fighting nutrients like lutein and zeaxanthin. — webmd.com To liven up this dish, try spreading the toast with avocado first before topping it with the boiled eggs. Use avocado in place of butter. It is beautiful and creamy, and trust me, you don’t need both. It is also cholesterol free, another bonus. People often combine chicken and avocado, but have you ever combined this wonderful and indulgent fruit (yes it is a fruit) with eggs? Well, if not, let me tell you, “It is a match made in Heaven!” Combine it with a few extra touches, I will mention, and .. mmmm .. perfect. A perfect avocado by Thanti Nguyen Unsplash Free Photos Avocado is a green, pear-shaped fruit often called an “alligator pear.” It is loaded with healthy fats, fiber and various important nutrients. — Kris Gunnars BSc This following recipe is one of the easiest you will ever prepare and the amount of ingredients mentioned is for one person. Just multiply all ingredients for how ever many you are cooking for. * please note that the ingredients in this recipe are based on using large eggs and a reasonable sized avocado. If the eggs are small use three, and if the avocado is small you may need to use a half instead of a quarter. 2 min 6 min 8 min Serves one person Put the lid on the saucepan John Hansen 2021 Suggested Condiments John Hansen 2021 An alternative way to use these two fantastic ingredients of egg and avocado together is by scrambling the eggs instead of boiling them. Simply use the avocado as a spread on your toast instead of butter and then place the cooked scrambled egg on top of it. I can guarantee this is equally as delicious as the boiled egg and avocado. For a recipe on cooking scrambled eggs see my article: How to Cook the World's Best Scrambled Eggs. Avocados are rich in healthy, good fats. In fact, avocados are the only fruit apart from olives to contain monounsaturated fats. So, why are these fats good for us? 1.Healthy fats help you absorb essential fat-soluble nutrients (such as vitamin E), 2. reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, 3. help maintain heart health, 4. promote healthy skin 5. and are great for the waistline. In fact, research has found that people who eat avocado weigh less, have a lower BMI and a smaller waist than people who avoided the delicious fruit. Avocado and egg on toast A Sweet Peach Chef Are 2 boiled eggs a day good for you? Eating eggs leads to elevated levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), also known as the “good” cholesterol. People who have higher HDL levels have a lower risk of heart disease, stroke and other health issues. According to one study, eating two eggs a day for six weeks increased HDL levels by 10%. I was going to include a nutrition capsule here but when looking up nutrition facts for avocados they differed greatly. Also, the cholesterol levels for eggs are confusing because it is the “good” type and not “bad.” So, I decided against it.  I just received an email from my friend and colleague Greg Cain who tried out his breakfast since I wrote the article, and had the following to say: “John - the day got away from me yesterday before I had a chance to send this to you. I woke up and was digging through the goods in the kitchen, thought of you and made this breakfast of muffin, avocado and soft-boiled egg. The timing worked out just as you said in an article you wrote quite some time ago! Anyway, it made me smile and realize I’ve got friends all over the globe who are doing good and living their best life. I count you among one of those friends. You certainly influenced my day yesterday, and we didn’t even interact. I’m watching my waistline so the sourdough muffin saved me about 40 calories. Haha! Also, it was delicious, no doubt about it. It’s at least the third or fourth time I’ve eaten this since I read your wonderful article.“ Thank you for the acknowledgement, Greg. The breakfast you made looks absolutely delicious. I love the addition of the sourdough muffin especially.

The recipe is very simple and I am sure you will enjoy it. Ravi Rajan from Mumbai on April 17, 2021: Wonderful recipe John. I have always been a fan of Avocado and it is amazing that this super fruit has so many nutrients and health benefits. I am surely going to try this simple recipe. Thanks for sharing John. John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on April 17, 2021: Check out the great review I added at the end of the article by Greg Cain after trying this recipe for breakfast. John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 16, 2021: Thank you, Rajput. I look forward to reading about your experience and how it turns out. Rajput from London, United Kingdom. on January 16, 2021: it looks yum. I am gonna give it a try and I would share my experience. BRENDA ARLEDGE from Washington Court House on January 16, 2021: John, I don't really know.   It's just one if those things I instantly say no to...i truly do cringe at the thought. Who knows...maybe one day I will try it. Then I might kick myself for not enjoying it sooner. John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 16, 2021: Really, Brenda? What is it about avocado that makes you cringe? There is no real effort, you just cut it in half remove the seed and there is a lot of flesh in one..enough to thickly spread on probably six or eight pieces of toast from one avocado. It is great just by itself even, with just a bit of salt. You need to at least try it to find out. BRENDA ARLEDGE from Washington Court House on January 16, 2021: John, I have never tried Avocado. I even cringe at the thought.  Plus I hear it is alot of work just to get a little bit of avocado. The health benefits sound great but unless I get over that cringe....I guess I will never know. John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 15, 2021: Yes, it is both of those, Nithya. Thanks for reading. Nithya Venkat from Dubai on January 15, 2021: A healthy easy to make breakfast, thank you for sharing. John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 15, 2021: Yes, it is very healthy, Cynthia.

John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 15, 2021: That is great Rosina. I am sure you can find one of those ingredients. Doug West from Missouri on January 15, 2021: Looks good, sign me up. What time is breakfast? Rosina S Khan on January 15, 2021: Thank you so much Linda and John for helping me finding a substitute for Avocado. My mother tells me both hummus and avocado are not native ones and probably imported from abroad. So now for this delicious breakfast, I now know If I don't find avocado, I will look for hummus. John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 15, 2021: Denise, a substitute can be found for almost anything. Glad you found scrambled tofu can fit the bill at replacing eggs with avocado. Thanks for reading. John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 15, 2021: Thank you manatita...that is great news. A recipe can’t be much easier than this. Glad you will try making it. John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 15, 2021: Firstly Linda, thank you for answering Rosina’s question...hummus of course! I couldn’t think for the life of me. Sorry, to publish this after you had eaten breakfast..but there is always the next one. I am too surprised that there are so many here that have never tried avocado. Thanks for the great comment. John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 15, 2021: Ruby, I am surprised that there seem to be so any people who have never tried avocado. You really do need to give it a try. It is a wonderful fruit. I am sure you would like it. Denise McGill from Fresno CA on January 15, 2021: I agree with you about the Avacado.  It certainly is a good source of creamy goodness when spread on toast.  Since I have been vegan now for the past 2 years, I don't have egg but sometimes I will put some tofu scramble on toast with my avacado.  It is yummy. Blessings, Denise manatita44 from london on January 15, 2021: The whole hub is beautifully described and even I can do those eggs and avocado now. I loved the video too, so that's two recipes together. Awesome! Linda Lum from Washington State, USA on January 15, 2021: John, I've good news and bad news. The good news is this is a great article (I love avocado and a runny egg). The only bad news is that I read this after I had already eaten breakfast. I am amazed to hear some people say that they've never eaten an avocado or, in the case of Billybuc, won't because they are green? Oh well, as you said, the more for the rest of us. As to Rosina's question--I would recommend hummus on that toast. It is healthy, creamy, and has much of the nutritional value of the avocado. Ruby Jean Richert from Southern Illinois on January 15, 2021: Would you believe that I've never tasted avocados. I do not know why? I will try it. Your sandwich looks delicious! John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 15, 2021: Thanks, Shauna. You can use eggs cooked any way you prefer for this recipe, I sometimes use poached eggs as well. Let me know if you do make iIt for breakfast over the weekend. John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 15, 2021: Hi MG, thanks you for checking out my breakfast recipe. I am not sure if I am a culinary expert, but I love food and cooking and I do my best. Drop in for breakfast next time you journey this way. John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 15, 2021: Thank you, Peg. I thought I’d join the club of those who write recipe article here. So glad this is your type of breakfast. Shauna L Bowling from Central Florida on January 15, 2021: John, like you, I love eggs in any way, shape or form. And I love avocados. They're so good for you! Using smooshed avocados as a spread is a healthy alternative to mayo. Your sandwich looks delicious. I think I'll try your recipe but cook the eggs over easy or poach them. I like runny yolks. I'll have to make this dish over the weekend. It's making me hungry just looking at the photo! MG Singh emge from Singapore on January 15, 2021: You seem to be a culinary expert as well. Great, hen I come to Australia must breakfast with you !! Peggy Woods from Houston, Texas on January 15, 2021: That type of breakfast is right up my alley, so-to-speak.  Yummy!  We eat eggs frequently and also avocados. John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 15, 2021: Chitrangada, thank you for the nice comment. I had this for breakfast this morning so thought why not take the advantage of writing about it, and something a bit different from my usual poetry and stuff. Glad you found my narration appealing. John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 15, 2021: Haha Bill, you sound like one of my sons..he would never eat anything green either. All the more avocado for the rest of us. There are plenty of eggs to go around. Thanks for reading. John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 15, 2021: Pamela, your son has good taste. Yes, it sure is easy to make. Glad he images made it look appealing too. I thought I would write something a little different for a change of pace. Chitrangada Sharan from New Delhi, India on January 15, 2021: A good writer is a good writer--whether poems or recipes or any other subject. Your narration made this recipe more delicious. Eggs are versatile and a comfort food, with the advantage of being nutrition packed. My children love to experiment with it. I like the addition of avocados. Perfect breakfast. Thank you for sharing. Bill Holland from Olympia, WA on January 15, 2021: I'll take the eggs and leave you the avocados, if it's all the same to you. :) I try to stay away from foods that are green.  lol  Happy Weekend, buddy! Pamela Oglesby from Sunny Florida on January 15, 2021: One of my sons loves this breakfast. It looks so delicious in your pictures, and it is easy to make. Thanks for an interesting article with an unusual topic from you. John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 15, 2021: Hey Greg. How fortunate that you have half an avocado left over. Be sure to try this for breakfast. Thanks for reading and your great comment. greg cain from Moscow, Idaho, USA on January 15, 2021: John - looks fantastic!  Thanks for sharing and inspiring.  Like Eric, I think I might just have this for breakfast today.  I happen to have half an avocado left from dinner we had last evening.  Thanks, my friend, and have a good weekend! John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 15, 2021: Eric, sunny side up is fine too. Whatever your preference will work. Eric Dierker from Spring Valley, CA. U.S.A. on January 15, 2021: I am all in, been there and done that. I like my eggs sunny side up though. I will try with the boiled. By golly I will have one today. Stop by a local stand for the avo. John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 15, 2021: Really, Flourish, never had avocados? Well, they are a real treat believe me. Sorry to make you hungry at an inappropriate time, but thanks for reading. FlourishAnyway from USA on January 15, 2021: I've never had avocados and with my intermittent fasting diet I skip breakfast but this is making me hungry. John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 15, 2021: Thank you for reading and for your fine comment, Umesh. I am glad you love eggs and will try this. Umesh Chandra Bhatt from Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, India on January 15, 2021: Looks delicious. Would try some day. Incidentally egg is my favourite also. Thanks John for sharing your culnery skills with us. John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 15, 2021: It really is delicious, Rosina. It is a shame if avocados aren’t available in your area. I have been trying to think of a substitute but can’t really think of anything. I am sure if Linda Lum (Carb Diva) reads this she will be able to suggest something. John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on January 15, 2021: Hello Liz, thank you for getting in early and being the first to read this. Yes, it is always difficult to know what to believe as far as the nutrition of various foods is concerned because it changes every few years. This has been the case with eggs and avocado. Yes, lemon juice stops avocado going brown in a salad, or you can store a cut avocado by sprinkling lemon juice on it and/or keeping it in a sealed plastic bag minus air. Rosina S Khan on January 15, 2021: This seems like a great mouthwatering breakfast. I am sure I would like to try it but I am not sure if avocados are available in our area. Do you know a substitute for them? Thanks for the wonderful share, John. Liz Westwood from UK on January 15, 2021: This is a great and very healthy idea. Confusion arose years ago with eggs and the debate over their healthiness. Now that the good and bad cholesterol has been sorted out, it's great to have them back on the healthy list. As you rightly say, they are so versatile and a great source of protein. I have learnt from previous mistakes with avocado. I wondered why they went brown in a salad until I was given the tip of putting lemon juice on them."
995,Leading Culinary Innovations: Pastry and Confectionery,food," KRANTHI KIRAN
Pastry and Confectionery ,Chef instructor
Culinary Academy Of India The Pastry and Confectionery department thrives upon the bridging of both the fields of art and science and is therefore, a department that evolves constantly. From timeless classics like the traditional wedding cake with marzipan to the more contemporary glazed dessert, every innovation in the world of pastry-making and confectionery is inspired by the desire to impress the guest more. An artist that understands the science behind this art will produce a dish of superior quality both in appearance and in taste. ‘Fusion’ art, or the fusing of two or more different cultures, play a dynamic role in the realm of pastry and confectionery innovation, unlike in its counterpart: the hot kitchen. Whether it be the introduction of exotic fruits like passion fruit or the trendy yuzu fruit, to the popular Japanese pastry technique Namelaka, the art of ‘fusion’ has birthed many innovations in the realm of pastry. Finesse is a skill every pastry chef strives towards throughout their lives. The perfection of this skill has led to numerous scientific and gastronomical innovations such as compressed choux or choux sphere that has surpassed earlier choux pastry buns by achieving a perfectly round shape. By restricting the growth or rising of the delicate or choux (light, airy) pastry, one can successfully create compressed discs of pastry or perfectly round shapes. Reverse lamination is a similar innovation in technique to do with the constant layering and folding of the pastry batter. Thereby successfully adding not only layers to the dough, but also an innovative layer of sophistication to the world of Viennoiserie. The layers of Viennoiserie pastry have never before been so fine. This has also led to the creation of pastries like brioche feuilletine, a delectable cross between bread and pastry. Furthermore, tarts and pie shells have moved away from their signature fluted, angled side patterns to the more modern and contemporary straight and sleek styles. It is well known that caramelization improves the flavour of sugars in a complex way. Perhaps too complex a scientific process to comprehend, but simple enough to apply in practice. Sugar is cooked or boiled at high temperatures, turning the clear crystalline sugar into liquid golden and caramel brown texture and colours. Curiously, the same technique been applied to white chocolate in recent years, and even stranger, to cream cheese! Who knows what will come next? An older trend that has had renewed interest in contemporary times, and thereby increased its scope as well, is the creation of life-like or realist desserts. From human busts to inanimate objects, every detail is crafted with utmost finesse and precision. However, the tools to accomplish this task have always existed. For example, innovative ingredients superior to sugar paste and gum paste are employed, like rice paste which tolerates higher levels of humidity gives the artist more space for a pastry chef to work on and innovate with. The culinary world is constantly moving forward and producing newer innovations. The ancillary industries to the pastry department have in like vein have created new ingredients and tools to give more scope and creative opportunity to the pastry chef. Ruby chocolate is one such example, or the novel 3D printing equipment that allows a pastry chef to craft and pre-design moulds or cut-out stencils and decorations, instantly giving new structure to one’s desserts. Pastries and confectioneries are generally the indulgence-worthy, guilt-free foods where one would typically shutdown that voice in one’s brain that overthinks one’s waist-lines. Yet, as the contemporary world would have it, the health bug has bitten pastry chefs too. Gone are the days where refined sugars, refined flour and processed ingredients are the major players in desserts. Diet restrictions and health trends have led to the evolution towards a health revolution where desserts are made with unrefined sugar, low and unsaturated fat, gluten and lactose-free variants. Even the ‘egg’, which we all know is one of the most important ingredients in the pastry and confectionery domain, serves a myriad of purposes. Not just the promotion of free-range egg farming, but even the promotion of movements like veganism and vegetarianism has led to the creation and development of desserts that are eggless and gelatine free. Many modern ingredients like sea-weed, which essentially functions as hydrocolloids and proteins, allows one to receive the same benefits from sources other than the egg. Another innovation trend that is clearly seen in modern times is the fusing of two desserts, and no this is not to be confused with the previously referred to fusion desserts. Many great chefs with the intention to make their mark in the world of pastry have created modern desserts like BRIOCOOKIE (Brioche and Cookie), BROOKIE (Brownie and Cookie), CRONUT (Croissant and Donut) or Croissant tart, wherein two different products have been integrated from their bare bone structure and fused to create an entirely new product. Whilst wedding cakes are by no means a new trend, nor the concept of building large tiered cakes, a renewed interest in the large cakes is witnessing the application of modern cake trends on a large scale. Whether it be glazing or velvet spray finishes, butte- cream painting, fault line or geode structures, these techniques are now being applied to the traditional large tiered cakes effectively moving wedding cakes away from their plain white finish into the segment of colourful themed cakes. What's the icing on top? They come with a variety of figurines which is a tradition that originates in Mexico instead of the more sophisticated names or toppers. Flavour development has taken the high seat when it comes to pastry and confectionery innovations. Nowadays, one can see choux batter flavoured with fruit pureés, chocolate present in croissant dough- all of these experiments with flavour done to ensure the richness of the flavour in pastry from its very foundational elements and not just as an addition. Another ideal medium for a pastry chef to display their skill in both flavour delivery and visual appeal have been entremets and petit fours. The modern entremets are stunning to look at with the most creative and alluring garnishes and finishes that consist of layer upon layer of flavours and textures resulting in the most pleasant mouth-feel. And yet, despite all these innovations, the pastry chef has never ignored the presence of natural ingredients like fresh fruits. Fresh fruits and fruit-based product usage are at an all-time high in pastries and confections. So, what’s next? Perhaps we will see an increased presence of natural flavourings through microbial synthesis, a technique that will allow the pastry world to further increase its flavour repertoire. One thing, however, is for certain: there is so much more to be seen, and so much more to come in the pastry and confectionery realm.

996,A Meatloaf Recipe Like No Other,food," Will is a resident of the Denver area but has Southern roots that run deep. This recipe takes a pound and a half of ground beef and turns it into a  meal that will make you famous among family and friends! For those who grew up in the South, meatloaf is a familiar dinner-time sighting. The standard recipe called for ground beef, some breading, and an egg to hold it all together; then a healthy dose of ketchup slathered on top. It all added up to a rather dry, mundane offering. Pair a bite with some mashed potatoes or cream-style corn, though, and you had something! If you're looking for a slightly elevated meatloaf recipe, you've come to the right place. This recipe switches things up a little by using moistened bread and a delicious sauce to liven things right up. There are a couple of things to keep in mind when prepping this delicious main dish. You'll need six slices of day-old bread. Will fresh bread work? Absolutely. Use white bread, wheat bread, whatever you have on hand. Take the six slices and moisten them with water. Get them fully soaked; then use your hands to gently ""wring them out"". Try to get as much excess water out as you can. Do not use a beater or mixer to stir up all the meatloaf ingredients. Use your hands; dig in there, and gently mix all the ingredients and shape it all into a nice shape, keeping it no more than three inches high. The shape you'll mold will be dependent upon the pan or dish you're using to bake the meatloaf. Don't pour the sauce over the meatloaf until about halfway through the baking cycle. You don't want the sauce cooking for the entire hour. During the last 15 minutes, open the oven door and spoon sauce from around the edges of your dish onto the meatloaf. If you want to get serious (and who isn't serious about meatloaf?), take a fork and poke holes into the meatloaf for the sauce to funnel into. The more sauce you have on top and inside of the meatloaf, the better! This isn't your typical dry meatloaf. This recipe produces a hearty, moist main dish that your family and friends will request again and again. Enjoy! 20 min 1 hour 1 hour 20 min Serves four people"
