0,"After flooding and lease cancellations, what comes next for Toombul Shopping Centre?",shopping-mall,"  Mirvac will eye major redevelopment after leases cancelled at flooded Toombul Shopping Centre, observers say A redevelopment of the flood-ravaged Toombul Shopping Centre site will capitalise on its proximity to the Brisbane CBD, airport and transport links, business and marketing leaders say. Owner Mirvac announced on yesterday that it would be terminating retail leases at the north Brisbane retail centre after flooding in late February causing extensive damage. In a statement, the developer said it had ""undertaken extensive assessments to understand the full impact of the flood damage at Toombul shopping centre"". ""After taking into account the current and potential future impacts of flooding on the site, it is impractical and undesirable to reinstate the centre to how it was prior to the flooding damage,"" the statement said. ""We are now assessing the future of the site recognising the importance of the continued provision of retail for this local community."" CM Ink director Catherine Michael said the decision to close the 54-year-old centre was ""always coming"". The marketing consultant said the value of the site and the age of the shopping centre meant Mirvac could benefit greatly from its redevelopment. ""Mirvac paid $228 million for that site in 2016, and the valuations of a lot of shopping centres spaces and those kind of sites have gone through the roof, even with COVID and people not going inside centres as much,"" Ms Michael said. ""It's one of those centres – it's not a Chermside, which has the car parks, has everything that opens and shuts – it was easy to get into and out of, close to a train station and buses. ""That's going to be the key to its next life — transport-oriented development. ""It's well located and has those [transport] feeders into there."" But retailers requiring large geographical footprints like Bunnings would probably not be eyeing the location, Ms Michael said. She said those businesses would have already mapped out their ideal sites. Ms Michael said combining retail and residential could be an option. ""They will be looking at what's the best use for that location for shareholders — but that community now with property prices, it's not an outer suburb,"" she said. ""Nundah isn't that far from the city, it's not far from the airport, it's got good feeder links with rail and buses. ""They'll look to do something quite clever and offer something that [Westfield] Chermside isn't. ""We've become highly dependent on cars, so parking is critical."" Brisbane North Chamber of Commerce president Simon Penrose said he expected a multi-use development. ""There may still be a lot of retail, but a lot of places are going for residential as well,"" he said. ""I haven't heard anything about what's likely, but that's certainly what's been going on in other developments."" Many businesses that were located at Toombul would have to ""start all over again from scratch"", Mr Penrose said. While there were vacant shops in the adjacent suburbs of Nundah, Stafford and Lutwyche, he said many residents would be inconvenienced because the Toombul centre was ""a hub of the local area"". ""It was one of the only shopping centres which had a lot of banks in there,"" he said. ""It was very much a community shopping centre. ""A lot of [the shoppers] will be going across to Chermside — that was evidenced the last couple of weekends when it took an hour to get out of the shopping centre."" Some retailers had already moved to new locations after the centre closed. Toombul Barber is now in Ascot, Ed's PCs in Taigum, Home & Her is in Nundah and the Function Well gym is operating in Newstead. Mr Penrose and Ms Michael also agreed that whatever was planned for the Toombul site would need to be heavily flood-proofed. Mr Penrose said shopping centres in Gympie were now built up high, with the first two levels being car parks. Once you're aware of the risks from disasters, you can plan for them — and it can help mitigate some of the impacts. Ms Michael said using the model of old Queenslander homes, which were also built high off the ground, would be wise. ""Things could go underneath them, you could hose them out — that flipping of things that require rent, trading, customers, safety, really good sanitation [and which] need to be up high in these flood zones,"" she said. ""A lot of these centres, it's not home, it's not work — it's the third space. It's the old town square. ""Retail provides a lot of that community — people do their walking and meet for a coffee there, it's knowing when a JP would be there, it's the newsagent, it's the daily things people would require regularly in their weeks."" On the other side of Brisbane, Bunnings regional operations manager Jason Doyle confirmed the Oxley hardware store would remain closed while ""redevelopment opportunities, including flood-proof design concepts"" were explored. But he said Bunnings would reopen its flood-hit Rocklea store by mid-June. ""For now, our Oxley team will continue to work at and support their nearby stores, as they have been over the past two-and-a-half months,"" Mr Doyle said. ""We'll continue to keep the local community updated as our plans for reopening the Rocklea store progress, and once we have further updates for our Oxley store.""

1,Flood-hit retailers at major Brisbane shopping centre have leases terminated,shopping-mall,"  Brisbane's Toombul Shopping Centre retailers have leases terminated by Mirvac after floods Retailers and shoppers have been left devastated by developer Mirvac's cancellation of retail leases after Toombul Shopping Centre was flooded in February. Business owners have been receiving letters informing them ""it is impractical and undesirable to reinstate the centre to how it was prior to the flooding damage"". ""As a result, to provide our retailers with certainty we have taken the difficult decision to close Toombul Shopping Centre and terminate all leases,"" the correspondence said. ""We are now assessing the future of the site, recognising the importance of continued provision of retail services for the local community."" Fruits of Eden and Eleni's Gourmet Deli owner Eleni Pippos said she was saddened by the decision, but was ""one of the lucky ones that were covered by flood insurance"". ""We have now received an official letter from Toombul Shopping Centre in regards to the future of the centre,"" she said. ""We are in talks with a few people in regards to a new premises, but needed the confirmation from Toombul with what was going to happen before we decided on the future of our store. ""Obviously this has impacted us with no income since closure, but yet again we were lucky with the Insurance side of things. ""We thank you all for your support at Toombul and miss seeing your faces. ""We hope to see you soon once we secure another store."" Mister Minit franchisee Trevor Kelley said he also received a letter cancelling his lease. He said the closure was ""disappointing"" and that Mirvac had left ""a lot of people hanging"". ""It's hard to move on,"" Mr Kelley said. ""I've got to start another business from scratch. ""I've put the last 20 years into that — [it] was going to be my retirement. ""We just scraped through COVID — I thought, 'Now I've got a year or two to put some money behind us for retirement.' ""Now, I can't get flood insurance because we weren't flooded and Centrelink refused to give me anything."" Mr Kelley said no-one at Mister Minit expected Mirvac to terminate leases. ""Mirvac owned the centre at Hinkler in Bundaberg and when it flooded they reopened,"" he said. A Mirvac spokesperson said the company had ""undertaken extensive assessments to understand the full impact of the flood damage at Toombul shopping centre"". ""As previously advised, there has been extensive damage to the centre across all major services, base building services and infrastructure,"" the spokesperson said. ""After taking into account the current and potential future impacts of flooding on the site, it is impractical and undesirable to reinstate the centre to how it was prior to the flooding damage. ""We appreciate this a disappointing outcome for our retailers and customers who are very loyal to our centre, with many tenants operating from Toombul for many years."" Documents sent to retailers also mentioned the centre's electricity, fire, air-conditioning systems, lifts and escalators ""all need significant repairs or replacement and mould is a significant issue"". ""Therefore all areas of the centre are not fit for occupation under the relevant building codes and reinstatement of services to allow UPSTAIRS to trade independently of ground level is not possible at this time,"" the letter read. Some retailers approached on Wednesday had not been told about the future of their leases. The owners of Toombul Barber and Home & Her had not received information from Mirvac early on Wednesday afternoon. Both businesses were temporarily operating at new locations. Maddy, who did not want her surname used, and her children enjoyed spending weekends at Toombul Shopping Centre. She said it was easy to get to and ""had everything"". ""I'm literally gutted, my daughter is probably going to cry,"" she said. ""I don't like Westfield, you struggle to get a park. ""The retailers at Toombul were friends, they were so friendly. ""I don't know what I'm going to do — I've been waiting for it to come back.""

2,analysis: Why are we all 'omni shopping' now?,shopping-mall,"  COVID-19 has dramatically changed how businesses and consumers behave. We've seen panic buying, the rise of the ""homebody economy"" and a strong shift towards contactless shopping. As we enter the third year of the pandemic, it seems the right time to reflect on the most important changes in consumer behaviour we've seen, and to make some predictions about COVID-19's lasting and pervasive effects on how we shop. One of the first impacts of COVID-19 was supermarket shelves being repeatedly stripped of toilet paper and other products ahead of lockdowns. One debate this behaviour sparked was about how much it could be considered irrational panic buying – or if it was rational to stockpile in response to the irrational behaviour of others. It was a real-life lesson in game theory. Decisions that make perfect sense for individuals can add up to a bad outcome for the community. Spending more money at the supermarket was at least possible. Consumption patterns changed significantly due to closed borders, restricted shopping, stay-at-home orders and general uncertainty. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows large drops in spending on transport, accommodation, recreation and entertainment services, and catering. Spending on food increased marginally, and on alcohol even more. The main reasons cited for increased drinking, according to one study, were stress (45.7 per cent), increased alcohol availability (34.4 per cent) and boredom (30.1 per cent). Spending also increased on home-related electronics, streaming services, furnishings, hardware and pet-related items. Interest increased in traditional activities such as cooking, reading and gardening. It is too early to tell to what extent these pandemic-driven shifts will translate into permanent behavioural change. However, research published last month, based on surveying 7,500 households in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, supports the likelihood of at least some long-term sectoral shifts in consumer behaviour. As restrictions relax, some marketing experts are predicting ""revenge spending"" – shopping sprees with abandon. Certainly many higher-income households have the money to splash out on a holiday, or new car, or home renovation, with Australians banking an estimated $140 billion in extra savings during the pandemic. Other research, such as the National Australia Bank's quarterly Consumer Sentiment Survey, suggests the pandemic has engendered greater caution. In its most recent survey, 37 per cent said they were mindful or careful of where they spent their money (42 per cent of women and 33 per cent of men). In terms of purchasing influences, 43 per cent nominated supporting local businesses, compared with 15 per cent environmental issues and 14 per cent social concerns such as labour practices. In NAB's consumer sentiment survey 43 per cent said their purchases were influenced by the desire to support local business. Some have wondered if, in the wake of COVID-19, we are about to experience another ""Roaring Twenties"" – emulating that period of economic prosperity and cultural dynamism in the 1920s following the deprivations of World War I and the ""Spanish flu"" epidemic. The circumstances are not exactly analogous. But new technologies and changes in habits are likely to drive several long-term changes in the way we shop. Our desire to reduce physical contact accelerated contactless payment methods. Research (from the Netherlands) suggests this will, for most, be a permanent change, accelerating a steady decline in the use of cash for shopping. Technology enabling payments using smartphones, such as supermarkets introducing a way to pay by scanning a QR code, will contribute to this shift. Ways to buy things without ever having to step inside a shop – such as curbside pick-up and home delivery – should also continue. In 2021 we've seen a number of startup businesses promising grocery deliveries in 15 minutes. Increasingly our buying behaviour will be shaped by what marketing experts call omnichannel shopping – a fancy word meaning using a variety of experiences to make a purchase. You might, for instance, go into a store to try out headphones, then go online to read third-party reviews and compare prices from different retailers. Technologies such as augmented reality will facilitate this trend. For example, IKEA's Place app allows you to see how furnishing will into your space. More and more what were once physical experiences will have their digital variants, from attending university to having an appointment with a health professional to taking a tour of the British Museum or exploring the Grand Canyon. Though these cannot replicate the real experience, they will be an increasingly common way to ""try before you buy"". The future of shopping will gradually merge the digital and physical. But whatever changes, some things will remain constant: the human desire to make experiences convenient, fun and meaningful.

3,"'Retailers are on alert but not alarmed': Shoppers expected to spend $21b in Boxing Day sales, despite COVID-19 case rise",shopping-mall," Coronavirus Australian shoppers are expected to spend $21 billion at retailers across the country during this year's Boxing Day sales, despite the surge in COVID-19 cases and rising concerns about the highly infectious Omicron strain. Australian Retailers Association (ARA) research conducted with Roy Morgan predicts Australians will have spent $58.8 billion in pre-Christmas sales, and a massive $21 billion in post-Boxing Day sales (which run from Boxing Day to January 15). On Thursday, Premier Dominic Perrottet announced density limits of one person per 2 square metres for hospitality venues would also be reinstated from December 27 for one month, while QR code measures would be ""back in a limited way"". He urged people to practise social distancing, while NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard warned: ""Get sensible, folks. Don't try [to] mingle too closely with people you don't know."" However, ARA chief executive Paul Zahra says the recent spike in cases will not stop people shopping in-store. ""In terms of Omicron, retailers are on alert but not alarmed,"" Mr Zahra said. ""With cases on the rise again, consumers are a little more cautious, and a few are taking extra precautions."" ARA still estimates Boxing Day sales' spending will rise 2.1 per cent on the previous year, to be up 12.6 per cent on pre-pandemic levels in 2019. ""We're still seeing high demand in stores and expecting sales to be upbeat, with a record $21.1 billion forecast to be spent in the post-Christmas sales,"" Mr Zahra said. Safety and hygiene remain important protocols for retailers, he said, as people adjusted to living with COVID. ""As they have throughout the pandemic, businesses will adapt to the changing health measures,"" he said. The country had experienced record-breaking Black Friday sales and, while many shoppers have moved on-line, many were still planning to go to shop in stores. Separate research from Commonwealth Bank, undertaken at the start of the month, suggested that Australians could spend $4 billion at retailers across the country on the first day of the Boxing Day sales. The bank's research — carried out between December 1 to 8, based on responses from a sample of more than 1,000 people — said that most Australians surveyed, 69 per cent, are looking for bargains. CBA predicts clothing, apparel and shoes will be the top purchase category during the sales, and that younger females, age 18 to 29 years, are expected to be the biggest spenders in this category. The next-biggest spending category is predicted to be technology, home electrical and white goods, followed by homeware and furniture. Males aged 30 to 39 are most likely to update their tech, the bank said. CBA said 40 per cent of those looking to shop during the sales have already predicted how much they would be spending. The average spend is expected to be $557, up 14 per cent from what people say they spent one year ago ($487). Despite the rise in online shopping, the CBA said that nearly half of Australians, or 41 per cent, planned to shop the Boxing Day sales in-store, while 28 per cent planned on shopping both in-store and online. ""Australians are embracing shopping and are excited to hit the sales,"" CBA's executive general manager, everyday banking, Kate Crous said.

4,Online Christmas shopping soars as Australia Post scrambles to deliver presents on time,shopping-mall,"  A record number of presents under the Christmas tree are likely to have been purchased online this year, as Australia Post scrambles to deliver more than 1 million parcels in Queensland this week. The National Retail Association (NRA) is forecasting a 51 per cent increase in online sales across Australia this Christmas, worth a total of $8.2 billion. But NRA chief executive officer Dominique Lamb said the overall spend is likely to be even higher. ""Australians are set to spend $60.8 billion between November 15 and Christmas Day,"" she said. ""In the last three days towards Christmas, we know Queenslanders will spend $1.6 billion, which is about a 5 per cent increase on last year's figures. ""Consumers are still going out, they're still spending, because at the end of the day they want to see their families and those domestic borders being open is really pushing that spending along."" An Australia Post spokeswoman said their Queensland staff have delivered more than 1.45 million parcels so far this week, including 500,000 packages on Monday alone. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Under current COVID-19 restrictions in Queensland, people over the age of 12 must wear masks at all times in shopping centres, supermarkets, and shops. Amie Kinnane said she was a little nervous about venturing to Brisbane's Chermside shopping centre with her children amid rising case numbers. ""But Christmas photos with Santa is kind of a priority in our family,"" Ms Kinnane said. ""It is a tradition, so we're here and we're just doing everything we can to get away from other people really. ""I know lots of people are doing online shopping or click and collect … so I think it is a little quieter than usual."" But Fiona Stager, the co-owner of Avid Reader bookshop in inner-city West End, said online sales were no match for the experience of choosing a gift in store. ""Now that we're lucky that we can be out in a safe COVID environment, people are wanting to come, because there's nothing quite like looking through a book in a book shop,"" Ms Stager said. ""They're also wanting to shop local."" A pop-up shop stocked with products made in rural Queensland is trying to empty its shelves before closing on December 30.

5,'Proud grinch': Why some people are not in the mood for Christmas,shopping-mall,"  It's supposed to be the ""most wonderful time of the year"", but not everyone will be telling you to ""be of good cheer"" as Christmas nears. Jamila Rizvi, traditionally a fan of this festive season, is one who is not feeling the Christmas spirit this year. The Sydney Morning Herald columnist finds it ""hard to pretend that the past two years didn't happen"". ""We are supposed to do joy on steroids, but I am finding it harder this year to muster up the over-the-top joy and excitement,"" Rizvi told Afternoons host Josh Szeps on ABC Radio Sydney ""The trauma that you have had over the past two years eventually catches up with you, even when you have tried to outrun it or in my case out-sourdoughed and out-crafted it."" Rizvi said uncertainty over the new Omicron strain of COVID-19 was casting a shadow over people's minds. ""Last year, I saw Christmas as a turning point to put the past behind me and switch to a better way of doing things,"" she said. ""I thought this [the pandemic] was over. We were done and 2021 would be a better and easier year than 2020 was. ""The sadness continues while we are still seeing people die from COVID every day in Australia and around the world."" The writer said she had seen many friends ""doing it tough when it comes to income, work hours and job security"". ""The idea of a festive season that comes with having to spend money to be festive doesn't excite them and is probably making many people nervous. ""For those who have just lost jobs or loved ones, it is almost painful to pretend to be happy at the Christmas lunch table because that's not how they are feeling at that moment."" Kate Hoffacker from the Central Coast, who claims to be a ""proud Grinch"", said Christmas represented a great strain on people's finances. ""Not everyone is cashed up to buy their kid the greatest toy of the season,"" Ms Hoffacker said. ""A lot of nieces, nephews and friends' kids just expect so much and are never happy with what they have. ""I have had my nieces chuck stuff on the floor and look at me like they wanted to say, 'You suck as an aunty'."" The sales executive said she often felt fatigued by the excessive commercialisation of the holiday season. ""From Kids Frenzy, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas Eve sales straight to Boxing Day sales, we are relentlessly bashed by commercials to buy stuff we don't need,"" she said. In defence of the holidays, pro-Christmas advocate Josh Szeps said the festive period was copping unfair flack for ""problems not of its own making"" and issues that have ""piggybacked the occasions"". ""Voracious and ungrateful kids are a result of bad parenting, while companies shoving everything down our throat during the holiday season is a product of late-stage capitalism and corporate greed,"" he said. ""If you boil it down to an opportunity to be generous and express love, whether you are religious or not, it is just that time of the year when everyone takes stock and a pause to reconnect."" Ms Hoffacker said there was a great deal of pressure on people to have a good time during the Christmas season. ""It is stressful to spend a ridiculous amount of effort, energy and money on a ridiculous number of guests and amount of food. ""What people need this year is not extravagant partying but a relaxation time to unwind and refresh for a new year."" Rizvi said the pressure to socialise may be challenging for many people suffering from anxiety after extended lockdowns. ""Many of us spent the majority of the past 18 months inside our homes and still struggle to ease back into social activities,"" she said.

6,"Sir David Attenborough writes to Adelaide shopping centre, asking for removal of falsely attributed quote",shopping-mall,"  Sir David Attenborough writes to Tea Tree Plaza shopping centre, asking for removal of falsely attributed quote An Adelaide shopping centre has come under fire for falsely attributing a quote about the plight of bees to Sir David Attenborough, with the broadcaster personally writing to centre asking for the plaque to be removed. The plaque at the Westfield Tea Tree Plaza shopping centre in Adelaide's north-east caught the eye of science graduate Heath Hunter. ""Back in July some time I saw this really beautiful mural of honey bees … of all places it was actually down this little corridor leading towards the toilets,"" Mr Hunter told ABC Radio Adelaide. ""On the edge of the mural there was this tiny little plaque, maybe 10 centimetres wide, and it had these fake quotes from David Attenborough on there."" The plaque quoted Sir David as saying: ""In the last five years the bee population has dropped by a third. If bees were to disappear from the face of the Earth, humans would have just four years left to live"". Mr Hunter said he recognised the quote, which has been attributed to other iconic figures as well. ""I know that they've been attributed to [Albert] Einstein in the past,"" he said. ""I'd seen it online a lot, but I'd never seen it engraved and displayed in a public place."" Mr Hunter said he reached out to the mural's artist, who directed him to the shopping centre's management. ""I just explained to them that it's not true and would you mind removing it,"" he said. A couple of months later he returned to the centre and the plaque was still there, so he decided to go a step further. He wrote to Sir David and sent him a photo of the quote. ""He sent a little letter to me and said thanks for letting me know, and then there was a separate one attached,"" Mr Hunter said. The attached letter was to the shopping centre asking for the plaque to be taken down, which Sir David asked Mr Hunter to send on. ""The funny thing is, the letter from David Attenborough wasn't enough to make them remove it. ""I sent them that about three weeks ago, but they got a call from a journalist yesterday morning and it came down pretty quick."" A spokesperson for Westfield Tea Tree Plaza confirmed the plaque had been taken down. ""We appreciate the customer bringing this to our attention,"" the spokesperson said. ""The plaque, including the quote, has been removed."" As a lifelong Sir David fan, Mr Hunter will be hanging on to the letter he received.

7,"Be careful if you're planning to shop Black Friday, Cyber Monday sales, warns Choice",shopping-mall,"  It used to be an American-only affair. The term Black Friday reportedly originated in the 1950s when factory workers would call in sick on the day after Thanksgiving, in order to have a four-day weekend. Then Black Friday became a once-a year in-store shopping event, with crowds of shoppers choking up malls across America the day after Thanksgiving. But in recent years US-based retailers have introduced Black Friday to other countries around the world. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are now firmly entrenched in the Australian sales calendar, rivalling more traditional sale events such as Boxing Day. The Australian Retailers Association (ARA) and Roy Morgan predict a record $5.4 billion will be spent in stores and online over the four days of Black Friday to Cyber Monday. But consumer groups are warning customers to beware before they open their wallets. A Choice survey found that almost all Australians (92 per cent) have heard of the Black Friday sales, with just over half (52 per cent) expressing an interest in buying something during this year's event. Choice carried out a six-month investigation, tracking the price of four espresso machines across 13 retailers, to see when the products were at their cheapest. Although retailer prices fluctuated during Choice's investigation, it found that overall Black Friday didn't offer the best deals. ""Instead, we found cheaper, or similarly priced, options on various dates in the six months prior – up to 33 per cent cheaper in some instances,"" according to CHOICE editor Margaret Rafferty. ""This is just one example, but it goes to show that big discounts can be found year-round and you may not need to wait for Black Friday to get the best deal."" However, Choice also tracked six months of price fluctuations to determine when each item was most expensive. ""Compared to those prices, Black Friday was cheaper by up to 25 per cent,"" it said, recommending people check the prices across a range of different retailers. Choice says that legally, retailers don't have to offer a refund or exchange if something's the wrong size or if a customer finds it cheaper elsewhere. It also warns that not all products available for sale are safe, and that price doesn't equal performance. ""Particularly when it comes to appliances and tech, there's so much variation and choice on the market, it's easy to get duped into buying a dud,"" Ms Rafferty said. ""We're seeing more and more Australians turn to independent reviews and testing to escape the marketing hype and pick up a genuine bargain."" The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has also been tracking whether retailers are offering customers actual discounts. In May online retailer Kogan Australia was sued by the consumer watchdog for offering fake discounts to its customers. UK-based consumer group ""Which?"" also carried out an investigation into Black Friday sales. It found that for UK shoppers, more than 90 per cent of Black Friday deals were the same price or cheaper in the six months before the sales event last year. The consumer association told shoppers to make sure the discounts were ""truly genuine"" ahead of this year's sales. It analysed items by looking at the prices offered by six companies every day during the six months before and after 2020's Black Friday, as well as on the day itself. It found that 184 out of 201 items from six retailers, which included Amazon, AO, Argos, Currys, John Lewis and Richer Sounds, were priced the same or cheaper before Black Friday in 2020. Which? suggests that before shoppers rush into impulse-buying a discounted product, that they check the price of the product across multiple websites and any footnotes about the offer. ""We've often found that more than one shop will sell a product at a similar price, but only one claims that the price is a special offer,"" Which? said. It said retailers often highlight savings in red ""as a way of influencing customers and they can be quite misleading"". ""When we looked at items on special offer across major retailers for the first half of 2020, we found that several products were listed at their lower price for longer than they were at their full 'was' price,"" it said. ""We've also found retailers using old RRPs (recommended retail prices) as 'was' prices, so they reflect the value of the item when it was first released, not its current value. ""Rather than automatically trusting anchor prices, it's better to check against other shops' prices to try to work out the true value of the item you're buying."" The consumer group also suggests looking out for notes or signs explaining offers, noting that ""rules that govern special offers are vague"". ""We've seen notes that explained the product was actually only at the higher price for a fortnight, six months before the current offer,"" it said. ""Sometimes these notes [on so-called shopping deals] are well flagged, but sometimes they're completely buried."" In response to the Which? investigation, which was reported by British media, Amazon told the BBC that it sought to ""offer our customers great value thanks to low prices all year round"" and that customers could ""easily compare prices, allowing them to make an informed purchase decision"". Australian Retailers Association chief executive Paul Zahra tipped a ""sales frenzy"" over the Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping period. ""November is now Australia's biggest shopping month of the year, and that can be mostly attributed to the spike in sales we see over Black Friday and Cyber Monday,"" he said. ""For the past two years, November has beaten December as the biggest month for Australian retail sales throughout the year. ""Black Friday and Cyber Monday can be credited with this trend as people snap up some bargains and shop early for Christmas."" But he warned consumers to be prepared for delays on their product arriving due to supply chain issues. ""With our supply chains under significant pressure, consumers need to be shopping early if they want their products to arrive in time for Christmas,"" he said. ""There are several issues that retailers are navigating at the moment — everything from COVID impacts, shipping delays and threats of industrial action from port workers and delivery drivers. There's a perfect storm of issues so consumers need to get in quick to ensure they get the products they want."" Choice says while better discounts can be found at other times of the year, if it's an item you are desperate for, it may still be worth adding that item to cart on Black Friday before it becomes unavailable due to supply shortages. ""Our investigation also found that, over time, several stores no longer carried the item in stock,"" Ms Rafferty said. ""This is typical of the appliance cycle – as products get older, they're often replaced with newer versions from the manufacturer."" ""This may mean you can grab a good deal on old stock the retailer is trying to get rid of, but you also run the risk of it selling out before you've had a chance to add it to cart.""

8,How to spot fake online reviews,shopping-mall,"  How to tell the difference between authentic and fake online reviews As lockdowns along Australia's east coast spark an online shopping boom, many Australians are growing increasingly reliant on online reviews to make purchase decisions. So what is digital ""word of mouth"" really worth and can we really trust it? A recent survey of 1,000 Australians found 95 per cent read reviews before buying online. Reviews.org editor Kate Reynolds, who carried out the research, says she studiously checks out reviews before making purchases, and 95 per cent [of the survey participants] were the same. ""We want to make sure that we feel well informed before making any purchasing decision,""  Ms Reynolds told Focus host Cassie McCullagh on ABC Radio Sydney. The survey also found 52 per cent of participants had fallen for fake reviews and 26 per cent did not know how to spot inauthentic reviews. ""We know fake reviews exist and are easy to spot but often they are not,"" Ms Reynolds said. Ms Reynolds said false testimonials could have a wide range of origins. ""A business may post fake positive reviews about their own goods or services or offer incentives to consumers to post positive reviews or remove negative reviews,"" Ms Reynolds said. ""Businesses may also post fake negative reviews about their competitors to gain an advantage in the market."" Nick, the owner of a Sydney recycling business, said dealing with a false reviewer had been challenging. ""As much as you try to talk to this person, they just won't respond,"" he said. Rod works at a Sydney club where the owners of the venue's restaurant have changed. He said it was a problem that reviews for the former management had remained online. ""They are dragging them [the new restaurant owners] down and it is extremely difficult to remove those outdated reviews,"" Rod said. Not only are fake reviews originating from false identities, but also from frustrated customers. Consumer psychologist Adam Ferrier said many negative reviews were often exaggerated. ""If it bleeds, it leads,"" Mr Ferrier said. ""Consumers sometimes blow bad experiences out of proportion as a way to exact revenge and gain justice, when they want to be watched and heard. ""People can be over-dramatic about something trivial."" Jess Goldsbro runs a small business selling homewares on e-commerce platform Etsy and her own website. ""The review process is hugely detrimental on Etsy because you have no control over what people put up there about your business,"" Ms Goldsbro said. ""Some businesses live and die on these comments."" Online review researcher Kate Reynolds said the increasing significance of online reviews meant there was a great need to filter out inaccurate information. Here are the suggestions from the experts: And as much as we value accurate information to make our decision, we should consider the power of feedback and remember the wise words of Spiderman's Uncle Ben: ""with great power comes great responsibility.""

9,Man killed in stabbing attack at Cairns shopping centre,shopping-mall,"  Man dies after knife attack at Cairns Central shopping centre A man has died after a knife attack at a major Cairns shopping centre early this morning. Police have alleged a 39-year-old man attacked a man in his 50s with a knife on the ground floor of the Cairns Central shopping centre about 8:00am. Detective Inspector Kevin Goan said the victim sustained lacerations to his throat and died about 20 minutes later. Police said a man was in custody and assisting police with their investigation into the death. Police officers could not say whether the two men were known to each other. ""Our immediate information is that it appears to have been a chance happening but the offender was resolute in what he had intended,"" Detective Inspector Goan said. ""These investigations are in their infancy."" While the shopping centre was not busy at the time, Detective Inspector Goan said there were multiple witnesses and ample CCTV footage that would assist their investigation. ""It's fortuitous to our investigation that there was limited foot traffic but it's also fortuitous that others aren't exposed to what's transpired here,"" he said. ""As you would imagine with a stabbing incident there's an amount of blood everywhere, but that's about all I can say at this time."" Forensic officers remain on the scene while parts of the shopping centre have been closed to the public.

10,Cheer or fear? Retailers weigh Christmas 2021,shopping-mall,"  Retailers hoping for Christmas cheer after large parts of Australia emerge from COVID lockdown It is fewer than 100 days to Christmas, but what will it look like this year? With his toy shop in outer-suburban Melbourne shut, Dean Niclasen is filling online orders from a nearby warehouse. His customers are bored of the pandemic. ""It's been driven not by purchases for children, but by adults,"" he said, reaching to a shelf for a $300 box containing NASA's Discovery space shuttle. ""So lots of puzzles, and lots of adult-oriented LEGO sets. ""People are looking for things to do at home, really."" Surprising news this week has buoyed retailers wondering how heavily to stock their shelves for a holiday season following a traumatic and difficult year. With Victoria and much of New South Wales – the nation's most populous states – in lockdown, when data was collected on how consumers felt in September you would have expected it to reflect a nation stuck on the couch indefinitely. Instead, the long-running Westpac-Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment was up, with respondents ready to spend big and looking forward to the future. According to Westpac chief economist Bill Evans, a 2 per cent jump ""at a time when Australia's two major cities are in full lockdown and the economy is contracting is extraordinary evidence of the resilience of the Australian consumer"". ""It really does emphasise the optimism that is building around the vaccination program."" On a clear day you can see from Sorrento's pier all the way back over the bay to Melbourne. Fashion boutique Sorrento Collective is on the main street and remains open, but only to pack online orders and answer the door for click and collect pick-ups. ""At the moment the business is pretty much in hibernation,"" co-founder Domenique Nestel said from the Victorian holiday spot. ""We have the website running that we're doing small amounts of sales through … it's keeping us in touch with our customers but pretty much we are just sitting tight trying to survive."" The consumer sentiment index increased to 106.2 in September from 104.1 in August. A reading of 100 means optimists equal pessimists, so the current reading signifies ""optimists comfortably exceed pessimists"" according to the research. That shows something incredible has happened. In August last year, Victoria was in a lockdown that would eventually stretch to 111 days. Even though it was the only state locked down, the national Index stood at 79.5. The fear of what was ahead next stopped people spending. even though Melbourne, Sydney, the Australian Capital Territory and various regional areas are locked down right now, consumers feel more confident than they did in surveys taken five years before the pandemic. As the report puts it, consumers are ""looking through current lockdown disruptions to a sustained improvement"". Rising vaccination levels boost the likelihood of lockdowns ending (and being less common in future) and that people will enjoy a merry Christmas and a better 2022. That is pumping optimism through people's wallets. Domenique Nestel is more confident she will be able to buy stock for a particular season – and sell clothes in that season to people who have got the occasions to wear them to. ""I think for the first time in the last couple of weeks – listening to the plan out, with the vaccination rates increasing – we're feeling really hopeful,"" she said. ""And we feel that we can actually plan for the first time in two years, really."" There is an astonishing split in how hopeful people are feeling, based on their vaccination status. Confidence is up among the 57 per cent of respondents that have had at least one vaccine dose: it is at 103.7 points. Even higher is confidence among the 27 per cent of people who are unvaccinated but willing to get the jab. It is a white-hot 121.6. The strongest gains in how consumers are feeling were in the 18-24 and 25-34 age groups, many of whom have only just been given access to the vaccine program. The twist? The remaining 16 per cent of people who responded to the survey, who described themselves as either unwilling to be vaccinated or undecided have a sentiment level of 90. It is the only group where pessimists outnumber optimists, economist Bill Evans confirmed. ""I think those people for various reasons have decided not to be vaccinated, but they must be fearing the insecurity of being in the society when case numbers are going to be high, most people are vaccinated, and they may be vulnerable."" Another factor could be the increasing number of large employers mandating vaccination – and public plans to only allow vaccinated people into mass events and venues – which will reduce jobs and opportunities available to unvaccinated people. The Prime Minster has refused to mandate COVID vaccines for workplaces, so where does that leave businesses who want to require their staff, and even customers, to be vaccinated? Mr Evans expects the number of people in the ""don't know"" category to slide as more take up the offer of vaccination. ""But I suspect that the 10 per cent that aren't planning to get vaccinated will be a hard number,"" he said. The study interviewed 1,200 people over the age of 18 across Australia in the week from September 6. The data was weighted to reflect the distribution of Australia's population. Australia's unemployment rate dropped to the lowest level in almost 13 years this week, but that is not the full picture. The number of hours worked slumped painfully last month, with many people giving up looking for work during the continuing COVID lockdowns in New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT. Hours worked fell 3.7 per cent, with underemployment rising a full percentage point to 9.3 per cent. Australia's unemployment rate drops again, but a steep fall in hours worked last month paints a more accurate picture of the economic pain resulting from COVID lockdowns. But analysis from payments into the accounts of our biggest bank demonstrates what Gareth Aird calls a ""counterintuitive dynamic"". Mr Aird, head of Australian economics for the Commonwealth Bank's research team, found the areas hardest hit are seeing accelerating growth in their household income. ""[Our] data indicates that at an aggregate level the reduction in household income from job losses to date in NSW and Victoria has been more than offset by an increase in government support payments,"" he said. This contrasts with data from other firms and complaints that federal government support – at astonishing levels in 2020 – had tapered too sharply this year. However, wage growth remains near record lows. With the cost of living still rising, and the cost of housing exploding, many people feel they are going backwards. But Dr Angela Jackson, lead economist at Equity Economics does not see that changing, even though we closed borders leading to labour shortages and a record number of job vacancies. ""It's going to be variable, as it always is. It's going to depend on your sector,"" she told ABC News. ""Of course, coming out of this lockdown we're going to have migration picking up which is going to put some downward pressure on wages as well. ""I don't think the prospects of wage rises are particularly great – we haven't seen them even increase this year where there have been significant labour shortages."" With a global shipping crunch, Christmas shopping might need to be brought forward, as some products will be missing from the shelves this December. Global supply chain problems are set to cause pain for Christmas shoppers this year. COVID-19 outbreaks have closed ports and factories resulting in a backlog of shipments to Australia. Like most retailers, toy store owner Dean Niclasen must make decisions about stock between six and 12 months in advance, well before the tinsel is hung. ""I'm optimistic about the Christmas period this year, I think that there will be a significant reopening of retail and some large pent-up demand,"" he said. ""But I think that we'll have a bit of a hangover in the new year when people realise it's not 2019 and there will be ongoing significant outcomes from COVID. People just aren't seeing yet.""

11,"COVID has accelerated the trend to buying online, but will it really spell the death of the shopping centre?",shopping-mall,"  Retail experts say shopping centres aren't a thing of the past, but COVID has changed the way we shop There is little doubt the COVID-19 pandemic has changed shopping habits, but retail experts say it is the acceleration of an existing trend rather than a major shift in the market. Shopping centres have made news throughout the pandemic, and in this case, all publicity is not good publicity. Malls, supermarkets and retailers have been listed as exposure sites during outbreaks and have even been at the centre of clusters such as one in Sydney's Bondi. It seems shoppers have fairly short memories, however, with the recent company reporting season revealing a recovery for shopping centre operators during periods of eased restrictions. From panic buying and hoarding to forced click-and-collect, the impact of COVID has been clearly evident in how retailers performed over the past year. JB Hi-Fi benefited from people working and entertaining themselves at home, while online furniture retailer Temple & Webster saw its revenue rise as people upgraded their interiors. ""The main shift we've seen is this monumental shift to online,"" said Jana Bowden, an associate professor of marketing at Macquarie University. Supermarket sales rose, particularly online, as people stocked up on essentials. There has also been a move to shopping locally, particularly during outbreaks, and the popularity of neighbourhood strips and supermarkets meant some grocery retailers outperformed others. Coles has more stores in shopping centres than its competitors and chief executive Steven Cain said that meant easing restrictions and increased vaccination would ""create a level playing field again"". Other retail sectors, such as clothing, were hit hard during last year's initial lockdowns, but recently staged a recovery. Mosaic Brands, the owner of Noni B, Rivers and Katies, returned to profit from last year's loss after closing more than 200 stores and growing its online sales despite catering to the over-50s demographic. Shopping centres themselves have also posted a recovery after suffering through falls in foot traffic and store closures — some temporary, some permanent. The head of real estate equities research at Jefferies, Sholto Maconochie, was closely watching how the real estate investment trusts (REITs) — many of which have retail properties in their portfolios — performed during reporting season. He described it as a ""tale of two halves"", with the start of the 2021 financial year more impacted by COVID restrictions and the second half seeing a recovery as restrictions eased and outbreaks became sporadic. “A lot of the REITs pretty much all saw foot traffic and sales back to or above pre-COVID levels,” Mr Maconochie said. One thing that remained weaker were rents — Mr Maconochie said new rents charged to tenants were around 10 per cent below old rents, but that was still an improvement from the depths of the pandemic. Despite threats of store closures from some major retail groups last year, Mr Maconochie said occupancy remained at around 98 per cent across most centres, something that was ""unheard of compared to global malls"". However, he noted occupancy rates were masking the fact that some leases were in a ""hold over"" phase, similar to a ""month-to-month"" arrangement. The recovery experienced by some of the hardest-hit retailers and centres when lockdowns ended and restrictions eased suggested shoppers had short memories about any reluctance to visit retail stores. But Dr Bowden said the online shopping shift would not be reversed post-pandemic, citing research that shows eight in 10 Australian households now do some of their shopping online and many expect to continue the habit. ""49 per cent of consumers globally say they're not going to stop, and shop online more than pre-pandemic,"" she said. In the short term, she forecast some lingering consumer reluctance around high-density centres due to virus fears, but in the longer term, it is the convenience factor that is likely to keep people online. ""Behaviours can be sticky,"" agreed Mr Maconochie. However, he said he expected a similar, if somewhat smaller, recovery to that seen over the past financial year when the current lockdowns in New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT ease. ""I think people will get back to their norm … people do like to get out of the house."" Some shopping centre owners are hedging their bets between bricks-and-mortar retail and online sales. Stockland boss Tarun Gupta said it was the acceleration of a trend that was underway even before the pandemic. ""There's a while to go in terms of e-commerce and customers getting more comfortable across the various demographics interacting and buying products online,"" Mr Gupta said. ""That's why in our portfolio, we have… quite a large logistics land bank, which we'll be using to provide those distribution channels as consumer habits shift."" With some of the changes to shopping behaviour likely here to stay even once the pandemic subsides, it may mean some significant changes to the way shopping centres and retail stores look and operate. Francis Loughran founded Future Food, which consults on the development of food precincts, including the dining areas in malls. He said the major shopping centres were already shifting away from traditional retail towards becoming ""mixed-used developments"", so the pandemic was unlikely to derail their future plans. ""'Mixed-use development' just says that shopping is only part of the total experience,"" he said. Examples of mixed-use developments include apartment towers over centres, and council facilities like libraries, exhibition spaces, childcare centres and gyms being integrated into shopping centres. ""The larger [shopping centres], we control a lot of land around them,"" Mr Gupta said. ""The long-term evolution as we're thinking about some of those assets is how they can be enhanced by putting in some more mixed uses as part of being vibrant town centres."" In the last 15 years, Mr Loughran has witnessed a shift from a ""product-based delivery"" model to centres incorporating external dining spaces, food halls and entertainment precincts. ""The growth in food and hospitality is huge. It's a major part of the asset development,"" he said, noting that food and beverage had gone from around 2-4 per cent of the leasable area of centres to around 4-6 per cent in Sydney and Melbourne, and as high as 30 per cent in overseas markets such as the Middle East. As some traditional outlets, like fashion stores, reduce the number of physical stores, Mr Loughran said he expected new types of tenants to be waiting in the wings to occupy shopping centre real estate. ""Dark kitchens are basically set up so that their kitchens operate serving various menus, so they could work with [food delivery services] to have five or six cuisines combined in one kitchen,"" he said. ""That kitchen could be in a secondary area in a shopping centre. They become a new tenant, they're paying rent and trading away."" Mr Maconochie said he thought click-and-collect would become further ingrained in shopping centres, with retailers expecting centres to provide the facilities to make it viable. ""They're all looking at ways to help their retailers, to make it easier for people to come in, with a concierge service or click-and-collect… and that's a really good way to help bring people back to the mall and save costs, because it is cheaper to pick it up in-store than send via online."" For supermarket giant Coles, the future means growing its presence in the smaller-format store space, allowing it to open in inner-city locations and smaller shopping strips. ""Historically, we'd found it difficult to get a full line supermarket into some of these suburbs and so a couple of years ago, we started Coles Local as an experiment to see if we could make a smaller supermarket work,"" Mr Cain said. But he is not writing off the big stores in shopping malls just yet. ""I'm confident that there is a strong future for shopping centres, as well as local stores here in Australia.""

12,"Criminals using illegal weapons, fake currency bought online",shopping-mall,"  Australian authorities worry about ease of online availability of illegal weapons, fake currency Consumers are buying illegal weapons and lifelike reproductions of currency so easily online that it has Australian authorities worried, a criminologist says. Police allege items bought on one US-based shopping platform, Wish, have been used in several crimes in Queensland during the past year. Security guard Shane Burrows was attacked with capsicum spray at PJ’s Irish pub in Cairns in November 2020, after confronting a patron about allegedly fake $100 notes. ""When the offender got ready to leave, I asked him to stay and this is when he became aggressive and he sprayed me several times directly in the face with capsicum spray,"" Mr Burrows said. ""I've been burnt in a fire before and it felt like he had an aerosol can and lighter spraying directly onto my face. ""My face burnt, my throat closed up, I couldn't breathe, and I couldn't open my eyes or see anything. ""Now I'm on Work Cover while I wait for eye surgery."" Earlier in the night, the same offender is alleged to have used capsicum spray inside the Cairns Reef Hotel Casino, reportedly seeing five people taken to hospital. During a search of the man’s Woree home, police allegedly uncovered weapons, including a replica gun, a ballistics vest, knives, a machete, an axe, a taser, capsicum spray and a cattle prod. Police allege some of the items were bought via the Wish website. In a separate case, Sunshine Coast man Gary Kenneth Kassulke was jailed this month for importing gun silencers and an automatic knife. The Commonwealth prosecutor said Kassulke used Wish to purchase the items between January and April last year. Kassulke was arrested after Australian Border Force officers intercepted several packages containing silencers disguised as ""aluminium car parts"". Griffith University school of criminology and criminal justice's Dr Andrew Childs said the easy access to illegal items and weapons online had law enforcement officials worried. ""These items weren't bought on the dark web, but a website that anybody, of any age, can access and purchase from,"" he said. ""It’s not illegal to import car parts and when the package is being inspected at the border, you can't really tell the intent of the purchase. ""We have seen some sellers doing creative things like advertising glass party straws which are actually ice pipes, and this makes it very difficult to police."" A spokesperson for Wish said the company did not condone the listing of illegal weapons on its platform and it had removed items from sale. “Such listings violate both our merchant policies and Terms of Service,"" the spokesperson said. ""In this instance, it appears the user purchased items advertised as car parts that can be made into makeshift 'silencers', along with two knives. “Each listing has been removed and the merchants have had appropriate remedial measures applied for violating our policies.” But a quick search of the website showed reproduction money, hidden knives, tasers and gun parts still for sale. Dr Childs said Wish and other similar websites worked with third party sellers, who were responsible for the distribution of their products. ""It's a peculiar situation as the platforms will say they are taking down sellers from their platform but, at the same time, they have incentives to keep sellers because they are making commission from them,” Dr Childs said. ""The current trend of online markets is, if there's a way to make money by selling illicit products, there's going to be a group of people that are going to pounce on that."" The Wish spokesperson said the company took a proactive approach. ""We have been, and will continue to, deploy various measures to prevent, identify and remove listings of illegal knives and weapons in our efforts to support a safe environment for users to shop online,"" the spokesperson said.
