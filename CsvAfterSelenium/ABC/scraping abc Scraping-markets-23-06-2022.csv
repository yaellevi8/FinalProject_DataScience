0,"ASX falls after biggest weekly loss since 2020 on interest rate, energy stocks offset gains in banks",markets,"  ASX falls after biggest weekly loss since 2020 on interest rate, energy stocks offset gains in banks Australian shares have struggled for momentum on Monday after falling to their worst week in more than two years as energy and mining stocks countered gains in banks. The ASX 200 closed down 41 points, or 0.6 per cent to 6,433. At the same time, the Australian dollar was up at 69.67 US cents. The benchmark sank 1.8 per cent on Friday in its sixth straight session of falls. Mining stocks fell about 5.1 per cent after benchmark iron ore prices extended losses on Friday as Chinese steel mills opted to reduce output amid weak profits and deteriorating demand prospects. Sector heavyweights BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue skidded between 5.1 per cent and 8.6 per cent, with Fortescue touching its lowest level since March 17. Energy stocks fell 5.2 per cent to be the biggest laggards on the main index, after oil prices dropped on Friday on worries that interest rate hikes by major central banks could cut energy demand. Sector heavyweights Woodside Energy and Santos skidded 4.9 per cent and 6 per cent respectively. Financials rose 0.6 per cent after a nine-session losing streak, with the ""Big Four"" banks trading in positive territory. The Commonwealth Bank, the country's biggest lender, led gains with a 0.3 per cent rise, while Westpac was flat. Among individual stocks, Infomedia jumped 7.4 per cent and was headed for its best day since May 16 after receiving a $638.8 million buyout proposal from US-based software company Solera Holdings LLC. Among the top movers were Pointsbet (+18.6pc), Harvey Norman (+4.5pc) and Home Consortium (+5.6pc). Meanwhile, Lake Resources (-13.7pc), Bega Cheese (-8.1pc), De Grey Mining (-10.2pc) and Beach Energy (-8.3pc) were among the worst performers. Brent crude oil was up, trading at $US113.51 a barrel, by 4:38pm AEST. World stocks on Friday closed out their steepest weekly slide since the pandemic meltdown of March 2020, as investors worried that tighter monetary policy by inflation-fighting central banks could damage economic growth. The US Federal Reserve's biggest rate hike since 1994, the first such Swiss move in 15 years, a fifth rise in British rates since December and a move by the European Central Bank to bolster the indebted south all took turns roiling markets. The Bank of Japan was the only outlier in a week where money prices rose around the world, sticking on Friday with its strategy of pinning 10-year yields near zero. The Australian share market will need to fall at least a further 5 per cent from the current 15 per cent to be classed as a ""bear"" market. David Taylor breaks down what happens next. After sharp early losses, world stocks steadied somewhat to end Friday's session down by just 0.12 per cent. The weekly slide of 5.8 per cent was the steepest since the week of March 20, 2020. Wall Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.13 per cent, the S&P 500 added 0.22 per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.43 per cent. For the week, the S&P 500 dropped 5.8 per cent, also its biggest fall since the third week of 2020. ""Inflation, the war and lockdowns in China have derailed the global recovery,"" economists at Bank of America said in a note to clients, adding they see a 40 per cent chance of a recession in the United States next year as the Fed keeps raising rates. ""We look for GDP growth to slow to almost zero, inflation to settle at around 3 per cent and the Fed to hike rates above 4 per cent."" The Fed on Friday said its commitment to fight inflation is ""unconditional"". Fears that its rate hikes could trigger a recession supported Treasury prices and slowed the rise in yields, which fall when prices rise. Ten-year Treasury yields retreated to 3.22944 per cent after hitting an 11-year high of 3.498 per cent on Tuesday. Southern European bond yields dropped sharply after reports of more detail from ECB President Christine Lagarde on the central bank's plans. ""The more aggressive line by central banks adds to headwinds for both economic growth and equities,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. ""The risks of a recession are rising, while achieving a soft landing for the US economy appears increasingly challenging."" The ASX slumps after yesterday's rally on Wall Street vanishes in a sea of red, with investors taking flight as both the UK and Switzerland raise official interest rates. In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell to a five-week low, dragged by selling in Australia. Japan's Nikkei fell 1.8 per cent and headed for a weekly drop of almost 7 per cent. Bonds and currencies were jittery after a rollercoaster week. The yen tanked after the Bank of Japan stuck to its ultra-accommodative policy stance. The yen fell 2.2 per cent by late Friday, bolstering the US dollar, which rose 0.73 per cent against a basket of major currencies. Sterling fell 1 per cent in New York as investors focused on the gap between US and UK rates. The Bank of England is opting for a more moderate approach than the Fed. ""If a central bank does not move aggressively, yields and risk price in more in the way of rate hikes down the road,"" said NatWest Markets' strategist John Briggs. ""Markets may just be continuously adjusting to an outlook for higher global policy rates … as global central bank policy momentum is all one way.""

1,analysis: No let-up to share market sell-off as recession fears build,markets,"  No let-up to share market sell-off as recession fears build There are some heavy emotions attached to the share market, aren't there? Emotions like greed and fear, and the anxiety attached to uncertainty. This week has seen the Australian Securities Exchange swiped sideways by heavy selling. The benchmark ASX200 index closed Friday's session down 116 points, or 1.7 per cent, to 6,474 points. So, from its all-time high set in August last year, the Australian share market is now down 15 per cent. To be classed as a ""bear"" market, it will need to fall at least a further 5 per cent. So will it? And then what happens? Let's take a look. Global shares are down around 6 per cent, and Australian shares are down by around 7 per cent (as of Friday afternoon) on the week. Stock falls have been led by technology stocks and resources (miners), retailers and financials (banks). There are fears we could be on the verge of another global recession and investors are spooked. From their all-time highs last year or early this year, US shares have now fallen 24 per cent, and global shares have fallen 21 per cent. So, what's going on? It's actually painfully simple: global inflation is on the march up. In response, central banks around the world have raised interest rates. The US Federal Reserve decided to be quite aggressive on that front, raising its ""Fed Funds"" rate — equivalent to the RBA's cash rate target — by 0.75 per cent. It was the sharpest increase in its benchmark rate since 1994. Economists say the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates and that has the potential to push the economy into a recession. ""I now foresee a US recession within the next 12 months,"" BetaShares chief economist David Bassanese said. What about Australia? Well, National Australia Bank chief economist Alan Oster mentioned in a podcast this week he saw the chances of Australia entering a recession now at 30 per cent. But some, like AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver, think it's more likely than that ""We remain of the view that a global recession can be avoided, but with central banks now hiking rates aggressively, the risks have increased to the point that it's now close to 50/50,"" he said. Dr Oliver has seen his fair share of financial market movements. In his previous role as head of investment strategy at AMP Capital, he also oversaw over $1 billion in managed funds. He said it's too early to call an end to the current wave of selling. ""It's still too early to say that shares have bottomed,"" Dr Oliver wrote. Why? Here's the crucial point. Financial markets are speculating right now about how much damage rising rates will do to business bottom lines and therefore the health of the economy. We simply won't know how much damage rising rates have done, or will do, until companies announce their annual profits later in the year, or other official data is released. Until then, economists and market analysts will look for evidence, and any evidence they find that's not encouraging about the economy, will likely send shares lower still. There's a lot of emotional energy attached to these market movements too (worn by the traders), so the volatility we've seen in recent months is likely to remain. Not to mention the sheer volume of money being carried through the financial markets, and the stress attached to that. There's a lot a stake.

2,"ASX, Wall Street and bond yields fall as UK and Switzerland raise rates",markets,"  ASX falls 2pc and Wall Street plunges amid recession fears, UK hikes interest rates The Australian share market plunged 2 per cent deeper into correction territory after global markets were spooked following interest rate increases in Europe, which renewed fears about a recession. In the first 40 minutes of trade, the All Ordinaries index lost 2.7 per cent to hit 6,608, while the ASX 200 lost 2.6 per cent to hit 6,421. By the close, the market finished off its lows, with the All Ordinaries down 1.8 per cent to 6,663, while the ASX 200 also fell by 1.8 per cent to 6,475. All the sectors were in the red, led down by miners, technology stocks, miners, consumer firms and banks. The ASX 200 lost nearly 7 per cent of its value this week, or more than $100 billion. The Commonwealth Bank (-3.6 per cent) did the worst of the big four banks, while big miners BHP (-3.4 per cent) and Rio Tinto (-4.2 per cent) also ended in the red after iron ore prices fell. The best performers on the ASX 200 were payments firm EML Payments (+9.4 per cent) and car sales website CarSales.com (-8.1 per cent). Automotive and water products maker GUD Holdings (-19.6 per cent) and investment platforms owner Hub 24 (-7.5 per cent) were the worst-performing stocks on the benchmark index. Australian digital payment and lending firm Latitude Group withdrew its $335 million offer to buy Humm Group's consumer unit, which includes its buy now, pay later (BNPL) business. Humm's shares fell by more than one fifth to $0.45. It told the Australian Securities Exchange ""the current disruption in financial markets"" was behind the termination of the offer. BNPL firms have seen their market value shrink rapidly as interest rate hikes to tame rising inflation fuelled concerns about a slowdown in consumer finance. Humm Group said the consumer unit, Humm Consumer Finance, saw its year-to-date cash-after-tax profit fall by two-thirds at the end of May, because of intense competition, rising interest rates, and weakening consumer confidence. Latitude shares came off their lows and finished flat at $1.40. The Australian dollar rose to 70.5 US cents, up 0.6 per cent at 7:20am AEST. But by 4:50pm AEST, the local currency had dropped 0.9 per cent to 69.81 US cents. Spot gold fell in Asian trade, down 0.6 per cent to $US1844.79 an ounce, while Brent crude oil dipped 0.08 per cent to $US119.68 a barrel. US stocks fell deeper into  the red, a day after rallying as the US Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 0.75 per cent. All 11 sectors on the S&P 500 index fell led down by energy stocks. The benchmark index suffered its sixth decline in seven trading sessions, and slipped deeper into a bear market, down more than 20 per cent from its peak. Interest rate rises in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Hungary reignited fears that attempts by central banks to cool roaring inflation could see the global economy stumble or cause a recession. A number of investment banks have warned of the risk of a recession, including Wells Fargo, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley. And Australia's biggest investor said Australia is not immune from a global recession. The $300 billion Australian Super industry superannuation fund has told members to expect their first financial loss in 13 years. Australian Super's chief investor Mark Delaney told Elysse Morgan on The Business program that investors and households need to prepare for tough times. But US president Joe Biden has told the Associated Press that a recession is ""not inevitable."" The Dow Jones index lost 2.4 per cent to 29,927, the S&P 500 lost 3.3 per cent to 3,667, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 4.1 per cent to 10,646. It was the Nasdaq's fifth single-day decline of 4 per cent or more since May with the index in a bear market. Big tech tumbled, led by a big fall from electric car maker Tesla (-8.5 per cent) and computer games maker Nvidia (-9.3 per cent). ""That is what people [are] reassessing today — what is the probability of a potential recession and will corporate profits come in where analysts estimate or will those get taken down,"" said global investment strategist Tom Hainlin at US Bank Wealth Management's Ascent Private Wealth Group. ""The Swiss came out and surprised everybody today and said, 'We are less worried about the strength of our currency and more worried about inflation.'"" US Treasury yields fell as fears of a recession dented investors' appetite for risk and they turned to the safe haven of government bonds. The benchmark 10-year yield (return on bonds) dipped to 3.307 per cent after reaching 3.498 per cent on Tuesday, the highest since April 2011. Economic data added to fears of slowing growth as the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell less than expected last week. And a Commerce Department report showed US housing starts slumped 14.4 per cent last month to the lowest since April 2021. The Bank of England raised official interest rates for the fifth time since December by 0.25 per cent to 1.25 per cent, a day after the European Central Bank promised support for debt-laden countries. The UK central bank raised rates again despite its concerns about a sharp slowdown in the economy, with inflation in the UK running close to 10 per cent this year. ""CPI inflation is expected to be over 9 per cent during the next few months and to rise to slightly above 11 per cent in October, the bank said in a statement. Switzerland's central bank, the Swiss National Bank, increased rates for the first time in 15 years by 50 basis points to negative 0.25 per cent. Negative rates means borrowers pay for the privilege of depositing their money with the central bank. Hungary's central bank raised its one-week deposit rate by 0.3 per cent to 6.75% as expected overnight as the bank continues to tighten interest rate policy aiming to curb inflation that is expected to hit double digits in coming months. European stock markets were also a sea of red. The FTSE 100 in London fell 3.1 per cent to 7,045, the DAX in Germany lost 3.3 per cent to 13,039, and the CAC 40 in Paris dropped 2.4 per cent to 5,886. Spot gold rose 1.3 per cent to $US1857.09 an ounce, while Brent crude oil increased 0.5 per cent to $US119.12 a barrel at 7:20am AEST.

3,What overseas interest rate hikes mean for Australia — as it happened,markets,"  The ABC's experts give their take on the US rate rise and today's jobs figures and what that means for you — as it happened Interest rates have risen by 0.75 in the US, and Europe's Central Bank is holding an emergency meeting to discuss the market rout. ABC News business reporter Sue Lannin has answered your questions on what this means for Australia. Look back on how the day's events unfolded in our blog. By Jessica Riga Thank you for joining us today! And thank you to everyone who sent in their questions as business reporter Sue Lannin helped unpack what the interest rate rise in the US means for Australia. You can continue to stay up to date here on the ABC News website, and on our app (and if you haven't already, you can sign up to our business alerts to get the latest news delivered straight to you). We'll see you next time! By Jessica Riga The Australian sharemarket came off today's highs after the unemployment rate remained unchanged in May as more people looked for work. The market saw a relief rally after the US Federal Reserve raise official interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point as expected overnight. At 12:30pm AEST, the All Ordinaries was up 0.5 per cent to 6,822, while the ASX 200 index rose 0.3 per cent to 6,623. Six out of the 11 industry sectors are higher today with real estate trusts and tech stocks leading the way. The market jumped more than one per cent in the first hour of trade, tracking Wall Street higher. The ASX is higher after four days of falls on worries rapid interest rises could cause a recession in North America. Still, the market is down 5.6 per cent for the week. The best performer is artificial intelligence firm Appen (+11.8 per cent) and the worst performer is share registry firm Link Administration (-10.1 per cent). The Australian dollar eased back after the jobless stayed steady. At 12:30pm AEST, it was trading around 70.16 US cents, up 0.2 per cent on the open. By business reporter Sue Lannin By Jessica Riga Australia's jobs market has continued to strengthen, with unemployment remaining at 3.9 per cent last month and underemployment falling to a 14-year low. The latest monthly Bureau of Statistics figures estimate 60,600 extra people were employed in May. The number of people considered officially unemployed increased by 7,800. The relative strength of the jobs market has seen the underemployment rate fall significantly from 6.1 per cent to 5.7 per cent, which is the lowest it has been since August 2008. By Jessica Riga Hi Martin, Thanks for your question. Here's business reporter Sue Lannin to break it down for us: Australia does not have enough capital (or finance) to fund all of its investment needs. Australian companies issue new shares, which they then sell to investors on the ASX to raise money. They also sell corporate bonds. The corporate bonds are sold to local and overseas investors in different currenciesm, such as US dollars or euros. So the companies have to pay returns based on the overseas interest rates. Banks also have to borrow some money from overseas investors like banks or insurers so that they can lend to borrowers. They have to pay interest on these loans, which are long term loans. Since the global financial crisis, Australian banks get more of their money from lending from deposits. However, if interest rates are going up, then the banks' cost of borrowing is going up too. So that is their argument for passing on official interest rate rises. They want to keep their profit margins, so they want to make more money from lending, than they pay to borrow to fund their loans. One of the issues is that banks may pass on interest rate rises to borrowers, but they may not pass them on in full to savers. By Jessica Riga By Jessica Riga There's a distinct lack of graphs in the blog, so let's fix that. ASX 200 has come off its earlier high following the unemployment figures. At 11:36am, it was up 0.5 per cent, to 6,633.  By Jessica Riga The unemployment rate has remained at 3.9 per cent. In May, the number of employed people increased by 60,600, and the number of officially unemployed people increased by 7,800. The increase in employment in May was the seventh consecutive increase in employment, following the easing of lockdown restrictions in late 2021. It saw the participation rate jump from 66.4 per cent to 66.7 per cent, while the underemployment rate fell from 6.1 per cent to 5.7 per cent. By Jessica Riga By 11:12am AEST, the All Ordinaries index had risen 1 per cent, to 6,856, and the ASX 200 index had risen 0.9 per cent, to 6,659. And the Australian dollar was buying around 70.30 US cents, up 0.4 per cent. By Jessica Riga Hi there, Here's business reporter Sue Lannin: A number of investment advisers, both globally and locally, think there will be more pain on global markets because higher interest rates will slow the economy and hurt confidence. I spoke to Michael McCarthy from Tiger Brokers Australia earlier in the week. He believes it's not a good time to buy yet, because stocks are not at their lows. Some stocks could be considered expensive. Remember the Australian market reached a record high in April. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 have entered bear markets. And there is probably more pain to come here on the ASX. So seek some specific, independent professional advice in relation to your particular circumstances. By Jessica Riga Betashares chief economist David Bassanese has warned the United States could experience a recession within the next year. ""Given stubbornly high US inflation and the Federal Reserve’s apparent determination to bring it down, I now foresee a US recession within the next 12 months,"" he said. He says for markets that means a bear market could continue. But is there some light at the end of the tunnel, according to Mr Bassanese: ""For investors, periods of US recession and associated bear markets can be difficult periods to endure. But the lesson of history is that markets do eventually bounce back. ""The Fed seems determined to learn the lessons of history and does not want to let supply side shocks and overly strong demand embed high inflation (and so also high interest rates) into the US economy to the same degree evident in the 1970s. ""Good buying opportunities will emerge in this period, especially in the now downtrodden growth/technology sectors which still offer strong long-term earnings potential and will benefit from an eventual return to lower inflation and steadier interest rates. ""And while value stocks (especially energy and resources)  – could continue to do well in this high inflation environment, they will ultimately be vulnerable to a weakening in inflation and commodity prices as global growth slows."" By Jessica Riga The Australian share market has opened higher after the US central bank raised interest rates as expected. Overnight the US Federal Reserve raised official US borrowing costs by three quarters of a percentage point to curb soaring inflation. Investors are relieved that the Federal Reserve didn't make a bigger rate rise. In early Australian trade, the All Ordinaries has gained 0.75 per cent, to 6,837, while the ASX 200, the top 200 companies index, has gained 0.7 per cent, to 6,647.Banks are doing well today with Bank of Queensland up 1.7 per cent. Banks benefit from higher interest rates because they get more revenue from borrowers. But they've been hammered because of worries that rapid interest rate hikes can cause an economic downturn or a recession. The Australian dollar has soared against the greenback. It rose more than 1 US cent overnight. Its currently trading around 70.33 US cents, up 0.4 per cent. Reporting by business reporter Sue Lannin By Jessica Riga Hi Jesse, Thanks for your question. Here's business reporter Sue Lannin with the answer: The rise in the federal fund rate puts more pressure on the RBA to raise the official cash rate again because the cost of money is going up globally. Central banks are beset by many global factors that they can't control such as global high inflation and the war in Ukraine which is pushing up commodity prices. The RBA governor told the ABC's 7.30 program this week that inflation could reach 7 per cent by the end of the year. That's more than the RBA previously predicted. So he said we may well see official interest rates rising to 2.5 per cent. Both RBA governor Dr Philip Lowe and Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell are warning there is a lot of uncertainty ahead. So bunker down. By Jessica Riga Hi there, Here's more from business reporter Sue Lannin: Super funds invest in stocks as part of their investment portfolio. So if the share market goes down then the value of your super fund balance will also fall. But the cash component will go up at the moment because interest rates on deposits are rising. However, it may not be enough to offset the falls from your equity (stock) holdings. By Jessica Riga Hi Confused, Here's how business reporter Sue Lannin explains it: Rising global borrowing costs affect everybody because the global financial system and economy are interconnected. The whole world is dealing with global inflation because of soaring commodity prices due to the war in Ukraine, the global supply chain squeeze, and pent up consumer demand as the world reopens from COVID-19 shutdowns. Benchmark interest rates are set by central banks and they are used as an index for borrowing costs — e.g., for banks and governments. The US is the world's biggest economy so the influence of the Federal Reserve is huge. Rising interest rates push up the US dollar, which is the world's ""reserve"" currency. Also commodities are priced in US dollars, so if the greenback rises so do commodity prices like gold, iron ore, and oil. While that is great for Australia in terms of trade revenue, it costs more for Australian governments and companies to borrow from overseas because interest rates are rising everywhere. So that's why the Reserve Bank had to put up rates, because 1. high global inflation saw borrowing costs go up and 2. high domestic inflation is making price rises unsustainable and hurting the economy. The aim is to dampen demand and force prices down because there is less demand. By Jessica Riga Hi Curious, thanks for your question. I'll hand the mic over to business reporter Sue Lannin: The ASX SPI 200 is pointing to a small rise this morning. That's because investors pretty much expected a 0.75 per cent rate rise. Investors were relieved that it wasn't larger. The ASX has had four days of falls on worries that aggressive rate rises in the US could cause a recession — that's two economic quarters of contraction. It looks like investors may take a breather today from the selling and buy up some cheaper stocks. The ASX SPI 200 index is up 0.24 per cent to 6,622. And a reminder, trading kicks off in 10 minutes.

You can submit your questions and comments to our business reporter Sue Lannin by using the 'leave a comment' button.  By Shiloh Payne The Bank of England looks set to raise interest rates again as it tries to tackle a UK inflation rate on course for double digits. After the US Federal Reserve announced its interest rate hike, the big question for investors awaiting the BoE's June policy announcement at 9pm Thursday (AEST time) is the size of the increase. Reuters is reporting that Financial markets are fully pricing in a quarter percentage-point increase in Bank Rate to 1.25 per cent. But investors have put a nearly 50 per cent probability on a half-point rise by the BoE, something it has not done since 1995. The BoE has already raised borrowing costs four times since December, when it became the first of the world's major central banks to increase rates after the COVID-19 pandemic. Britain, more than many other rich nations, is facing a mix of high inflation and zero growth or a recession. Its economy is already showing signs of a slowdown and will be the weakest among the world's big, rich countries next year, according to forecasts by the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. But inflation, which hit a 40-year high of 9 per cent in April, is set to surpass 10 per cent later this year, more than five times the BoE's 2 per cent target, according to the central bank's latest forecasts. By Shiloh Payne US investor and businessman Jeffrey Gundlach and prominent investor Mohamed El-Erian have weighed in on the rate hike. Here's what they had to say: By Shiloh Payne Here's the latest from our North America correspondent Carrington Clarke: The biggest rate rise since 1994 and more to come. That’s the takeout from the latest move by the US’s central bank. The Federal Reserve is attempting to slay the inflation beast and it’s using the only blunt instrument at its disposal, making borrowing money more expensive. The Australian Reserve Bank might have spooked those with variable mortgage rates by hiking half a percentage-point last week, but the Federal Reserve has done one better. The three quarters of a percentage-point hike means the official short term rate is now between 1.5 and 1.75 percentage-points. But, according to those who get to make the big call on rates, it’s likely there’s a lot more to come. The average expectations is that the rate will double by the end of the year. Citi’s Global Chief Economist Nathan Sheets says the Federal Reserve has a tricky decision to make. Are they willing to accept higher inflation than their target rate (which is 2 per cent over the year) or risk driving the economy into dangerous territory. “Are they willing to live with higher inflation? And, if so, then I think then maybe we can avoid a recession.  If the answer to that is no, that they want inflation back down to target by the end of 2023 or early 2024,  then I'd say yes, the recession is inevitable.” By Shiloh Payne Interest rates have risen in the US overnight as the European Central Bank holds an emergency meeting after bond yields surged in recent days.

4,"As the eastern states face an energy crisis, Victoria may fare slightly better. Here's why",markets,"  As the eastern states face an energy crisis, Victoria may be in a slightly better position. Here's why As Victorians endure a particularly cold start to winter, two major concerns resulting from a national energy crisis — rising prices and supply issues — have loomed large. For the first time ever, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) suspended the spot market for wholesale electricity across the country, to help secure reliable supply. On Wednesday, AEMO's chief executive Daniel Westerman pointed to the situation in New South Wales as that of most concern, and urged residents to conserve energy where it was safe to do so. Coal and gas-fired power generators are facing big spikes in their input costs due to both international and local factors, sending wholesale electricity prices in Australia soaring. While its neighbour contemplated blackouts, Victorian Energy Minister Lily D'Ambrosio said late Wednesday she had been advised the state had ""enough supply"". We asked some experts what makes our state different, and how Victoria's unique position may play out over the weeks and months ahead. Melbourne Energy Institute director Michael Brear said the fact that Victoria mined and processed brown coal set it apart from other states. ""We're the only state that burns brown coal to make electricity,"" he said. ""Brown coal is significantly lower cost than the black coal that is used to generate electricity in NSW and Queensland. ""If high prices persist across the national electricity market you would expect that brown coal generators are in a strong position to generate for others and make good profits while doing so."" When the demand for electricity is set to exceed supply, power can be cut to some areas in a process known as load shedding. Here is what you need to know to get you up to speed. Tim Buckley, an energy market analyst and director of Climate Energy Finance, said if there were indeed blackouts in some parts of Australia — it would not be because the country lacked supply. Mr Buckley, whose work is focused on identifying opportunities to expand the use of renewable energy, said NSW and Queensland were some of the biggest exporters of black coal and gas in the world. ""They are now exporting coal and gas that is critically important for domestic energy security,"" he said. He said the the brown coal mined and burnt in Victoria's Latrobe Valley was not exported overseas because its low energy content reduced its value. ""The fact that Victoria does not export coal is proving to be a real safety net for Victorians,"" Mr Buckley said. But that ""safety net"" effect could be threatened by the fact the Yallourn coal-fired power plant, which usually produces about a fifth of Victoria's electricity, is not running at capacity at the moment. Yallourn's owner, Energy Australia, said the brown coal-fired plant would operate at half-capacity while it underwent ""unplanned maintenance"". Meanwhile another key part of Gippsland's coal-fired power infrastructure remains offline, and is unlikely to be back up and running until September. AGL's Loy Yang A unit 2 first broke down in April because of an electrical fault. A Victorian government spokesman said despite the outages at Yallourn and Loy Yang A the state still had 75 per cent of its capacity online. They indicated the state was producing more electricity and gas than it needed, with the excess being exported to other eastern states. Ms D'Ambrosio said the national crisis highlighted the importance of investing in renewable energy sources. ""The reality is ageing coal generation is unreliable — highlighting why our transition to renewable energy is so important,"" she said. Mr Buckley said Victoria's reliance on renewables was providing some protection, given the unreliability of the coal plants. ""There's nothing like domestic zero-emissions, cheap, renewable energy to actually underpin affordable, reliable and zero-emissions power for the people of Victoria,"" he said. Data from AEMO from the past three months shows 27 per cent of Victoria's energy composition was made up of renewable sources, while 67 per cent was brown coal and 6 per cent gas. In contrast, only 11 per cent of Queensland's fuel mix came from renewables, and 22 per cent in New South Wales. Professor Brear said although renewables did help, they weren't the ""full answer"" to the complicated matter of electricity supply in Australia. ""Any form of generation helps, so if you make more renewable electricity, then that helps reduce the likelihood of inadequate generation,"" he said. ""However, there are times when, as they say, the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow, and something needs to provide that electricity during those times. ""Those controllable fossil fuel generators, both coal and gas, normally fill that gap and if you lose some of them for various reasons, then that gap may not be able to be closed."" During his time as chief scientist, inventor Alan Finkel also recommended significant investment in batteries and storage solutions to address fluctuations in renewable energy generation. Mr Buckley said Victoria could be hit with problems because it's part of the national energy market, and hence feeds power to other states when they're struggling to meet demand. ""There will be instability — it'll probably be somewhat imported instability from NSW because the market is nationally connected, at least across the east coast,"" he said. Professor Brear said Victorians should not necessarily expect to experience power outages in the coming weeks, but the ""widespread impact"" of rising electricity and gas prices would kick in. He said fortunately the winter months did not tend to require as much electricity across the grid as the demand during summer heatwaves. ""Electricity demand in winter peaks at lower levels than it does on the hottest days of summer when we've all turned on our air conditioning,"" Professor Brear said. ""Hopefully we'll make it through, but time will tell.""

6,ASX 200 3.6pc down after recession fears wipe tens of billions from share market — as it happened,markets,"  Australian sharemarket: ASX 200 3.6pc down after recession fears wipe tens of billions from share market Tens of billions of dollars have been wiped off the value of Australia's top companies as global markets sink on worries of more aggressive interest rate hikes by the US central bank. Look back on how the day's events unfolded with our blog. By Jessica Riga Now that the markets have closed for the day, we'll wrap things up here. Thank you for joining us today and for sending in your questions! And a huge thank you to business reporter Sue Lannin for joining the blog to help unpack the situation. You can read more about 'one of the worst down days' on the Australian share market here. And you can continue to stay up to date here on the ABC News website or on our app. And (last thing!) a reminder, Leigh Sales is interviewing Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe on 7.30 tonight, so you won't want to miss that. See you next time! By Jessica Riga The S&P500 futures rose 1 per cent on the open in Asian trade, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent. Business reporter Sue Lannin says that suggests the bargain hunters could buy up beaten day stocks overnight, but as we've warned you, ""buyer beware"". But there could be more bad news out overnight with US Producer Price Index for May out. That is basically inflation at the farm and factory gate, so business inflation, which is also running hot. And on Thursday, we get the latest rate rise from the US Federal Reserve, the US central bank. Some pundits are tipping a 0.75% rise in one go. Ouch. The Australian market came off its lows because US futures rose, which suggests that the US market could rise tonight, but depends on those business inflation figures. By Jessica Riga Nearly $90 billion has been wiped off the value of the local sharemarket today after investors took flight because of worries that rapid interest rate rises in the US could cause a recession. The All Ordinaries fell more than five percent in early trade at its lowest point. By the close, the index fell 3.7 per cent to 6,881, while the ASX 200 index lost 3.6 per cent to 6,686. Energy firms and technology stocks led the falls, but all sectors were in the red. Buy now, pay later firm Zip fell by the most on the ASX 200, losing 15 percent of its value. The Australian dollar tumbled below 70 US cents on a stronger greenback. It came off its lows during the day and it now buying arond 69.66 US cents. By Jessica Riga By Jessica Riga You'll be able to watch the interview live on ABC or catch up on iview. On Instagram, 7.30 host Leigh Sales called it a ""very, very rare"" interview. When asked in the comments if she was nervous, she said yes because ""it is a HUGE deal."" By Jessica Riga Hi Matt, Our business reporter Sue Lannin has been talking to veteran market watcher Michael McCarthy, who is chief strategy officer from Tiger Brokers Australia. Michael McCarthy says yes, because rising interest rates have changed the economic and markets equation. Higher rates are bringing the value (prices) of assets like homes and shares down to earth because the higher cost of borrowing makes these assets less affordable. However, Michael McCarthy warns ""the sea change has yet to be reflected in share prices."" So expect much more market volatility and more falls. I was working as a finance journalist during the GFC and it was frightening. It felt like the end of the world as we know it and that the global financial system would collapse. It felt like the market was falling 10 per cent or 9 per cent every day. Massive government and central bank stimulus saved the global financial system from disaster and Australia escaped a recession. During the coronavirus market meltdown from late February 2020 to March 2020, the Australian market lost nearly 40 per cent of its value. But all the massive government and RBA stimulus helped it bounce back, and then some, as markets rebounded to record highs. However, the record highs are part of the problem. The markets are at record highs because interest rates have been at record lows, which means you can borrow more to buy assets. The massive stimulus encouraged investors into share markets and property because of record low interest rates. But now as interest rates rise rapidly there is, as Michael says, a ""sea change"". And Michael says that ""sea change has yet to be reflected in share prices."" A recession is possible in North America if the US central bank keeps raising rates aggressively. Michael McCarthy and many economists say it can't be ruled out. And will Australia get through it? Well, the problem is our housing market is massively indebted. So if the RBA continues to raise rates then some people could be trouble. And we have are already $1 trillion debt to the rest of the world. But if the RBA starts to ease up on rate rises, we may muddle through. So fingers crossed. By Jessica Riga Our business reporter Sue Lannin says the market has come off its lows. The ASX 200 is down 4.4% to 6,628 while All Ordinaries is down 4.5% to 6,821. Here are the worst performers on the ASX 200: Buy now, pay later service Zip is down down 17.9% Chalice Mining is down 14% Mesoblast is down 12.2% And here are the best performers: Polynovo is up 2.8% Computershare is up 0.8% Uniti Group is up 0.3% Insurance Australia Group is up 0.2% Meanwhile, Crown Resorts is steady. By Jessica Riga The Australian market plunged more than 5 per cent in the first 20 minutes of trade this morning. Here's how things are looking at 2:40pm AEST. By Jessica Riga Hey there, let's break it down. When the RBA increases interest rates, many people will need to cut back on spending and tighten their budgets. As they rein in spending, companies need to respond to a change in consumer demand and adjust their prices accordingly. The RBA will typically keep increasing interest rates until inflation slows down. By Jessica Riga The Australian dollar has come off its morning low and is buying around 69.57 US cents. To Asian markets and the Nikkei 225 in Japan is down 1.8 per cent to 26,490, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong has lost 1.1 percent to 20,840, while the Shanghai Composite has fallen by 1.6 per cent to 3,204. Spot gold is up 0.4 per cent to $US1825.26 an ounce, off its overnight lows. Brent crude oil has dropped in Asian trade by 0.2 per cent to $US122 a barrel. By Jessica Riga At 1:50pm AEST, the All Ordinaries index is down 4.9 per cent to 6,795, while the ASX 200 index has dropped 4.8 per cent to 6,601. The worst performer in the ASX 200 index is buy now, pay later firm Zip (-20.2pc), followed by WA based gold, nickel and cobalt miner Chalice Mining (-14pc) and biotech firm Mesoblast (-11.5pc). The only firm going up among the top 200 companies is communications infrastructure provider Uniti Group (+0.3pc). By Shiloh Payne  Our business reporter Sue Lannin has been talking to veteran market watcher Michael McCarthy, who is chief strategy officer from Tiger Brokers Australia. He has warned investors to be very cautious about seeing the current selloff as a buying opportunity because there is more pain to come. He said the selloff could worsen because markets are massively overvalued having been pumped up by central bank and coronavirus stimulus. So, to quote US politician Aaron Burr from Lin Manuel Miranda's epic stage show Hamilton, ""wait for it"". Don't be Alexander Hamilton today. Clifford Bennett, chief economist at ACY Securities agrees. ""'Protect your portfolios' from the roof-tops we should all scream,"" he said. By Jessica Riga Just joining us now? Let's get you up to speed: The Australian share market has plunged more than 5 per cent, wiping tens of billions of dollars off the value of shares Why? Global markets sank on worries that aggressive interest rate hikes by the US central bank could push North America into recession At midday, the broad All Ordinaries index was down 4.8 per cent to 6,806, with $116 billion wiped from the value of the market The ASX 200 index, the index of the top 200 companies, lost 4.7 per cent, or 329 points, to 6,604 at 12:15pm AEST Technology stocks were the hardest hit, after a sell-off on Wall Street The biggest loser on the ASX 200 index was buy now, pay later firm Zip, which lost almost one fifth of its value The Australian dollar tumbled below 70 US cents amid the stock market rout, to a low of 69.20 US cents At 12:25am AEST, it had come off its daily low and was trading around 69.37 US cents You can read more from business reporter Sue Lannin here. By Jessica Riga Australian, US and global stocks have been dumped by investors as they worry more aggressive interest rate rises by the US Federal Reserve could tip the global economy into recession. Read the full story from business reporter Sue Lannin here.  By Jessica Riga Business reporter Sue Lannin says there were steep falls for the big banks with National Australia Bank (-4.7 per cent) and ANZ (-4.7 per cent) doing the worst, followed by the Commonwealth Bank (-4.5 per cent) and Westpac (-4.4 per cent). By Jessica Riga By Jessica Riga There are expectations there will be a 75-basis point increase. Does Jun Bei Liu, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, share that view? ""I think it is 50-50 whether it is a 50 or a 75-basis point increase,"" she told ABC News. ""It is in the best interest of the economy to slow it down quickly because when inflation picks we can move on to the eventual recovery, so it will be quite aggressive."" By Jessica Riga ""[Investors] are very worried about the sharp rate or how quickly it will be on the consumer as well as the eventual impact on corporate profit earnings outlook,""  Jun Bei Liu, the portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, told ABC News. ""That is why the market started pricing in a more recession risk for the US market because interest rates are up a lot faster than we expected. ""This has been translated to Australia even though our earnings growth or inflation numbers are way behind what is experienced in the US. At this point, really it is investors not distinguishing both, really just selling any sector that will potentially be exposed to the eventual recession at risk."" By Jessica Riga ""Locally, we're seeing a lot of pain across the tech sector, as we have seen the Nasdaq was really down significantly and the last couple of days,"" Jun Bei Liu, the portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, told ABC News. ""Probably one of the biggest falls is across the Fintech base. We are seeing it down over 18% in some places. There was a big sell-off. ""These companies are trading on a very high earnings valuations, so they definitely have worn the brunt of the seller."" By Jessica Riga The price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has plummeted after a major lender stopped withdrawals from its platform — citing extreme market conditions. It's the latest high-profile collapse of a pillar of the cryptocurrency industry, which has seen tens of billions of dollars of assets erased. Bitcoin is down more than 16 per cent in the past day, and Ethereum has dropped roughly 17 per cent. Investors have been selling riskier assets like digital currencies and tech stocks, as the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates to fight inflation.

7,$88 billion wiped off Australian share market on 'one of the worst down days',markets,"  ASX down nearly 4 per cent after Wall Street sell-off on inflation fears, S&P 500 falls into bear market The Australian share market has plunged on Tuesday, wiping tens of billions of dollars off the value of shares after global markets sank on worries that aggressive interest rate hikes by the US central bank could push North America into recession. The All Ordinaries index closed down 3.7 per cent to 6,881, while the ASX 200 index had dropped 3.6 per cent, to 6,686. That's a paper loss of $87.5 billion. The worst performer on the ASX 200 was buy now, pay later firm, Zip (-15.9 per cent), followed by Block (-15.1 per cent), WA-based gold, nickel and cobalt miner Chalice Mining (-14.2 per cent). Among the only handful of firms going up among the top 200 companies was communications infrastructure provider Uniti Group (+0.4 per cent). Technology stocks were the hardest hit, after a sell-off on Wall Street. ""Locally, we're seeing a lot of pain across the tech sector, as we have seen the Nasdaq was really down significantly over the last couple of days,"" Jun Bei Liu, the portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, told ABC News. ""Probably one of the biggest falls is across the Fintech base. We are seeing it down over 18 per cent in some places. There was a big sell-off. ""These companies are trading on a very high earnings valuations, so they definitely have worn the brunt of the sell-off."" Michael McCarthy, chief strategy officer from Tiger Brokers Australia, warned investors to be very cautious about seeing the current sell-off as a buying opportunity because there is more pain to come. ""As a market professional, I'm forced to say 'don't buy this dip, there's a lot of re-reckoning to come',"" he told ABC News. ""It's far too early to be thinking there might be bargains in the market."" In the first twenty minutes of trade, the All Ordinaries index slumped 5.4 per cent, or 384 points, to 6,761, below the key 7,000-point mark. The ASX 200 lost 5.2 per cent of its value, to 6,570, after falling below 7,000 on Friday. The Australian share market has plunged on global fears of rising interest rates in the US. Follow live with business reporter Sue Lanin to unpack what it all means. All sectors finished in the red, with the ASX Resources index — which contains the country's biggest miners, such as BHP and Rio Tinto — losing 4.4 per cent. There were steep falls for the big banks with National Australia Bank (-4.4 per cent) and ANZ (-4.6 per cent) doing the worst, followed by the Commonwealth Bank (-2.8 per cent) and Westpac (-3.7 per cent). CommSec said the market was near a February 2021 low. It has fallen 13 per cent from its April 2022 record high. ""It is one of the worst down days in the last 20 years, excluding 2008, the GFC, and the COVID panic in 2020,"" Jamie Hannah, deputy head of investments and capital markets at VanEck, told ABC News. ""When volatility like this gets into the market, it generally stays around for considerable time, and we've been seeing that for the last few months. ""I would assume that it would continue, based on a number of factors ... we have the war in Ukraine, we still have COVID lockdowns, we have supply chain issues, we have rising interest rates and we have what would otherwise be termed high inflation."" The Australian dollar tumbled below 70 US cents earlier amid the stock market rout, to a low of 69.20 US cents, as the greenback hit its highest level in two decades on expectations of more steep rate rises by the Fed. By 4:36pm AEST, it had come off its morning low and it's buying around 69.61 US cents. Wall Street has plunged as investors took flight after consumer inflation in the US reached a 40-year high on Friday, with worries that aggressive interest rate rises could lead to a recession. The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 3.9 per cent, to 3,750, after government data on Friday showed that annual inflation reached a 40-year high of 8.6 per cent. It's only been two years since the COVID-19 pandemic began, but economists are already speculating about when the next recession could happen. Meanwhile, the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, is expected to raise official interest rates again later this week, possibly by as much as 0.75 per cent. Traders are betting that US rates could peak at 4 per cent next year. The S&P 500 is down nearly 22 per cent from its record closing high on January 3, officially confirming a bear market, one that is falling. So the index is in a bear market and has dropped by one fifth since its peak in January. In the past four trading days, the index has fallen, with all major industry sectors sharply lower, including tech giants, Apple (-3.8 per cent), Microsoft (-4.2 per cent), and Amazon (-5.4 per cent). Global markets are under pressure because of surging inflation, the war in Ukraine and a global supply chain squeeze. The Dow Jones index lost 2.8 per cent, to 30,517, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 4.7 per cent, to 10,809. Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility index, known as the VIX, closed at its highest level in more than a month. The gap between US 2- and 10-year Treasury bond yields (returns) inverted for the first time since April, a sign that investors expect a recession. Yields on US 10-year Treasury bond hit 3.44 per cent, their highest since April 2011. In Europe, the FTSE 100 index dropped by 1.5 per cent, to 7,206, the DAX in Germany lost 2.4 per cent, to 13,427, and the CAC 40 in Paris fell 2.7 per cent, to 6,022. Crypto currency did not escape the stock market contagion either. Bitcoin plunged 14 per cent, to $US22,725 per digital coin, after a major US crypto currency network lending company, Celsius Network, froze withdrawals and transfers citing ""extreme"" market conditions. In addition, the Binance US crypto exchange was sued by an investor over the collapse of stable coin Terra USD, which the investor alleges was marketed as a safe investment. By 4:45pm AEST, spot gold was up 0.5 per cent to $US1,828.7 an ounce, off its overnight lows. Brent crude oil was up by 0.8 per cent to $US123.30 a barrel.

9,'Vulnerable' investors who lost $77m to trading firm likened to Wolf of Wall Street still looking for compensation,markets,"  Forex Capital Trading liquidators hoping to claw back cash for investors from Gibraltar Liquidators are hoping to claw back cash for ""vulnerable"" Australians who lost tens of millions with a trading company likened to something out of the Leonardo DiCaprio film The Wolf Of Wall Street. But in another twist straight out of Hollywood, the liquidators will need to go after a parent company believed to be domiciled in the tax haven Gibraltar. The activities of Forex Capital Trading (ForexCT) were first revealed by the ABC in 2019. The firm engaged in forex trading, which is a highly complex and risky form of investment that involves pitting one currency against the other in a series of micro-trades. After revelations of large client losses, corporate watchdog ASIC cancelled ForexCT's Australian financial services licence in 2020 after finding it engaged in ""unconscionable, misleading and deceptive conduct"". It also handed lengthy bans to its former director and employees. ForexCT was also fined $20 million by the Federal Court. ASIC noted that former account managers had likened its culture to Martin Scorsese's black comedy The Wolf Of Wall Street, which is based on a biographical book of the same name about boiler room tactics in the United States. ""A bell or a gong was rung when clients deposited funds of certain amounts into their trading accounts,"" ASIC found about ForexCT. ""Account managers could participate in incentive 'games' such as 'wheel of fortune', roulette tables and dice games to win cash if certain client deposit targets were met."" Dubbo-based man Lindsey Rankmore is one of the estimated 11,000 people who handed over money to ForexCT. Mr Rankmore told ABC News that he first put money into ForexCT in 2018 after doing a search on the internet about how he could trade in shares. He had put his details into forms on social media and websites and said he was contacted by a ForexCT trader on the phone. ""They basically got all your contact details straight away,"" Mr Rankmore said. He initially handed over $500 to create a trading account with ForexCT. ""Once they started giving advice, I thought: they know what they're doing. You started building a slight amount of funds,"" he said. ""You think: yeah, this was really good. And then all of a sudden, things start going bad."" ForexCT sought to voluntarily wind down its Australian operations in mid-2021 after it was fined by the Federal Court, and liquidator FTI Consulting was appointed to manage its affairs and creditor claims. One of the joint liquidators, Daniel Woodhouse, told ABC News that they believe thousands of ForexCT clients lost at least $77 million between them with ForexCT. ""They were vulnerable and unsophisticated investors, generally speaking,"" Mr Woodhouse said. ""[ForexCT] targeted them through various Google searches and Facebook streams that people were putting into Google. Things like 'get rich quick' keywords and things like that."" Mr Woodhouse likened ForexCT's trades to when an individual goes to bet on a horse at the Melbourne Cup. ""If you win, the bookmaker loses. If you lose, the bookmaker wins, but at no point do you ever own the horse. ""I've not seen anything like it."" FTI Consulting was given permission last month by the Federal Court to contact the 11,000 people it has identified as having traded through ForexCT. In an automated letter seen by ABC News, FTI Consulting asks former customers to lodge losses formally, so that it can seek money from ForexCT's holding company, Invesus. FTI Consulting claims it has a letter of assurance from Invesus that it will provide financial support to meet any debts incurred by ForexCT. This letter was referred to in the recent Federal Court proceedings but the ABC has not seen this document or verified that it exists. Invesus – or ForexCT's former director – could not be contacted for comment about whether it believes Invesus is liable for ForexCT customers' losses. ASIC confirmed to the ABC that Invesus had paid the $20 million fine for ForexCT. Invesus's website contains scant information. ABC News could not independently verify its current location. FTI Consulting believes Invesus is domiciled in Gibraltar, and this is noted in the Federal Court proceedings. ASIC also told the ABC that it is of the understanding that Invesus is based in the small British Overseas Territory. Gibraltar is known for its tax benefits for overseas companies, and pursuing a company there will be a complicated endeavour for FTI Consulting. Mr Woodhouse said that if Invesus does not respond to an initial letter of demand, FTI Consulting will consider a process comparable to a class action to claw back cash for the clients. So far, since sending out the letters last month, FTI Consulting has had more than $32 million in claims registered by 1,200 people. Mr Woodhouse said 70 per cent of claims were for less than $5,000 – however, some were ""significant"". ""We have sums of north of a million dollars that people have lost,"" he said. Dubbo-based man Lindsey Rankmore has signed on to the liquidator's process – although he considers himself one of the lucky ones. He lost the $500 that he put into ForexCT and then walked away despite being asked to invest more by account managers. ""I lost everything I put in with them, which wasn't a great deal of money compared to a lot of other people,"" he said. ""When I went into it, I was no better than a gambler.""

10,Almost every Chinese billionaire has one American dream. But now it's turning into a nightmare,markets,"  US financial regulators threaten to delist Chinese companies but will Beijing compromise to save their American dream? It still feels like yesterday that Jack Ma announced the debut of China's e-commerce giant Alibaba Group at the New York stock exchange in 2014. The Chinese billionaire invited eight Alibaba customers and employees to ring the bell that has traditionally marked the open and close of trade each day, as a symbol of gratitude to his company's frontline workers and customers. Those bell-ringers wore matching T-shirts with a quote from Mr Ma printed on the front: ""Keep your dream, in case it comes true"". Jack Ma's American dream of being listed on the US stock market has been widely shared by Chinese entrepreneurs over recent decades. Currently, there are 261 Chinese companies listed on the New York stock exchange, with a combined capital worth approximately $1.9 trillion. But some of them may be about to lose this dream. In May, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that more than 80 companies — including Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com and video platform Bilibili — faced the risk of being delisted. They joined a growing list of Chinese companies — from tech front-runner Baidu to fast food chain Yum China — that the SEC says will be expelled from the US capital market in 2024 unless they comply with new auditing standards over the next two years. ""This is part of the larger context of US concerns about Chinese companies' operations in the United States,"" said Professor Andrew Walter, who specialises in international finance at the University of Melbourne. While the SEC warnings are the Biden administration's latest action in the ongoing US-China financial war, the move can be traced back to a financial saga that began two decades ago. In 2001, the financial world was rocked by a scandal that took down energy giant and Wall Street darling Enron Corp, then widely considered among the largest and most innovative companies in the US. After it was revealed that Enron had used creative accounting to cover up corporate fraud and corruption, the company filed for bankruptcy, resulting in $US11 billion in shareholder losses. In response, the US introduced the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, requiring all publicly listed companies, both domestic and international, to allow US regulators to inspect their audits. However, for years, China and Hong Kong have rejected requests from the SEC on national security grounds, which has left regulations in a state of limbo for decades. While the administration of Donald Trump and the ongoing US-China trade war have pushed US authorities to tackle the issue, the straw that broke the camel's back was the fraud perpetrated by Luckin Coffee. Founded in 2017, the chain launched almost 2,400 coffeehouses across China within two years, and began trading on the Nasdaq in 2019, raising $US645 million through its initial public offering. It was one of the biggest listings by a mainland Chinese company in the US that year. A rising star, it looked set to compete with the likes of Starbucks and Costa. But soon Luckin Coffee was accused of inflating revenue. In 2020, an internal investigation revealed its leadership faked $US310 million in sales for the previous year. The company has now been delisted by the Nasdaq, and it emerged from bankruptcy proceedings last month. However, its fall has alerted US regulators who had already begun scrutinising Chinese companies. At the end of 2020, US Congress passed a bill that prevents Chinese companies from listing on the New York stock exchange if they refuse to comply with US auditing processes. The Biden administration also appointed Gary Gensler as the chair of the SEC, which Professor Walter described as ""probably one of the most important Biden administration appointments"". Widely known for his pledge to increase reporting transparency, Mr Gensler has proposed a mandatory climate risk disclosure for public companies. ""Gensler would probably say, 'Look, what we're doing is really just trying to increase reporting transparency for US investors',"" Professor Walter said. ""[And the measures will] reduce concerns that Chinese companies might, in some cases, be hiding information from investors that might create market volatility and bad outcomes for US investors."" Many Chinese corporations may actually be willing to comply with the US standards, according to Jeremy Mark, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council and a former Wall Street Journal reporter. ""Most Chinese companies are quite open to having their books audited,"" he said. ""They want to be a listed company in good standing in the United States, largely for the access to capital."" Mr Mark said Chinese entrepreneurs' hunt for US capital could be traced back to the 1990s, when economic reforms and privatisation of state enterprises opened the floodgates for Chinese investors looking for somewhere to grow their money. Beijing even encouraged corporations to reach out for foreign investments, because there was a lack of capital flow in the domestic market. Today, despite China's rapid economic growth, Chinese entrepreneurs still see Wall Street as their dream land for global reputations and more flexible access to capital. ""[Many Chinese corporations] don't want to just be large Chinese enterprises, they want to be large global enterprises,"" said James Fok, veteran financial analyst and author of Financial Cold War. Mr Fok said some Chinese entrepreneurs were also concerned about their private property rights and protections offered by the domestic market, which pushed them to choose listing overseas rather than in China. China is producing billionaires faster than anywhere on earth. But many of those who reach the pinnacle of fame and fortune find danger also lurks at the top. However, Beijing has begun to crack down on billionaires and tech giants for ""common prosperity"", with the government targeting overseas-listed companies whose wealth it is unable to trace. China is also worried that allowing the US to audit materials of Chinese companies could be used against Beijing in the next stage of the US-China trade war. In July 2021, after a meeting with Beijing officials, Tiktok owner ByteDance scrapped its plan to list in the US. Regulators had asked the company to ""focus on data security risks"". ""So, for all these sorts of reasons, the Chinese [authorities] would prefer to see those companies listed in the domestic market,"" Mr Fok said. ""It's not necessarily the choice of a private businessman, but it is the desire of the state."" One could expect Beijing to take a firm stance against the US on this issue — but that's not happening, yet. Over the past few weeks, China's financial watchdog said it was willing to change the secrecy laws that prevent US regulators from inspecting Chinese companies listed in New York. It announced that foreign regulators might request to ""investigate"" or ""inspect"" overseas-listed Chinese companies and their auditors. However, the Atlantic Council's Jeremy Mark said there were still questions about the level of access that China would give to US regulators, as it also signalled it would prefer some Chinese companies to be delisted rather than opening the audit book. Beijing also encouraged Chinese companies to turn to Hong Kong rather than the US to access foreign capital. Last week, Didi, known as China's Uber, announced it would delist from the US and relist in Hong Kong, just a year after it made its New York debut. Mr Fok — who served as a senior executive at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing for nine years — said Hong Kong could give Chinese companies the same access to foreign capital as New York, while insulating them from the geopolitical risks they would face in the US. However, Hong Kong's National Security Law may raise doubts from international investors over the city's future as a global financial hub, according to Professor Walter. ""I think non-Chinese global companies probably see Hong Kong as far less attractive today than they would have five years ago,"" he said. ""But Chinese companies don't have a lot of choices here."" In a speech at the International Council of Securities Association in May, YJ Fisher, the director of the SEC's Office of International Affairs, stressed that the SEC's inspection of Chinese and Hong Kong companies' audit papers did ""not raise national security issues"". Ms Fisher also emphasised the necessity of resolving audit issues with China and Hong Kong to protect US investors with a growing interest in the Chinese market. She also said time was ""running out"" to resolve the issues. ""Even if the [US regulators] and Chinese authorities reach an agreement on proceeding with inspections and investigations, we still have a long way to go,"" she added. While the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) is also a popular choice for Chinese companies seeking foreign investment, over the years there has been a huge drop — from 55 ASX-listed Chinese companies in 2017 to just 15 this year. A spokesperson said the ASX had tightened its admission rules over the past eight years, and the number of companies being delisted or rejected was ""indicative of the steps ASX is taking to ensure standards are kept high"". ""Every company listed on ASX, from whichever country they come [from] — including from emerging markets, which includes but is not exclusively China — must satisfy ASX admission requirements and then meet ongoing compliance obligations,"" they said in a statement. Tim Murray — co-founder of J Capital — described the US-China audit dispute as the new reality that foreign investors, including Australia's, should be aware of. ""In the heyday of the China growth story, everybody was willing to look the other way in terms of compliance to normal standards of reporting and transparency, because everything was growing,"" he said. ""It's not like that anymore. "" We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

11,Finance stocks have worst week since COVID started as rate hike woes hit markets,markets,"  Price spikes continue, with oil up and OECD forecasting highest inflation since 1988 Analysts say the financial stocks on the ASX have had their worst week so far since the pandemic started. The ASX 200 traded lower throughout Thursday and ended down 1.4 per cent to 7,020. The All Ords was down 1.5 per cent. The finance index lost 2.1 per cent overall. Over the last week, it is down 7.5 per cent. Commonwealth Bank was also down 2.6 per cent, while ANZ was down 1.7 per cent and NAB 2.3 per cent. Westpac had the worst loss at 3.7 per cent. Banks and other financial providers were losing ground as interest rates were hiked in Australia, which impacts lending. Senior market analyst for City Index Tony Sycamore said the index had just witnessed its biggest decline in a week since the start of COVID, when it lost 45 per cent in five weeks. ""The financial sector is now testing support,"" he noted. ""Most of the bank's interest rate risk comes from customers and policyholders via loan impairments and demand for financial services. ""Growth in housing credit has picked up in recent years, alongside the strong growth in housing prices. However, higher interest rates reduce demand for credit, a key driver of bank profitability."" He said reduced levels of consumer confidence, as seen in other data this week, were also bad for banks. ""In a simplified world, this leads to job losses which in turn leads to households falling behind in their payments and a reduction in the quality of banks' loan books."" While the banks are having a bad week, energy stocks gained on Thursday as the price of oil rose again on global markets. The energy index had gained almost 8 per cent. Winners included Woodside Energy, which was up 1.8  per cent. Meanwhile, miner Rio Tinto has come out calling for more renewable energy projects to power its aluminium plants in Queensland. It has two alumina refineries and a smelter around Gladstone in central Queensland. They require 1,140MW of power to operate, making Rio Tinto the state's biggest user of energy. The company said it has lodged a formal market request for new wind and solar projects to supply its Gladstone plants. In other news, it was also revealed that a Russian entity was filing a lawsuit against Rio Tinto over one of those same plants, which it has a 20 per cent stake in. Australia banned the export of alumina and aluminium ores to Russia in March, and Rio Tinto stepped in and took sole control of the Gladstone refinery in April. Russian aluminium producer Rusal now argues Rio was in breach of its obligations by taking control. Rio Tinto lost 1.1 per cent. The losses in Australia came after Wall Street and European stocks ended down in trade overnight, with losses as high as 1.1 per cent on the S&P 500. The price of oil is up again, this time by 2.8 per cent to $US123.94. ""Brent oil is up for the eighth day in the past 10,"" NAB notes this morning. ""(That's) up $10 in the past fortnight. ""After some indication of a likely ease in inflationary pressures, the renewed uptick in oil and energy prices is stoking concerns central banks will be forced to increase their hawkishness."" Inflation data for the United States is also out this week. The last round showed yet another spike in prices. Economists including ANZ are tipping the US is headed for another rate hike to curtail inflation. With everything from mortgage rates to grocery prices and energy bills going up, more Australians are under financial pressure. We want to hear how it's impacting you. ""We expect the US Federal Reserve will raise rates by 0.5 per cent at its 14 to 15 June meeting and reiterate guidance that it intends to return rates to neutral quickly,"" ANZ noted today. ""We also expect it to maintain its guidance that rates will rise by 0.5 per cent in July to 2.0 per cent."" Just this week, the Reserve Bank of Australia hiked rates by an unexpected 0.5 per cent to curtail inflation here. The OECD has also put out its latest economic outlook. The organisation covers economic concerns for 38 nations including Australia ""It has slashed the global growth outlook to 3 per cent from the 4.5 per cent estimated in December,"" NAB notes. ""The OECD also doubled its forecast for inflation among its members (which include the US, Australia, Japan, and Latin American and European nations) to 8.5 per cent, its highest level since 1988."" The Australian dollar has gone below the 72 US cents mark after a loss of 0.6 per cent.

12,"analysis: If interest rates rise as much as markets say they will, we won't be able to afford the extra repayments",markets,"  Expect the RBA to go easy on interest rate hikes from here — we can't afford rates to rise as much as markets expect By lifting its cash rate from 0.35 per cent to 0.85 per cent, the Reserve Bank has just added about another $120 per month in payments for a $500,000 mortgage. If financial markets are to be believed, by the end of this year it will have added a total of $800 per month — and, by the end of next year, a total approaching $1,000 per month. Those figures are for variable mortgages, but homeowners on fixed rates won't escape them long. Those rates are typically fixed for up to three years. The Reserve Bank increases interest rates by 50 basis points, taking the cash rate target to 0.85 per cent — well ahead of most economists' expectations. Many of the fixed-rate mortgages were taken out during COVID at annual rates as low as 2 per cent. When those fixed rates end (and many will end in the next year or so) those homeowners will find themselves paying 5 per cent or 6 per cent per year, shelling out as much as $3,000 per month instead of $2,000. Unless financial markets are wrong. The good news is, I think they are. The pricing of deals on the futures market factors in an increase in the Reserve Bank's cash rate from 0.10 per cent to 3.5 per cent by June next year, enough to push up the standard variable mortgage rate from around 2.25 per cent to 5.65 per cent. One reason for suspecting it won't happen is that many homeowners simply couldn't afford the extra $1,000 per month. Most of us don't have that much cash lying around. US President Richard Nixon had an economic adviser by the name of Herbert Stein with an uncommonly-developed sense of common sense. In his later years he wrote an advice column for Slate magazine. To a reader wanting a cure for unrequited love, he wrote that the best solution was ""requited love"". To a reader concerned about her inability to make small talk, he wrote that what people want most is a ""good listener"". In economics, Stein is best known for Stein's Law, which says: ""if something cannot go on forever, it will stop"". Mortgage rates can't keep climbing to the point where homeowners pay an extra $1,000 per month. For new homeowners, it's worse. The typical new mortgage taken out to buy a home in NSW has climbed to $700,000. In Victoria, it has climbed to $585,000. These people will be paying a good deal more than an extra $1,000 per month if the bets on repeated rate hikes made on the futures market come to pass. The Reserve Bank says it lifted its cash rate from 0.35 per cent to 0.85 per cent this week to withdraw the ""extraordinary monetary support"" put in place during the pandemic. But the bank says from here on it will be guided by data, and, in a nod to homeowners concerned about continual rate hikes, said it expected inflation to climb just a bit more before declining back towards its target next year. Financial markets don't see it that way. They have priced in (in other words, bet money on) rate hikes in July, August, September, October, November, December, February, March, April and May. But there are reasons to believe the bank is right about inflation. As the world becomes more uncertain, and interest rates rise, we're flying a little blind. It doesn't seem that way with electricity prices set to climb 8-18 per cent in NSW, 11 per cent in Queensland, 5 per cent in Victoria, and as much as 20 per cent in South Australia. (The only jurisdiction without an increase in prospect is the Australian Capital Territory, which has 100 per cent renewables and fixed long-term contracts.) Fortunately for overall inflation, electricity accounts for less than 3 per cent of the typical household budget. Gas accounts for less than 1 per cent. Even low earners spend little more than 4 per cent of their income on electricity. While the price of vegetables is soaring (heads of lettuce are selling for $10), we spend less than 1.5 per cent of our income on vegetables. The best measure of overall price increases remains the official one of 5.1 per cent for the year to March, calculated by the Bureau of Statistics. It is a more alarming increase in inflation than Australians are used to. But what matters for the Reserve Bank is whether the 5.1 per cent is set to turn down and head back towards the target of 2-3 per cent, or climb further away from it. Australia is almost uniquely disadvantaged among developed nations in getting a handle on what's happening to inflation, being one of only two OECD members (the other is New Zealand) to compile its consumer price index quarterly, instead of monthly. By the time Australia's index is published, several of the measures in it are months old, and they don't get updated for another three months. It has been said to make the bank's job like driving a car looking through the rear-view mirror. Fortunately the Bureau of Statistics is gearing up to produce a monthly index. Meanwhile, in the United States — which is subject to the same international price pressures as Australia — most measures of inflation eased in April. Wages growth, which the Reserve Bank said last month seemed to be ""picking up"", remained dismal in the figures released a few weeks later — at just 2.4 per cent in the year to March. That was well short of the 2.7 per cent forecast in the budget for the year to June, and not enough to do anything to further fuel inflation. Australia has a history of aggressive interest rate hikes to tame inflation. In 1994, Reserve Bank Governor Bernie Fraser rammed up the cash rate from 4.75 per cent to 7.5 per cent in a matter of months. But that was when wage growth was well above inflation and the bank was trying to dampen ""demands for wage increases"" to prevent a wage-price spiral. We don't even have the beginnings of that yet. Unless the bank wants to needlessly impoverish Australians, and keep going until it pushes them out of work, it will increase rates cautiously from here on.

13,"ASX slumps, Australian dollar volatile as RBA hikes rates to 0.85pc",markets,"  ASX plunges, Australian dollar briefly surges as Reserve Bank lifts interest rates by 0.5pc The local currency has jumped briefly and the Australian share market has plunged in the wake of the Reserve Bank raising interest rates by a bigger-than-expected half a percentage point to 0.85 per cent. The central bank's second rate rise in a row is an attempt to curb surging inflation, and is the biggest rate rise in 22 years, according to CommSec. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe said today's increase in the official cash rate was a further step in pulling back coronavirus stimulus. He added that more rate rises were on the cards for the months ahead. ""The resilience of the economy and the higher inflation mean that this extraordinary support is no longer needed,"" Dr Lowe said. ""Given the current inflation pressures in the economy, and the still very low level of interest rates, the board decided to move by 50 basis points today."" Of the 35 economists surveyed by Reuters, 22 forecast a rise of one-quarter of a percentage point, 11 predicted a 40 basis point increase and, one expected a 50 basis point hike, and another said rates would stay on hold. Official interest rates could lift from the current 0.35 per cent to 1.75 per cent by year's end. The Australian dollar briefly jumped above 72 US cents to a high of 72.45 US cents on the news of the surprise 0.5 per cent rate hike. But it quickly lost its gains and at 4:30pm AEST, the local currency was down 0.1 per cent to around 71.80 US cents. Meanwhile, the Australian share market lost 1.5 per cent of its value after the decision was announced by the RBA, with all sectors finishing lower for the 12th time this year as investors feared that higher borrowing costs would hurt the economy. The All Ordinaries index fell 1.5 per cent to 7,319, while the ASX 200 index dropped 1.5 per cent to 7,096. All the banks were down, even though financial institutions benefit from higher interest rates because they lead to higher revenue. National Australia Bank (-3.3pc) led the falls, followed by the Commonwealth Bank (-2.6pc), Westpac (-2.1pc) and ANZ (-1.5pc). The best performers on the ASX 200 were copper miner Sandfire Resources (+3.4pc), chicken producer Ingham's (+3.2pc) and oil refiner Ampol (+2.4pc). Leading the losses were buy now, pay later firm Zip (-14.4pc), pharmaceutical company Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals (-6.7pc), and real estate company Ingenia Communities (-5.7pc). Zip fell for the sixth day in a row. It was hit by the RBA's big rate rise and Apple's announcement that its latest operating system will have a buy now, pay later function called Apple Pay Later. Apple also announced at its annual developer conference that it would more deeply integrate its software into the core driving system of cars. China's Yankuang Energy said it was open to further negotiations with Yancoal Australia, after the Chinese backed Australian coal miner said it will oppose a $2.5  billion deal for Yankuang to buy the remaining shares in Yancoal that it does not own. Yancoal said an independent board set up to assess the potential takeover had unanimously found that the deal was not in the best interests of minority shareholders because it undervalued the stock. Reuters previously reported that the deal was unacceptable to global miner Glencore, which holds a 6.4 per cent stake in Yancoal. Yancoal shares rose 4.2 per cent to $5.66. Brent crude rose 0.3 per cent in Asian trade to $US119.84 a barrel, and spot gold was slightly lower at $US1840.27 an ounce at 4:30pm AEST. Electric car billionaire Elon Musk has threatened to walk away from his $US44 billion ($61 billion) takeover bid for Twitter after accusing the social media giant of refusing to give him information about fake accounts and spam. Mr Musk's lawyers sent a letter to Twitter's chief legal officer, Vijaya Gadde, which accused the company of ""resisting and thwarting"" giving the billionaire information about ""spam bot"" accounts. In the letter,  a lawyer for Mr Musk called it a ""clear material breach"" of the terms of their merger agreement, and said he reserved all rights to terminate his takeover bid. ""Twitter's latest offer to simply provide additional details regarding the company's own testing methodologies, whether through written materials or verbal explanations, is tantamount to refusing Mr Musk's data requests,"" the letter said. ""Mr Musk believes the company is actively resisting and thwarting his information rights (and the company's corresponding obligation) under the merger agreement."" Mr Musk said he needs the data to conduct his own analysis of Twitter users because he did not believe the company's ""lax testing methodologies."" Twitter said that it planned to enforce the completion of the deal on agreed terms. ""Twitter has and will continue to cooperatively share information with (Mr) Musk to consummate the transaction in accordance with the terms of the major agreement,"" the company said in a statement. The salvo has prompted speculation that Mr Musk's deal to buy Twitter is falling apart as it is not the first time that the eccentric billionaire has publicly suggested his purchase of Twitter may not happen. ""He is trying to walk away from the Twitter deal, this is the first shot across the bow,"" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Dennis Dick from Bright Trading said it was ""fairly obvious that Musk has buyer's remorse and he is trying whatever to get a reduction in price, and I think he may succeed,"" he told Reuters. Last month, Mr Musk tweeted that the deal was ""temporarily on hold"" and said he would not move forward with the offer until the company showed proof that spam bots account for fewer than 5 per cent of its users. Elon Musk's brilliant track record has seen even the most blue-blooded establishment figures overlook his more outlandish and erratic behaviour. But this time, even his most ardent supporters have their doubts, writes Ian Verrender. He has said he believes spam bots constitute at least one-fifth of the user base. The billionaire waived due diligence when he agreed to buy Twitter at $US54.20 a share in April. Twitter shares fell 1.5 per cent on the news to $US39.56. US stocks ended a volatile session higher, but lingering worries about rising inflation continued. The Dow Jones index rose 16 points or 0.05 per cent to 32,916, the S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent to 4,121, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.4 per cent to 12,061. Amazon shares increased 2 per cent and were the biggest driver on the S&P 500. Apple shares rose 0.5 per cent as it made major announcements at its annual software developer conference. In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 1 per cent to 7,608, the CAC 40 in Paris also added 1 per cent to 4,988, and the DAX in Germany gained 1.3 per cent to 14,654.

14,"RBA expected to lift interest rates, Rio Tinto sued over Queensland refinery, ASX falls",markets,"  ASX falls ahead of RBA meeting, global stock markets slide, Rio Tinto sued over Queensland refinery Australian shares fall ahead of the RBA meeting on Tuesday, pulled down by a slide in global equities as US jobs data signals the Federal Reserve will likely continue raising interest rates to ease inflation. The RBA is expected to raise interest rates tomorrow and economist predict that rates would go up between 25 and 50 basis points. According to RateCity, if the RBA hikes the cash rate by 0.25 percentage points, the average owner-occupier with a $500,000 debt and 25 years remaining will see their repayments rise by a further $66. Technical assumptions in the RBA board minutes presume the cash rate could increase to 1.75 per cent by the end of the year and hit 2.5 per cent by the end of 2023. If this happens, the same borrower with a $500,000 loan balance could see their monthly repayments rise, in total, by $652 a month by Christmas next year. ""The board may stick to a standard 0.25 percentage point hike, but there’s every chance it will be more hard-hitting,"" said RateCity research director Sally Tindall. “With petrol and grocery prices continuing to shoot up, the case for a 0.40 percentage point hike is strong. ""Central banks across the world are struggling to get on top of inflation, and the Reserve Bank of Australia does not want to be one of them. The board will want to nip this in the bud."" The ASX 200 closed down 33 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 7,206. At the same time, the Australian dollar was down, to 71.95 US cents. Metals and mining index declined 1 per cent, with Rio Tinto, BHP and Fortescue falling between 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent. Financials retreated 0.6 per cent. NAB and ANZ dropped 0.5 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively. Shares of Magellan slumped 13.9 per cent, to $12.85, on announcement that its funds under management (FUM) fell to $65 billion by May 31, from $68.6 billion in the month prior. Technology stocks were the lead laggards on the local bourse, tumbling 1.6 per cent as they tracked Wall Street's weak finish from Friday. Block, Xero and WiseTech were down between 1.5 per cent and 3.2 per cent. In an energy crisis that pits gas exporters against Australia, there are two possible actions for the new Albanese government to take, writes Ian Verrender. On the upside, energy stocks gained 2.1 per cent and hit a more-than-two-year high, as oil prices rose in early trade after Saudi Arabia raised prices sharply for its crude sales in July. Oil and gas giant Woodside Energy climbed 3.2 per cent in its fourth straight session of gains. Meanwhile, Santos rose 2 per cent, to hit a more-than-two-year high after the gas producer said on Sunday that it was taking steps, along with its joint venture partner Beach Energy (+1.4 per cent), to increase domestic supply of the energy resource. Russian aluminium producer Rusal has filed a lawsuit against global miner Rio Tinto, seeking to win back access to its 20 per cent share of the alumina produced at a jointly owned refinery in Queensland. The lawsuit challenges Australia's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which included wide-ranging sanctions against Russian firms and oligarchs who had links with President Vladimir Putin. Rio stepped in to take sole control of Queensland Alumina Ltd (QAL) in April, sidelining Rusal and cutting its access to the refinery's output of alumina, a compound from which aluminium is derived. While Rio owns 80 per cent of the refinery, Rusal owns the remaining 20 per cent. Rusal's Australian unit, Alumina and Bauxite Company (ABC), said in a Australian Federal Court filing that the circumstances required for Rio to step in to take control did not exist, and amounted to a breach of obligations, according to the court documents reviewed by Reuters. Rio's move at QAL came shortly after the world's biggest iron ore miner severed all ties with Russian businesses over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls its military actions in Ukraine ""a special operation"". Australia banned the export of alumina and aluminium ores, including bauxite, to Russia in March. Global equity markets fell on Friday. Data showed the American economy generated more jobs than expected in May, signalling the Federal Reserve will likely continue raising interest rates in its effort to curb inflation. The US Labor Department's closely watched employment report showed the US economy added 390,000 jobs in May, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.6 per cent for a third straight month, beating most analyst estimates. Traders were hoping the jobs report would reveal stronger signs of weakness in the US economy that would help persuade the Fed to soften its stance on inflation and interest rates to avoid triggering a recession. ""It was strength across the board with the exception of retail trade, and the economy on the jobs front continues to power forward,"" said Josh Wein, portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. ""The Fed still needs to unfortunately destroy a little bit of demand and they are going to continue to do that for at least the next few meetings with 50-point rate hikes."" The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, was down 1.11 per cent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was also down 0.26 per cent. On Wall Street, all three major indexes were led lower by sell-offs in the technology, consumer discretionary, communication services, financials and industrials sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.98 per cent, to 32,923.57, the S&P 500 lost 1.57 per cent, to 4,111.41 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.46 per cent, to 12,013.45. ""Some of the rally (in equities) of late was due to the Fed acknowledging that in the fall they could reassess and take a pause perhaps,"" Mr Wein said. ""But the market is retracing some of their earlier losses and saying basically that's all off the table."" Oil prices rose, buoyed by expectations that OPEC's decision to increase production targets by slightly more than planned will not affect tight global supply much and by rising demand as China eases COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions.

Just like home owners may see the latest house price news as a negative, buyers may feel some long-forgotten optimism about getting back into the market. Similarly, median prices do not tell the full story. Median values do not necessarily mean all houses in a particularly favourable growth area will increase in price. These statistics provide a snapshot of the properties that were sold in that time period. Ultimately, your home's value will be determined by how much a buyer would pay for it. According to CoreLogic, the top three suburbs in each capital city are mostly clustered in the same areas. In Greater Melbourne, the Mornington Peninsula is by far the best area for price growth. The Logan-Beaudesert region in Greater Brisbane has also bucked the national trend, while prices in Perth's north-west continue to climb. For would-be home owners and investors, let's drill down into your capital's top three burgeoning suburbs. Suburb Median Value Annual Change Maraylya $1,605,065 30.4 per cent Box Hill $1,398,477 29 per cent Mount Victoria $801,587 28.4 per cent Despite the country's most populous city leading the trend for house price declines, there are still pockets where growth is happening. The Baulkham Hills and Hawkesbury region is home to the two best suburbs as far as growth goes. About 43 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district, Maraylya and Box Hill are virtually next-door neighbours and share similar statistics and demographics. Maraylya was the best performer with a median house value of $1,605,065, which is an annual change of 30.4 per cent. The median weekly household income, according to the 2016 census, was $2,133 per week. Rentals made up 15.2 per cent of the occupied private dwellings. Mount Victoria rounds out the top three. Located in the Blue Mountains in the outer west, you'll clock about 120 kilometres by road to reach the CBD. The median weekly income was $1,065 back in 2016 and 22.7 per cent of the suburb's residents rented. Suburb Median Value Annual Change Tootgarook $1,148,420 22 per cent St Andrew's Beach $1,509,360 21.6 per cent Sorrento $2,304,891 20.8 per cent The Mornington Peninsula boasts the top 10 suburbs for price growth in greater Melbourne. Median house values vary wildly in the top 3 but all have one thing in common — values are holding strong and rising. Tootgarook was the best performer. Located 80 kilometres from the Melbourne CBD, Tootgarook has a median weekly household income of $1,023 and rentals make up 27 per cent of the market. Further up the road is Sorrento, home to the mansions on millionaire's walk. The median value of houses is markedly higher here but interestingly, the median household income is not much more at $1,136. A whopping 64.5 per cent of occupied private dwellings are owned outright (without a mortgage) while 13.6 per cent are rentals. On the opposite side of the peninsula is the coastal village of St Andrew's Beach, where the median weekly household income is $1,652 while the median weekly rent is lower than the nation's ($335) at $294. Suburb Median Value Annual Change Cedar Grove $801,831 45 per cent Logan Central $473,578 42.1 per cent Cedar Vale $841,756 41.6 per cent If you are a home owner in the Logan-Beaudesert region, the figures look impressive.  Classified as a mixed-use locality in the city of Logan, Cedar Grove is about 25 kilometres from Brisbane's CBD. According to the 2016 census, the median weekly household income was $1,793 and 61.6 per cent of people in Cedar Grove have a mortgage. Logan Central, as the name would suggest, is the CBD and administrative centre of the City of Logan. The median weekly household income in 2016 was $856 and 57 per cent of private dwellings were rentals. The rural locality of Cedar Vale showed a median household income of $1,863 with just 8.2 per cent renting. Suburb Median Value Annual Change Beaumont $1,783,745 43.8 per cent O'Sullivan Beach $534,156 38.7 per cent Modbury North $596,655 38.7 per cent The top three performers in Greater Adelaide are spread out over a wider distance. Beaumont in the Adelaide-Central Hills region is just 8 kilometres from the CBD. With a relatively high median weekly household income of $2,265, the proportion paying rent greater than or equal to 30 per cent of that income (according to the 2016 census) sits at just 3 per cent. The seaside suburb of O'Sullivan Beach in the south has much lower house prices but also lower weekly incomes — the median sitting at $891 in 2016. There's a pretty even three-way split of those who own their homes outright, those who have a mortgage and those who rent. In Modbury North, which sits 14 kilometres from the CBD, the median weekly household income sits around $1,400 and close to 45 per cent have a mortgage. Suburb Median Value Annual Change Primrose Sands $579,571 28.1 per cent Tranmere $1,119,609 26.4 per cent Acton Park $1,316,007 25.7 per cent In 2016, the median weekly household income for the mixed urban and rural locality of Primrose Sands was $744. Rentals made up 23.6 per cent of occupied private dwellings with the median weekly rental costing $200. At Tranmere, the house prices double and median weekly household income rises accordingly to $1,966. Nearly 39 per cent of houses are owned outright. Over in Acton Park, the median household income sits at $2,195 with just 3.4 per cent of occupied private dwellings listed as rentals. Suburb Median Value Annual Change Watermans Bay $1,276,719 14.9 per cent Ocean Reef $990,680 14.5 per cent Carine $1,107,087 14.5 per cent The best-performing suburbs in Greater Perth experienced modest growth. Perth's north-west fared best, with Watermans Bay experiencing growth of 14.9 per cent. The northern coastal suburb has a median household income of $1,927 and renters make up 28.6 per cent of occupied private dwellings. Further up the coast at Ocean Reef, median house values are less but weekly household income more generous at $2,245. In nearby Carine, 45 per cent own their homes outright and there's a median weekly household income of $2,242. Suburb Median Value Annual Change Nakara $637,057 16.2 per cent Wagaman $513,276 26.4 per cent Wulagi $579,251 15 per cent In the Top End, the top-performing suburbs are right next door to each other, approximately 13 kilometres from the CBD. The three suburbs have similar statistics and demographics. Nakara boasts the highest median value and median weekly household income of $2,261, while rentals make up 32.4 per cent of occupied private dwellings. Suburb Median Value Annual Change Denman Prospect $1,221,771 32.9 per cent Waramanga $971,167 30.7 per cent Coombs $760,037 29.8 per cent The nation's capital has a number of suburbs to watch as far as house price growth is concerned. Denman Prospect is a suburb currently under development and as such has no 2016 census data. Waramanga, on the other hand, was established in the late-1960s and has a 30.1 per cent rate of homes owned outright. The median weekly household income is $1,875. In Coombs, 74 per cent of occupied private dwellings are owned with a mortgage and the median weekly household income is $2,315.

17,"Tech, financials drag ASX lower; global equities fall despite positive US economic data",markets,"  Tech, financials drag ASX lower; global equities fall despite positive US economic data Australian shares, in tandem with global markets, have edged lower, dragged by losses in technology and banking stocks as investors remain wary of potential rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve. Oil prices strengthened as EU leaders agreed to phase out Russian oil The ASX 200 closed down 58 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 7,176. At the same time, the Australian dollar was down at 71.59 US cents. Global equities traded lower after economic data from the US remained supportive of the Fed's planned pace of interest rate hikes, potentially influencing central banks elsewhere. Domestic technology stocks emerged as the biggest drag on the benchmark, shedding 2.5 per cent, for a third session of losses after tracking overnight declines on Wall Street. Shares in sector majors Block, Xero and Computershare plunged between 1 per cent and 5 per cent. Financials slipped over 1.2 per cent, with all of the so-called ""big four"" banks trading in negative territory. The export-reliant mining sub-index fell over 0.3 per cent, even as iron ore prices continued to move upwards. Sector giants BHP Group and Rio Tinto shed 0.1 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively. Lithium miners Pilbara (-0.9pc) and Allkem (-1.4pc) were also down. Bucking the trend, energy stocks gained over 3.1 per cent on sharper oil prices after European Union leaders agreed on a phased ban on Russian oil, while the end of the COVID-19 lockdown in Shanghai raised demand prospects. Woodside Energy jumped 5.2 per cent, to $31.75, after completing its merger with BHP's oil and gas business. It now has a market capitalisation of $60.34 billion. Liontown gained 3.9 per cent, to $1.21, Origin advanced 2.7 per cent, to $6.07 and Whitehaven rose 1.6 per cent to $5.24. Additionally, gold stocks edged 0.4 per cent lower on global inflation woes. Global equities fell on Wednesday after stronger-than-expected economic data was unable to assuage investor concerns of high inflation and an impending recession, driven partly by rising oil prices. A report by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) showed US manufacturing activity picked up in May as demand for goods remained strong, even with rising prices. The survey followed data released last Friday showing US consumer spending, the largest contributor to American economic output, increased in April, even amid growing concerns of a recession. Market sentiment, however, has remained bearish, due to the prevailing uncertainty caused by the pace of the US Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes, and the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on food and commodity prices. ""There's a lot of uncertainty,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital in Los Angeles. ""The market climbs a wall of worry and there's a lot to worry about."" ""If we have a recession, it would be strange and unusual with nearly full employment, companies still hiring and huge demand for things."" The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, was down 0.8 per cent. Meanwhile, the pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 1 per cent. On Wall Street, all three main indexes ended lower, driven by stocks in the financials, healthcare, technology and consumer discretionary sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5 per cent, to 32,813, the S&P 500 lost 0.8 per cent, to 4,101 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7 per cent, to 11,994. ""Rising interest rates and inflation are just compressing valuations,"" Mr Schulman added. ""You may like a company, and it may be good and can continue to make profits, but the valuation must still come down because your base interest rate is rising."" Oil prices continued to strengthen after the move by European Union leaders to gradually phase-out Russian oil, even as China ended its stiff COVID-19 lockdown in Shanghai, which could bolster demand for crude in an already tight market. Brent crude oil was up, trading at $US115.83 a barrel, by 06:52am AEST.

18,"Soaring energy costs driving up inflation, while Origin Energy downsizes earnings",markets,"  Soaring energy costs driving up inflation, while Origin Energy downsizes earnings The Australian share market has closed up on Wednesday, despite ongoing global and domestic concerns about inflation, rate hikes and energy prices. The ASX 200 opened the day slightly up and by 2:30pm was trading 0.1 per cent up. It ended the day 0.3 per cent up at 7,234 points. Seven of 11 sectors ended higher, with telcos the best performing. Telstra had gained 3.1 per cent. Meanwhile, Fortescue added 3.2 per cent. This was after official GDP figures were released for the March quarter, which showed above-expected growth of 0.8 per cent. ANZ economist Felicity Emmett told ABC News this may increase the likelihood of the RBA hiking rates by 0.4 per cent next week. ""It really is suggesting there is this broadening and inflationary pressures, and I think this is going to concern the RBA, and that certainly leaves open the option that they will opt for a 40 basis point hike,"" she said. Losers included Pilbara Mining, which dived by 22 per cent. Energy provider Origin lost almost 14 per cent. That was after it revised down its earnings as the price of wholesale energy soared. Coal, gas and oil prices are up, due to global volatility, including the war in Ukraine. Locally, coal prices are also up, which is pushing up the price of generating electricity. Origin noted that its Eraring coal-fired power plant is producing less power, which means the energy company has to buy more power on the spot market. ""The recent material under-delivery of coal to Eraring results in lower output from the plant, additional replacement coal purchases at significantly higher prices, and is being exacerbated by coal delivery constraints via rail. ""In addition, the lower output from Eraring results in a greater exposure to the purchase of electricity at current high spot prices in order to meet customer demand. ""As a result, Origin now expects energy markets' underlying EBITDA in FY2022 to be $310 to $460 million, lower than the original guidance range of $450 to $600 million."" Concerns about rising energy prices were highlighted just last week, when the energy regulator raised default prices due to similar concerns raised by Origin. The Australian share market was having a subdued day after global markets traded down overnight. Europe's DAX was down 1.3 per cent after inflation data showed prices had spiked 8 per cent in a year across the continent. Like inflation here and in the United States, price hikes are being led by soaring energy costs. The price of gas and other energy has been rising due to the war in Ukraine and other global factors. Food is also going up in price. Higher inflation increases the likelihood that central banks will hike rates to curtail runaway prices. ""Inflation is back in focus, with European inflation at its highest-ever level, of 8.1 per cent, year on year, helping rates to extend yesterday’s sell off,"" NAB notes. ""Higher inflation and higher yields helped a cautious tone in equity markets, with US equities failing to continue the rebound last week."" Overnight, Wall Street ended in the red, with the Dow and S&P down 0.6 per cent each, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.4 per cent. Oil prices are up (+0.6 per cent) after the European Union agreed to ban most Russian imports, due to the nation's war in Ukraine. OPEC is due to meet this week to discuss its production. Meanwhile, European natural gas rose to its highest level in almost two months, according to ANZ. That was after Russia cut supplies to more energy firms due to payment issues. It will only make the inflation worse across the continent. In Australia, the focus today will be on GDP data being released. ANZ is forecasting a rise of 0.8 per cent but says attention will be labour cost measures. Meanwhile, fresh property data out today shows that prices declined nationally for the first time since September 2020, with a decline of 0.3 per cent overall, but some capital cities, such as Adelaide and Brisbane, still rising. ""We think further declines are inevitable as interest rates rise,"" ANZ adds. The Australian dollar is unmoved at 72 US cents. More to come.

19,Why crypto is like kryptonite according to some of the world's biggest investors,markets,"  Many put faith in cryptocurrency but crash could lead to regulation and new consumer protections Max Moulder is doing whatever he can to make ends meet. He's taken a shot at being an Uber driver. He's drawing on his life-long trade of cutting and selling gemstones. But odd jobs are not earning him enough to keep up with the growing cost of living. ""I've done gemstone cutting and trading for a long, long time — since I was 10 years old — that's not paid off for me,"" he said. ""It's very difficult doing Uber driving with the cost of petrol. That's not working. And I can't do cabinet making anymore. So I'm running out of options really."" In his mind, there's just one option left: to invest in crypto. ""I feel like I've been forced into this,"" he told ABC News. Mr Moulder only started investing three weeks ago when the market tanked. He's put in $1,000 so far and is willing to invest a lot more. His view is that he's buying cheap and so ""it can only go upwards from here"". ""I feel I've only got six years to make some large gains, so, I'm jumping in,"" he said. It is faith, rather than investment fundamentals, that has left Mr Moulder, and millions of other investors around the world, either already suffering or being vulnerable to massive losses. Consumer advocacy group Choice has found that one in nine Australians have bought cryptocurrencies in the past year and that number is expected to keep rising. Half of them see crypto as a long-term investment, rather than short term speculation and two in five see it as a diversification of their portfolio. ""People have really been harmed, and the system is really rigged against consumers,"" said Patrick Veyret, senior policy adviser for consumer group CHOICE. ""What we're seeing is widespread market manipulation, market rigging... a real rise in scams. ""And that's why we're calling for stronger consumer protections and strong obligations on cryptocurrency exchanges."" Since November (when Bitcoin hit a record high of $US69,000), about $US1.5 trillion has been wiped off the value of the entire cryptocurrency market. That's more than half its value erased in just six months. Crypto has made some investors overnight millionaires but for others it's a fad propped up by celebrity endorsements. Much like housing, cryptocurrencies were boosted by record low interest rates and by governments globally pumping trillions of dollars' worth of stimulus to fight off COVID. But unlike the housing market, which is largely regulated and incentivised through tax perks and government grants, crypto operates without regulation and, some argue, little accountability. It's a reality that's not lost on global policymakers, who have signalled new regulations are imminent. Bitcoin, which came to life in 2008 as the financial system was imploding, was started by a growing class of tech-savvy dissatisfied citizens seeking an alternative to the mainstream financial system. Now that utopian vision is under fire, and the question everyone is asking is, will a new era of regulation kill or strengthen cryptocurrencies? In May, the collapse of popular cryptocurrency Luna and the so-called ""stablecoin"" TerraUSD showed such investments can wreak havoc on the lives of many. Together, they were valued at about $60 billion just weeks ago. But now they are almost worthless. Investors losing their life savings, people at risk of homelessness, and even stories of suicide surfaced on social media, causing people worldwide to question its legitimacy. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are usually pegged to a fiat currency, such as the dollar. Most issuers claim by backing the coins with traditional assets that are safe and liquid, it protects against risk. There are three main ways stablecoins remain pegged to a fiat currency. First, it can be pegged to the dollar. Second, it can be backed by reserves of cryptocurrencies. Finally, as in the case of Terra, it can be backed by an algorithm. The devastating effects of the crash of crypto ""stablecoins"" Terra and Luna are being felt by many but their crash may have been orchestrated in one massive piece of ethically questionable trading. This algorithm adds tokens to the supply if the price is getting too high, to bring the price back down, or removes tokens from supply if the price falls below the peg. But on May 9, Terra crashed. It is now worth just 3 US cents. Its sister coin Luna, which was worth $US119 at its peak, is now worth nil. Terra was being deposited by many investors via a platform called Anchor, which worked like a bank savings account. It allowed users to earn yields on Terra deposits and take out loans against holdings. The team behind Terra were telling investors if they deposited Terra via Anchor they could get returns of around 20 per cent. Sound too good to be true? That's because it was, said Henri Arslanian, a former PwC crypto leader and partner who is now an author and Adjunct Professor at the University of Hong Kong. ""What's important to understand is that there are different kinds of stablecoins,"" he said. ""For many, the riskiest stable coins are the algorithmic ones. Unfortunately, they are giving the stablecoin industry a bad name."" ""Nothing malfunctioned with Luna or Terra. But the design didn't provide a solution in this black swan scenario that eventuated. ""It's like saying, you have built a building, but it's not built to withstand an earthquake. That means, if there was an earthquake, the building would collapse."" ""This is what happened with Terra. The building (infrastructure) behind it did not have the right safeguards."" Some have theorised that an 'evil genius' may have caused Terra and Luna to crash. At the time of the crash, many on social media speculated that the big US hedge funds and trading firms, BlackRock and Citadel Securities, were behind it. The accusation was that they jointly borrowed 100,000 bitcoin from cryptocurrency exchange Gemini to purchase Terra, only to dump the assets, causing the market to collapse and wiping out more than $US25 billion in the underlying LUNA market value. Both firms have rejected that, saying they don't trade Terra. Mr Arslanian said regulators and policy makers will now try to introduce new regulation over algorithmic stablecoins but that it will be difficult. Do Kwon, who founded Terra creators Terraform Labs, did not respond to ABC News' request for comment. He had tweeted at the time of Terra's collapse, in early May: ""I understand the last 72 hours have been extremely tough on all of you — know that I am resolved to work with every one of you to weather this crisis, and we will build our way out of this"". But on Saturday, he attempted to resuscitate the Terra ecosystem by launching a new blockchain (Terra 2.0) and a new cryptocurrency (Luna 2.0). The new version of Luna appears to be suffering a similar fate. Its value plunged by more than 70 per cent within hours of trading. Mr Kwon has also been caught up in other controversies, including being directed by South Korea's National Tax Service to pay 100 billion won (roughly $US78 million) in taxes and is facing lawsuits from burnt investors. Conor Bronsdon's is one of those, although he is not thinking of litigation. His $US400,000 investment was wiped out when Terra/Luna crashed. ""It was the majority of my savings,"" said the 30-year-old investor, based in Seattle. Crypto has been particularly popular with millennials across the globe — more than one quarter of Australian investors aged 18 to 34 have at least 10 per cent of their portfolios invested in cryptocurrency, according to eToro data. Despite the personal loss, Mr Bronsdon is still an advocate of decentralised transactions. He said, with the benefit of hindsight, he would not have put so much money into Terra and Luna. ""I saw it as a safer investment than it actually was — I didn't expect it to go to zero that quickly."" Henrik Andersson is the chief investment officer and co-founder of Apollo Capital. He said his firm did have exposure to Terra and Luna and lost out because of it but said that won't stop them investing in crypto. ""It was not a catastrophic loss for us,"" he told ABC News. The firm has been focusing its investments solely in crypto space for past 4.5 years, and he has been personally investing for almost a decade. ""Look, it's very risky – there's very high volatility, and all investors need to understand the risks. ""It's hard to find another asset class that's generated higher returns over the past few years and that's set to continue."" Our fondness for stashing cash during a crisis isn't abating even as we move to a more digital world, writes Nassim Khadem. However, other big investors disagree cryptocurrencies give higher returns – relative to the risk — and are steering away from crypto. PGIM, a global $US1.5 trillion asset manager, recently released a report calling cryptocurrency ""portfolio Kryptonite"". It says about 16 million Australian superannuation accounts could be exposed to cryptocurrency investments if institutional investors adopt it. Its chief operating officer Taimur Hyat argued that crypto is not a quite currency and that there is little evidence that cryptocurrencies deliver diversification compared with mainstream financial assets. He noted that with cryptocurrency like bitcoin ""you get the same risk-adjusted returns as other asset classes, but you have far more volatility"". Mr Hyat said it does not act as effective hedge against fluctuation from factors like COVID. ""We asked, do they [peoples' investments in cryptocurrencies] absorb shocks over time? Crypto does not achieve that."" Mr Hyat said there is now the risk that increased regulation could see peoples' investments further tank as ""there's uncertainty about what the regulations will be"". Aside from the investment fundamentals, there's also questions about the lack of consumer protections when investments fail. Mr Veyret, from Choice, wants to see the same rules that apply to stock markets, apply to digital assets. ""Right now, conduct such as market manipulation, which is banned and Australian stock markets are actively promoted on cryptocurrency exchanges,"" he said. The evidence now shows that stablecoins such as TerraUSD might not actually be that safe, he said. ""It's really concerning that these exchanges are advertising... terms like safe and also really high yield. ""Businesses and exchanges have an obligation to ensure that they're not engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct."" Consumer Action Law Centre (CALC) chief executive Gerard Brody is calling for new laws to be introduced, requiring crypto platforms to be obliged to detect, prevent and reimburse people from scams. ""We regularly hear from callers to our advice lines who have lost astounding sums of money — often their entire life savings — to scams occurring on crypto platforms,"" he said. ""The reality is that these platforms are a conduit for organised criminals and money launderers."" CALC is also advocating for restrictions on advertising and marketing of crypto to the general public, in its submission to Treasury's review of the sector. ""Crypto is intentionally complex and should not be advertised and marketed to the general public — the use of celebrity endorsement and association with sports teams is particularly worrying,"" Mr Brody said. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has stated that stablecoins are anything but stable, while flagging regulation of the wider digital assets market. ""Stablecoins raise policy concerns, including those related to illicit finance, user protection, and systemic risk,"" Dr Yellen said. ""And, they are currently subject to inconsistent and fragmented oversight,"" she said, adding that the broader ecosystem should governed in order to allow ""responsible innovation"". From a local perspective, Australia's new Labor could impose tougher regulation. In the lead up to the election Labor's Stephen Jones had said that would consider crypto regulation as part of a broader overhaul of the digital payments system. If that happens, corporate watchdog ASIC would be responsible for overseeing changes. A spokesman for ASIC said the regulator does not currently regulate crypto assets unless they are legally considered as financial products, ""and it is not always clear whether a particular crypto-asset product is within our jurisdiction"". ""This means you may not be protected if a platform fails or is hacked,"" the ASIC spokesman said. He said in the meantime, ASIC supervises products traded on the stock exchange, such as the recent ETFs with crypto as an underlying asset. ASIC also investigates conduct breaches such as misleading or deceptive behaviour, where they involve crypto-assets that are financial products. Joni Pirovich, a lawyer specialising in blockchain and digital assets, said crypto tokens are being used to experiment how to do financial transactions better, cheaper and faster. ""There are more than 10,000 of these tokens that people can purchase and trade, which is far beyond the current resources of any regulator to supervise meaningfully,"" she said. ""But there's a desire from policymakers around the world to make sure crypto tokens are brought into a supervised net."" Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices have surged to dizzying heights since their creation amid the global financial crisis. We explain what's driving this, along with the pros and cons. That policy conversation has been happening for the past six years, but the collapse of Terra (which trades under the code ""UST"") and Luna has people refocused on it. ""The average person had invested about $50,000 in UST and that investment has shrunk to nil,"" she said. ""There's new calls for consumer protections, but uncertainty about the best approach: whether mums and dads should maintain choice to access these risky tokens or whether to make the issuers responsible for preventing investment from mums and dads."" But the issuer is often not linked to one country. There is often a global team of people involved in coming up with the token, its features and what it can do. She said the other option is to have new law, enforced by a regulator like ASIC, that requires an issuer to have controls that cap mum and dad investor crypto deposits to no more than, say, $5,000. But she says caps and the ability to increase or decrease caps, are best left to the market, not law, to decide and compete on. And a final option, which she does not recommend, is to ban these products for retail investors. ""You can't eliminate risks ever. Being informed of the risks and being educated is what supports choice and a growing economy."" Meanwhile, US lawyer Moe Vela believes crypto needs to be regulated but urged the current US administration to not fall into the trap of a regulatory environment that will stifle growth under the guise of protecting consumers. Mr Vela was director of administration for US President Barack Obama, where he worked closely with Joe Biden. He also worked with former Vice-President Al Gore in the Clinton White House, and is a director at Unicorn Hunters, the company building a cryptocurrency called Unicoin. ""Regulation can be healthy if written in the spirit of fostering innovation and creating an inviting environment to new and existing investors,"" he said. ""I am optimistic that the regulations that are inevitably forthcoming will be of a nature that will bring more confidence and security to the industry and thus spur more investment."" Tony Richards was head of payments at the Reserve Bank for 10 years. He said too many people are speculating on digital currencies, unaware of the risk that its value ""can fall sharply or even to zero"". He warned that anyone buying cryptocurrency should be mindful that even bellwether cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are not yet considered by corporate watchdog ASIC to be a financial product, meaning it's not regulated under the Corporations Act. While cryptocurrency millionaires allegedly abound, the real future for digital currencies looks far more conventional and state-controlled. ""Bitcoin only gets its value from the hope that someone else tomorrow will give you value for it,"" Dr Richards said. ""It's a thing that people can trade they can buy and sell between each other, but it's, it's not a financial product."" But he also noted that cryptocurrencies, like any other goods or services in the economy, could be subject to Australian Consumer Law protections. He said the consensus from central banks and others in the international organisations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) are that the links between the cryptocurrency universe and the traditional financial sector are weak. ""You could have significant further falls in in cryptocurrency prices without having major effects on the traditional financial system… on financial stability, but obviously that could change. He said there may be a world where digital currencies, distributed ledger technology and smart contracts are a major part of financial system, but that ""cryptocurrencies might be very much a sideshow"". In early April, several weeks before Terra (UST) collapsed, the cryptocurrency exchange Binance released an online advertisement claiming that stablecoin was a ""safe"" investment. Binance also promoted it as a ""safe and happy"" opportunity to earn a very high return — up to 19.63 per cent. When asked about the ad, Binance Australia's CEO, Leigh Travers, said: ""It's not the language that I think we'd use again if that advertisement were to be considered by the marketing team"". Binance is also warning its customers in real time trade that ""the price of a token is subject to high volatility"" and that ""Binance will not be held responsible for any trading losses"". Like many others in the industry, Mr Travers welcomes increased scrutiny in the crypto industry. By improving the standards and better protecting consumers, crypto exchanges can get access to things like banking and financial services, including insurance, he said. He explained that Binance currently has a pool of more than $1 billion in capital to protect users in the event of exchange malfunction. However, it is made up of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as opposed to actual cash. While he noted the industry may have got a bad reputation following last month's crash, he did not believe there was widespread market manipulation. ""If there happened to be excessive manipulation on one platform, that's simply… smaller exchanges that don't have the same liquidity don't have the same consumer protections,"" Mr Travers said. An ABC investigation unravels a sophisticated cryptocurrency operation endorsed by a political movement founded by exiled billionaire Guo Wengui and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. But he said the sector also had the potential to drive growth. ""There is true value here. There could be a major industry with... tens of thousands or potentially hundreds of thousands of jobs — high paying jobs in an exciting industry. ""So let's work together and make sure that Australia has an opportunity to compete on a global scale here."" Meanwhile, Mr Bronsdon believes there is a need to protect individuals who invest in crypto – having lost $US400,000 when Terra and Luna collapsed. But he said that ""we want to be careful about how those regulations are put into place"". ""We don't want to stifle the innovation that's happening, the space and some of the incredible things that are being built, but at the same time normal people need to be protected. ""When an event like this happens, it is the kind of scale of the Enron crash or Bear Stearns (collapse that led to the global financial crisis). ""It has affected hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people worldwide. There are opportunities for protections.""

20,"Miner, tech shares lift ASX higher; AGL tumbles on demerger collapse; ACCC sues Mastercard",markets,"  Miner, tech shares lift ASX higher; AGL tumbles on demerger collapse; ACCC sues Mastercard Australian shares have risen, led by gains in technology stocks tracking a Wall Street rally and mining stocks on new strength in commodity prices, while AGL Energy fell on withdrawing plans for its demerger. The ASX 200 closed up 104 points, or 1.5 per cent, to 7,287. The Australian dollar was up at 71.85 US cents at 4.22pm AEST. Shares of AGL Energy dropped 1.7 per cent to $8.72 after news about the company scrapping its plans to demerge its coal-focused generation business. It has prompted four senior board members to quit. Technology stocks led gains on the benchmark, climbing more than 4.6 per cent, tracking a strong Wall Street rally from Friday, with Block's shares and Xero rising 10.9 per cent and 5.2 per cent respectively. Miners rose about 2.3 per cent to hit their highest since April 29, with sector giants BHP Group, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group adding between 0.4 per cent and 2.8 per cent. Financials added 0.6 per cent. ANZ was up 0.4 per cent to $25.77 despite being sued by the corporate watchdog ASIC for allegedly misleading its customers about how much they have got left to spend on their credit card accounts. The ACCC has instituted proceedings in the Federal Court against Mastercard for allegedly engaging in conduct with the purpose of substantially lessening competition in the supply of debit card acceptance services. Mastercard's alleged anti-competitive conduct commenced in late 2017 in the context of the Reserve Bank of Australia's least cost routing initiative. The RBA's least cost routing initiative aimed to increase competition in the supply of debit card acceptance services and reduce payment costs for businesses by allowing them to choose the lowest cost network to process their transactions. This enabled businesses to choose whether their debit transactions were processed by Visa, Mastercard or eftpos, with eftpos often being the cheapest option. It is alleged that in response to the least cost routing initiative, Mastercard entered into agreements with more than 20 major retail businesses, including supermarkets, fast food chains and clothing retailers. The agreements gave these businesses discounted rates for Mastercard credit card transactions, provided they committed to processing all or most of their Mastercard-eftpos debit card transactions through Mastercard rather than the eftpos network. ""We are concerned that Mastercard's alleged conduct meant that businesses did not receive the full benefit of the increased competition that was intended to flow from the least cost routing initiative,"" ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said. ""Reducing costs for businesses enables them to offer their customers better prices. Making sure the major card schemes, Mastercard, Visa and eftpos, compete vigorously is important for both those businesses and their customers."" Global markets enjoyed a broad-based rally on Friday. Wall Street rallied on after the data, with all three major US stock indexes bringing a decisive end to their longest weekly losing streaks in decades. The US Federal Reserve, in minutes from its May meeting released earlier this week, called inflation a serious concern. A majority of the central bankers backed two half-a-percentage-point rate hikes in June and July, as the group attempts to curb inflation without causing a recession. The Fed did leave room for a pause in hikes if the economy weakens. The price of everything is increasing: from mortgages and rents, to coffee and petrol, to Netflix and chilling — we want to hear about your experience. Analysts said the consumer spending and inflation data was encouraging and supported growth estimates for the second quarter that are mostly above a 2.0 annualised rate. ""The growth engine of the US economy is still alive and kicking, and that's important,"" said Joe Quinlan, head of CIO Market Strategy for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank. ""Growth estimates for [the second quarter] are still good. There is a better tone in the market than we have seen in recent weeks, in terms of inflation possibly peaking here. Maybe we can avoid stagflation."" The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, was up 2.12 per cent. European shares hit a three-week high and rose 1.42 per cent. Britain's FTSE also hit a three-week high, and was heading for its best weekly showing since mid-March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 575.77 points, or 1.76 per cent, to 33,212.96, the S&P 500 gained 100.4 points, or 2.47 per cent, to 4,158.24 and the Nasdaq Composite added 390.48 points, or 3.33 per cent, to 12,131.13.

21,ASX edges higher as new Labor PM Albanese sworn in and global equity markets rebound,markets,"  ASX edges higher as new Labor PM Albanese sworn in and global equity markets rebound Australian shares have finished the day slightly higher, while Labor Party leader Anthony Albanese was sworn in as the country's 31st prime minister after nine years of rule by the conservative Coalition. ASX 200 closed up 0.1 per cent to 7,149. The All Ordinaries gained 8 points or 0.1 per cent to 7,399. Mr Albanese promised a ""journey of change"" as he vowed to tackle climate change, rising living costs and inequality. On the share market, miners climbed 0.8 per cent and touched a more-than-two-week high after iron ore prices surged on Friday. BHP Group, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group rose between 1.1 per cent and 2.8 per cent. Incitec Pivot was down 3.7 per cent after surging as much as 7.5 per cent when the fertiliser maker said it would spin off its explosives manufacturing and fertilisers businesses. Energy stocks added 0.3 per cent, benefiting from strong oil prices. Major oil and gas explorers Woodside and Santos gained 0.5 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively. Domestic technology stocks were up 0.4 per cent, despite Wall Street's weak finish last week. Block tumbled 2.4 per cent, while WiseTech Global gained 0.6 per cent. Financials shed 0.4 per cent, with Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group falling 0.1 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively. Among the top movers up were Codan (+14.5 per cent), Imugene (+12.5pc), Elders (+9.6 per cent) and A2 Milk (+3.5 per cent). The Australian dollar was also up, at 71.05 US cents at 04:27pm AEST. Global equity markets rebounded on Friday after the S&P 500 pared losses that briefly took it into bear market territory. China cut its prime rate for five-year loans, which influences mortgage prices, by 15 basis points in a reduction that was sharper than expected as authorities seek to cushion the impact of an economic slowdown. While a late-day rally on Friday stopped the S&P 500 from confirming a bear market, the gloom on Wall Street led the benchmark to fall for the seventh consecutive week, an event that has occurred only five times since 1928, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. How long the downdraft in equities lasts will depend on when inflation breaks, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""What really flummoxed investors this week, myself included, is when you have the types of companies that typically do well in economic softness, do terribly,"" Mr Tuz said, referring to poor earnings results at Walmart and Target. The S&P 500 closed up 0.01 per cent after being down 2.27 per cent at one point or below the level would confirm a bear market — a 20 per cent decline from its January 3 record closing high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.03 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite already in bear territory, fell 0.3 per cent. Equity valuations need to come down and the expected return on investments, the discount rate, needs to go up, said Stephen Auth, chief investment officer of equities at Federated Hermes. ""The market is starting to digest the idea that this might be a new world where the discount rate on risk assets is not zero anymore,"" Mr Auth said. ""You're seeing all these different areas of the market get pounded at the same time and it's just been very unsettling for investors,"" he added. MSCI's gauge of stocks in 47 countries closed up 0.37 per cent, but still fell for the seventh consecutive week, its longest losing streak since the index was launched in 1990. Earlier in Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 index rose 0.73 per cent. US Treasury yields fell for a third straight session on concerns about growth prospects. The yield on benchmark 10-year notes fell 6.5 basis points, to 2.79 per cent. Gold edged up, heading for its first week of gains in five weeks on persistent worries over economic growth and the dollar's decline over the week. Oil prices steadied, on course for little change for the week as a planned European Union ban on Russian oil balanced concerns that slowing economic growth would hurt demand. Brent crude oil was up, trading at $US112.91 a barrel, by 10:36am AEST.

22,China's third largest developer just defaulted — and the worst may be yet to come,markets,"  Chinese developer Sunac defaults as Beijing struggles to save the trillion-dollar sector About a year ago, Chinese billionaire Sun Hongbin was certain that his luxury real estate company Sunac China would never ""bomb"". Last week, his firm — China's third-largest developer — defaulted, missing the deadline for coupon payments on a $US742 million ($1.1 billion) offshore bond. Unlike Evergrande, which defaulted in December last year, Sunac appeared to be financially healthy and the boss, Mr Sun, had previously been diligent in repaying debts. He even repaid some of the company's debt out of his own pocket, Chinese media reported. Betty Wang, senior China economist from ANZ Research, said Sunac's default was ""another blow to the fragile property sector"". ""The shock to the market confidence, especially in the private sector segment, was quite big,"" she told the ABC. ""If people regarded Evergrande as an extreme case, it should not be happening to many other developers, especially those with relatively healthy financial performance. ""There are a lot of downside risks in the economy."" While the Hong Kong-listed company has apologised for the default, it said it could miss more deadlines in the coming year. ""Given the group's current liquidity constraints, there is no assurance that the group will be able to meet its financial obligations when due or within the relevant grace periods,"" the company said in a statement. The company also asked the creditors to give it some ""time to overcome challenges"" while it makes efforts towards ""accelerating sales and payment collection, disposing of assets, seeking debt extension, and introducing strategic investors"". Mr Sun is widely known as a ""white knight"" in the Chinese property market, who has been actively acquiring assets from his competitors in the past five years while the property market was cooling. He made it to China's 200-richest list when he was 40. In 2016, at the age of 53, his company became one of the top 10 developers in China through a rapid business expansion. Now Sunac is one of the most indebted Chinese developers, with $US7.7 billion ($11 billion) in US dollar bonds. ""My dream is to build time-honoured and high-quality products that can pass on for generations, and keep Sunac steady, calm and long-lasting,"" Mr Sun said on his company's website. After Beijing implemented the ""three red lines"" scheme — in order to reduce debt within the industry, curb runaway property prices and lift construction standards — a wave of defaults has hit the sector. China's biggest developer, Evergrande, is reeling under more than $400 billion in liabilities. It is a chaotic week for the world's most indebted property developer, with about $2.8 billion seized by banks and shares suspended from trading. Other companies — such as Fantasia and Kaisa — have also defaulted after having struggled for access to finance or refinancing. Since November last year, several policy adjustments at both state and local levels have been introduced in an attempt to salvage the collapsing property sector, while avoiding complete bailouts. Last week, China's central bank, the PBoC, announced that it would lower the mortgage rate for first home buyers for the first time in eight years, by 20 basis points. However, Ms Wang said, Sunac's default shows that the rescue policies have failed to prevent China's real estate sector from declining further. ""Policy adjustments in the past few months do not appear to have been timely enough to improve the financial conditions of developers, and demand is far from recovery,"" she said. ""Uncertainty surrounding lockdowns and their impact on the local economy have dampened the income outlook for households and constrained their purchasing power."" On Friday, the PBoC cut the five-year loan prime rate (LPR), the benchmark for pricing most mortgages, from 4.60 per cent to 4.45 per cent to drive housing demand, while kept the one-year LPR unchanged, at 3.70 per cent. Senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard from Capital Economics said the cut was the largest reduction on record, but the lack of any reduction to the one-year LPR suggested that the central bank was trying to keep easing targeted. ""We shouldn’t expect large-scale stimulus of the kind that we saw in 2020,"" he said in a note. ""The PBoC is showing greater restraint in its efforts to support the rest of the economy."" However, the worst may be yet to come, as Chinese developers are facing another peak in offshore bond repayments in June and July. ANZ Research estimates that $US14.3 billion ($20.3 billion) of offshore bond debt, or 25 per cent of this year's annual amount, will be due in the next two months. Sluggish home sales — which have been hit by strict COVID-19 lockdowns in parts of the country — have worsened the situation. Once a symbol of glittering success, China's biggest property group is tanking, dragging many of its competitors with it, writes Ian Verrender. The top-30 listed developers in China reported an 11.1 per cent, year-on-year contraction in their collective cash position as at the end of 2021 and, since January, sales have dropped 32.2 per cent, year-on-year, according to ANZ Research. Contractual home sales from China's top-100 developers halved in April, meaning the estimated monthly operating income of $US5.7 billion ($8.1 billion) will not be enough to cover debt payments. China's property sector contributes more than 20 per cent of China's economic output by some metrics, and Ms Wang said dampening across the whole sector would increase uncertainty for China's growth outlook. ""A fiscal push and the infrastructure drive have picked up and may go some way to filling the gap if the property sector retreats, "" she said. ""This would come at the cost of more leveraging and front-loading of China's growth potential. ""We expect China's potential growth to drop to the low end of the 4-5 per cent range in the next few years, much earlier than many others expect."" NAB also has downgraded China's GDP growth prospects, expecting China’s economy to grow by 4.2 per cent in 2022, down from 5 per cent forecast previously. As Beijing has indicated that it would not bail out private developers, many firms are betting on a rebound in the sector sooner rather than later. ""The fall of another top developer is likely to accelerate the process of industry revaluation, putting the sector's future at risk,"" Ms Wang said. ""The market capitalisation of some of the top-30 listed real estate companies has shrunk as much as 80 per cent since the first half of 2021. ""We remain cautious about the near-term outlook for private developers.""

The ASX 200 opened higher and, by 11am AEST, it was up 1.4 per cent, to 7,039. And the All Ords was up a similar amount. That positive mood continued, with the ASX 200 eventually finished up 1.9per cent, at 7,075. The All Ords was up even more, at 2 per cent, helping it regain the heavy losses it had during the week. All the major sectors were in the green. The top-performing stocks were Life360 (+13.4 per cent) and Polynovo (+12.7 per cent). However, over the past five days, the benchmark has still lost 1.81 per cent. The Dow Jones closed 0.3 per cent down, while the S&P 500 was 0.1 per cent lower. However, the Dow Jones had recovered some losses during late trade. The Nasdaq was marginally up, by 0.1 per cent. That's after the tech sector has suffered heavy losses off the back of higher-than-expected inflation data out of the US. Crypto is still struggling, but Bitcoin has recovered a slice of what it lost yesterday. By 4:30pm, it was back above the benchmark $US30,000. The devastating effects of the crash of crypto ""stablecoins"" Terra and Luna are being felt by many but their crash may have been orchestrated in one massive piece of ethically questionable trading. This is as investors say that people are putting their cash back into the safe haven of the American currency. The Australian currency was also down. As the ANZ noted this morning: ""The AUD is firmly below 69 US cents as global equities resumed their decline overnight. Pressure remains to the downside for the AUD."" Meanwhile, there's speculation that Europe will soon increase rates. Inflation is also a problem in countries there, with the shortage of gas especially putting pressure on economies. ""In Europe, we have recently revised up our inflation forecasts and anticipate the [European Central Bank] will hike rates in July,"" ANZ noted.

24,"Shares sink as bitcoin tanks, investors flee to safe haven US dollar",markets,"  Surging prices rattle markets and tech stocks, while Bitcoin tanks to below $US27,000 Surging prices — and the possibility of looming interest rate hikes — are rattling global markets and tech stocks, while the price of Bitcoin has tanked to below $US27,000 ($39,000). The Australian share market is tracking this global sentiment. At 1pm AEDT, the ASX 200 was down 1.1 per cent. The All Ords had lost similar. By end of the day, it was even further down. The ASX 200 closed 1.75 per cent down at 6,941 points. That was a 50-day low. The worst-performing stocks included Altium (-16.6pc) and Xero (-13.2pc). Overall, the All Ords also lost 1.9 per cent. This equates to $46 billion being wiped out in a day. Tech stocks were the worst-performing with the sector down 8.9 per cent overall. That followed the trajectory of the Nasdaq in the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq dived 3 per cent in the US on Wednesday (local time) as the latest inflation data there was released. It showed the cost of everyday necessities, including food and housing, is still rising in the United States, with inflation there now sitting at 8.3 per cent annually. Further interest rate hikes are now being tipped, after the data for April showed that inflation in the US was not slowing as quickly as many experts were anticipating. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 lost 1 per cent and 1.6 per cent, respectively. The tech losses are being replicated in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has fallen sharply again this week. It's lost more than a third of its price in a week, diving from above $US40,000 to less than $US27,000 by 4:30pm AEST. This latest crash prompted the founder of one of the largest holders of Bitcoin to post a photo of himself working at McDonald's. The Australian dollar also hit a low of 68.80 US cents. City Index senior market analyst Tony Sycamore said it appeared cash was being put into the ""haven"" of the American greenback. ""The DXY index just retouched cycle highs at 94.18. The dollar is king!"" ""US 10-year yields are trading at 2.87 per cent after trading as high as 3.20 per cent three days ago."" In April, data showed the CPI rose by 0.3 in the US. The rise came even with a big decrease in the price of fuel, and surpassed many economists' predictions. This puts the annual US inflation rate at 8.3 per cent. While these rates did surprise markets, they still show the surge in price hikes is starting to calm down from earlier this year. The April rise was significantly below the 1.2 per cent increase in March, when fuel prices were hitting global economies. Increases in the cost of housing, food, airline tickets and new cars were some of the biggest factors behind the April price rises. Prices — or core inflation — are rising at their highest rate in three decades in the United States. Here's why and what it could mean for Australia. After taking out fluctuations in food and fuel, the so-called core inflation rate was also still higher than expected, at 6.2 per cent. The food index rose 9.4 per cent, which is the largest annual increase since April 1981. Inflation without matching wage growth means people are essentially going backwards. ""Risks remain that persistently high inflation will feed through into inflation expectations and become more entrenched,"" City Index senior market analyst Tony Sycamore said. ""This increases the possibility that the US Federal Reserve will be forced to unleash more aggressive tightening measures, including an inflation busting 75bp rate hike. ""That may push the economy into a recession."" Price hikes have also been a problem in Australia, too, and were one of the reasons the Reserve Bank here gave for rising interest rates this month for the first time in 11 years. Globally, inflation has emerged as a problem as economies emerge from COVID lockdowns. Demand for goods rising as economies recover is part of the problem, but it's also due to supply chain woes globally, the war in Ukraine, rising petrol prices and other factors. The US Federal Reserve has already been hiking rates there to control inflation. Analysts from local firm State Street Global Advisors agree that the global economy is in a precarious position, as regulators globally try to ensure smooth transitions out of the COVID era. ""The global economic environment has become considerably more precarious following Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"" they said. ""This powerful stagflationary shock worsens the monetary policy trade-off for nearly every central bank, with the prospect of slower growth colliding with sharply higher inflation. ""We can't help but feel some nervousness around what may turn out to be excessively aggressive market pricing for rate hikes. ""We are concerned about a boom-bust scenario brought about by tightening that could prove to be too much, too late."" Meanwhile, this morning the price of Brent crude oil was up again, almost 5 per cent, to US$107.48. The dollar in your pocket doesn't go as far when you're buying something made overseas. And, with the Aussie dollar falling against the greenback, that's bad news for inflation. That rising fuel price was after the WHO said China's zero-COVID policy was unsustainable. Lockdowns in Shanghai have been one of the reasons behind the falling oil price, as it was reducing demand. This morning, ANZ noted that these lockdowns would remain a weight on the Australian currency. ""Concerns about China's strict lockdowns and their economic impacts will likely remain a weight on AUD in the near term,"" ANZ notes. ""China's accommodative policies suggest AUD can rebound rapidly once the lockdowns are relaxed.""

25,Consumer confidence plunges to lockdown levels while Australians prepare for the polls,markets,"  Consumer confidence plunges to lockdown levels while Australians prepare for the polls Australians' confidence in the economy and their own financial situation has plunged to lockdown levels, just weeks before an election that is being fought on the rising cost of living. Here in Australia and globally,  markets are considering rate hikes, inflation, war and supply chain woes. The latest consumer confidence data from Westpac shows it is down 5.6 per cent to 90.4 points in May. That is the measure's lowest level since August 2020, when COVID lockdowns were hitting Victoria. Westpac's rolling data is based on surveys with 1,200 people. Its data for May was conducted just as the Reserve Bank announced the first interest rate rise in 11 years and inflation data showed prices are surging. ""Two stunning developments are clearly unnerving consumers,"" Westpac noted. The data showed specific concerns from people about their household finances. ""The prospect of rising interest rates is clearly weighing on respondents despite the prospect of higher bank deposit rates,"" Westpac noted. Despite this, it found spending is bouncing back from COVID lockdowns. The survey results come less than 2 weeks before a federal election that is being fought on the rising cost of living. The Australian share market was also in a dour mood on Wednesday that only improved in late-day trade. The Reserve Bank wants you to believe it has inflation under control. Gareth Hutchens asks: ""Do you believe it?"" At 12pm AEST, the ASX 200 was down 0.2 per cent. That took the benchmark to a 50-day low. But it recovered and actually finished up 0.2 per cent to 7,065 points. The top-performing stocks were Lifestyle (+16pc) and Life360 (+6.5pc). The All Ordinaries also ended up 0.3 per cent after trading mostly in the red all day. Super manager Magellan was up 0.8 per cent after appointing David George as chief executive and managing director. Mr George most recently held the role of deputy chief investment officer at the Future Fund, where he oversaw an asset base of about $170 billion. Losers included Link, which dived 15 per cent. The company told media it was not aware why this significant move was happening. Graincorp was down 0.9 per cent, even after the key food company posted a 50 per cent increase in revenue. The ASX-listed company says it's doing better due to better planting conditions for crops, along with higher demand for grain amid tightening supply globally. The supply of grain has been hit by the war in Ukraine, for instance. The Australian share market's volatility down came as markets globally mulled a maelstrom of factors, including war, inflation, rate hikes and supply-chain woes. Wall Street also had volatile trade on Tuesday (local time) but the end losses were less significant. The Dow Jones closed 0.3 per cent down, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both recovered some losses, with 0.3 and 1 per cent gains respectively. The Dow dipped as the market prepared for inflation data to be released tonight (Australian time). The RBA doesn't want to raise interest rates — at least not to anywhere near the levels many now believe are inevitable — writes business editor Ian Verrender. European markets also recovered some losses, with the DAX up 1.2 per cent. Meanwhile, the price of oil is down again, with it now below $US100 a barrel for Brent. The fall comes amid concerns about continued lockdowns in China, which could ease demand. Bitcoin is also taking another battering. It has lost about $US10,000 ($14,418) in a week. That is a quarter of its value, which takes the leading cryptocurrency to $US31,000. The last round of inflation data in the US showed another surge in prices. Headline inflation is sitting at 8.5 per cent, with the March data showing it is now at its highest level since December 1981. That is being led by surges in energy prices, including oil, and even on food. It is a similar story here in Australia, however, our headline inflation is lower at about 5 per cent. Even without the spikes, the US core inflation is still at about 6.5 per cent. Analysts are tipping that the US data for April will show the situation is calming down, however, that is not a broad consensus. ""The consensus of US economists expect headline inflation to decelerate significantly from 1.2 per cent/month in March to only 0.2 per cent/month in April because retail petrol prices have stabilised,"" ANZ analysts wrote. ""But core inflation is expected to step up slightly from 0.3 per cent/month in March to 0.4 per cent/month in April."" Higher-than-expected inflation could mean another interest rate hike. Currently, the yield on 10-year treasury notes is slightly down on yesterday, below 3 per cent, showing the market is not expecting a rate hike as much.

26,"$25 billion wiped off Australian share market as 'war, inflation, rate hikes' hit global markets",markets,"  Australian share market suffers $25 billion loss as 'war, inflation, rate hikes' hit global markets The Australian share market has lost $25 billion as it follows Wall Street lower on concerns about rate hikes triggering a global economic slowdown. The All Ordinaries index opened down 2.6 per cent. That worked out to a loss of $64 billion in value from the previous close. The benchmark ASX 200 was also down 2.4 per cent on open. A loss of more than 2 per cent is generally considered a significant move. The All Ords had pared back some losses and closed down 1 per cent. That still worked out to a market loss of around $25 billion. The ASX 200 closed down 1 per cent to 7,051. Tony Sycamore, senior market analyst from City Index, noted that there was ""a massive volume"" going through ASX 200 futures this morning. The main losers on the ASX 200 included AUB Group (-9.9pc), Block (-8.5pc), Chalice (-6.7pc), Paladin (-4.8pc) and Ramelius (-3.4pc). Oil stocks were also down, including Paladin and Beach, as the price of crude dropped overnight. Market analyst Clifford Bennett said this drop ""has been building for several months"". ""The reasons for it have been around for a while,"" he said in a briefing note. ""The fundamentals of war, inflation, rate hikes and supply-chain disruption are all individually significant headwinds. ""When combined, equity markets have no way through."" Among the top movers were Polynovo (+15.6pc), Pendal Group (+8.1pc) and Life360 (+5.8pc). Business conditions continued to strengthen in April, while confidence eased but remained above its long-run average, NAB Monthly Business Survey finds. The gains came on the back of a long-awaited recovery in the recreation and personal services sector, where conditions rose 20pts. Both confidence and conditions now look fairly strong across most industries, with the exception of transport and utilities and construction, where cost pressures have been most acute. ""Conditions in most industries now look fairly strong although conditions in construction and in transport and utilities are being held down by negative levels on the profitability index, a sign that cost pressures could be beginning to take a toll on margins,"" said NAB Group chief economist Alan Oster. ""Across the states, there was a large improvement in Queensland, and New South Wales and South Australia also made gains, although conditions in Victoria eased. ""Still, conditions are fairly strong across the board."" This follows sharp losses on Wall Street overnight, as concerns there about interest rate hikes triggering a general economic downturn weighed on stocks, especially technology. The S&P 500 had a particularly bad run, dropping below 4,000 points during its first day of trade for the week, which is the first time it's done that since March 2021. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones lost 650 points, or 2 per cent, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fared worse with losses of 3.2 and 3.4 per cent respectively. That is happening as analysts predict more rate hikes in the US, and the nation awaits its next round of inflation data. US inflation has been soaring and rate hikes are generally seen as one way to control price hikes. It was one of the main motivations for the Reserve Bank of Australia also rising rates for the first time in 11 years last week, earlier than previous forecasts. Inflation data is out again later this week in the United States. Depending on whether it is still rising significantly, the US federal reserve may seek to continue hiking rates. ""We don't normally pay too much attention to short-term market movements, but there's some concern brewing in markets that we might be on the cusp of a significant event,"" market analyst Peter Esho said in a briefing note today. ""Ultimately our view is that each and every time the US Federal Reserve seeks to raise rates, the economy and growth will break and send us back to square one. ""The most vulnerable sectors of the economy are at risk, tech for example is already breaking with lay-offs being announced by the hour."" ""We now need to watch out for contagion events. ""The markets are more intertwined than 2008. Leverage is everywhere including crypto markets, which are off grid. The risk is in the unknown."" Ten-year US Treasury yields were around 3 per cent. They had gotten higher, towards 3.4 per cent earlier in trade, but pared back. This is generally seen as the market predicting interest rate rises. Tech stocks suffered big losses in the United States, including Facebook's owner Meta, Google's parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Netflix, all with losses above 2.8 per cent. Energy stocks were also down on a lower oil price. European markets also closed in the red, with travel and tech stocks leading losses. The price of oil is also down 6.5 per cent, to US$105.05, as concerns about lockdowns in China continue. China is one of the world's biggest oil consumers. Saudi Arabia has also cut prices for buyers in Asia. ""Sentiment in the oil market will be dictated by negotiations with EU on a proposal to ban Russian oil,"" ANZ noted. ""Any sign of unity in enacting sanctions before the end of year should see oil prices react positively."" Meanwhile, the Australian currency was under 70 US cents. ""With a high correlation to global equities currently, pressure on the AUD is likely to persist,"" ANZ added.

27,"ASX slides, Westpac jumps after dividend improves and expenses forecast to fall",markets,"  ASX slides, Westpac jumps after dividend improves and expenses forecast to fall Australian shares have fallen, dragged lower by mining stocks, with investors globally maintaining a cautious stance over rate-hike worries and as tightening COVID-19 restrictions in Shanghai fuelled concerns about a possible recession. Chinese authorities reinforced the lockdown in Shanghai they imposed more than a month ago as part of their tough COVID-19 response policy that has hit economic activity. On the domestic bourse, ASX 200 closed down 85 points, or 1.2 per cent, to 7,121, with the real estate, technology and materials sectors leading the losses. The Australian dollar dropped below 70 US cents for the first time since January. Miners tracked lower iron ore prices and slumped 2.5 per cent. Sector heavyweights BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group were down between 1.3 per cent and 5.8 per cent. Financials lost 0.3 per cent while Westpac gained 3.2 per cent, to $24.60, after reporting a $3.1 billion cash profit for the first half. The bank said continued margin pressure from competition in mortgage lending caused its first-half earnings to drop more than 12 per cent from a year ago, but it forecast lower expenses in the second half of the year, with its cost-reset plan in full swing. The company also declared an interim dividend of 61 cents per share, compared with 58 cents last year. Suncorp dropped 0.3 per cent to $11.28 after reporting an $803 million growth in its home-lending portfolio in the March quarter. Shares of Magellan plunged 8.4 per cent on news about selling its shares in takeaway fast food chain Guzman y Gomez (GYG) for a cash consideration of $140 million. Technology stocks, which slumped 3.2 per cent, were the top-percentage losers in the benchmark, while gold stocks dropped 3.4 per cent. Domestic energy stocks were up 0.5 per cent after crude prices rose last week on supply concerns. Among the worst performers were Nvonix (-12.3pc), Imugege (-11.1pc), News Corp (-8.3pc), Block (-6.2pc) and Telix Pharmaceuticals (-7.3pc). On the flip side, Domino's Pizza climbed 2 per cent, CSL gained 0.8 per cent while Polynovo advanced 3.3 per cent. Trade was volatile on Wall Street on Friday. The major indices rose briefly into the green and the Nasdaq fell as much as 2.7 per cent. Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 posted their fifth-straight week of declines, and the Dow its sixth. It was the longest losing streak for the S&P 500 since mid-2011 and, for the Nasdaq, since late 2012. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent, the S&P 500 lost 0.6 per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.4 per cent. ""The market is focused on the Fed being behind the curve and that's why the market is down,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist and co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services. Fed funds futures priced in a roughly 75 per cent chance of a 75-basis-point interest rate hike at next month's Fed policy meeting, even after Fed chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the US central bank was not considering such a move. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 1.9 per cent, as regional shares chalked up their worst week in two months. MSCI's gauge of global equity performance shed 1 per cent, and emerging market stocks lost 2.6 per cent.

28,"Fed raises official rates by 50 basis points, ASX gains",markets,"  Federal Reserve hikes official interest rates by 0.5 per cent, ASX rises, Dow Jones jumps 900  points The US central bank has increased official US interest rates by an expected 0.5 per cent to curb the biggest price rises seen in 40 years. In an unanimous decision, the US Federal Reserve has lifted the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a new target range of 0.75 per cent to 1 per cent, the biggest increase in 22 years. Despite a slowdown in the US economy over the first few months of the year, the Fed's policy setting committee said that household spending and business investment remained strong, although it noted inflation was high because of the war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 lockdowns in China. Consumer prices surged by 8.5 per cent over the past year, and in March, the US central bank lifted rates by 0.25 per cent, its first rate rise since 2018. ""Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially,"" the Fed said. ""Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices and broader price pressures."" At his first face to face press conference in two years, Mr Powell played down the prospect of a 0.75 per cent rate hike. However, he said more 0.5 per cent increases were likely at the next two meetings. ""Inflation is much too high and we understand the hardship it is causing, and we're moving expeditiously to bring it back down,"" Mr Powell said. ""My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing and transportation."" Renowned investor says the failure of central banks to move interest rates higher, sooner, will lead to recession and an implosion in asset prices. The move saw the greenback fall to a one-week low of 102.48 on the US dollar index. Global investor Mohamed El-Erian tweeted that the Fed should have raised rates sooner, and the ""too exuberant"" rally on the US stock market after Mr Powell all but ruled out a 75-basis-point rise, was not justified. ""One big issue is that the #FederalReserve is already very late in responding,"" he said. And Charles Schwab chief investment strategist Liz Anne Sonders warned about the risk of a recession in North America from higher interest rates. ""Although the Fed addressed the contraction in the economy in the first quarter, it focused more on the strong gains in final sales to households and businesses,"" Ms Sonders wrote in an investment note. ""For what it's worth, we believe the risk of recession is elevated and should not be dismissed."" The US central bank said its $US9 trillion ($12.4 trillion) worth of bonds would be allowed to decline by $US47.5 billion a month in June, July and August. The bonds will be allowed to mature and roll off the Fed's balance sheet, rather than being sold into the market by the Fed. The Australian dollar jumped by more than 2 per cent, to 72.66 US cents overnight, as the greenback fell to a one-week low. At 4pm AEST, the local currency had dropped 0.3 per cent to about 72.39 US cents. Spot gold, which is seen as a hedge against inflation, rose 1 per cent to about $US1,900 an ounce in Asian trade. Brent crude oil jumped more than $US5 a barrel overnight, or around 5 per cent, to $US110.35, as the European Union moved closer to banning Russian oil imports by year's end. At 4pm AEST, Brent crude was up another 1 per cent to $US111.22 a barrel. National Australia Bank saw net profit for the six months to the end of March rise 10.7 per cent, to $3.55 billion, thanks to higher revenue from the economic recovery and strong demand for home loans. Cash earnings, the bank's preferred measure of profit, rose 4.1 per cent from the same time a year ago, to $3.48 billion. It said it benefited from strong growth in lending (+10 per cent) and deposits (+12 per cent) over the half year. However, net interest margin, the profit margin from lending, fell 11 basis points because of tough competition for loans, partly offset by lower deposit and finance costs. Expenses rose and the bank said an agreement with financial crimes regulator AUSTRAC for breaches of anti-money-laundering laws would cost the bank $120 million per year until the 2024 financial year. NAB's interim dividend was 73 cents per share, fully franked, up 13 cents a share on the interim dividend a year ago. The bank's chief executive, Ross McEwan, said he was pleased with NAB's performance, although the bank had ""alot more to do"" to deliver for customers. ""We are growing right across the bank. We are growing business lending, home lending, unsecured lending, deposits and transaction accounts,"" Mr McEwan said. ""We are delivering better results because we are delivering for our customers and getting the basics right more consistently."" Mr McEwan told the World Today program that borrowers should speak up if they were feeling under pressure because of the rise in official interest rates, which has been passed on in full by the Reserve Bank. ""The big thing, for me with customers, if they are having difficulty please ring their bank,"" Mr McEwan said. ""Talk to us, so we can make adjustments for them."" ""But we anticipate that customers will be able to absorb the next few rises."" He said the bank had not seen calls from customers yet who were in difficulty because of the rate increase, and dodged a question about whether the bank would foreclose on a borrower who defaulted on their loan. NAB shares fell nearly 4 per cent in early trade. By the close, the shares had come off their lows and fell 0.6 per cent to $32.25. After three days of losses, the Australian market ended higher following an exuberant night on Wall Street. Aside from the banks, nearly all industry sectors were higher, with tech stocks, energy and miners leading the way. The All Ordinaries index gained 1 per cent to 7,639, while the ASX 200 index put on 0.8 per cent to 7,365. ANZ fell 1.7 per cent following yesterday's profit results, NAB lost 0.6 per cent, Westpac fell 0.25 per cent, and the Commonwealth Bank (+0.7 per cent) reversed course. AMP (+1.7 per cent) swung from loss to gain, as investors withdrew $1.3 billion from its investment funds over the March quarter because of market uncertainty over the war in Ukraine. However, AMP told investors to brace for a ""one-off impact"" when a contract to provide corporate superannuation for retailer Woolworths ended in early 2023,  with the supermarket giant expected to pull out $4 billion from AMP funds. The company's outflows were down from $2 billion for the first few months of 2021. Meanwhile, the best performers on the ASX 200 index were nickel miner Liontown Resources (+7.7 per cent), lithium miner Pilbara Minerals (+7.6 per cent), and concrete maker Adbri (+7.1 per cent). The worst performers were global investment company Janus Henderson (-13 per cent), app firm Lifes360 (-1.9 per cent) and infection control company Nanosonics (-1.9 per cent). Rio Tinto held its Australian annual general meeting and said nearly 16 per cent of votes cast were against its climate policy. Big miners gained on a rise in iron ore prices after China's central bank pledged more support for businesses hit by COVID-19 lockdowns. BHP  put on 0.1 per cent, Fortescue Metals rose 3.5 per cent, and Rio Tinto climbed 0.4 per cent. Australia's largest airline, Qantas, says it will buy the 80 per cent of Alliance Aviation that it does not already own, for $614 million. Allliance provides charter flights for workers in the mining industry. The takeover needs to be approved by the competition regulator. Qantas shares fell 0.35 per cent to $5.65, while Alliance Aviation surged 21 per cent to $4.25. Permits to build new homes fell by 18.5 per cent from February to March, on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to the Bureau of Statistics. And the trade balance improved by nearly $2 billion — to a $9.3 billion surplus — as imports fell during March. Stocks on Wall Street surged as investors bet on the US central bank slowing inflation without causing a recession. They were heartened by Mr Powell ruling out a 75-basis-point increase in the federal funds rate. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones index jumped 2.8 per cent, to 34,061, the S&P 500 index rose nearly 3 per cent, to 4,300, and the Nasdaq rose 3.2 per cent, to 12,965. It was the biggest gain in two years for the Dow and the S&P indices. Shares in ride-share firm Lyft fell by one third on concerns about the company's customer levels and spending. That was despite first-quarter revenue rising by 44 per cent, to $US875 million. In Europe, major markets ended in the red thanks to lacklustre earnings. The FTSE 100 in London fell by 0.9 per cent, to 7,494, the DAX in Germany lost 0.5 per cent, to 13,971, and the CAC 40 in Paris dropped 1.2 per cent, to 6,396.

29,Newspaper publishers plead for aid as paper price surges more than 80 per cent,markets,"  Regional newspaper publishers ask for government support as paper costs surge Empty offices, further journalist job losses, and even fewer sources of local news — that's what communities face without an emergency injection of funds by the government, according to regional newspaper owners. Australian Community Media (ACM), the country's largest regional news publisher, is leading a Country Press Australia (CPA) campaign for an immediate cash injection to compensate for an increase in the cost of printing newspapers of up to 80 per cent. The CPA has also called for ongoing support in the form of tax incentives and rebates for newspaper advertisers and a mandated minimum amount spent by government on advertising in regional newspapers. However, one publisher has broken ranks with other newspaper owners, declaring the newspaper business is still profitable and businesses should not be propped up by government. The headline ""Your paper in peril"" has been splashed across the front page of ACM newspapers including the Ballarat Courier, Bendigo Advertiser, and Warrnambool Standard. This was while the CPA, which represents 330 regional newspapers, met with federal Communications Minister Paul Fletcher and opposition communications spokesperson Michelle Rowland. ACM editorial director Rod Quinn said the threat to smaller regional mastheads was real. ""It's an issue that's very serious,"" Mr Quinn said. ""Few businesses could survive an 80 per cent increase in raw materials. A total of 53 submissions are presented to a parliamentary inquiry suggesting ways to help save local newspapers. ""For the larger daily papers it's one thing. But it is most acute for the smaller, most marginal papers. ""There are some levers we can use — cover price, how many pages you print, even publishing frequencies. ""At the end of the day we love publishing newspapers, but after challenge after challenge we need government and politicians to listen. ""We're not talking about an academic problem, we're not talking about something that might happen in some time, we're not talking about anything 'airy fairy'. We're talking about something that will hit in weeks."" ACM suspended dozens of regional newspapers across Australia in 2020. It led to a $50 million funding announcement from the federal government to support media organisations. Meanwhile, News Corp announced a 13.6 per cent price rise for its daily newspapers in January. Norwegian-owned Norske Skog is the only manufacturer of newsprint and magazine-grade paper in Australia. A spokesman for the manufacturer said paper prices varied widely depending on whether a masthead had a contract or whether they bought on the spot market. ""Underlying market conditions including COVID, the war in Ukraine, rising power prices in Europe, and global shipping issues have all impacted [prices] more than anticipated,"" the spokesman said. Norske Skog encouraged publishers to seek contracts, buy Australian product, and ""not play the global spot market"". ""Recently we have closed two newsprint mills in Australasia due to the decline in demand that has seen the market reduce from 1.3 million tonnes per annum to less than 300,000 tonnes,"" the Tasmanian-based manufacturer said, highlighting its own cost pressures. Pyrenees Advocate and Ararat Advocate publisher Craig Wilson said he had not heard about an 80 per cent spike in newsprint prices but was told of an increase between 30-50 per cent. He said while that would drive up costs, newspapers could still make money without government subsidies. ""The newspaper business is still profitable, it's not like there is no money coming through the door. It's not like there's no advertising,"" Mr Wilson insisted. ""No businesses should really be propped up all the time by government."" Mr Wilson said if he can ""make a buck"" with two small newspapers, bigger publications should be ""chugging along reasonably well"". ""One thing [the government] could do in this part of Victoria, for example, is open up a [printing] press site,"" he said. ""We've all had to go elsewhere to be printed because there just isn't a press site with any capacity that can actually take on our work. ""We've had to find someone to drive to Wodonga from Ararat every week to go pick up a big car-load of newspapers. It's a really awkward situation."" Mr Wilson said it cost about $2,500 to print 3,600 copies of the Ararat Advocate and Pyrenees Advocate each week. ""The paper component of that is only about 20 to 30 per cent,"" he said. Regional newspapers already received $50 million from the federal government through its public interest news gathering fund, along with support in the form of the JobKeeper allowance during the pandemic. Mr Quinn said government support during the pandemic was appreciated but increasing costs meant hard decisions would have to be made within weeks if there was no further support. Across Australia, where newspapers have closed or gone online, some have taken their place. But many regional areas are missing out. He said the losers would be smaller communities. ""Between PING (the Public Interest News Gathering fund) and JobKeeper, it saved our business during COVID, but you can't keep taking hits of this magnitude,"" Mr Quinn said. ""It's all about community good. We know what these papers mean for these markets. We know they are part of the community fabric. ""We know, when we've had to go through very difficult times in recent years, when those papers are not there, even temporarily, the community reacts. ""I don't think there would be anyone who would argue that newspapers don't contribute to democracy. We are seeing increasing news deserts around the country, and do we really want to see a situation where some of these communities are without their paper and without their local jobs? ""Our readership online is building and there is no secret about the trends of digital around newsprint versus digital over time, but there is still a very loyal following for our printed papers.""

30,"ANZ half-year profit jumps, while Westpac tips outsized June rate rise; ASX loses ground",markets,"  ANZ half-year profit jumps; ASX loses ground after Wall Street makes modest gains ANZ has seen half-year net profit surge, the ASX has fallen, while the US Federal Reserve is set to raise US interest rates again at this week's meeting. ANZ said after tax profit for the six months to the end of March increased by 20 per cent from the same time last year, to $3.5 billion. Cash profit, the bank's preferred measure rose 4 per cent to $3.1 billion. Investors will get a dividend payout of 72 cents a share for the half, fully-franked. ANZ chief executive officer Shayne Elliott said it was an important half year for the overhaul of the bank's business. ""The introduction of our new retail banking platform in Australia, ANZ Plus, designed and built by our own teams using the world's best technology, was a key milestone,"" he said. ""While still in soft launch, the first 'savings and transact' product on ANZ Plus, a proposition focused on helping customers better manage their financial wellbeing, is tracking well and will become the core deposit and transaction product offered to new customers."" Mr Elliott also acknowledged the rise in interest rates was ""going to hurt some people."" ""But at this point, people are well prepared for it."" National Australia Bank has joined the other big banks in passing on the Reserve Bank's 25 basis point interest rate rise in full, and the US Federal Reserve is set to raise US interest rates again at this week's meeting. NAB said borrowing costs on variable rate mortgages would rise by a quarter of a percentage point. It has also lifted rates on some savings accounts. The changes will start from May 13. The Reserve Bank raised the official cash rate by 25 basis points to 0.35 per cent yesterday to rein in spiralling prices. It forecast that underlying inflation could reach 4.75 per cent by the end of the year and the official cash rate could reach 2.5 per cent to curb rampant price rises. Within hours, the Commonwealth Bank, ANZ and Westpac, announced they would be passing on the rate increase in full to mortgage borrowers. The next official rate rise is expected next month with Westpac chief economist Bill Evans predicting the central bank could move by 40 basis points (0.4 per cent), as opposed to the standard 25 basis points (0.25 per cent). ""We have chosen 40 basis points rather than 50 basis points  purely because we expect that ""business as usual"" is increments of 25 basis points on a base of multiples of 25 basis points (in line with the practices of most other central banks),"" Mr Evans said in an economic note. ""We continue to disagree with the Board's base case and the market's expectation that the tightening cycle will extend into the second half of 2023."" The Australian dollar was up 0.2 per cent at 4:45pm AEST to 71.07 US cents. Oil prices rose during the day after falling overnight with Brent crude up 1.2 per cent to $US106.27 a barrel, while spot gold fell almost 0.2 per cent to $US1864.68 an ounce. The local share market gained ground in early trade boosted by the banks, but the gains faded over lunchtime. By the close, the All Ordinaries index finished down 0.3 per cent to 7,565, and the ASX 200 fell nearly 0.2 per cent to 7,305. The big four banks were among the best performers after they all raised interest rates less than 24 hours after the Reserve Bank 0.25 per cent increase yesterday. National Australia Bank (+1pc) led the charge, followed by Westpac (+0.7pc) , ANZ (+0.4pc) and the Commonwealth Bank (+0.7pc). Big miners, BHP (-0.6pc) and Rio Tinto (-0.7pc) weighed on the market as iron ore prices fell. Fortescue Metals (-2.4pc) said it would make a final investment decision by 2023 on its first green hydrogen project. Also going down on the benchmark index were vehicle parts maker ARB Corporation (-11.2pc) and buy now, pay later firm Zip (-10.8pc), and retirement homes company Lifestyle Communities (-7.8pc). The best performers on the ASX were financial services platform HUB 24 (+3.9pc), packaging manufacturer Orora (+3.4pc) and Virgin Money (+3pc). Electronics retailer JB Hi-Fi shares dropped 4.8 per cent to $49.73, because it did not provide a profit forecast in a trading update, due to COVID-19 uncertainties. It saw sales rise 11 per cent over the third quarter of the 2022 financial year because of ""heightened customer demand and strong sales growth momentum"" according to the retailer. Meanwhile, nationwide retail sales rose for the third month in a row in March as people restocked their pantries after the east coast floods in late February and early March. The Bureau of Statistics said that sales jumped 1.6 per cent over the month to a record $33.6 billion, and they were up 9.4 per cent from a year ago. ""Rising prices, combined with the continued easing of restrictions across the country has led to rises in turnover in all three months of the March quarter,"" said ABS director of quarterly statistics Ben James. Every state and territory saw a rise in sales except South Australia. Queensland (+3.4pc) and NSW (+1.8pc) had the largest increase in sales following the recovery from the floods and extreme rainfall. People shopped for household goods (+3.4pc) and at department stores (+4pc), ate out (+2pc) and bought clothes and shoes (+0.5pc). The US central bank kicked off its two day policy meeting overnight. Traders see a 50-basis point interest rate increase as virtually a sure bet with a 99.9 per cent chance of a lift in borrowing costs after recent comments from US Federal Reserve officials including chairman Jerome Powell. US stocks ended higher after a choppy session in which the major indexes fluctuated between gains and losses as the Federal Reserve's meeting got underway. Investors bought financial and technology stocks ahead of Thursday's expected increase in official interest rates by the Fed. The Dow Jones index rose 0.2 per cent to 33,129, the S&P 500 0.5 per cent to 4,176, and the Nasdaq rose 12,564. Nine of the major S&P500 sectors gained ground, led by energy stocks and financials. In London, the FTSE 100 rose 0.2 per cent to 7,561, the DAX in Germany rose 0.7 per cent to 14,039, and the CAC 40 in Paris rose 0.8 per cent to 4,932. Oil prices fell, with Brent crude down 1.5 per cent to $US105.96 a barrel. Spot gold gained 0.3 per cent to $US1867.78 an ounce. Starbucks revenue beat estimates as higher US sales offset declines in China, caused by strict COVID-19 lockdowns. Chinese same store sales plunged by 23 per cent as the country reimposed lockdowns after coronavirus outbreaks. Global same store sales increased by 7 per cent over the quarter, fuelled by strong growth in the US. Starbucks shares fell 1.4 per cent to $US74.33.

31,"The RBA raises rates for the first time in 11 years, Australian dollar jumps ",markets,"  ASX loses ground as RBA makes first interest rate rise in 11 years to curb inflation; Aussie dollar surges The ASX has fallen and the Australian dollar has jumped, after the Reserve Bank raised official interest rates for the first time in 11 years to curb surging inflation, which is running at an annual rate of 5.1 per cent. Official rates were slashed to a record low of 0.1 per cent in 2020 as an emergency response to the coronavirus pandemic. The central bank last raised the official cash rate by 0.25 basis points (0.25 per cent) in November 2010, which took the OCR to 4.75 per cent. The median forecast of 32 economists surveyed by Reuters showed the central bank would lift the cash rate by 15 basis points to 0.25 per cent from 0.1 per cent today. Instead, the bank made a full 0.25 basis point rise to 0.35 per cent, with the Reserve Bank governor Dr Philip Lowe saying it was time to start winding back the massive monetary stimulus that saved the economy from the worst of the coronavirus pandemic. The share market is screaming a message right now: The economy is not OK. And the ramifications will hit all of us. The Australian dollar surged by more than 1 per cent to 71.4 US cents after the RBA announcement at 2:30pm AEST. The local currency fell to an overnight low of 70.31 US cents, prompted by the rise of the greenback to a 20-year high before another expected rate increase by the US Federal Reserve this week. At 4:40pm AEST, the Australian dollar was up 1.1 per cent to 71.23 US cents. Consumers are worried about higher interest rates after the latest inflation figures showed that prices rose by the most in 20 years over the first few months of the year, because of the war in Ukraine, the global supply chain squeeze and the strong Australian economy. ANZ said its measure of consumer confidence fell 6 per cent last week, the sharpest drop since the Omicron variant of COVID-19 swept through the eastern seaboard in January. Confidence among mortgage borrowers slumped nearly 10 per cent over the week. ""This is the lowest level for consumer confidence at the start of the tightening cycle since the inflation targeting regime began in the early 1990s,"" said ANZ head of Australian economics David Plank. The local share market opened in the red and slipped further after the rates decision came out, ending lower for a second day. Higher borrowing costs weigh on consumer spending, and banks came off their lows because higher interest rates raise their revenue. Westpac (+0.1pc) gained, while National Australia Bank (-0.7pc), ANZ (-0.15pc) and the Commonwealth Bank (-0.7pc) fell. Real estate investment trusts were hit by the prospect of higher interest rates, and the mining, consumer and financial indexes also ended lower. Technology stocks did the best, tracking their peers on Wall Street. At the close, the All Ordinaries index fell 0.5 per cent to 7,588, and the ASX 200 lost 0.4 per cent to 7,316. The best performers on the ASX 200 were Magellan Financial Group (+5.4pc), technology company Appen (+5.2pc), and buy now, pay later firm Zip (+5pc). Going down were vegetable and fruit grower Costa Group (-6pc), biotech firm Imugene (-5.3pc) and retailer Premier Investment (-5.1pc). In a trading update, supermarket chain Woolworths said it was still facing problems stocking its shelves because of supply disruptions and staff shortages from COVID-19. The value of sales over the third quarter jumped to $11.4 billion because of supply chain blockages and higher fuel prices, as inflation rose at the fastest pace in two decades. Woolworths shares rose 0.6 per cent to $38.51. Telstra announced that Michael Ackland would become the new chief financial officer to replace Vicki Brady, who takes over in September from departing chief executive, Andy Penn. Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes, has bought 11.3 per cent of AGL Energy, becoming its largest shareholder through his private investment firm, Grok Ventures. In a letter sent to AGL's board of directors last night, he said he would vote against a proposed demerger, labelling it a ""flawed plan."" ""Grok Ventures has acquired more than an 11 per cent interest in AGL, becoming the largest shareholder,"" Mr Cannon-Brookes tweeted. ""We will be voting against the upcoming, flawed demerger."" It comes two months after the company rejected his takeover bid. AGL is Australia's largest electricity generator and largest greenhouse carbon emitter. AGL fired back and told the stock market that the demerger, which would split the business into two companies: an energy retailer and a power generator, was in the best interest of shareholders. It acknowledged that its largest shareholder would vote against the demerger proposal. In a statement to the ABC, an AGL spokesperson said the company had not been contacted by Grok Ventures. ""The AGL board is committed to delivering the proposed Demerger, which will ensure the value created through Australia's energy transition stays with our shareholders. ""The AGL Energy demerger is on track to be completed by the end of next month,"" the spokesperson said. AGL shares fell 3.1 per cent to $8.35. Wall Street ended higher after wild swings between profit and losses. It was a volatile night of trade on the New York Stock Exchange, a day before the US Federal Reserve meets to consider its next move on interest rates. US stocks fell 1 per cent at one stage, after a steep sell-off on Friday, as investors worried about higher interest rates and slower economic growth. The Nasdaq turned positive in afternoon trade as investors bought up beaten-down technology firms. The benchmark S&P 500 rebounded after dropping to the lowest since May 2021, and the Nasdaq fell to the lowest since November 2020 during the session. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 33,062, the S&P 500 gained nearly 0.6 per cent to 4,155, and the Nasdaq increased 1.6 per cent to 12,536. Returns or yields on benchmark 10 year US Treasury bonds hit 3 per cent for the first time in more than three years. The 10-year yield is an important barometer for mortgage rates and other financial instruments. It has surged over the last two months as the bond market prepared for the US central bank to reduce its balance sheet, which ballooned to nearly $US9 trillion as the Federal Reserve bought bonds during the pandemic to stimulate the economy. The Fed meets this week and is expected to raise interest rates by 50 basis points, to 0.75 per cent to 1 per cent, to tackle the strongest price rises in 40 years. Oil prices rose overnight on continuing concerns over supply shortages as the European Union considers a ban on Russian crude oil because of the invasion of Ukraine. Diesel prices rallied 5 per cent to $US4.0172 a gallon as a low supply of global inventories put pressure on oil prices. Brent crude gained 0.6 per cent to $US107.62 a barrel at 7am AEST. Earlier in the session, Brent and West Texas Crude fell on the news that the European Commission may spare Hungary and Slovakia from a Russian oil embargo as it prepares to finalise its next round of sanctions on Russia. The EU is looking at banning Russian oil imports by the end of 2022, a major source of revenue for Russia. Hungary and Slovakia are heavily dependent on Russian fossil fuels.

32,ASX tumbles ahead of RBA meeting; Qantas jumps on profitability forecast,markets,"  ASX tumbles ahead of RBA meeting; Qantas jumps on profitability forecast Australian shares have fallen more than 1 per cent in broad-based selling, as investors braced for a central bank policy meeting where it is widely expected to hike interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. The ASX 200 was down 1.2 per cent, to 7,347 on Monday. The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to raise interest rates on Tuesday, joining a long list of central banks now expected to tighten policies at a much faster pace than previously thought to tame surging inflation. Australian consumer prices surged at the fastest annual pace in two decades last quarter, likely prompting the central bank to move towards normalisation but as a consequence sparking fears of an economic slowdown. The RBA doesn't want to raise interest rates — at least not to anywhere near the levels many now believe are inevitable — writes business editor Ian Verrender. Almost every sector was lower. Among the losers on the benchmark, technology stocks dropped 4 per cent after their US peers fell sharply at the end of last week as the biggest surge in monthly inflation since 2005 spooked investors already worried about rate hikes. Xero dropped 6.6 per cent to $90.00, Tyro was down 5.6 per cent to $1.19, and Block lost 2.2 per cent to $142.00. Financials sank 0.8 per cent. NAB lost up to 1 per cent as the lender entered a deal with the country's financial crime regulator to address concerns around suspected serious breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism laws. Miners dropped 0.7 per cent, with BHP down 0.1 per cent. Shares of Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group were up 0.7 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively. AGL Energy was down 0.7 per cent on news that it trimmed its profit forecast for fiscal 2022, due to a hit from the shutdown of a unit at its Loy Yang A power station in Victoria after an electrical fault with a generator. However, Qantas jumped 2.9 per cent, to $5.76, after announcing that it expected to return to profitability in the financial year 2023-24, and launching its direct routes from Sydney to London and New York from 2025. The company said it was experiencing strong return to domestic demand and recovery in international travel. It said it expected underlying earnings before interest and tax to be between $450 million to $550 million for the second half of the 2022 financial year. Shares of Webjet and Flight Centre were also up, by 1.2 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively. Gold stocks fell almost 1.8 per cent as bullion prices dipped on pressure from elevated US Treasury yields. The Australian dollar was down at 70.52 US cents this afternoon. Wall Street equities closed sharply lower on Friday with the latest economic data and Amazon's disappointing quarterly report and outlook keeping the spotlight on surging inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 938.99 points, or 2.77 per cent, to 32,977.4, the S&P 500 lost 155.58 points, or 3.63 per cent, to 4,131.92, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 536.89 points, or 4.17 per cent, to 12,334.64. The Nasdaq showed its biggest monthly decline since October 2008. Amazon shares closed down 14 per cent after the e-commerce giant delivered a disappointing quarter and outlook late Thursday as it was swamped by higher costs to run its warehouses and deliver packages to customers. Equities were under pressure after data showed that monthly inflation surged by the most since 2005 while US consumer spending increased more than expected in March amid strong demand for services. Also, first quarter US labour costs surged by the most in 21 years, pointing to rising wage inflation, supporting Federal Reserve policy tightening ahead of its scheduled meeting this week. Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. Rates Strategy at BMO Capital Markets notes that the data could lead to a more hawkish response from the Fed. ""The operating assumption in the market at the moment is that the Fed has sufficient flexibility to ratchet up the pace of hiking in response to any further acceleration of inflationary pressures,"" he said. The pan-European STOXX 600 index had risen 0.74 per cent but MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.9 per cent. On the last trading day of April, the global index was on course for its biggest monthly decline since March 2020.

33,"ASX closes down, Pendal rejects Perpetual's $2.4b takeover offer",markets,"  ASX closes down, Pendal rejects Perpetual's $2.4b takeover offer Australian shares have closed lower on Tuesday, with investors tracking cues from a weak overnight session on Wall Street, while a drop in commodity prices has also pulled down the resource-heavy bourse. The ASX 200 fell 0.4 per cent, or 31 points, to 7,454. The broader All Ordinaries dropped 38 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 7,735. The Australian dollar was up 0.1 per cent, at 74.28 US cents. All 11 sectors on the ASX closed lower. Health care was the worst-performing sector, down 1.5 per cent. Energy stocks fell 0.5 per cent, tracking an overnight drop in oil prices, as traders fretted that the COVID-19 surge would cut demand in China and as International Energy Agency countries planned to release record volumes of oil from strategic stocks. Sector heavyweights Woodside Petroleum and Santos finished flat. Raw material prices dropped as China's stringent curbs dented market sentiment and fuelled worries the recovery momentum in the world's second-largest economy might lose steam. After falling during the day miners finished almost flat. Financials lost 0.3 per cent, weighed down by poor performances in the Big Four banks. NAB was flat, ANZ lost 1 per cent, CBA slipped 0.1 per cent and Westpac fell 0.4 per cent. Pendal closed 0.2 per cent down, at $5.29, after it rejected Perpetual’s $2.4 billion takeover offer, saying the offer was not in the best interests of its shareholders. The $6.23 per share offer for Pendal, a former unit of Westpac Banking Corp, was first disclosed on April 4 and was at a 39.2 per cent premium to the stock's close on April 1. Shares of Perpetual lost 0.4 per cent, to $32.15. Regis Resources gained 4.2 per cent, Bluescope Steel added 2.8 per cent, Elders Limited added 2.7 per cent, Uniti Group Limited gained 2.6 per cent and St Barbara Limited closed 2.4 per cent higher. Imugene Limited copped the biggest losses, down 8.7 per cent, followed by Zip Co, which lost 6 per cent. Rounding out the worst-performing five stocks were Pilbara Minerals, which fell 5.8 per cent, while Liontown Resources dropped 5.3 per cent and Paladin Energy closed 5.1 per cent lower. Meanwhile, business conditions have surged higher in March and confidence has also strengthened, according to NAB's monthly business survey. The report said confidence jumped in the transport, construction, and recreation and personal services sectors, and leading indicators also strengthened overall with capacity utilisation up to 83.1 per cent. Across the states, WA saw a significant boost to conditions as the border fully reopened. Conditions and confidence are now fairly strong across all jurisdictions. Overall, both conditions and confidence are now back around the levels last seen in the pre-Delta rebound, despite activity having more than recovered its pre-COVID level. ""Businesses reported very strong trading conditions and a sharp rise in profitability, which indicates demand is continuing to hold up as the economy rebounds from Omicron and growth gathers momentum,"" NAB Group chief economist Alan Oster said. ""Purchase costs reached records with elevated oil prices adding to existing supply chain issues, and labour costs are also rising as businesses hire more workers in a very competitive labour market. ""These cost pressures are very broad-based across industries. ""Overall, the results depict a very strong rebound, led by strong consumer demand."" Wall Street closed sharply lower on Monday as investors started the holiday-shortened week in a risk-off mood, with rising bond yields weighing on market-leading growth stocks ahead of crucial inflation data. All three major US stock indexes ended deep in negative territory, with tech and tech-adjacent stocks pulling the Nasdaq down 2.2 per cent. ""There's been two kinds of sell-offs in the past month or two,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""There's the rising yields, which primarily affects tech and other growth stocks, and then there's the recession/economic slowdown sell-off that affects energy and various materials' names. ""Today, you're seeing both."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 413.04 points, or 1.19 per cent, to 34,308.08, the S&P 500 lost 75.75 points, or 1.69 per cent, to 4,412.53, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 299.04 points, or 2.18 per cent, to 13,411.96. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield hovered near a three-year high ahead of key inflation data expected on Tuesday. The US Federal Reserve has vowed to aggressively tackle scorching inflation, and market participants largely expect a series of 50-basis-point interest rate hikes from the central bank in the coming months. ""All eyes on an inflation number that’s probably going to be the highest in 40 years, which could prompt higher and more frequent [interest] rate hikes from the Fed,"" Mr Tuz added. The Labor Department's CPI report is expected on Tuesday for any sign the inflation wave has crested. Analysts expect the report will show an 8.5 per cent year-on-year growth in consumer prices, the hottest reading since 1981. Ongoing geopolitical strife also helped prompt the flight to safety. Ukraine said it expected Russia to launch a huge new offensive soon as the most serious conflict in Europe since the Balkan wars of the 1990s wore on, despite ongoing peace negotiations. All 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 ended the session in the red, with energy shares suffering the biggest percentage losses. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe closed down 1.33 per cent and the pan-European STOXX 600 index slid 0.59 per cent as regional bourses fell with the exception of France's CAC 40.

BlueScope Steel jumped 0.8 per cent, set for its best day in one week after signing an agreement to acquire Cornerstone Building Brand's coil coatings business for $US500 million ($671 million). On Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended lower in choppy trades as investors assessed the economic outlook with the Fed moving to fight inflation. Last week's release of minutes from the Fed's March meeting showed ""many"" officials were prepared to raise rates in 50-basis-point increments in coming months. The US dollar index advanced to 100 for the first time in nearly two years. In Treasuries, the 10-year yield hit 2.73 per cent, its highest since March 2019, and the yield on 10-year inflation-protected securities went within 15 basis points of turning positive for the first time in over two years.

Australian Government 10-year bonds meanwhile passed a 3 per cent yield for the first time since July 2015, in a further sign of how far markets expect interest rates to rise from previous lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 137.55 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 34,721.12, the S&P 500 lost 11.93 points, or 0.27 per cent, to 4,488.28 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 186.30 points, or 1.34 per cent, to 13,711.

The ASX 200 ended the day up 0.5 per cent to 7,478 points. The All Ords gained a similar amount. The top performers were Paladin (+13.1c) and Graincorp (+5.8pc). This takes the benchmark back to where it was five days ago, and means it is virtually unchanged from April 2021. Graincorp was up after revising up its financial year 2022 guidance. All 11 major sectors were in the green, with consumer goods and staples performing the strongest. This comes after Wall Street ended in positive territory. The Dow rose 0.3 per cent overnight (local time) while the S&P 500 gained 0.4 per cent. The Nasdaq inched up marginally. Consumer goods like Costco, Walmart, and UnitedHealth made gains. ""The positive tone (in Australia on Friday) reflects a rebound in the US share market,"" CBA notes. ""(This) comes after back-to-back session losses following the US Federal Reserve raising concerns over the pace of monetary policy tightening and a potential slowing in US economic growth."" Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank is warning of serious risks for those who are heavily indebted with limited savings buffers, while painting a generally upbeat picture of the resilience of Australian households as interest rates rise. Westpac has also been fined again. Today the Federal Court ordered its subsidiary BT Funds to pay $20 million for incorrectly charging commission payments to members of the super fund. That followed Westpac being fined $1.5 million yesterday for selling consumer credit insurance. Oil is wavering and is just over $US100 a barrel for brent. That's as the world mulls up what lockdowns in China and further reserve releases will do to global supply and demand. ""Oil prices have extended their decline overnight amid uncertainty that the Eurozone will be able to effectively sanction Russian energy exports,"" CBA added. Brent plunged more than 5 per cent yesterday, following the International Energy Agency's announcement that US allies will deploy 60 million barrels from stockpiles. The lockdown in Shanghai is also rattling the iron ore market. China is one of the world's biggest buyers of the commodity and Australia is one of its biggest exporters. ""Iron ore shed $US3.43 or 2.1 per cent to $US156.64 a tonne as investors assessed the potential fallout from China's COVID-19 outbreak,"" CBA said.

Wall Street ended in the red overnight, with losses as large as 2.2 per cent on the Nasdaq. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla contributed to the tech-heavy sector's decline. European markets also dipped. Germany's DAX lost 1.9 per cent. The ASX 200 was down all day on Thursday and ended with a loss of 0.6 per cent, to 7,443 points. The bottom-performing stocks were Life260 and Liontown Resources, down 6.7 and 6.7 per cent respectively. Magellan was the top performer, with a gain of 10.1 per cent. Miners, including Iluka and Perseus, were also gaining as commodity prices moved overnight. Seven of the 11 major sectors were down, including energy, financial and tech. Meanwhile, Westpac has been fined $1.5 million for mis-selling consumer credit insurance (CCI) on its credit cards and certain sorts of loans. CCI is often dubbed ""junk insurance"" and it has been an endemic problem in the financial sector for years. It ended down 0.5 per cent, in line with the broader sell-off within the banking sector. The Fed's latest meeting notes showed many members of it refrained from voting for a bigger rate hike at the March meeting only because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The US economy is battling rising inflation and more rate hikes are seen as imminent to tackle this, with many analysts expecting a 0.5 per cent rise, not the more typical 0.25 per cent. ""Many members viewed one or more 50bp rate hikes could be appropriate at future meetings if high inflation persists,"" CBA noted this morning. ""We expect the FOMC to increase the Funds rate by 50bp in May and June."" The Australian economy is also battling price hikes, however the Reserve Bank only this week decided to keep rates at historical lows for a while longer. ""USD fluctuated modestly as market participants digested the FOMC's March meeting minutes,"" CBA's analysts said. ""AUD/USD dropped below its pre RBA level and is trading near 0.7510. ""Weaker oil and equity prices weighed on AUD."" Meanwhile, there are jitters about China's economy, with the entire city of Shanghai under another COVID lockdown. That's as the major financial hub battles 13,000 cases of the virus daily. ""China's COVID-zero policy leaves Shanghai still locked down with cases rising still, and nerves fraying about further spreads and more sweeping lockdowns,"" OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley said in a briefing note.

38,"Elon Musk gets Twitter board seat, ASX in the red ",markets,"  Twitter offers Elon Musk board seat, ASX and Wall Street fall on fears rapid rate rises could lead to recession Twitter has offered Elon Musk a seat on its board after the billionaire Tesla founder bought a big stake in the social media firm, and the local share market has lost ground. Mr Musk disclosed this week that he had bought a 9.2 per cent stake in Twitter in March, making him the company's largest shareholder. His nearly $US3 billion investment is four times larger than that of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as chief executive in November. Twitter's chief executive Parag Agrawal said in a tweet that in conversations with Mr Musk in recent weeks ""it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our board."" ""He's both a passionate believer and intense critic of the service which is exactly what we need on Twitter, and in the boardroom, to make us stronger in the long term,"" Mr Agrawal tweeted. Mr Musk tweeted that he was looking forward to working with the Twitter board ""to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months"". Reuters reported that Mr Musk would be involved in strategic decisions, including the direction of Twitter's Bluesky project and the addition of an edit button, which he set up a poll on Twitter for users to vote on. But Mr Agrawal warned users to think carefully about the addition of an edit function. Twitter confirmed on Wednesday that it was testing a function that would allow users to edit tweets after they have been published. Mr Musk will not have a say on the platform's moderation, including what speech gets banned or whose accounts get restored, a policy that applies to all board members. Bluesky is a company funded by Twitter to develop a new operating standard for social media. Twitter shares rose 2 per cent, following yesterday's 27 per cent surge on the news of Mr Musk's investment. The Australian share market lost ground after a US central bank official signalled the swift end of coronavirus stimulus to curb surging inflation. The market fell more than 1 per cent earlier in the day, but finished off its lows. The All Ordinaries index fell 0.6 per cent to 7,788, while the ASX 200 dropped 0.5 per cent to 7,490, with most sectors in the red. Technology stocks were among the worst-hit following a sell-off on Wall Street. Miners and consumer-discretionary firms also weighed on the market, but financial firms ended higher, including the big banks. Shares in US payment giant Block fell nearly 7 per cent, and energy producers dropped after a fall in oil prices overnight. Leading the falls were battery materials firm Novonix (-6.9pc), miner Lynas Rare Earths (-6pc), and Magellan Financial (-6pc). The best performers were coal miner Whitehaven Coal (+5.5pc), medical device firm Polynovo (+4.6pc, on record first-quarter revenue), and investment house AMP (+4.6pc). The European Union is proposing a potential ban on Russian coal imports because of the invasion of  Ukraine. BGH Capital raised its takeover bid for IVF provider Virtus Health (+1pc) to $8 a share. That is after Virtus recommended investors accept a rival offer of $8.25 a share from CapVest. The private equity firms have been vying for months to take over Virtus, with seven competing offers received. Virtus said it would consider the new bid from BGH. At 4:30pm AEST, the Australian dollar was buying around 75.77 US cents, down 0.1 per cent. It surged to a ten month high of 76.61 US cents overnight after the Reserve Bank signalled it was getting ready to raise official interest rates. At 4:30pm AEST, Brent crude oil was up 0.4 per cent to $US107.08 a barrel, and spot gold was down 0.2 per cent to $US1920 an ounce. Victoria's gaming regulator has started disciplinary action against Crown for allowing Chinese high rollers to use a Chinese bank card, China Union Pay, to bypass that country's currency restrictions. The Victorian royal commission into Crown found that the casino group had assisted Chinese high rollers to illegally transfer up to $160 million in funds out of China. It found that Crown was not fit to hold a casino licence, but recommended that Crown be allowed to keep its licence under strict conditions. That scheme had worked, the commission found, because Crown's hotel in Melbourne issued a room charge bill to the patron, which falsely stated that the hotel provided services. The customer would then pay their bill using the China Union Pay card and be given a voucher which would be exchanged for cash or chips at the casino. Crown could face a fine of up to $100 million. Fran Thorn — the chair of the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission — said she welcomed tougher laws that imposed stronger regulatory obligations on Crown and gave the commission greater enforcement powers. ""These powers are needed to deter Crown from engaging in the conduct that was revealed during the royal commission"" ""As a first step, we are acting on the royal commission's findings that Crown's China Union Pay process breached important Victorian regulatory obligations, was illegal and constituted serious misconduct,"" she said. In a statement, Crown said it would fully cooperate with the commission. Crown's shares fell 0.8 per cent to close at $12.75. Global miner Rio Tinto said it paid $US13.3 billion ($17.6 billion) in taxes and royalties globally during 2021, up from $US8.4 billion in 2020. Around half of Rio Tinto's assets are in Australia, where it pays the majority of its taxes. In Australia, Rio Tinto paid $14.8 billion in taxes and royalties in 2021, compared to $9.8 billion the year before. Rio Tinto shares lost 1.2 per cent on lower iron ore prices. Rio Tinto has joined other global miners and the maritime industry in a drive to reduce pollution in the export of iron ore. The Global Maritime Forum, BHP, Rio Tinto, and commodity shipping firms Oldendorff Carriers and Star Bulk Carriers Corp will assess the development of an iron ore ""green corridor"" between Australia and East Asia. The aim is to cut greenhouse gas pollution caused by the transport of iron ore by establishing specific shipping routes where zero emissions or near-zero emissions transport and logistics are more feasible, including the use of cleaner fuels such as green ammonia. ""Zero greenhouse gas emission pathways require the creation of a parallel value chain that involves new ways of working, new contractual relationships, and drives the development of decarbonised fuel production and infrastructure,"" said Global Maritime Forum chief executive Johannah Christensen. Stocks on Wall Street lost ground overnight, pulled down by technology and other growth stocks after comments from US central bank officials prompted fears that aggressive interest rate rises could cause a recession. Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard said in a speech she expects interest rate increases and reductions to the US central bank's nearly $US9 trillion balance sheet as soon as next month to bring monetary policy to a ""more neutral position."" Ms Brainard spooked investors when she said the Fed could move as soon as next month to reduce its bond holdings at a ""considerably"" faster pace than previously, to curb inflation. ""The committee will continue tightening monetary policy methodically through a series of interest rate increases and by starting to reduce the balance sheet at a rapid pace as soon as our May meeting,"" she said. The Fed official said the bond reduction would ""contribute to monetary tightening over and above the expected increases"" in official rates. The US central bank can either sell securities on its balance sheet or chose not to reinvest maturing securities. Kansas City Federal Reserve president Esther George said she supported a rapid reduction of the Fed's bond holdings and larger increases in interest rates. ""50 basis-points is going to be an option that we'll have to consider,"" Ms George said. Last month, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates from near zero for the first time in three years, and released forecasts showing most officials thought the federal funds rate would end the year at 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent. Big tech names such as Amazon and Apple weighed on the Nasdaq, which saw its biggest daily percentage drop in about a month. The Nasdaq fell 2.3 per cent, to 14,204, the Dow Jones index lost 0.8 per cent, to 34,641 and the S&P 500 fell 1.3 per cent, to 4,525. On the other side of the Atlantic, the FTSE 100 index in London rose 0.7 per cent, to 7,614,  the DAX in Germany dropped 0.7 per cent, to 14,424, and the CAC 40 in France fell 1.3 per cent, to 6,645. Meanwhile, the US dollar hit its highest level on the dollar index in nearly two years, reaching 99.526 after the comments from the Federal Reserve officials. Oil prices fell overnight on concerns about the rising greenback and worries that rising COVID-19 cases could hurt fuel demand. Brent crude futures dropped 1.8 per cent, to $US105.70 a barrel, at 7:15am AEST. Spot gold fell 0.5 per cent, to $US1923.52 an ounce.

39,"ASX trims gains on looming rate rise, oil prices climb again",markets,"  ASX trims gains on looming interest rate rise, oil prices climb again The Australian share market has trimmed earlier gains in late trade, as traders have interpreted the latest Reserve Bank minutes as a clue a rate rise is imminent. The benchmark share market indices were more than two-thirds of a per cent higher earlier in the afternoon, but both closed just 0.2 per cent up, with the ASX 200 at 7,528 points and the All Ordinaries at 7,833. The shift in the afternoon came as the Reserve Bank decision and governor's statement were released at 2:30pm AEST. This morning, NAB analyst Tapas Strickland said the governor's statement would be closely examined for further hints about the timing of the first rate rise. ""The key focus will be on the final policy paragraph and whether rates guidance is put on a more agile setting,"" he noted. ""The prior March post-meeting statement concluded: 'The board is prepared to be patient as it monitors how the various factors affecting inflation in Australia evolve'. ""If the RBA removes the word 'patient', markets will take that as a sign as a clear nod to the importance of Q1 CPI [first quarter Consumer Price Index] and lines up May or June for the first rate hike."" The statement did lose ""patient"", causing a surge in the Australian dollar, as traders brought forward their expectations of the first interest rate rise, with more bets now centred on June. The Australian dollar, already stronger overnight, gained the better part of a cent this afternoon to 76.14 US cents. ""The risk-on move spread to FX markets broadly, with commodity currencies moving higher,"" observed IG's Kyle Rodda in a note to clients. ""Higher commodity prices, expectations for tighter monetary policy, improving market sentiment, and a possible short-squeeze are tailwinds for the Aussie dollar right now."" The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil was up 1.8 per cent to $US109.41. ""Europe is contemplating further sanctions against Russia amid reports of war crimes,"" noted NAB's Tapas Strickland. ""Talk of Europe restricting Russian oil and gas has re-surfaced, driving oil prices higher."" Ampol was up 3 per cent, Origin Energy 3.1 per cent and AGL 2.6 per cent. Gold miners were among the major losers in a rally driven by positive sentiment and a return to riskier investments, with Silver Lake Resources off 2.4 per cent and Gold Road Resources down 3.4 per cent, although Australia's biggest gold producer, Newcrest, was up 0.3 per cent. Some more speculative lithium stocks also took a hit, with AVZ Minerals off 7.9 per cent and Liontown Resources down 6.1 per cent. Rare earths miner Lynas was down 5.7 per cent to $10.74. It was revealed yesterday in a market filing that Tesla founder Elon Musk had bought a roughly 9 per cent stake in the social media platform. That news drove Twitter shares more than 27 per cent higher, to close at nearly $US50. Tesla shares also rose 5.6 per cent. It also boosted the US tech sector more broadly, with the Nasdaq closing up 1.9 per cent. The broader S&P 500 and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average posted more modest gains, of 0.8 and 0.3 per cent, respectively. As in the US, tech names drove the best gains. The Australian listing of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's payments platform Block was up 6.2 per cent, to $191.44. Software firms Xero (+4.5pc) and Appen (2pc) gained strongly. Biotech firms Imugene (+4.2pc), Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals (+3.9pc) and Polynovo (+4.9pc) were also higher on the positive, risk-taking sentiment. News of an ASIC lawsuit against Macquarie did nothing to dampen its share price, which was up 0.5 per cent, to $207.06. The corporate regulator is suing the bank for failing to detect a series of fraudulent transactions made by a financial advisor from 13 of his clients' accounts, costing them $2.9 million in unauthorised withdrawals. The financial planner is already in jail and Macquarie refunded the customers $3.5 million in compensation, but now ASIC wants financial penalties and declarations by the court for the bank's failure to put the transfers made under a ""fee authority"" through a fraud monitoring system. ASIC also wants a compliance order for an independent review of Macquarie's fee authorities and fee transactions using its bulk transaction system to ensure recommendations regarding improvements are effectively implemented.

40,"ASX rises, Pendal jumps on $2.4b Perpetual bid, US yield curve inverts after strong jobs data",markets,"  ASX rises, Pendal jumps on $2.4b Perpetual bid, US yield curve inverts after strong jobs data Australian shares have risen as heavyweight mining stocks have hit a record high and the gold sub-index has rallied, but gains have been capped by the escalating Ukraine crisis. The ASX 200 closed up 0.3 per cent, up 19.9 points to 7,514, recouping losses from last Friday when it fell 0.1 per cent. Ukraine on Sunday accused Russia of carrying out a ""massacre"" in the town of Bucha, and Western nations reacted to images of dead bodies with calls for new sanctions on Moscow, which kept a lid on investor mood. Mining stocks climbed 1.2 per cent. Iron ore futures in China closed at a near eight-month high on Friday as hopes for economic stimulus rose following a month of COVID-19-induced lockdowns. Global miner BHP rose 0.1 per cent and peers Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group added 0.3 per cent and 3 per cent respectively. Mineral sands explorer Iluka Resources jumped as much as 6.1 per cent after its board approved a rare-earths refinery project and secured government funding for it. Gold stocks climbed 2 per cent and hit a near three-week high. Newcrest Mining, Australia's largest listed gold miner, rose 0.9 per cent, while Northern Star also climbed 2.1 per cent. Heavyweight banks were down, with the financial index dropping 0.3 per cent. The mixed mood comes ahead of an interest-rate decision by the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday. NAB, ANZ and CBA lost 0.8 per cent, 0.2 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively. Westpac also dropped 0.2 per cent despite a marginal rise in the afternoon trade. Investment manager Pendal Group soared 18.1 per cent on receiving a buyout offer worth about $2.4 billion from asset manager Perpetual. Perpetual's shares were down 6.6 per cent to $31.97. Among the worst performers were Imugene (-4pc), Fletcher Building (-3.3pc) and Bank of Queensland (-3.2pc). The Australian dollar was up at 75.10 US cents by 4:39pm AEST. US government bond yields resumed their upward climb on Friday as a key part of the US Treasury yield curve inverted once more on signs of persistent inflation. Data released on Friday showed US employers added 431,000 jobs in March and the unemployment rate fell to 3.6 per cent, continuing a strong run of hiring that has left key aspects of the American labour market ""little different"" from where it was before the COVID-19 pandemic. With US economic growth so robust — and inflation running at three times the Federal Reserve's 2 per cent target — investors are widely expecting a drum roll of interest rate rises this year. Treasury yields — which retreated earlier last week as portfolio adjustments boosted demand for bonds — spiked again on Friday, causing a closely watched part of the yield curve to invert for the third time in the past week. An inversion of the yield curve — when shorter-dated yields rise above longer-dated ones — is seen as a harbinger of a recession in the next one or two years. ""[Friday's] solid growth of payrolls checked the box for the Fed in its drive toward fighting inflation,"" said Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income. ""Consequently, the Fed looks clearly undeterred in reaching at least policy neutrality and probably will do at least one, and maybe two, 50-basis-point rate hikes by the June … meeting, which could even include an inter-meeting hike."" Bets that aggressive monetary tightening could be in the cards did not drag equity markets lower on Friday. US stocks finished higher after a choppy session on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent, the S&P 500 added 0.34 per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.29 per cent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index climbed 0.54 per cent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.16 per cent. Inflation in Europe is also running at record levels, with euro zone inflation hitting 7.5 per cent in March, data showed on Friday, another all-time high with months left before it is set to peak, raising pressure on the European Central Bank to act to contain prices even as growth slows sharply. In response, the German 10-year government bond yield, a benchmark for the euro zone, rose 2.8 bps to 0.58 per cent, after jumping 39 bps in March, its biggest monthly rise since 2009. ""Government bond yields have moved up markedly in recent weeks, and can be expected to trend higher over time, due to inflationary pressures that are here to stay and responses by the main central banks,"" Christian Nolting, global chief investment officer at Deutsche Bank Private Bank said in a note. Two-year US Treasury yields jumped to 2.4503 per cent from 2.284 per cent, surpassing benchmark 10-year US Treasury yields, which also rose to 2.3767 per cent from 2.325 per cent. ""Given its impressive track record in predicting US recessions — it's been almost 50 years since the last false positive — it would seem foolish to doubt that bearish recession speculation,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. ""Historically, however, the 10-year three-month [Treasury yield] spread has done a better job of signalling downturns than the 10-year two-year spread and the former is still close to 200 basis points,"" Ashworth added. Oil dipped in and out of negative territory ahead of a meeting of International Energy Agency member nations which is set to discuss a release of emergency oil reserves alongside a huge planned release by the United States. Meanwhile oil prices fell after the United Arab Emirates and the Iran-aligned Houthi group welcomed a truce that would halt military operations on the Saudi-Yemeni border, alleviating some concerns about potential supply issues. Oil slid 13 per cent last week, the biggest weekly fall in two years, after US President Joe Biden announced the largest-ever US oil reserves release. Brent crude oil was up, trading at $US105.46 a barrel by 4:42pm AEST. The rise in bond yields globally has been a drag on gold, which pays no return. The metal was stuck at $1,923 an ounce by 4:42pm AEST.

41,"EV battery manufacturer gains 9pc as critical minerals boosted, but ASX closes down",markets,"  EV battery manufacturer Novonix gains 9pc as critical minerals boosted, but ASX closes down Instability and inflation are continuing to weigh on global markets, with the Australian market finally coming down off a winning streak to follow sentiment down. At 2pm AEDT the ASX 200 had been up 0.4 per cent to 7,544 points. That took it to a 50-day trading high, and was a continuation of a six-day streak. However, in late afternoon trade the benchmark traded down and finished 0.2 per cent off at 7,500 points. Global markets, including the major index in Europe and the Nasdaq on Wall Street, made notable losses overnight as inflation data and instability spooked investors. Some of the top-performing stocks on the ASX 200 on Thursday were miners Champion Iron, BHP and Whitehaven Coal, which were all up between 2 and 5 per cent. The price of iron ore and many other commodities is continuing to rise amid the war in Ukraine. The ASX 200's top performer was battery and tech company Novonix, which gained 9.3 per cent. That was after news reports on Thursday that the United States has agreed to invest more in Australian critical minerals projects, which could further boost the resources sector. Everything from lithium to zinc is in higher demand globally for renewable energy projects. The critical minerals sector also got a $250 million boost in this week's federal budget. Tech was down as investors sold off stocks bought in recent days. Retail chain Harvey Norman was the biggest loser of the day (-6.1pc) while plumbing and bathroom supplier Reece lost 4.4 per cent. Both operate in the consumer goods sector that is being hit with inflation and supply chain concerns. Both Wall Street and the European majors ended in the red overnight (local time) as hopes for peace talks for Ukraine and Russia failed to end the conflict. The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed down by 0.7 per cent, with retail stocks shedding 2.7 per cent to lead losses. Gas stocks gained 3 per cent, as concerns about supply lifted, driving up prices. Germany and Austria, which buy a lot of gas from Russia, have started contingency planning for what to do if their supply is curtailed. Meanwhile, early inflation figures out of Germany and Spain have showed price spikes there are continuing. ""Ahead of the EU wide inflation readings due for release on Friday, overnight Germany and Spain recorded their largest price increases since reunification in the early 1990s (or 1985 prior to unification),"" NAB notes. Spain's inflation jumped 9.8 per cent annually while Germany leapt to 7.6 per cent. The European Central Bank's president Christine Lagarde is warning that those price hikes could get worse and the conflict is posing “significant risks to growth”. ""Reaction to the inflation data and Lagarde's comments triggered a sell-off of EU yields led by the front end of the curve,"" NAB notes. Wall Street also ended a four-day winning streak overnight. The S&P 500 fell 0.63 per cent, the tech-heavy Nasdaq shed 1.2 per cent, and the Dow Jones dropped much less at 0.2 per cent off. The price of Brent crude jumped again on concerns about supply and the war. By 7:45am AEDT, it had gained 2.1 per cent to $US112.57 a barrel. The Aussie dollar was buying around 75.20 US cents overnight. ""Once the impact of the war fades, AUD is well positioned to trend higher over the rest of this year,"" ANZ notes.

42,"Wall St gains despite 'yield inversion' recession warning, Telstra CEO steps down",markets,"  Wall St gains despite 'yield inversion' recession warning, Telstra CEO steps down Australian shares have risen the day after the federal budget, however, analysts say the cash splash wasn't ""market-moving"" and the benchmark more likely followed Wall Street's optimism about the war in Ukraine easing. The ASX 200 opened 0.5 per cent higher and eventually finished 0.7 per cent higher at 7,515 points. That is a new 50-day high. The benchmark has closed up six days in a row. Top performers included Life 360 (+9.6pc) and Magellan (+8.5pc). Nine out of 11 sectors ended higher. Information technology was the best performing sector, with a gain of 3.8 per cent. Tech stocks also did well on Nasdaq on Wall Street overnight (local time). Commodity stocks dragged down the market, with Whitehaven down 3.5pc, South32 down 3.5pc, and Silve Lake losing 2.8pc. This comes as the price of oil dips again, and as commodities continue their volatility amid the war in Ukraine. Telstra ended down 0.8 per cent after it was announced early this morning that chief executive Andy Penn is stepping down from the top job after seven years. Mr Penn was at the helm of Telstra during its major restructure, which saw 8,000 people lose their jobs. He will be replaced by the telco's current chief financial officer Vicki Brady from September 1. She will be Telstra's first female chief executive. Wall Street was boosted by talk of yield inversion and further optimism that the war in Ukraine could be resolved sooner than later. The Dow Jones gained 1pc, S&P 500 was up 1.2pc, and the Nasdaq gained 1.8 per cent with the likes of Netflix boosting the tech-heavy index. In trade, the US Treasury yield curve had started flattening with parts of it inverting, as investors price in an aggressive rate-hiking plan by the US Federal Reserve as it attempts to bring inflation down from 40-year highs. Analysts often see so-called yield inversion as a reflection of market concerns that an economy could go into recession. IG's Kyle Rodda said this showed ""the US economy is on a countdown to recession"". ""At least, that's what history suggests,"" he said. ""The 10-2 spread inverted overnight — an event that was closely watched and widely anticipated — signalling that the extraordinary pandemic boom in the US economy may come with an equally forceful bust. ""For many, the writing is on the wall: The Fed is going to tighten the economy into recession in order to bring down inflation. ""But other than some blaring red headlines and a few pre-emptive eulogies for this economic cycle, markets broadly pushed on with the risk recovery seen over the past fortnight."" NAB added that: ""The news headline writers haven't yet got their field day."" ""Even if it has gifted a suitable song title for today's missive,"" the bank added. ""The bigger market story has been a further lift in optimism toward some sort of Russia-Ukraine peace agreement."" European stocks also performed well, whereas the price of Brent crude also shaved off more losses. At 7:30am AEDT, it was down 0.9 per cent to $US111.43. The price of oil has been surging on the war in Ukraine, with the country that invaded it, Russia, one of the biggest producers. The surging price reflects concerns in supply, so it dropping again shows investors may feel that the conflict could ease. There have also been concerns about lockdowns in China, which could ease demand, too. Last night's federal budget contained measures to reduce the price of fuel at the pump here. Meanwhile, the local currency gained 0.3 per cent. ""As is usually the case, AUD/USD was not influenced by the release of the government's budget overnight,"" ANZ said. ""With most of the government's policy changes leaked to the media in recent days, there was little 'new news' for financial markets to digest."" NAB added the budget ""sprung few surprises and shouldn't be market-moving today or in the days ahead"".

43,"Oil stocks take a hit as brent price jumps around, while the ASX gains",markets,"  Oil stocks take a hit as brent price jumps around, while the ASX gains Australian shares have risen but oil stocks are taking a hit, as the price of Brent crude jumps around on fresh lockdowns in China and potential peace talks for Ukraine. The ASX 200 rose steadily throughout the day and finished up 0.7 per cent. That is it's sixth day in a row of trending upwards. The top-performing stocks included Magellan (+7.1pc) and Appen (6.7pc). Generally, tech and consumer goods stocks were doing nicely. On the flip side, miners Whitehaven and Iluka Resources were down between 4.2 and 2.1 per cent. However, oil stock Beach Energy was down 2.1 per cent. That comes as the price of oil has dropped again as Shanghai heads into fresh rounds of COVID-19 lockdowns, potentially subduing concerns about a shortfall in global supply. At 7am AEDT, the price of Brent crude had dropped 9.2 per cent, to US$109.60 a barrel. However, it started to recover as more talk emerged of peaces talks for Ukraine and Russia to be held in Turkey. Its price has been fluctuating to near historic highs with the war in Ukraine. The country that invaded it, Russia, is one of the world's biggest oil producers. High oil prices have added to inflation concerns globally and hiked prices at the pump, including in Australia. Petrol prices are so high in Sydney, Rebecca Matanale might have to leave her car in the car park because it's ""too expensive to take anywhere"". People in the outer regions of Sydney are feeling the bite of rising petrol prices the most, making them think twice about how they travel. Trade on Wall Street was generally muted on Monday, but was lifted by a hike in Tesla shares. The electric car-maker's stock rose 8 per cent after it said it wanted to split its stock to pay a dividend. That boosted the Nasdaq by 1.3 per cent. The other two majors rose between 0.3 per cent and 0.7 per cent after muted afternoon trade. Bitcoin gained almost 8 per cent as it continued its recovery. The Aussie dollar was trading near 74.90 US cents at the US close. Meanwhile, as the price of oil continues to put upwards pressure on inflation in Australia and globally, the latest consumer confidence data from ANZ shows concerns about price hikes are growing. ""Inflation expectations surged 0.4 points last week, to a multi-year high of 6.4 per cent of respondents, even though petrol prices declined slightly,"" ANZ head of economics David Plank said. ""Consumer confidence was essentially unchanged despite this, with a slight decline of just 0.1 per cent. ""Within the detail, however, sentiment toward 'current financial conditions' dropped to its lowest since May 2020. ""Consumer confidence is very weak, given the strength of employment, which we think is directly linked to concerns over cost-of-living pressures."" It found more respondents were now wanting to put off buying major household items. Meanwhile, the federal government is expected to unveil a suite of measures aimed at easing cost of living concerns in its budget tonight.

44,"Miners hit over seven-month high on iron ore rally, Star CEO resigns, ASX rises",markets,"  Miners hit over seven-month high on iron ore rally, Star CEO resigns, ASX rises Australian shares have risen as investors assess interest rate hikes and the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, subdued technology stocks limited the gains. ASX 200 closed up 6 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 7,412, extending its gains to a fifth straight session. Metals and mining stocks climbed 1.4 per cent, to hit a more than seven-month high, as iron ore futures extended gains for the second straight session after posting a fourth weekly gain on Friday. Heavyweights Rio Tinto, Fortescue Metals Group and BHP Group rose between 0.8 per cent and 2.3 per cent. However, Chalice Mining and Liontown Resources were down 4.9 per cent and 4.7 per cent respectively. Financials gained 0.6 per cent, with the country's four largest banks advancing between 0.2 per cent and 1.2 per cent. Energy stocks were marginally down 0.1 per cent, with Paladin Energy diving 6 per cent to $0.78, as oil prices falling on prospects of a drop in fuel demand in China. Major oil and gas explorer Woodside Petroleum dropped 1.3 per cent and Santos was flat. Bucking the overall positive trend, the technology index retreated 2.7 per cent in its third consecutive session of losses. Shares of Block (-3.7pc), WiseTech Global (-4.1pc) and Xero (-5.2pc) were leading the losses. Among the best performers were AVZ Minerals (+4pc), Washington H. Soul Pattinson (+3.1pc) and Costa Group (+2.6pc). Shares of Star Entertainment Group were up 0.3 per cent, to $3.24, after falling as much as 1.9 per cent in early trade. The casino operator's chief executive officer, Matt Bekier, submitted his resignation on Monday amid an investigation over possible breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism laws at Star's establishments. Mr Bekier’s decision to step down, effective immediately, followed public hearings in connection with a review of The Star Sydney hotel and casino that raised issues, the company added in a statement. The Star Sydney is Australia's second-largest casino. He informed the board that, as managing director and chief executive, he was ""accountable for the effectiveness and adequacy of the company’s processes, policies, people and culture"", adding that the right thing to do was for him to take responsibility, the statement said. The casino sector has been plagued by a slew of regulatory inquiries in Australia. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was up, at 75.22 US cents, by 4:35pm AEDT. Oil prices turned positive on Friday after reports of a missile strike and a fire at Saudi Arabia's state-run oil company Aramco's facility. Brent crude oil wound back a little, trading at $US117.04 a barrel, by 4:35pm AEDT. The S&P 500 ended higher on Friday as financial shares rose after the benchmark Treasury yield jumped to its highest level in nearly three years. The Nasdaq ended lower, and tech and other big growth names mostly declined, but they finished off session lows following a late-session rally. Last week, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 registered solid gains of 2 per cent and 1.8 per cent, respectively, and the Dow was nominally higher with a 0.3 per cent rise. The S&P 500 financials sector gave the S&P 500 its biggest boost on Friday, rising 1.3 per cent, while technology and consumer discretionary sectors were the only two major sectors to end lower on the day. Investors are assessing how aggressive the Federal Reserve will be as it tightens policy after Fed Chair Jerome Powell this week said the central bank needed to move ""expeditiously"" to combat high inflation and raised the possibility of a 50-basis-point hike in rates in May. US Treasury yields jumped on Friday, with the benchmark 10-year note surging to nearly three-year highs, as the market grappled with high inflation and a Federal Reserve that could easily spark a downturn as it aggressively tightens policy. Ten-year Treasury yields were last at 2.492 per cent after earlier rising above 2.50 per cent for the first time since May 2019. The equity market is pricing in a higher rate environment, said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta. That is causing bank stocks to outperform, while ""adding more pressure to the riskier elements of the market,"" such as growth shares, he said. Higher borrowing rates benefit banks, while higher rates are a negative for tech and growth stocks, whose valuations rely more heavily on future cash flows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 153.3 points, or 0.44 per cent, to 34,861.24, the S&P 500 gained 22.9 points, or 0.51 per cent, to 4,543.06 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 22.54 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 14,169.30. Economists at Citibank are expecting four 50-basis-points interest rate hikes from the Fed this year, joining other Wall Street banks in forecasting an aggressive tightening path against the backdrop of soaring inflation. The US central bank last week raised interest rates for the first time since 2018. ""The market's really macro driven,"" said Steve DeSanctis, small- and mid-capitalisation equity strategist at Jefferies in New York. ""Company fundamentals haven't really mattered."" MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe was up 0.11 per cent, adding a second consecutive week of gains for the first time in 2022. The pan-European STOXX 600 index also inched up 0.11 per cent, but was down on the week.

45,"Russian stocks soar on reopening, ASX hits two month high",markets,"  Russian share market reopens after month-long closure, ASX at two month high Russian stocks have seen wild swings as the market reopened for limited trading after being shut down for a month, and the Australian market has risen to a two month high. Stock trading was suspended in late February after President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine and the Russian market fell by more than one-third in a day. The Moscow stock exchange resumed trading overnight for four hours in 33 Russian stocks including oil and gas giant Gazprom and Sberbank. The MOEX Russian index soared more than 10 per cent. It closed up 4.4 per cent to 2,579, with energy and mining stocks driving the gains. Bloomberg reported the fortunes of Russian tycoons linked to the top 33 companies jumped $US2.7 billion. But the Russian market is still down by nearly 30 per cent since the invasion of Ukraine. Stocks have not traded since February 25, the day after the invasion. Short selling on bonds is banned. And foreign investors will not be able to sell stocks or OFZ rouble bonds until April 1. Oil firms Rosneft and Lukoil jumped, while aluminium firm Rusal and Norilsk Nickel also increased. Airline Aeroflot fell 16.4 per cent. The Moscow Exchange will restart limited trading in more stocks, bonds and Eurobonds tonight, but trading in Russian companies on the London Stock Exchange remains suspended. ""We will do everything possible to open all segments of the stock market soon,"" Boris Blokhin from the Moscow exchange said. The White House said the reopening of the market was a ""charade"". ""This is not a real market and not a sustainable model — which only underscored Russia's isolation from the global financial system,"" deputy White House national security adviser Daleep Singh said. The reaction to the invasion sent the Russian rouble tumbling and saw sanctions imposed by Western countries and companies. The rouble rose 6.2 per cent to 94.75 against the greenback overnight. It has fallen by 20 per cent this year. German chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian premier Mario Draghi and other European Union leaders told Russia to honour payments for gas exports stated in the contract, usually US dollars or euros. The war in Ukraine suddenly has shifted from the battleground to the boardroom, the bourse and banks as Russian consumers prepare to enter their very own world of pain. Mr Putin yesterday said ""unfriendly"" countries would have to pay gas contracts in roubles. Gas prices jumped after Mr Putin ordered the Russian central bank to prepare measures to force some buyers to make rouble payments for natural gas within a week. The EU is planning measures to wean itself off Russian energy. Russia supplies about 40 per cent of Europe's gas and 60 per cent of its oil. Latvia's prime minister said energy sanctions were a serious option that the EU should consider. But Belgium's Prime Minister said oil and gas sanctions on Russia would have a ""devastating impact on the European economy and I don't think it's necessary."" Mr Scholz said ending dependence on Russian oil, coal and gas ""from one day to the next would mean plunging our country and all of Europe into recession."" European gas prices fell as the US promised to supply more LNG to the EU. Brent crude fell 3 per cent overnight to $US117.89 as investors faced the prospect of higher trading costs on major exchanges, according to ANZ, with traders required to deposit more collateral. Spot gold rose nearly 1 per cent to $US1,961 an ounce. Iron ore prices increased nearly 2 per cent to $US150.75 a tonne. The Australian market lifted for the fourth day in a row to a two-month high, thanks to higher iron ore prices and a bounce back on Wall Street. While coming off its lunchtime peak, the All Ordinaries index increased by 0.3 per cent to 7,690, and the ASX 200 put on 0.26 per cent to 7,406. Mining stocks led the increases on the market, with utilities, real estate stocks, and oil stocks among the seven out of 11 sectors that rose. The big miners gained but the big banks dropped. Tech, healthcare and financial firms were weaker. The best performers on the benchmark index were BlueScope Steel (+5.1pc), brick maker Brickworks (+4.8pc) and Flight Centre (+3.8pc) after pre-travel COVID-19 tests for international arrivals were scrapped. The laggards were biotech Imugene (-5.2pc), battery materials firm Novonix (-4.5pc) and online bookmaker Pointsbet (-3.3pc). Virtus Health (-0.25pc) said its purchaser, CapVest Partners, received approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board for its takeover. The Australian dollar bought 75.12 US cents at 4:20pm AEDT, after rising to a nearly five-month high of 75.28. It is being driven by higher commodity prices and expectations of a local interest rate rise by the Reserve Bank. It rose to a six-year high against the weaker Japanese yen of 92.01, but was buying 91.32 at 4:20pm AEDT. Retailer Premier Investments said Delta lockdowns in Sydney and Melbourne hurt its profit for the first half of the financial year. The owner of fashion chain Peter Alexander and children's stationery firm Smiggle saw net profit fell by 13 per cent to $163 million in the 26 weeks to January 29 as revenue slipped. Chairman Solomon Lew said the first half of fiscal 2022 was one of the most challenging and unpredictable halves of the pandemic. ""Under government mandates, stores in our largest markets were shut for most of the first quarter, equating to 42,675 trading days."" Despite that, the firm saw record online sales over the half. Its shares rose early on as investors received a record 46 cents a share interim dividend. Premier's shares closed the day down 1.6 per cent. Energy firm AGL announced it would invest $41 million with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency in its battery project in Broken Hill in outback New South Wales. The 50 megawatt Broken Hill battery is part of AGL's planned 850 megawatt grid-scale battery network under development. AGL is receiving nearly $15 million from the government agency. Its shares rose 1.3 per cent. Origin Energy said it was awaiting advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade regarding Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, who is on Australia's sanctions list. A company controlled by Mr Vekselberg has a 16 per cent stake in Falcon Oil & Gas, Origin's joint venture partner in the Beetaloo Basin in the Northern Territory. Origin executive Tim O'Grady told a parliamentary committee that the company believed it had done the right thing and would happily comply with any DFAT directives in full. ""We have no relationship at all. There is an interest by Mr Vekselberg but it is a passive interest,"" he said. Falcon said this week that Mr Vekselberg's stake had been quarantined since US sanctions were imposed in 2018. Origin shares rose 1.4 per cent. Wall Street jumped on good economic data and as investors bought the dip. The Dow Jones index put on 1 per cent to 34,708, the S&P 500 rose 1.4 per cent to 4,520, and the Nasdaq gained 1.9 per cent to 14,192. Technology stocks like Nvida and Intel boosted the market. The greenback rose for the fourth time in the past five sessions as economic data continued expectations that the US central bank would raise interest rates rapidly this year to curb inflation. Initial jobless claims fell to 187,000 last week, seasonally adjusted, the lowest since September 1969. Meanwhile, durable goods orders fell last month as shipments slowed. Bitcoin rose 3.5 per cent to $43,859. In Europe, the FTSE 100 index rose 0.1 per cent to 7,467, the DAX fell 0.07 per cent to 14,274, and the CAC 40 fell 0.4 per cent to 6,556.

46,"Russia to sell gas in roubles, ASX ekes out gain",markets,"  Russia to sell gas in roubles as sanctions bite, ASX turns positive on oil rally Russia says it will sell gas to some countries in roubles, and Australian shares have edged higher helped by a new surge in oil prices. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would seek payment in roubles for gas sales to ""unfriendly"" countries in response to the Western sanctions crippling Russia's economy. The world's commodity trade is usually conducted in US dollars. The Russian President's plan would further disrupt commodity markets. At a televised meeting with government ministers, Mr Putin said Russia would continue to supply natural gas in line with existing contracts. ""The changes will only affect the currency of payment, which will be changed to Russian roubles,"" Mr Putin said. Moscow has drawn up a list of unfriendly countries which includes the United States, European Union members, Britain and Japan. Russian state oil giant Gazprom has been tasked with modifying contracts. The news saw European gas prices soar as Russia supplies around 40 per cent of Europe's gas. Whether European nations will pay for gas in roubles is another question. Germany said the shift to roubles was a breach of contract, while Italy said it would likely continue payments in euros. Mr Putin's announcement also saw the rouble jumped to a one-month high against the greenback, to 87.50 US cents. Nickel prices jumped 15 per cent, to $US32,380 a tonne, and other industrial metals also increased because of disruptions from the conflict and higher energy prices. Nickel prices continue to be volatile after the price jumped to $US100,000 earlier this month. As Russia bombed the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, Western leaders gathered in Brussels to plan more measures to force Russia to end its war in Ukraine. US President Joe Biden and his European counterparts will announce new sanctions against Russia. They will also discuss whether to impose further energy sanctions on Russia, and whether the US can supply LNG and hydrogen to Europe to replace Russian gas. Several nations have banned the import of Russian oil, including the US, the UK and Australia. Bloomberg has reported that Russian central bank governor Elivra Nabiullina sought to resign after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But Mr Putin reportedly rejected the resignation and she was nominated for a new five-year term last week. The Russian central bank's press office told Russian state media the report ""doesn't correspond to reality"". Ms Nabiullina is highly regarded by investors as one of the world's best monetary policymakers. Oil prices jumped more than 5 per cent due to sanctions on Russia threatening fuel shortages and disrupting the oil market. There also weather related disruptions to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium pipeline on the Black Sea, which transports Russian and Kazakh crude oil exports. Russia is the world's biggest oil exporter and supplies nearly half of Europe's energy. Brent crude rose 5.4 per cent, to $US121.57 a barrel, while West Texas crude oil rose 5 per cent, to $US114.57 a barrel overnight. Brent crude neared its record high earlier this month because of the war. And local petrol prices are at record highs, driving inflation. Spot gold put on 1.3 per cent, to $US19445.42 an ounce. Oil prices edged lower in Asian trade, with Brent crude down 0.5 per cent to $US120.96 a barrel at 4:15pm AEDT. Spot gold fell 0.2 per cent to $US1,939.68 an ounce in afternoon trade. The Australian dollar gained on the rise in commodity prices, to just above 75 US cents overnight, a four-month high. It fell 0.2 per cent to 74.82 US cents at 4:30pm AEDT. The world's biggest bond investor, PIMCO, said the war had ""cast an even thicker layer of uncertainty"" on the already uncertain economic outlook. The Australian market opened lower but turned positive during the day, helped by stronger energy stocks and miners. By the close, the All Ordinaries index rose 0.05 per cent to 7,669, and the ASX 200 lifted 0.1 per cent to 7,387. Utilities, energy firms, miners and consumer staples gained, but financial firms, healthcare and technology stocks weighed on the market. Crown Resorts was found to be unsuitable to hold a casino licence in Perth by the Perth Casino Royal Commission because it facilitated money laundering and criminal activity. However, the commission did not recommend that Crown be stripped of its casino licence. Instead, an independent manager will be appointed to oversee all of its operations comply with regulations. That move boosted Crown (+0.2pc) shares. Crown said it would review the report and would work co-operatively and constructively with the Western Australian government. Crown chief executive Steve McCann said the company was committed to continuous improvement across all its resorts, including Crown Perth. ""This includes investment in people, systems, processes, culture and a sharp focus on responsible gaming and the prevention of financial crime."" Crown has replaced most of its board and management over the past year as it seeks to hold onto its gaming licences. Westpac is the latest of the big four banks to reduce standard variable home loan rates. Westpac cut its variable rate by 0.1 per cent, to 2.09 per cent, for people with a 30 per cent deposit, making it the lowest variable rate of the big four. RateCity said St George and the Bank of Melbourne were offering a 2.04 per cent rate for borrowers with a 40 per cent deposit. Fixed home loan rates have continued to rise because of increasing borrowing costs Westpac lifted its one- to five-year rates for owner occupiers and investors by up to 0.3 per cent. It raised its three-year fixed rate from 3.44 per cent to 3.74 per cent, increasing the repayment on a $500,000 loan by $84 a month. The rate was 1.88 per cent a year ago. ANZ has carried out the first payment by an Australian bank-issued $A stablecoin through a blockchain transaction. This A$DC payment was made by investment firm Victor Smorgon Group, through its stake in the Zerocap platform, which invests in digital and technology assets like cryptocurrency. The investment firm did not have to convert Australian dollars to US dollars to do the transaction. Zerocap said $30 million A$DC was transferred from ANZ to Zerocap ""in seconds"". A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency with a value linked to a commodity, currency or algorithm to manage supply. The Reserve Bank is looking at issuing a central bank digital coin. ANZ head of banking services Nigel Dobson said the bank-issued stablecoin was a first and important step to enable customers to safely and securely use digital transactions. ""Stablecoins are a new way for customers to transact and, in this case, was an efficient and direct way for Victor Smorgon Group to access Zerocap's digital asset exchange and move funds across a decentralised network,"" he said. ANZ also launched a new digital banking service called ANZ Plus. Bitcoin rose 1.4 per cent to $US42,976 at 4:45pm AEDT. National Australia Bank has completed a $2.5 billion buyback of its shares and announced a further buyback of up to another $2.5 billion. ""The further $2.5 billion on market buyback announced today supports our ambition to reduce share count and increase sustainable ROE (return on equity) benefits for our shareholders,"" NAB chief executive Ross McEwan said. The bank expects to commence the further buyback following the release of its half-year results on May 5. NAB shares increased 0.2 per cent, Westpac rose 0.4 per cent, but ANZ and the Commonwealth Bank ended lower. The best-performing stocks were Whitehaven Coal (+6.5pc), brickmaker Brickworks (+5pc), and JB Hifi (+4.4pc), while the laggards were buy-now, pay-later firm Zip (-5.1pc), and healthcare stocks Polynovo (-4.3pc) and Healius (-4.2pc). Brickworks reported a record net profit of $581 million, with demand for building products driving the result. The electronics retailer JB Hifi said increased customer demand and strong sales growth drove an 11 per cent rise in sales over the first few months of the year. Telecommunications firm Uniti Group (-0.6pc)  lost ground, despite confirming it had received a higher takeover bid from Macquarie Group and Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board. Investment house Washington H. Soul Pattinson (+1.3pc) made a net loss of $643 million for the first half of 2022, compared to a profit the year earlier. It said profit before one-offs rose nearly four fold to $343.7 million thanks to higher revenue. US stocks were hit by the rally in oil prices and finished lower. At the close of trade, the Dow Jones index fell 1.3 per cent, to 34,359, the S&P 500 lost 1.2 per cent, to 4,456 and the Nasdaq dropped 1.3 per cent, to 13,923. Computer software firm Adobe lost 10 per cent after it forecast lower second-quarter revenue. Technology stocks such as Tesla and Apple gained. Video game retailer Gamestop jumped after chairman Ryan Cohen's investment company bought 100,000 shares. Prices in the United Kingdom surged to a new 30-year high of 6.2 per cent — more than expected. A budget update and a cut in petrol tax by Finance Minister Rishi Sunak failed to soothe investors nerves. In London, the FTSE 100 lost 0.2 per cent, to 7,461, the DAX in Germany fell 1.3 per cent, to 14,284, and the CAC 40 fell 1.2 per cent, to 6,581.

47,Evergrande says it is on track to restructuring after shares suspended and billions seized by banks ,markets,"  Evergrande says it is on track to restructuring after shares suspended and billions seized by banks Embattled Chinese developer Evergrande has assured investors it will unveil a debt restructuring proposal for its creditors by the end of July, after concerns about its financial health were renewed by a delay in publishing its annual results. Evergrande, whose $US22.7 billion ($30.5 billion) worth of offshore debt is deemed to be in default, is seeking to ""further enhance communications"" with creditors to reach the end-of-July target, its executive director Shawn Siu told investors on a call. Earlier on Tuesday, Evergrande said in a stock exchange filing it would not meet a March 31 deadline to file its financial results for 2021 because audit work had not been completed. The world's most indebted property developer, Evergrande told investors in January it aimed to have a preliminary restructuring proposal in place within six months. A wave of defaults in China's property sector has rattled investors and while state intervention has quelled market concern over a disorderly collapse of Evergrande, investors are still in the dark over whether they will recoup their money. Troubled Chinese property giant Evergrande's shares have been suspended from trading on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Evergrande, once China's top-selling developer and now reeling under more than $400 billion in liabilities, defaulted on some overseas bond payments in December and has struggled to repay suppliers and creditors and complete projects and homes. The developer set up a risk management committee in December made up mostly of members from state enterprises, as the Guangdong provincial government is leading the restructuring. ""With the broad support and understanding from the majority of creditors … we strive to release the preliminary restructuring proposal by the end of July,"" Chen Yong, a member of the committee, told investors on Tuesday night. As part of its plans to divest assets to repay some of its offshore debt, the developer is working to sell its Yuen Long land parcel in Hong Kong as well as the Evergrande Centre commercial building, said Evergrande board member Liang Senlin. Trading in shares of Evergrande, its property services unit Evergrande Property Services Group, and electric vehicle unit China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group, have been suspended since Monday. Mr Liang said on the investor call that the developer was trying to rope in strategic investors in both the electric vehicle (EV) and property services units to restore value — a goal it has been pursuing for roughly a year without much success. Mr Siu said the EV unit aimed to start mass production in June of its inaugural electric car, the Hengchi 5 sport-utility vehicle, after getting approval to start sales last week. Some of the investors who attended the call were not impressed with the assurances from management. ""They mainly explained why the trading of stocks is suspended,"" said a bondholder who was on the call, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media. ""There was no new information and the situation remained the same."" Earlier on Tuesday, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Evergrande planned to return land used as collateral for a trust loan to the Guangzhou government, providing a model for local authority involvement that could be replicated for other indebted Chinese property firms. Once a symbol of glittering success, China's biggest property group is tanking, dragging many of its competitors with it, writes Ian Verrender. The deal centres around a 3.25 billion yuan ($685.4 million) trust loan that CITIC Trust issued to Evergrande using funds raised from investors, according to the sources and a document reviewed by Reuters partially outlining the plan. Under the plans, CITIC will return the land used as collateral to Evergrande, which will then pass it on to the Guangzhou city government to put up for sale, the sources said. State-owned Guangzhou City Construction Investment Group will act as a guarantor of the loan and CITIC will repay the principal amount to its investors within two years using funds from the Guangzhou city government, the sources said. The plan is still pending approval from the investors of the trust loan, one of the people said. If successfully implemented, this model of local government and creditors working together to resolve Evergrande's debt repayment issue could be replicated for other trust loans, analysts said, and more state-owned city investment companies may become involved in the firm's debt restructuring process. Evergrande, CITIC and Guangzhou City Construction Investment did not respond to requests for comment. Trust companies, which pool money from wealthy investors, are an important source of funding for Evergrande and other property developers in China. In a separate filing on Tuesday, Evergrande said its Property Services Group had launched an investigation into how banks seized 13.4 billion yuan ($2.82 billion) in deposits that had been pledged as security for third-party guarantees. The seizure of the funds, which the property services unit discovered when it was preparing its annual report, underscores the turmoil at Evergrande, which said it would hire King & Wood Mallesons as an additional legal adviser.

48,ASX and US stocks gain as investors prepare for more US rate rises,markets,"  ASX boosted by financials and technology stocks as investors prepare for more US interest rate rises The Australian share market has risen for the fifth time in six trading sessions as investors pulled out of bonds and back into shares amid expectations of rapid rises in US interest rates. The All Ordinaries index climbed 0.6 per cent to 7,665, while the ASX 200 index put on 0.5 per cent to 7,378, reaching a fresh two-month high during the session. Most sectors were higher, with financial firms and technology stocks bolstering the market, and miners the main weak spot after five days of rises. The best performers were technology company Uniti Group (+10.6pc) on a reports of a new takeover bid, biotech firm Imugene (+9.6pc) on approval for a cancer treatment study, and online bookmaker Pointsbet (+8.3pc). Uniti went into a trading halt pending an announcement late in the afternoon. Losing ground were healthcare firm Fisher & Paykel (-7.8pc) after it said higher freight costs were squeezing profit margins, biotech Mesoblast (-6pc) and miner Champion Iron (-3.4pc). Oil and gas producer Santos (-0.3pc) lost its gains, despite announcing a new oil discovery off the coast of Western Australia. It confirmed a significant oil discovery at its Pavo-1 exploration well near its Dorado facility, approximately 160 kilometres north-east of Port Hedland. Santos chief executive Kevin Gallagher said the discovery was ""a great result."" ""With the global oil and gas markets seeing increased volatility, low-CO2 oil and gas resources at Dorado and Pavo add significantly to Australia's national energy security,"" he said. Carnarvon Energy jumped more than one third because it owns a 30 per cent interest in Pavo-1. It ended up 14.1 per cent to $0.37. Oil prices rose in Asian trade after falling overnight. At 4:15pm, Brent crude oil climbed 1.2 per cent $US116.88 a barrel, while spot gold was lower at $1,920.67 an ounce. Outdoor adventure wear maker, KMD Brands, the owner of Kathmandu and Rip Curl brands, has swung from profit to a half year net loss of $NZ5.5 million ($5.1 million) because of flat sales over the six months to the end of January. Chief executive Michael Daly said Kathmandu and Rip Curl stores in Australasia were hurt by COVID-19 closures over the first quarter of the financial year, but recovered strongly in the second quarter. KMD shares rose 3.7 per cent to $1.28. Insurance Australia Group (-1.3pc) updated the market on the latest test case involving COVID-19 business interruption claims. It said it was maintaining its net provisions of $1.2 billion for potential business interruption insurance claims. Regional airline Rex said it would raise domestic and regional airfares on Friday because of surging oil prices and rising inflation. Fares will increase by $10, with some larger increases on lower-priced promotional fares. Rex shares fell 0.4 per cent to $1.24. The Australian dollar rose to a five month high of 74.76 US cents in morning trade, after rising by 1 per cent overnight on the prospect of high commodity prices continuing. At 4:20pm AEDT the local currency was buying around 74.57 US cents, down 0.15 per cent. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo increased 3 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.4 per cent in afternoon trade. Debt-laden Chinese property developer Evergrande promised to unveil a debt restructuring plan by the end of July after it said it would not meet an end of March deadline to file its 2021 financial results because the audit work had not been completed. The corporate regulator is running the ruler over the marketing of the $4.4 trillion managed funds industry to mum and dad investors. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission said it was concerned that consumers were being misled to expect high returns in volatile, low-yield conditions. The regulator is examining traditional and digital media advertising by investment funds and product statement disclosures targeting retail and unsophisticated investors, including retirees. ""ASIC remains concerned that managed fund promoters continue to target consumers,  particularly retirees or those planning for retirement, with ambiguous or misleading performance and risk representations,"" said ASIC deputy chairwoman Karen Chester. ASIC has taken legal action recently against fund managers for misleading or false advertising, including the Mayfair 101 Group and La Trobe Financial Asset Management. The National Skills Commission's internet vacancy index jumped by 3.6 per cent in February, bringing job ads to a 13.5-year high of 269,746 available positions. CommSec said employment vacancies were at record highs for 15 occupations, with hospitality workers the most in demand, followed by general inquiry clerks, call centre workers, receptionists and food trade workers. The demand for labour was highest in New South Wales and Victoria. Senior economist Ryan Felsman expects the official unemployment rate to fall to 3.8 per cent in the second half of 2022 and the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates by June. The jobless rate dropped to an equal record low of 4 per cent last month, the lowest since August 2008. US stocks have gained overnight, boosted by technology shares, as markets absorb plans by the US central bank to further raise interest rates to curb surging inflation. On Monday, local time, US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said that inflation was ""much too high"" and vowed to take ""necessary steps"" to tackle price rises. Federal Reserve official James Bullard told Bloomberg TV overnight that the US central bank should raise its benchmark interest rate to 3 per cent this year. ""The Fed needs to move aggressively to keep inflation under control."" ""Faster is better,"" he said. However, billionaire US investor Carl Icahn said a US recession, or worse, could be on the horizon because of surging inflation and the war in Ukraine. He told CNBC that it was unclear whether the Federal Reserve could engineer a soft landing. The Dow Jones index rose 0.7 per cent, to close at 34,807, the S&P 500 increased 1.1 per cent, to 4,512, and the Nasdaq put on nearly 2 per cent, to 14,109. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet were among the firms that drove higher the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Shares in sportswear company Nike (+2.2pc) rose after its quarterly profit and revenue were better than expected. Tesla (+7.9pc) gained as it delivered its first German-made cars at its Gruenheide gigafactory, its inaugural European hub. Elon Musk, the founder of the electric car maker, danced and joked with fans as thirty clients and their families got a first glimpse of their new vehicles. Tesla said manufacturing issues that previously hampered production because of the pandemic had eased. In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 0.5 per cent, to 7,477, the DAX in Germany rose 1 per cent, to 14,473, and the CAC 40 increased 1 per cent, to 6,659. Major energy traders warned of gas and diesel shortages in Europe as well as the potential for an economic recession as markets struggle to absorb the potential loss of about two million barrels of oil a day from Russia, one of the world's biggest energy exporters. The chief executives of four of the biggest energy traders — Vitol, Gunvor, Mercuria and Trafigura — said the gas market had become dysfunctional because of unmanageable margin calls. Margin calls arise when the gap between the market price and the future sale becomes too wide, forcing traders to increase the deposit they hold at commodity exchanges on each trade. ""The longer the war goes on, the greater the chance of an economic recession,"" Vitol chief executive Russell Hardy told the FT Commodities Global Summit. Mercuria chief executive Marco Dunand said he expects Gulf countries to benefit most from higher oil prices. ""From an economic perspective, Russia will be a loser."" ""Europe won't do particularly well either with a refugee crisis...(and) higher commodity prices,"" he said. The war in Ukraine has restricted Russian exports and led to the highest oil prices since 2008. However, oil prices edged lower overnight, with the European Union looking less likely to ban Russian oil. Brent crude fell 0.2 per cent, to settle at $US115.48 a barrel. Spot gold lost 0.8 per cent, to $US1,920.64 an ounce. European Union foreign ministers are split on calls for sanctions on Russian oil and gas supplies. The EU relies on Russia for 40 per cent of its gas. France's TotalEnergies is the latest global company to boycott Russian commodities, saying that it will not renew its Russian gas oil and crude oil supply contracts for its German refinery. Russian and Kazakhstan oil exports via the Caspian Pipeline Consortium from the Black Sea may fall by up to 1 million barrels of oil per day, or 1 per cent of global oil production, because of a damaged berth, according to a Russian official. A storm in Russia's section of the Black Sea has damaged loading equipment belonging to CPC, one of the world's biggest oil pipelines that ships crude oil from Kazakhstan to global markets. Pavel Sorokin, Russia's Deputy Energy Minister, said maintenance could take up to two months, which could lead to exports falling by 1 million barrels of oil per day.

49,ASX lower; Magellan's Hamish Douglass resigns while Woolworths to ban plastic bags in WA,markets,"  ASX lower; Magellan's Hamish Douglass resigns while Woolworths to ban plastic bags in WA Australian shares have closed lower despite early gains boosted by tech and mining stocks. The ASX 200 was down 0.2 per cent, to 7,279, breaking a three-day winning streak from last week. Industrial, health care and financial sectors were dragging the benchmark index lower. Financials declined 0.6 per cent, with the country's four largest lenders dropping between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent. Gold stocks dropped 2 per cent as demand for the safe-haven metal was hit by hopes of progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, as well as the fallout from a US interest rate hike. Northern Star Resources and Newcrest Mining fell 2.4 per cent and 2.7 per cent, respectively. Among the worst performers were De Grey Mining (-7.7pc), Atlas Arteria (-3.7pc) and Clinuvel Pharmacy (-4.9pc). However, technology stocks tracked their US peers higher, to climb 2.5 per cent, their highest level since early February. Block surged 9.2 per cent, to $184.40, while Life360 was up 6.4 per cent, to $5.62, and Eml Payments was up 6.1 per cent, to $2.61. Miners rose 0.3 per cent in their fourth straight day of gains, as iron ore prices scaled a one-week high on Friday. Sector heavyweights Rio Tinto, Fortescue Metals Group and BHP rose between 0.1 and 0.8 per cent. Energy stocks gained 0.4 per cent after oil prices surged on Monday. Brent crude was up 3.3 per cent, trading at $US111.52 a barrel. Tony Sycamore, senior market analyst from City Index, said today's session was a disappointing start to the week. ""After punching through numerous headwinds last week, today’s reversal lower indicates stocks will find sellers at higher levels as the ugly macroeconomic backdrop of persistently high inflation, a full-scale war in Europe, sanctions, price shocks in commodities, and tighter monetary policy persists."" Meanwhile, Magellan Financial Group (MFG) co-founder Hamish Douglass has resigned from the board. He stepped down as chairman in February after seeking medical leave. MFG said that ""his resignation as a director of the Magellan Board is due solely to his medical leave of absence"". Its shares were down 4.3 per cent to $15.06. Logistics services provider Qube has announced an off-market $400 million buy-back. The company's half-year results posted record underlying earnings following strong financial performance and completion of the Moorebank Logistics Park transaction, which have ""contributed to a strong capital position, allowing [Qube] to announce the [buy-back]"". Shareholder registry firm Link Administration rose 1.2 per cent to $5.15. The company said it received a conditional, non-binding proposal from wealth management platform operator FNZ Group to buy LNK's retirement & superannuation solutions unit for $1.5 billion. Woolworths shed 0.6 per cent, to $35.84, after the company's announcement it would phase out its 15-cent plastic shopping bags in Western Australia over the next month. The Australian dollar was down, at 74 US cents. Global equity markets gained on Friday after traders cheered a Russian bond payment that averted a historic sovereign default, while gold prices dropped as demand for the safe-haven metal eased after the start of the US interest rate hike cycle. The Russian finance ministry announced on Thursday that it had sent funds to cover $US117 million in coupon payments on $US2-denominated sovereign bonds that came due this week. Those payments calmed investor worries that a Russia sovereign default, which would have been its first in a century, could rattle already nervous markets. Western sanctions have hobbled Russia's financial dealings since it invaded Ukraine on February 24. ""If you think about where we could have been if Western governments had disallowed the use of frozen funds for coupon payments on Russian sovereign bonds, we would be sitting on a default [by] a world economy,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Virginia. ""As a result of that, some of the biggest impacts to the global financial system are being put off into the future: That's good."" MSCI's gauge of world stocks, which tracks equities in 50 countries across the globe gained 0.9 per cent. European stocks closed higher as peace talks to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict continued amid heavy fighting. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.9 per cent. Wall Street's three major indexes closed higher, boosted by recently battered technology stocks, after talks between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping over the Ukraine crisis ended without any big surprises. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent, to 34,754.93, the S&P 500 gained 1.17 per cent, to 4,463.12, and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.05 per cent, to 13,893.84. ""We're in the middle of a relief rally after such a deep sell-off in tech in advance of the likely path of rates by the Fed. Now that they've basically removed all the uncertainty about rates, tech stocks can reprice,"" Cox added.

50,"ASX rises on mining and energy stocks, Qube dodges ACCC enforcement action while Star dives",markets,"  ASX rises on mining and energy stocks, Qube dodges ACCC enforcement action while Star dives Australian shares rose for a third straight session on Friday as investors weighed economic consequences of the US Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate stance. The ASX 200 was up 44 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 7,294, with mining and energy stocks leading the advance. The benchmark index has gained 3.3 per cent this week, posting its best week in more than a year. AMP's chief economist Shane Oliver noted that the share market's rebound was helped by optimism about a peace deal in Ukraine, a fall back in oil prices, relief from the expected US Fed’s rate hike and stimulus indications in China. ""If [a peace deal] is reached, markets would see a strong bounce, but if not, things could get a lot worse before they get better,"" he said. ""So, Ukraine-related risks for investment markets remain high in the short term."" Jessica Amir, market strategist from Saxo Markets, observed that the end-of-quarter gains are likely to be short lived. ""Portfolio rebalancing from now to the end of quarter is likely to take place, where fund managers bring asset allocations back into alignment, meaning commodity darlings that have gone up the most this year are likely to see some profit taking or selling,"" she said. ""And some managers could also be forced to top up [buy] downward-facing tech stocks, given tech is down the most this quarter as its margins will be squeezed as interest rates rise."" Miners climbed 1.5 per cent on strong iron ore prices, but were set for a second straight weekly drop weighed down by gyrating commodity prices. Sector heavyweights Rio Tinto, Fortescue Metals Group and BHP Group rose between 1.3 per cent and 2.2 per cent. Liontown Resources soared 7.8 per cent to $1.7. Energy stocks gained nearly 2.2 per cent on surging oil prices amid fears of supply shortage in the coming weeks due to sanctions on Russia. Paladin Energy (+7pc) and Beach Energy (+1.6pc) were among the top movers. Conflict between Russia and Ukraine is likely to increase cost-of-living pressures, even far away in Australia, as fuel and fertiliser prices soar. Major oil and gas explorers Woodside Petroleum and Santos advanced 2.7 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively. Technology stocks (+1.6pc) tracked their US peers higher, with Block Inc jumping 7.2 per cent while WiseTech Global up 3.3 per cent. Financials were up 0.4 per cent, resulting in a four-day winning streak. Healthcare stocks were flat (+0.1pc), dragged down by a 0.1 per cent drop in biotech giant CSL. Qube Holdings was flat at $3, after the ACCC said it would not pursue enforcement action in relation to Qube’s acquisition of Newcastle Agri Terminal (NAT), but remains concerned with potential impacts on the supply chain for bulk grain export through the Port of Newcastle. The ACCC also said it would continue to monitor developments in the industry. Megaport and Abacus Property dropped 8.1 per cent and 5.9 per cent respectively. Star Entertainment shares were down 3.6 per cent to $3.2 after media reports on money laundering allegations, hitting their lowest level since late 2020. All three of Wall Street's major indexes closed higher, up more than 1 per cent, on Thursday. Investors were reassured that Russia may, at least for now, have averted what would have been its first external bond default in a century. This was because creditors received payment, in dollars, of Russian bond coupons which fell due this week, two market sources told Reuters on Thursday. That outcome added to risk appetites in a market that was benefiting from some bargain-hunting. The Fed had raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, as expected, and forecast an aggressive plan for further hikes, while policymakers also trimmed economic growth projections for the year. Russia's payment news and a breaking of technical decline lines ""to the upside"" in indices — including the S&P and the Nasdaq — all boosted stocks, according to Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities. ""It's giving investors an increased level of cautious optimism, which is a change from the significant pessimism we've been experiencing since early January,"" Mr James said. ""People have gotten more comfortable with the fact rates are going higher. This has been talked about, ad nauseum, [by Fed] chairman [Jerome] Powell since early December. ""The fact there were no significant negative surprises in the Fed's plans coming out of the meeting, and Powell's commentary, gave people a sense that maybe we've seen as bad as it's going to get in the near term."" Describing the Fed's plans as dovish, Phil Blancato, chief executive of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York also said the continuation of Russia-Ukraine peace talks helped the mood. ""What you're seeing today simply as a spillover effect from yesterday,"" Mr Blancato said. ""There's a potential resolution for the conflict overseas, the positive effects of the Federal Reserve and stocks at a very fair entry point, providing an opportunity to add risk."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.23 per cent, to 34,480.76, the S&P 500 gained 1.23 per cent to 4,411.67 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.33 per cent to 13,614.78. European stocks also gained in choppy trading after the Fed's rate hike and a similar move by the Bank of England. The Bank of England raised interest rates again on Thursday in a bid to stop fast-rising inflation becoming entrenched, but it softened its language on the need for more increases as households face a huge hit from soaring energy bills. Eight of the nine Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members voted to raise Bank Rate to 0.75 per cent from 0.5 per cent, taking the benchmark for UK borrowing costs back to its pre-pandemic level. The British central bank has now raised rates at three consecutive meetings for the first time since 1997. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.5 per cent, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.5 per cent. Meanwhile, the London Metal Exchange (LME) was hit by more glitches early Thursday, which delayed the open and saw nickel futures dropping by 8 per cent limit. The fresh chaos came after a Chinese billionaire's short bet on nickel forcing the LME to shut down on Tuesday. It was the stuff of a Hollywood film: A Chinese tycoon bet on a falling nickel price only to see it skyrocket 250 per cent. Oil prices rose more than 8 per cent, continuing a series of wild daily swings, as the market rebounded from several days of losses on renewed focus on supply shortages in coming weeks due to sanctions on Russia. Benchmark Brent crude futures gained 2 per cent, to $US108.8 a barrel. The Australian dollar was up, at 73.95 US cents. Spot gold lost 0.5 per cent, to stand at $US1,933 an ounce.

51,"Australian shares trade higher, but ASX 24 outage 'a big deal' that could hurt investors",markets,"  ASX jumps after US hikes interest rates for first time since 2018; ASX 24 suffered outage A platform which provides traders with access to the futures market has been restored after a four-hour trading outage, according to the ASX. ASX 24 is used for a suite of interest rate, equity index and commodity futures products trading. The ASX said it identified a hardware-related issue with ASX 24 and placed the system into a halt at around 10am this morning. The market operator has since apologised for the disruption caused by the glitch. ""The issue is isolated to ASX 24 and does not affect ASX Trade, ie, the equities trading platform continues to operate normally,"" it said. However, Tony Sycamore, senior market analyst from City Index, said that the outage was ""a big deal"". ""What this does is effectively [put] the ASX 200 equity futures, which is the futures contract over the ASX 200 as well as the interest rate futures market, on hold,"" he told the ABC. ""You could still probably go and buy single named stocks [like] BHP or CBA and not have any problems, but if you wanted to do a trade over the whole ASX 200 basket of stocks, you couldn't do it at this point."" Mr Sycamore said the outage came at a bad timing as market would react to the new jobless rate, which was released earlier today, but it became a barrier for investors to trade. The ASX 200 closed up 1.1 per cent to 7,251, extending its advance (+1.1pc) from yesterday. Tech stocks surged as much as 3.6 per cent, tracking their US peers. Block Inc's Australian shares jumped 10 per cent and WiseTech Global added 3 per cent. Miners advanced 1.3 per cent on robust iron ore prices, with heavyweights BHP Group, Fortescue Metals and Rio Tinto up between 1.1 per cent and 4.4 per cent. Financials leapt 1 per cent, with CBA, NAB and ANZ rising 1.3 per cent each, while healthcare stocks climbed 1 per cent, with CSL up 0.8 per cent. Bullion prices were steady, helping gold miners rise 0.1 per cent. Newcrest Mining, the country's largest gold miner, was up 1 per cent. Energy stocks advanced 0.3 per cent, with Woodside Petroleum and Santos up 1.3 per cent and 1 per cent respectively. Pointsbet (+10.3pc), Zip (+10.1pc) and Polynovo (+8.3pc) were among the top movers. Among the worst performers were Gold Road Resources, Graincorp and Domino's Pizza, dropping 3.3 per cent, 2.8 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively. The Australian dollar was up at 73.07 US cents. The US central bank announced a quarter-percentage-point increase in its benchmark overnight rate as was widely expected, but the projection that its rate would hit between 1.75 per cent and 2 per cent by year's end appeared to be more hawkish than some investors had anticipated. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking after the end of the latest two-day policy meeting, said the economy was strong and that officials would raise rates more aggressively at future meetings if needed to control inflation. ""The way we're thinking about this is that every meeting is a live meeting,"" Mr Powell said in a news conference. ""We're going to be looking at evolving conditions, and if we do conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly to remove accommodation, then we'll do so."" Mr Powell said the US economy should ""flourish"" even in an environment where borrowing costs are rising and stimulus is being removed. ""It's clearly time to raise interest rates and begin the balance sheet shrinkage,"" he said. While the Fed flagged the massive uncertainty the economy faces from the war between Russia and Ukraine and the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, it said ""ongoing increases"" in the target federal funds rate ""will be appropriate"" to curb the highest inflation the country has witnessed in 40 years. Market analysts reacted to the Fed announcement with caution. ""This looks like a Fed that is intending on causing recession in order to stamp out the inflation problem and that is as short sighted as calling inflation transitory a year ago,” said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer of Horizon Investments in North Carolina. Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at Natixis in New York, was also concerned about the Fed's impact on the economy. “They’re going to try to be aggressive here in raising rates. I wish Jay Powell and company all the best of luck because they're not going to get anywhere near as they think, unless they’re willing to throw a lot of people out of jobs, because that's what's going to happen. Because we're going to have a recession. This is a recession forecast,"" he said. ""I just don't see the Fed being able to engineer this kind of tightening for what right now is inflationary demand destruction."" Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, said that many investors may just be relieved the Fed was taking action. ""Hearing the Fed finally 'say and act' to tackle inflation is somewhat calming for the investment community, and for Main Street struggling with higher inflation."" Sonal Desai, CIO of Franklin Templeton Fixed Income, said she was surprised the hiking cycle was as short as it appeared to be. ""The terminal rate has not changed at 2.8 per cent, which means we will end the hiking cycle with real rates barely positive (using Fed’s own forecasts),"" she said in a note. ""Not clear what actually brings inflation down as quickly as is anticipated given this."" On Wall Street, the Dow, benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq all closed higher after choppy trading following the central bank's moves. The gains were driven by stocks in the technology, financials and consumer discretionary sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.55 per cent to 34,063.1, the S&P 500 gained 2.24 per cent to 4,357.86 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.77 per cent to 13,436.55. Historical data suggests tighter monetary policy has often been accompanied by solid gains in stocks. The S&P 500 has returned an average 7.7 per cent in the first year the Fed raises rates, according to a Deutsche Bank study of 13 hiking cycles since 1955. Ahead of the Fed statement, stocks had been rallying as talk of compromise from both Moscow and Kyiv on a status for Ukraine outside of NATO lifted hope on Wednesday for a potential breakthrough after three weeks of war. The global mood had also been lifted earlier by China's promise to roll out more stimulus for the economy and keep markets stable. European stocks closed at over two-week highs on Wednesday. The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed up 3.1 per cent. Oil lost ground for the fifth time in the past six days as traders reacted to hoped-for progress in Russia-Ukraine peace talks and a surprising increase in US inventories. On oil markets, Brent crude settled below $US100 per barrel at $US98.02, down 1.9 per cent. Safe-haven gold rebounded after falling to more than a two-week low earlier in the session.

NAB analysts believe that drop is more to do with soaring COVID-19 cases in China than optimism about an end to the war in Ukraine. ""Even if it were to occur, (an end to hostilities) would not lead to an immediate lifting of sanctions, self-imposed or otherwise on Russian oil,"" analysts said. ""It more likely reflects a combination of some speculative froth being blown off, alongside fears of weaker China demand as more Chinese cities are put into lockdown amid record high COVID case numbers.""

It comes a day before the latest business data out in the US showed a continued recent weakness in March. ""The weakness in the NY survey will need to be corroborated by other business surveys to suggest an initial negative impact on the US economy from the Ukraine war,"" ANZ said.

53,"Australian dollar drops, while falling price of Brent crude hits local oil companies",markets,"  Australian dollar drops, while falling price of Brent crude hits local oil companies Australian oil producers and the local currency are taking a hit, as the price of Brent crude oil comes down from weeks of frenzied trade. The ASX 200 traded at a 0.7 per cent loss on Tuesday and eventually closed down this amount at 7,098 points. The big losers included miners Champion and Chalice, both with losses of about 10 per cent. On the flip side, Uniti Group gained 27 per cent on reports it is in discussions to be bought out. Some of the other companies being hit with losses at almost 5 per cent included Beach Energy and BHP, which both have interests in oil production. That's as the price of oil fell overnight, with Brent crude down almost 6 per cent, to around $US106 a barrel, by 8:30am (AEDT). The oil price had been climbing for weeks on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia is the world's second biggest producer of the critical commodity, and the conflict had thrown this global supply into question. But now the price of it is coming down off its high on Russia-Ukraine peace talks, with some delegates from both sides saying that draft agreements could be reached within days. Surging fuel prices and supply chain disruptions will continue to unsettle the stockmarket, according to new research released today. While inflation in food prices has been understandably grabbing the headlines, a study from comparison website Finder has revealed the cost of petrol is now the most stressful expense for a quarter of respondents. Prices are at record highs, with the national average price of a litre of unleaded petrol now 197.6 cents, according to data from the Australian Institute of Petroleum. In South Australia, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Tasmania the average is higher, above $2 a litre. Consumers have issues, but companies making things for them are also feeling the pinch. The March quarter results from the ACCI – Westpac Survey of Industrial Trends shows manufacturers facing shortages of both people and product; with material shortages not seen since the 1970s and supply chain disruptions set to worsen. Westpac Senior Economist Andrew Hanlan said output improved in early 2022 as the economy reopened but its pace was held back by falling profitability caused by rocketing costs. ""Expectations are positive as respondents anticipate that the expansion in new orders and output will extend into the June quarter,"" he said. ""[But] the survey reports that 46 per cent of respondents experienced rising input costs, up from 38 per cent, reflecting the impact of ongoing supply chain disruptions globally and domestically. ""Cost pressures over the past year are the most pronounced since 2008, prior to the impact of the GFC. ""Workforce shortages also continue to hamper the growth in Australian manufacturing output with labour constraints at their highest level since 1974. ""Although businesses are taking on new hires, these have fallen considerably short of hiring intentions, representing the increasing acute skills crunch as border closures and pandemic disruptions continue to bite. ""Despite manufacturers experiencing an uptick in new orders, profitability is being squeezed, with approximately 50 per cent of manufacturers already reporting higher costs. ""Expectations of new orders also moderated, but remain solid, which will support output going forward."" At 8:45am AEDT, the Australian dollar was fetching 71.88 US cents. The Australian dollar has lost around 1 cent in a day and US tech stocks dived another 2 per cent overnight as investors brace for a US interest rate rise later this week. That also saw European and UK stock markets close higher, with London's FTSE up 0.5 per cent, at 7,193, and the Eurostoxx 600 index up 1.2 per cent. ""Everything seems to be heading towards an acute point where we should have some headway,"" Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital in New York, told Reuters. ""The fact is, neither side has a complete edge and, as a result, talks are the most sensible outcome, with some type of resolution."" However, any optimism about the prospect of an end to the Ukraine conflict was tempered on Wall Street by the near-certainty of a rate rise later this week. ""The Fed is expected to hike rates by 25 basis points (this week) and you're seeing the 10-yield [bonds] rise, which is positive from a yield curve perspective, and implies the flattening may be coming to an end,"" Mr Hayes added. ""We may avoid an inversion and a recession in the near term."" Nonetheless, the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped further into bear market territory, falling another 2 per cent overnight, to 12,581, and now in excess of 20 per cent off its November peak. The sell-off was more subdued on the S&P 500, which had traded higher earlier in the session but closed down 0.7 per cent, at 4,173 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed flat, at 32,945 points.

54,"ASX listed company to buy another chunk of Probuild, as share market claws back some losses",markets,"  ASX rises as lithium miners boost the market; Probuild finds another buyer Australian shares have clawed back some losses on Monday after losing ground for weeks due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. By lunchtime the ASX 200 was up 1.2 per cent to 7,147. It stayed at this level all afternoon and finished marginally higher at 7,150. The All Ordinaries gained a similar amount to finish at 7,422. The top-performing stocks on the benchmark included Elders and Pendal, up 11 per cent and 6.7 per cent respectively. Elders gained ground as the agribusiness company said its financial year 2022 results were forecast to be better than market expectations. A company with lithium interests, Silver Lake, gained 1.9 per cent after announcing it had taken a 5 per cent interest in several exploration projects. The company heading up those projects, Global Lithium Resources, rose 6.6 per cent. Magellan was down 5.6 per cent in the mid-morning as the fund manager reported that the amount under its management had dropped 10.5 per cent to $69 billion. Its losses softened to 1.4 per cent by end of day. The fund's stock has been diving since July, when its performance woes started to become headline news. Paladin was the biggest loser on the benchmark index in early afternoon trade, with a loss of 7.5 per cent. The ASX 200 closed down on Friday and is 4 per cent lower today than it was a year ago. Several states and territories in Australia had public holidays on Monday, which means trading could have been lower than normal. ASX-listed company SRG Global is snapping up Probuild's assets in Western Australia. The Australian construction company collapsed last month and it now has more than 2,000 creditors awaiting news on whether they will recoup losses. SRG Global is taking the Western Australian arm out of voluntary administration for the price tag of $15.2 million. That will assure employment for 275 workers. SRG Global's stock gained 5.6 per cent. The collapse of the construction giant is being dubbed ""nightmarish"" by its administrators. The purchase follows an announcement last week by administrators Deloitte that NSW construction firm Roberts Co will also buy the failed building giant's operations in Victoria. That leaves arms of the company in NSW and Queensland still in limbo. The administrators' first report was delayed after Deloitte's lawyers described it as ""nightmarish"". The price of brent dropped 2.7 per cent, as global markets continue to grapple with rising petrol costs. Russia is the world's second biggest oil exporter, with supply in limbo as it wages war on Ukraine. The ASX's good fortunes today came after Europe also recovered some losses at the end of last week's trade. The DAX gained 1.4 per cent while the FTSE was up 0.8 per cent. Wall Street, however, finished its week on losses, with a drop of 2.2 per cent on the tech-heavy Nasdaq and less severe pains on the S&P 500 and Dow Jones. At 1:00pm AEDT, Dow Jones futures were up, along with those in the other two benchmarks. Key factors to watch on Wall Street this week will be whether the US federal reserve raises rates, along with the ongoing impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war, and crude oil prices. US markets analyst David Bassanese said his ""growing concern"" was the US economy's performance. ""The still upbeat US earnings outlook could be the next shoe to drop,"" he said. ""Especially given the squeeze on real incomes from higher inflation and multiple Fed rate hikes ahead. ""The key issue is whether a soft landing for the US economy will be sufficient to contain inflation and inflation expectations – given a post-COVID recovery, already tight labour market and surging oil prices – or whether Volcker 2.0 will be required."" Russia's central bank has decided not to reopen stock market trading on the Moscow Exchange from March 14 to 18, with the exception of some non-open-market transactions and transactions using the SPFI payment system. The Russian market has been closed for weeks as the country's invasion of Ukraine continues.

55,"Oil surges, pushing up Santos, Paladin and Woodside as ASX falls sharply",markets,"  Oil surges, pushing up Santos, Paladin and Woodside as ASX falls sharply The Australian share market fell sharply on Monday, amid a surge in oil prices as the war in Ukraine continues to rock commodity and equity markets. The benchmark ASX 200 index closed 1 per cent lower at 7,038. The broader All Ordinaries also dropped 1 per cent to 7,321. At 4:30pm AEDT, the global price of Brent crude oil was up more than 10 per cent to $US130.13 a barrel. The US benchmark oil, West Texas intermediate crude, was up 8 per cent at $US125.87. The price of oil soared again as concerns grow about global inflation and the possibility of further sanctions, such as a Western ban on Russian oil and gas, with analysts in Australia predicting the price at the pump could soon hit $2. ""The average Australian family is spending a record $257.46 a month on petrol, up $35 from the beginning of 2022,"" CBA chief economist Craig James said. ""That is effectively 'dead' money or a tax on consumption, meaning that consumers have to either cut back on non-essential spending or dip into savings."" That surge is also pushing up the value of Australian-listed energy companies, which were among those seeing the biggest gains. Woodside was the top-performing stock on the top 200 companies index, up 9 per cent. Santos gained 5.3 per cent. Other top stocks were Ramelius Resources (+6.4pc), IGO Limited (+6.3pc), Beach Energy (+6.3pc) and Gold Resources (+5.9pc). Imugene Limited was the worst-performing stock, down 10.2 per cent. Qantas stocks also tumbled, down 8.5 per cent on rising oil prices. Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield fell 8.4 per cent, Lynas Rare Earths lost -7.7 per cent, and Life360 dropped 7.3 per cent. Globally, energy giant Shell is being criticised for buying oil from Russia. It said it made a ""difficult decision"" to buy Russian crude oil to ensure the supply of the commodity was kept stable in Europe. ""We will continue to choose alternatives to Russian oil wherever possible, but this cannot happen overnight because of how significant Russia is to global supply,"" it said. OPEC last week voted against releasing extra reserves of oil. Palladium, which is used to make catalytic converters, jumped to a record high amid concerns it will be in short supply if there are new sanctions against Russia. The precious metal gained 3.5 per cent to $US3,138.50. Gold was up 1.3 per cent to $US1,992.60 an ounce. ASIC's four-year pursuit of Rio Tinto for breaching continuous disclosure obligations has ended with the Federal Court ordering the miner to pay a $750,000 fine that was agreed to by both parties. Instead of proceeding to trial, last week ASIC and Rio Tinto asked the court to approve a settlement fine. Rio Tinto failed to disclose material information to the ASX from December 2012 to January 2012, including that mining assets held by its coal operations in Mozambique were ""no longer economically viable as long-life, large-scale, tier-one coking coal resources."" ""Rio Tinto had obligations to the market to keep it adequately informed about its mining projects overseas,"" ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said. ""When Rio Tinto was aware of information that Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique was no longer economically viable as a long-life, large-scale, Tier 1 coking coal resource, the market should have been properly informed in a timely manner."" The court also ordered that the regulator drop its proceedings against two former officers of Rio Tinto, Mr Tom Albanese and Mr Guy Elliott. Rio Tinto stocks closed 0.7 per cent lower. Tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and his Canadian partners are set to abandon their takeover bid for the energy giant after the electricity company rejected a second $9 billion offer. AGL stocks were down 1.7 per cent after the company rejected a second offer from tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and his partner Brookfield Asset Management. Mr Cannon-Brookes and Brookfield made an increased offer of $8.25 a share — a 75 cent-per-share increase from the original $7.50 bid made a fortnight ago. AGL said it was ""still well below the fair value"" of the energy company.

56,"ASX drops further on war in Ukraine, while government warns super funds to sell assets in Russia",markets,"  ASX drops further on war in Ukraine, while government warns super funds to sell assets in Russia The Australian share market dropped further on Friday amid news that Russia has shelled a Ukranian nuclear power plant, and Wall Street is set for a rocky day ahead too. Earlier, London's FTSE ended down 2.6 per cent, Germany's DAX lost 2.2 per cent and other majors in the continent saw similar drops. Wall Street also had wobbly afternoon trade, with all three indices ending in the red. The Nasdaq was the most impacted with a loss of 1.6 per cent. The ASX 200 followed at the open, and steadily dropped towards lunchtime as news emerged that Russia was firing on a Ukranian nuclear power station. At 12:30pm AEDT, it was down 1.3 per cent to 7,056 points. It recovered some ground as Ukraine's state emergency service said the fire in a training building near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had been put out. It finished down 0.6 per cent to 7,111 points. Overall, it had recovered some ground this week (1.6pc) but was still down on where it was this time last year. The day's worst-performing stocks were Paladin Energy (-14.8pc) and Zip (-9.4pc). ""Equities [were] generally sold off overnight, particularly in Europe,"" ANZ notes. ""Oil prices seesawed as Ukraine calls for a ceasefire and humanitarian corridors be developed to allow evacuation of its citizens from the bombed cities."" Brent crude soared to an eight-year high yesterday, fuelling concerns that the price at the pump in Australia will soon hit $1.87. However by 8am AEDT, it was down 2 per cent. The local currency rose 0.3 per cent, taking it above 73 US cents. ""AUD/USD is trading comfortably above 73 US cents and is on track to end the quarter near our forecast of 74 US cents,"" CBA said. ""So far, the negative impact of the war on AUD has been brief and modest (AUD temporarily fell by 2 US cents initially). ""Putting aside the social and political consequences, if the net impact of the war is higher energy prices, AUD/USD will benefit because Australia is a large energy exporter."" Meanwhile, the Australian government is calling on superannuation funds to divest from Russia. Australia's sovereign Future Fund and the country's second-largest superannuation fund Aware Super have already announced they will dump Russian assets. ""The government welcomes the voluntary actions taken to date by some superannuation funds to divest their Russian assets,"" a joint statement by the federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Minister for Superannuation Jane Hume said. ""While Australian superannuation funds only have a small exposure to Russian investments in the context of the $3.5 trillion superannuation system, it is important that Australia sends a clear and unequivocal signal that we condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine."" Meanwhile, the latest statistics from the ABS show that supply chain woes are easing for Australian companies but were still at above-average levels. Supply chain woes grew into a big issue for many companies, especially retailers and construction companies, during the pandemic. The latest data for February found more than a third of all businesses were still experiencing disruptions. “This latest data shows supply chain issues had eased compared to January where nearly half of all businesses (47 per cent) reported having them,” ABS head of industry statistics John Shepherd said. ""But still remained at elevated levels compared to when the survey was last collected in April 2021 [30 per cent]."" The survey found the most common supply chain issue facing businesses was domestic and international delivery delays.

57,"Petrol creeping closer to $2 a litre in Australia as oil price surges, while ASX opens higher",markets,"  Petrol creeping closer to $2 a litre in Australia as oil price surges, while ASX opens higher Oil prices have hit an eight-year high and economists are predicting that the average price of petrol at the pump in Australia will soon reach $1.87 a litre. As Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, the price of brent crude is still surging. Overnight it gained another 9.4 per cent, taking the cost of a barrel to almost $US115 ($156). That is a near eight-year high, and a gain of more than 40 per cent so far this year. That gain comes after OPEC, which includes Russia, decided to hold production of the commodity at current levels. ""In its post-meeting statement, OPEC+ said that recent oil price increases are not being driven by fundamentals, but rather geopolitics,"" Capital Economics commodities economist Edward Gardner said. ""By this, of course, OPEC+ is referring to the war in Ukraine and the ensuing Western sanctions. ""Whilst we agree with OPEC+ that a large part of the recent oil price increase is due to a higher risk premium, we also think that the fundamentals have changed. ""In all probability, Russia’s exports will fall, at least in the short term. Foreign buyers of Russian oil have already reported problems accessing the required finance to make their purchases. ""With prices as high as they are now, it is more important than ever that OPEC+ closes its production gap."" The average price at the pump in Australia hit $1.80 last week. Commsec chief economist Craig James is predicting that will soon rise to $1.87. ""The terminal gate price is around 174 cents per litre,"" he told ABC News. ""The gross retail margin is around 13 cents a litre. So the pump price is headed for 187 cents per litre."" Rising oil prices don't just hit people at the bowser. They also float through to the prices of everyday goods that rely on transport and delivery, with rising energy costs a key factor in current inflationary pressures in Australia. Australian petrol prices are at record highs, but it's not just at the service station that your wallet is likely to feel the pain, explains Michael Janda. The price of wheat is also at a 14-year peak, and aluminium hit a record as the Russian attack on Ukraine intensified and Western sanctions disrupted air and sea transport of commodities exported by Russia. ""Meanwhile the Russia Ukraine war rages on, further roiling commodity prices with record moves in coal, oil, gas wheat and aluminium,"" NAB added. The ASX 200 ended up 0.5 per cent at 7,151 points. The top-performing stocks were Whitehaven Coal (+18.2pc) and Pointsbet (+10.6pc). The broader rise was after the benchmark defied global markets yesterday to finish higher. Both European and US markets were buoyant overnight with gains of almost 2 per cent on Wall Street. Germany's DAX ended up 0.7 per cent, while the United Kingdom's FTSE gained 1.4 per cent. That is as the war in Ukraine continues to intensify. NAB said it believed Wall Street was on the upswing, due to comments by US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell about the possibility of rate hikes. ""Rate hikes is the medicine the US economy needs to promote a long expansion,"" it said in a morning note. ""Powell is in favour of a 25bps hike this month but warns a more aggressive approach may be needed if inflation pressures don't abate. ""US equity markets loved Powell’s reassuring remarks."" ANZ is betting that a US rates hike will now happen as soon as next month. ""We now expect the FOMC will raise the Funds rate by 25bp in March,"" it said. ""However, we retain our expectation for 150bp of tightening over 2022 because Powell signalled larger hikes could be warranted later in the year.""

58,"Global markets take a hit on Russian strikes, but ASX defies the trend to rise",markets,"  Global markets take a hit on Russian strikes, but ASX defies the trend to rise The ASX has defied global market sentiment to close up again, despite ongoing shivers over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The ASX 200 opened down 0.5 per cent after Wall Street took on big losses. However, it then recovered ground around lunchtime and eventually ended up 0.3 per cent to 7,117 points. This was as GDP figures were released for Australia showing that it expanded by 3.4 per cent seasonally adjusted from September to December. Winners included Polynovo and Santos, which ended up more than 6.5 per cent. The ASX had been making gains in recent trading sessions after initial heavy losses as the Ukrainian conflict began. However, it is still down 1.3 per cent in the last week and down more than 5 per cent on the same time last year. The choppy Australian market conditions followed big hits to Wall Street overnight. The Dow Jones dropped 1.8 per cent as Russian strikes targeted Kyiv. The other two majors on Wall Street lost 1.6 per cent each. Meanwhile, European markets dived. The DAX and CAC both ended down 3.9 per cent, while the FTSE had lost 1.7 per cent. ""Markets are bracing for a drawn-out conflict and appear to be focusing more on the negative growth implications than inflation risks,"" ANZ notes this morning. ""Expectations of a 50bp rise in US federal funds this month have faded and investors are flocking to the safe haven of US Treasuries amid deteriorating liquidity."" IG trader Kyle Rodda said European equities were ""swan diving"" on the potential of hits to economic activity across the Continent. ""Right now, the fog of war is thick, and things could easily get worse before they get better,"" Rodda said. ""It’s really too hard to know. ""What’s apparent is that given this murkiness, it is risk-is-off in financial markets, and traders are discounting the potential for a major hit to European growth."" And oil is surging again. The price of brent was up 7.8 per cent by 7:10am AEDT — that is $US105.58 ($145.54) a barrel. ""Global companies and countries are either disassociating themselves from Russian companies voluntarily, or being prevented from trading due to sanctions, including for oil which is putting stress on oil markets,"" NAB said in a morning note. ""The IEA agreed on Tuesday to release 60 million barrels of oil from global reserves, but realistically this isn’t going to do much given it is equivalent to around 12 days of Russia’s exports. ""Another factor adding to a tight crude market is OPEC itself producing below targeted levels for various reasons."" Bitcoin was choppy but still making a recovery after losses with the war in Ukraine. It had made a sharp gain early in the session and was now up to almost $US44,000 ($60,000). By 7:00am AEDT, the local currency had slipped (-0.2 per cent) to 72.48 US cents. Meanwhile, insurers are having to set aside cash to deal with a crisis closer to home than Ukraine.

59,"ASX gains, Russia doubles interest rates",markets,"  ASX rises for the third day and Russia doubles interest rates to prop up the rouble amid financial sanctions over Ukraine invasion The Australian share market has increased for the third day in a row, and the Reserve Bank has warned that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is a major source of uncertainty. Australian shares rose as much as 1.6 per cent on Tuesday, boosted by oil and gas stocks, technology firms and banks. But they came off their highs by the close. The All Ordinaries index closed up 0.9 per cent to 7,385. The ASX 200 index rose 0.7 per cent to 7,097, with more sectors higher than lower. The Reserve Bank kept official interest rates on hold at 0.1 per cent as expected, with RBA governor Philip Lowe saying the war in Ukraine was a ""major new source of uncertainty"". Gold miners lost ground as the precious metal fell in Asian trade, and utilities were a major drag. The Commonwealth Bank said it would sell a 10 per cent stake in Chinese bank, the Bank of Hangzhou, for $1.8 billion. Its shares rose 1.4 per cent to $94.82. Shares in Virtus Health (+4,7pc) jumped after the in vitro fertilisation service provider received an improved takeover offer from CapVest Partners. Virtus said it would not engage with rival bidder, BGH Capital. The best performers on the ASX 200 index were payments firm Block, the owner of Afterpay (+12.8pc), online bookmaker Pointsbet (+17.5pc) and uranium firm Paladin Energy (+13pc). Miner IGO said it had abandoned talks with global miner Glencore about buying its CSA copper mine in New South Wales. Leading the losses were copper miner Sandfire Resources (-11.6pc), gold miner Perseus Mining (-7.4pc), and buy now, pay later firm Zip (-6.3pc), after it raised nearly $150 million to fund its takeover of smaller rival Sezzle. But the issue price of $1.90 per share was a 14 per cent discount to the company's last closing price. Insurance Australia Group said it had received 6,700 claims for damage so far because of the floods in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales. It expects the number of claims to rise over coming days. The Australian dollar was buying around 72.62 US cents at 4:40pm AEDT,  after it jumped nearly 1 cent overnight. It fell slightly after the RBA kept rates on hold. Asian markets were also higher, with the Nikkei 225 in Japan up 1.3 per cent to 26,876. Brent crude futures rose 1. 2 per cent to $US98.11 a barrel at 4:50pm AEDT. Spot gold fell 0.05 per cent to $US1906.83 an ounce. Russia more than doubled its key interest rate and introduced some capital controls as it scrambles to shield its economy from financial sanctions imposed by the West because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The central bank increased its key rate to 20 per cent, the highest level this century, from 9.5 per cent. That's after the Russian rouble plunged by one-third to a record low of 109.1850 against the greenback after the West imposed new financial sanctions on Russia, including banning some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system and freezing foreign reserves of the Russian central bank. The sanctions restrict the Bank of Russia's ability to use its $US640 billion in foreign exchange and gold reserves. Russian central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina told a news conference that interest rates were raised because of the plunge of the rouble. ""We had to increase rates to compensate citizens for increased inflationary risks."" The rouble clawed back some ground after the rise in interest rates and the Bank of Russia sold $US1 billion on foreign exchange markets. The Russian stock market will remain closed for a second day to prevent further losses. Russian President Vladimir Putin banned all Russian residents from transferring foreign currency overseas. The immediate steps include a ban on payments of hard currency made to foreigners in relation to loan agreements. The central bank said the ban only covers new loans and not servicing of existing debt. The Biden administration also announced new sanctions against Russia's central bank. The move bans Americans from doing any business with the bank and freezes its assets in the United States. Some leading global analysts are warning that not only are the risks and costs of a Russia-Ukraine war being underpriced, but so too are the costs of avoiding it, writes Michael Janda. US Treasury yields dropped as sanctions against Russia were ramped up. A global banking industry lobby group warned that Russia was likely to default on foreign debt and its economy could suffer a double-digit contraction this year. The Institute of International Finance estimated that half of Russia's central bank foreign reserves are held in countries that have imposed freezes on its assets. Elina Ribakova, the group's deputy chief economist, warned that Russia was becoming increasingly unlikely to pay its debts. ""If we stay here and this (crisis) escalates, then default and restructuring is likely."" IG Markets analyst Kyle Rodda said the war would hurt not just Europe, but the global economy. ""In the longer run, this event is likely to be inflationary, given the huge impacts of the crisis on energy and broader commodity prices."" ""But there's certainly going to be a drop in demand, too, and impact on growth, not just in Europe but across the global economy,"" he said. Oil giants BP and Shell, global bank HSBC and the world's biggest aircraft-leasing firm AerCap have joined a growing list of companies looking to exit Russia. Shell joined Russia's biggest investor BP in saying it would exit all Russian operations. That includes the flagship Sakhalin 2 LNG plant, in which Shell owns a 27.5 per cent stake, and which is 50 per cent owned and operated by Russian gas group Gazprom. BP announced on the weekend that it was abandoning its 20 per cent stake in Russian state-controlled Rosneft at a cost of up to $US25 billion. BP shares fell nearly 4 per cent in London and Shell shares lost 1.4 per cent. Equiqor, the energy firm controlled by Norway, said it would start divesting its joint ventures in Russia. HSBC said it was starting to wind down relations with Russian banks including the second largest, VTB, which has been targeted by financial sanctions. The financial sanctions against Russia saw Wall Street tumble, but stocks pared their losses by the close. The Dow Jones index and the S&P 500 fell more than 1 per cent during the session. The Dow closed down 0.5 per cent to 33,893, the S&P 500 fell 0.24 per cent to 4,374 and the Nasdaq turned recouped its losses and rose 0.4 per cent to 13,751, helped by electric car makers Tesla and Rivian Automotive. Meanwhile, Citigroup said its total exposure to Russia amounted to $US10 billion. Its shares fell 4.4 per cent. European stocks cut their losses as Russia and Ukraine held ceasefire talks, but eurozone banks slumped because of the financial sanctions. The FTSE 100 index fell 0.4 per cent to 7,458, the DAX in Germany lost 0.7 per cent to 14,461, and the CAC 40 fell 1.4 per cent to 6,659. Oil prices soared on fears about disruption to energy prices because of some Russian banks being blocked from the SWIFT network. Conflict between Russia and Ukraine is likely to increase cost-of-living pressures, even far away in Australia, as fuel and fertiliser prices soar. Brent crude rose 3.2 per cent to $US101.10 a barrel overnight. While spot gold rose 0.9 per cent to $US1904.78 an ounce. European natural gas futures rose sharply as trading opened for the week but gave back some gains later in the session. ANZ economists said the market remained wary that the fighting in Ukraine may damage key pipelines that deliver Russian gas to Europe causing energy shortages. The European Union convened an emergency meeting to discuss what steps would be taken if Russia gas supplies were disrupted, and Belgium's energy minister Tinne van der Straeten said that the EU must work to accelerate the energy transition. The minister also proposed the freezing of gas prices. Shares in casino operator Crown Resorts lost 0.1 per cent after financial crimes regulator AUSTRAC launched legal action in the Federal Court against Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth for alleged breaches of anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing laws. AUSTRAC accused Crown of ""alleged serious and systemic noncompliance"" with anti-money laundering laws and is seeking civil penalties that could potentially cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars. AUSTRAC chief executive Nicole Rose said Crown failed to meet its legal obligations under the laws, making its business and Australia's financial system vulnerable to criminal exploitation. ""AUSTRAC's investigation identified poor governance, risk management and failures to have and maintain a compliant AML/CTF [anti-money laundering/counterterrorism funding] program detailing how Crown would identify, mitigate and manage the risk of their products and services being misused for money laundering or terrorism financing."" ""They also failed to carry out appropriate ongoing customer due diligence including on some very high-risk customers."" ""This leads to widespread and serious non-compliance over a number of years,"" Ms Rose said. Crown said the legal action follows a long-running investigation by AUSTRAC, which began in October 2020. It said that Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth had fully co-operated with the regulator. The casino firm said it had developed a comprehensive remediation plan which included a financial crime and compliance change program and improved controls to detect money laundering. ""Crown recognises the importance of complying with its financial crime obligations and has overhauled its approach to managing financial crime risk."" AUSTRAC is also investigating rival casino firms SkyCity Adelaide and the Star Group, which runs Sydney's Star casino. Crown was found by royal commissions in Victoria and Western Australia and an inquiry in New South Wales to have facilitated money laundering at its casinos.Last month it accepted a $9 billion takeover offer from US private equity firm Blackstone.

60,ASX gains ground even as analysts warn of Russian 'financial collapse' and possible European recession,markets,"  Australian shares are trading moderately higher, as news over the weekend of tougher Western sanctions against Russia dampen the flow-through of a global market rally on Friday. The benchmark ASX 200 index rallied strongly in the afternoon to close up 0.7 per cent at 7,049 and the broader All Ordinaries index was also 0.7 per cent higher at 7,323. That was well short of following the huge rally seen overseas after the ASX closed on Friday. Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 index rose 2.2 per cent on Friday, and the rally on most European markets was well above 3 per cent. But that strong rebound from Thursday's heavy losses was before the US, UK, EU and Canada announced that some Russian banks would be cut off from the key global financial transaction service SWIFT, and that the Russian central bank would be denied access to much of its foreign reserves. ""Risk rallied on hard on Friday,"" noted NAB's head of FX strategy and markets Ray Attrill. ""If a key reason for this was because sanctions announced by the US and Europe fell short of what they might have been, then it is hard to see the rally surviving the early part of the week."" Some leading global analysts are warning that not only are the risks and costs of a Russia-Ukraine war being underpriced, but so too are the costs of avoiding it, writes Michael Janda. Rabobank strategist Michael Every said it was clear that the outcome of Russia's invasion of Ukraine was veering towards worst-case scenarios for the global economy and financial markets, with some banks reportedly backing away from Russian transactions in case of further sanctions. ""Russia is being placed in the same camp as North Korea, Venezuela, and Iran,"" he wrote in his latest note on the crisis. ""The $620 billion-plus in FX [foreign exchange] reserves held by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) are sanctioned too – meaning that apart from the gold and only partially-convertible CNY [Chinese yuan] it holds, the vast majority are now unavailable. Even the gold is not liquid if nobody can use FX in exchange for it. ""There will be a complete collapse in the rouble today, with a 20 per cent drop at the open and nothing to support it from that point onwards. ""The expectation is runs on Russian banks and perhaps the worst economic and financial collapse since 1991, when the USSR was dissolved."" A US dollar could buy 100 roubles on the Asian currency markets today, up from fewer than 84 on Friday, but there are reports that exchange rates are higher still for those trying to buy US dollars within Russia. IG Markets analyst Kyle Rodda said traders were concerned about financial implications outside Russia too. Conflict between Russia and Ukraine is likely to increase cost-of-living pressures, even far away in Australia, as fuel and fertiliser prices soar. ""A prolonged civil war brought about by regime change in Ukraine could send Europe into recession,"" he warned. ""At the same time, supply disruptions, especially in energy and food, could exacerbate inflationary pressures."" The Australian dollar was a little weaker at 71.76 US cents around 4:30pm AEDT. Brent crude oil recovered after Friday's decline, bouncing back 5.3 per cent to $US103.15 a barrel. Gold was also a little firmer at $US1,906 an ounce. Mining stocks led the gains, up 2.7 per cent. In the mining sector, mineral sands miner Illuka Resources (+5.3pc), rare earths producer Lynas (+6.9pc) and Gold Road Resources (+5.5pc) were among the strongest gainers. The giant diversified miners BHP and Rio Tinto were 4.4 per cent and 3.2 per cent higher respectively. Gains in the mining sector would have been bigger still, but Fortescue Metals traded ex-dividend today, meaning that those who bought the stock missed out on its latest shareholder payment. It was down 2.4 per cent as a result. Energy stocks continued their recent climb, with Woodside Petroleum up 2.1 per cent. Australian grain-handling giant Graincorp jumped 5 per cent to $8.40 on fears that Russia's invasion of Ukraine might be lengthy and disrupt the upcoming growing season for Ukrainian grains, resulting in higher demand and prices for Australian shipments. Outside commodities, Blackmores (+9.8pc), Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals (+8.1pc), BlueScope Steel (+6.3pc) and Appen (+5.4pc) were leading gains on the ASX 200. Insurance companies have been heavily sold down as the massive damage from floods in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales has become apparent. Insurance Australia Group was down 4 per cent, while Suncorp fell 3.2 per cent after revealing that its liability for the floods was likely capped at $75 million due to reinsurance policies. Elsewhere, losses were being led by a combination of technology, financial firms and consumer cyclicals. Tech firm Life360 continued its recent decent, losing 8.9 per cent to $5.20, with Tyro Payments down 5.5 per cent, Telix Pharmaceuticals off 4.8 per cent and Flight Centre down 3.4 per cent. Buy now, pay later companies Zip and Sezzle have announced a merger under the laws of US state Delaware. The deal will see Sezzle shareholders receive 0.98 Zip shares for every Sezzle share they currently own. At the trading prices of both companies on the ASX at the close of trade last Friday, the deal values Sezzle at $491 million and is a 22 per cent premium on its last closing price. At the conclusion of the deal, and a $199 million capital raising by Zip, its shareholders will own approximately 78 per cent of the combined company. Zip said the money from the share sale ""will help Zip strengthen its balance sheet and positions Zip for sustainable growth by providing more capital runway to execute on the potential synergies from the proposed transaction"". Both companies are still on a trading halt, but Zip's share price is down almost 50 per cent so far this year, while Sezzle's is off more than 40 per cent.

61,ASX rebounds after Ukraine-Russia crisis wiped $74b in one day; Block soars while Blackmores dives,markets,"  ASX rebounds after Ukraine-Russia crisis wiped $74b in one day; Block soars while Blackmores dives Australian shares rose on Friday, driven by a rebound in tech stocks after Wall Street closed sharply higher overnight in a dramatic reversal as the United States unveiled more sanctions against Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The ASX 200 closed up 0.1 per cent to 6,998 points, with the industrial and education sectors leading the gains. That was a turnaround for the benchmark, which plummeted by 3 per cent and nearly $74 billion was wiped off the value of Australian shares on Thursday. The All Ordinaries index was up 0.3 per cent to 7,274 points. Oil prices surged again on worries about supply disruptions, with Brent crude rising over 2 per cent to $101.3 a barrel by 4:15pm AEDT. Australian shares plunge by 3 per cent after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine. Technology stocks soared 8.1 per cent, tracking a rally on the tech-heavy Nasdaq, and recouped a large chunk of their losses suffered earlier in the week. Block soared by a record 32.5 per cent on quarterly results, while Life360 recouped most loses from yesterday's 28.8 per cent dive, jumping 22 per cent to $5.71. Also among the best performers were Paladin Energy (+12.4pc), Tyro (+10.9pc), Liontown (+10pc), Appen (+8.7pc) and Adbri (+7.6pc). Energy stocks gained 0.1 per cent after oil prices breached $US100 a barrel again, with Santos up 0.7 per cent. Almost half of the sectors were trading in negative territory. Blackmores dived 10.5 per cent after its profit report while Magellan dropped 10.1 per cent on an almost $10 billion decline in assets under management. Investors will be flooded with updates from the nation's largest companies in the next few weeks — about how much they're earning, along with the impact of staff shortages and higher inflation on their profit margins. Safe-haven gold inched higher 0.57 per cent to $1,913 an ounce in the afternoon after easing back from a multi-month high of $1,973.96 that it hit on Thursday. Gold stocks fell following a drop in bullion prices overnight. Newcrest, the country's largest gold miner, shed up to 3.1 per cent, while Northern Star Resources fell 5.6 per cent. Lynas Rare Earth jumped 6.9 per cent after it posted a record first-half profit, helped by a surge in demand for the minerals used in electric vehicles amid a global push to reduce carbon emissions. Shares of Charter Hall Group rose 3.7 per cent and were set for their best day since August 2020 after reporting a near three-fold increase in half-yearly profit. The Australian dollar edged higher at 71.95 US cents by 4:33pm AEDT. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 ended sharply higher on Thursday in a dramatic reversal from the start of the session as US President Joe Biden unveiled harsh new sanctions against Russia after Moscow began an all-out invasion of Ukraine. The Dow also ended in positive territory. After consulting counterparts from the Group of Seven nations, Mr Biden announced measures to impede Russia's ability to do business in the world's major currencies, along with sanctions against banks and state-owned enterprises. Indexes, which sold off at the start of the day on news of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, hit session highs in the wake of Mr Biden's comments. The Nasdaq was down more than 3 per cent at the open. Conflict between Russia and Ukraine is likely to increase cost-of-living pressures, even far away in Australia, as fuel and fertiliser prices soar. ""There was a knee-jerk reaction overnight to the invasion by Russia into Ukraine, but the situation is still developing,"" said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at Ally Financial in New York. ""Obviously we're not out of the woods yet, and we have several weeks of volatility in front of us,"" she said, adding, ""the beaten-up parts of the market aren't leading the market lower today, which is a good sign."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 92 points, or 0.3 per cent, at 33,224 while the S&P 500 gained 63 points, or 1.5 per cent, to 4,289. The Nasdaq Composite added 436 points, or 3.3 per cent, to close at 13,474. The information technology sector gave the S&P 500 its biggest boost in a reversal of Wednesday's action. ""The tough stand the US and Europe is taking is sending a loud message to the financial markets that they're going to try to cripple as much as they can the Russian economy,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. ""From one perspective that's positive,"" he said, adding that the selling in the market may not be over. ""Going forward, we're still subject to probably higher oil prices, probably higher commodity prices."" Ukrainian forces battled Russian invaders on three sides on Thursday after Moscow mounted an assault by land, sea and air in the biggest attack on a European state since World War II. Some leading global analysts are warning that not only are the risks and costs of a Russia-Ukraine war being underpriced, but so too are the costs of avoiding it, writes Michael Janda. In the following hours, European stocks dived to nine-month lows, with banks and automakers bearing the brunt of the sell-off. The pan-European STOXX 600 index tumbled 3.3 per cent to its lowest since May 2021, marking a correction, or 10 per cent drop, from its record high in January.

63,"Australian shares drop by $74 billion amid Russia's Ukraine invasion, the worst fall in 18 months",markets,"  ASX plunges by 3 per cent after Russia launches Ukraine invasion; Qantas COVID woes continue Australian shares have plunged by 3 per cent after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine. Russian troops landed in the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odessa and in Mariupol in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk, Russian news agencies reported. Several explosions were heard in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, before dawn, after an initial series of sounds similar to artillery fire, a Reuters witness reported, shortly after Russia announced the military operation. Mr Putin called on Ukrainian soldiers to immediately lay down their weapons and go home, and said the responsibility for any bloodshed will be on the conscience ""of the Ukrainian regime"" according to comments carried by Russian news agencies. The comments worsened an already grim sell-off in Australian trade, pushing the ASX 200 down 3 per cent to 6,991, making its worst one-day fall since September 4, 2020. All sectors were in the red, with industrials and mining leading the losses. The All Ordinaries index was also down 3 per cent to 7,253 points. Miners dropped to their lowest since earlier this month, as iron ore prices slumped on concerns regarding demand in China amid a directive for ports to reduce their stockpiles of the commodity. Sector heavyweights BHP (-6.9pc), Rio Tinto (-3.8pc) and Fortescue Metals (-4.2pc) all fell steeply. Tech stocks dropped 6.4 per cent to hit their lowest level since June 2020. Tech company Life360 was the biggest loser on the benchmark index, plunging 28.8 per cent to $4.68 after revealing its loss had doubled. Investors will be flooded with updates from the nation's largest companies in the next few weeks — about how much they're earning, along with the impact of staff shortages and higher inflation on their profit margins. Appen slumped 28.7 per cent to $6.11 following its profit report. Payments and buy now pay later companies including Block (-13pc), Zip (-10.3pc) and Tyro (-7pc) also got slammed. Qantas fell 5.1 per cent after it posted a bigger-than-expected half-year loss and forecast a $650 million hit to second-half earnings before interest and tax due to Omicron. However, CIMIC jumped by 33.4 per cent to $22 after the news about a takeover bid from Hochtief. Gold miners were the only sector gaining ground, led by Perseus Mining (+12.3pc), Ramelius Resources (+4.7pc) and Evolution Mining (+4.8pc). Next DC (+3.4pc) and Nine Entertainment (+1.1pc) were among the other rare gainers on a day when most of the market was awash with red. Brent crude oil rocketed, trading at $US101.2 a barrel, by 4:05pm AEDT. Spot gold jumped more than 1.8 per cent to $US1,942, its highest level since early January 2021. Conflict between Russia and Ukraine is likely to increase cost-of-living pressures, even far away in Australia, as fuel and fertiliser prices soar. The Australian dollar was down slightly at 71.8 US cents this afternoon as the greenback gained. Tim Harcourt, chief economist from the Institute for Public Policy and Governance (IPPG) at UTS, said the military confrontation in Ukraine could send further ""shocks waves"" through the world. ""Europe is particularly vulnerable to a supply shock as it is especially reliant on Russian oil and gas,"" he warned. ""For example, more than 20 per cent of Germany’s gas emanates from Russia, hence why German Chancellor Olaf Scholz made a pretty gutsy call to call a halt to Nord Stream gas pipeline. These are the key things to understand about the Nord Stream 2 project and its strategic importance. ""There is also a danger if Australia is targeted by Russia, as it is seen as too close to the rest of the West when imposing the initial sanctions. ""The biggest risk to Australia is if China decides to follow Russia’s lead."" Lale Akoner, senior market strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management, told Bloomberg that geopolitical risks were flaring at a “very inopportune time” since markets are grappling with receding stimulus support. “Expect volatility to really persist in the next few months."" Qantas has reported a $456 million net loss in the first half of the 2022 financial year, limited by a major land sale in Mascot, but Delta and Omicron have resulted in even bigger operational losses. The airline saw an improvement on its net loss, compared to the $1.06 billion loss a year ago. However, it also reported a steeper $1.28 billion first-half underlying loss during a period hard-hit by domestic and international border closures. The airline's most closely watched financial measure, the result was bigger than a $1.03 billion loss a year earlier. However, the company said the outlook was improving as restrictions eased. ""Most of Australia was in lockdown for several months of the first half, so the loss we've announced today isn't surprising but it is frustrating,"" Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said. ""We saw a sharp rebound in travel demand when borders started opening in November and December, only to be hit by the Omicron wave and all the uncertainty that came with it. ""The uncertainty carried over into January but demand has started to recover as Australia adjusts to truly living with COVID. Our frequent flyer surveys show the intent to travel is extremely high and we're seeing good leisure demand into the fourth quarter. ""We've also seen a sharp uptick in international ticket sales in the past few weeks."" Mr Joyce said the company was on track to deliver more than $900 million in annualised savings through restructuring by the end of the 2022 financial year. Qantas workers who lost their jobs due to outsourcing have been told they will not be able to get their roles back. Qantas had to scale back domestic and international capacity plans by around one-third after the Omicron variant of COVID-19 emerged, leading to record case numbers in Australia and lower-than-expected travel demand. The airline said demand had strengthened in recent weeks, but it forecast a $650 million hit to second-half earnings before interest and tax due to Omicron. Qantas said it would run 68 per cent of its pre-COVID-19 domestic capacity in the third quarter, rising to 90 per cent to 100 per cent in the fourth quarter. International capacity would be around 22 per cent of pre-COVID-19 levels in the third quarter, doubling to 44 per cent in the fourth quarter, the airline added. “Qantas’ results for the first half continue to reflect the impact of Delta-related lockdowns and the emergence of Omicron. Still, the airline’s net debt reduced by $400 million to $5.5 billion, and we expect it to reduce further by fiscal 2022 before trending towards the bottom of its target range of $4.4 billion to $5.5 billion,"" said Ian Chitterer, vice president of Moody’s Investors Service. ""We expect Qantas' EBITDA and balance sheet recovery over the next 12-18 months to be substantial, given its strong liquidity, increasing capacity, and a lower probability of border closures. ""This supports our credit view that Qantas will emerge from the pandemic strongly positioned operationally and financially.” Wall Street indexes ended sharply lower on Wednesday as Ukraine declared a state of emergency and the US State Department said a Russian invasion of Ukraine remains potentially imminent. Earlier, the West unveiled more sanctions against Russia over its move into eastern Ukraine, and in what some market watchers saw as another sign of a possible Russian military onslaught, Moscow began evacuating its Kyiv embassy. Nasdaq led the day's decline, while the information technology sector was the biggest drag on the S&P 500. ""There's been geopolitical risks and rhetoric that have given investors that much more to be worried about,"" said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi. ""I don't want to minimise that, but what it's done is exacerbate the momentum that was already in place to the downside. ""What we were seeing already coming into this was clearly a compression in multiples across a number of different highly valued areas of the market."" Investors especially have been on edge about possible aggressive tightening by the US Federal Reserve to combat inflation. The Nasdaq has tumbled more than 15 per cent so far this year, while the S&P 500 confirmed a correction in the previous session when the index ended down more than 10 per cent from its January 3 closing record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 465 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 33,132, barely above the 33,120 level that would have confirmed a correction. The S&P 500 lost 79 points, or 1.8 per cent, to end at 4,226 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 344 points, or 2.6 per cent, to 13,037. The pan-European STOXX 600 index slipped 0.3 per cent, after it firmed 1 per cent in early trading with banks, financial services firms and retailers leading declines. After rising as much as 0.7 per cent earlier on Wednesday the MSCI World Index, a leading gauge of equity markets globally, reversed course in morning trading and was last down 1 per cent, with losses deepening in afternoon trading.

64,"ASX edges up, RBNZ raises rates, oil prices soar amid Russia-Ukraine tension",markets,"  ASX edges up, RBNZ raises rates to 1pc, oil prices soar amid Russia-Ukraine tension Australian shares recovered from a slightly lower open as investors braced for market volatility and watch for international responses to Russian President Vladimir Putin's next moves against Ukraine. The ASX 200 closed up 0.6 per cent to 7,206, with technology (+1pc) and industrial (+1.8pc) sectors leading the way. The All Ordinaries index was up 0.7 per cent to 7,474. Domino’s Pizza led the worst falls on the ASX 200, diving 14 per cent to $86.13 after warning of lower growth in same-store sales and posting a 5.3 per cent fall in underlying profit. Ramelius Resources was down 4.2 per cent, Scentre Group 4.4 per cent, Costa Group 8.6 per cent and JB Hi-Fi was off 5.2 per cent, rounding out the top five falls. Hub24 (+9.9pc), Paladin Energy (+9.1pc), Tyro (+8.6pc), Zip (+8.4pc) and Nickel Mines (+8.2pc), which posted a 25 per cent rise in profits, were leading the gainers. Woolworths was up 1.4 per cent to $35.68, despite the company cutting its interim dividend on a substantial profit fall. The Australian dollar was up at 72.31 US cents by 04:23pm AEDT. New Zealand's central bank raised interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, a third consecutive hike that brings borrowing costs to pre-pandemic levels, and said it would sell bonds as it looks to counter rising inflation. All but one of the 20 economists in a Reuters poll had expected RBNZ to hike rates by 25 basis points to 1 per cent, while one was poised for a 50 basis point hike. But RBNZ flagged a more aggressive tightening path, which sent the New Zealand dollar soaring over 0.5 per cent to $0.6765 after the announcement. ""The Committee agreed it remains appropriate to continue reducing monetary stimulus so as to maintain price stability and support maximum sustainable employment,"" RBNZ's monetary policy committee said in its statement. The bank also said it would commence the gradual reduction of its bond holdings under the Large Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) program through both bond maturities and managed sales. RBNZ forecasts the cash rate reaching 3.35 per cent in March 2025. The rate would reach 2.57 per cent by March 2023, a more aggressive path than the 2.3 per cent seen in the previous forecast in November. The committee said a 50-basis point OCR move was strongly considered and members saw this as a ""finely balanced decision."" The RBNZ hiked rates at its last two meetings and signalled further tightening as it looked to cool a heated economy. Global supply constraints pushed inflation to 5.9 per cent, almost double the top of the bank's 1-3 per cent target range, and jobless rates to a record low of 3.2 per cent. House prices have also soared to historic highs. But uncertainties remain over the outlook as the Omicron variant spreads more rapidly through New Zealand and the market braces for any global economic fallout from potential conflict in the Ukraine. Crude oil futures rose to their highest levels since 2014 on supply concerns, while Wall Street equities fell a day after Mr Putin ordered troops into the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine. Brent crude futures were up at $US96.50 a barrel by 07:12am AEDT, after earlier topping $US99 to reach the highest level since September 2014, reflecting fears that Russia's energy exports could be disrupted by any conflict. US stocks further trimmed losses after US President Joe Biden announced the first wave of sanctions against Russia, for what he said was the beginning of an invasion of Ukraine. Mr Biden also said he was hopeful diplomacy was still available, adding that the United States had no intention of fighting Russia. He said the sanctions, among others things, target Russian banks and sovereign debt. ""The world is still hoping this is somewhat limited and doesn't really spread across Europe and Ukraine,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. Earlier on Tuesday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance believed Russia was still planning a big assault on Ukraine following Moscow's recognition of two separatist regions in the former Soviet republic's east. Britain published a list of sanctions and Germany froze the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline project, which would have significantly increased the flow of Russian gas. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 483 points, or 1.4 per cent, at 33,597, while the S&P 500 lost 44 points, or 1 per cent, falling to 4,305 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 167 points, or 1.2 per cent, to 13,382. The Dow and Nasdaq were each down more than 2 per cent shortly before Mr Biden spoke. Europe's STOXX 600 index was essentially flat after falling just under 2 per cent earlier in the day and losing 1.3 per cent on Monday when US markets were closed for a holiday. ""The bottom line is that fear factor remains elevated and until we get some sort of a clearer picture of what Putin may or may not do,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. ""The market is just going to stay in a state of confusion."" And rising oil prices added to the uncertainty as investors worried about the implications for Federal Reserve policy changes aimed at combating high inflation. ""If oil prices continue to rise and go above $100 and stay there for sustained period of time that means you're going to have even higher inflation,"" he said.

65,"Magellan soars on results while QBE dives, as ASX follows Wall Street down",markets,"  QBE dives on company results, as ASX follows Wall Street down Tensions between Russia and Ukraine are hitting global markets, with the ASX following Wall Street down on Friday. The ASX 200 closed down 1 per cent, to 7,222 points, after setting a new 20-day high. The benchmark index had gained 0.2 per cent on Thursday, however some companies, including Wesfarmers, took a hit to their stock after posting results. Wall Street took a big hit overnight, with the Nasdaq losing 2.9 per cent in one session. The Dow lost 1.8 per cent, while the S&P 500 shaved off more than 2 per cent. ""Simmering frictions in the Ukraine are keeping markets nervous,"" a NAB spokesperson said. The big four banks had a mixed bag on Friday, with Westpac gaining a little (+0.3pc), ANZ ending even, and the other two majors losing around 0.5 per cent each. The broader sell-off came as reporting season continued. QBE was one of the worst-performing stocks of the day after it posted its 2021 results. The insurer lodged a $1.04 billion profit, compared to 2020, when it made a loss of $2.09 billion. QBE said the turnaround was partly due to better conditions with its underwriters. However, it also noted, that there had been ""premium rate increases"" averaging 9.7 per cent during the year. It has been pumping up premiums for several years, it added. Industry analysts Barrenjoey described the results as ""a headline miss"" but roughly in line with expectations. ""QBE has significantly increased their catastrophe allowance for FY22E, lowered their dividend payout ratio and changed their gearing targets,"" they said. The insurer's stock dived on opening, with a loss of 8.8 per cent by 10:40am AEDT. It finished the day down 8.3 per cent. Meanwhile, energy provider Origin was another poor-performing stock, a day after it announced it is closing Australia's biggest coal-fired power generator earlier than forecast. Origin ended the day down 7.9 per cent. Other company results out on Friday included chicken company Ingham's. It posted a 1.8 per cent rise in revenue, which it said was largely due to inflation. It said price rises were coming through in the costs of feed for poultry and also across its logistics chain. Like many companies, Ingham's is also being impacted by COVID-19 staff shortages and mitigation. ""The company has experienced significant cost pressures through increases in overtime, transport and compliance costs,"" it said. ""[That's] resulting from the heightened health and safety procedures and operational adjustments that have been a necessary part of our COVID-19 response."" It said Omicron staff shortages had been so bad that its meat processing was limited, resulting in fewer sales. Its share price ended 5.1 per cent down, in line with the broader sell-off. On the flip side, Magellan Financial Group gained 18.8 per cent after posting its results. The fund manager's shares crashed late last year after it lost its biggest client in the UK. In its results, Magellan posted a 16 per cent rise in profits to $2.48 billion. All things considered this week, the index finished where it started, but it is down 3 per cent on its latest year-to-date comparison with 2021. At 7am AEDT, the Australian dollar was up 0.1 per cent, to 71.98 US cents. ""The AUD held onto recent gains, despite more negative news from Ukraine,"" ANZ said in a briefing note this morning. ""Risk appetite still remains highly sensitive to geopolitical news."" However, CBA said it did not believe the dollar would be back over 72 US cents any time soon. ""AUD crosses — except against EUR — remain weaker than levels seen before the renewed Ukraine tensions,"" the CBA said. ""We consider AUD/USD will struggle to sustainably break above 0.72 in the near term.""

66,"Wesfarmers takes a hit from COVID supply chain woes, as ASX trades up",markets,"  Wesfarmers takes a hit from COVID supply chain woes, as ASX trades up Australia's share market has ended in the green, as major companies — including Wesfarmers, Telstra, Origin and Whitehaven — post results. The ASX 200 defied sentiments on Wall Street and Europe, and at one point during Thursday afternoon trade was up 0.8 per cent. It ended the day with a softer gain of 0.2 per cent, at 7,296 points. Some of the top movers were stocks in healthcare, real estate and commodities. The big four were all up with gains of between 0.3 and 0.8 per cent. Wesfarmers had lost 7.2 per cent off its stock after posting its company profits. One of the first to post results, Wesfarmers has taken a hit from COVID-19 supply-chain woes and curtailments. The owner of Bunnings, Kmart and Officeworks saw a 14.2 drop in first-half profit, to $1.2 billion. ""The group has continued to incur additional costs and experience stock availability impacts as a result of ongoing global supply-chain disruptions, elevated team member absenteeism and delays with third-party logistics providers,"" it said. Its Kmart Group lost about a quarter of its store trading days in the first half, seeing its pre-tax earnings tumble 63.4 per cent to $178 million. Wesfarmers paid an interim dividend of 80 Australian cents per share, compared with 88 cents last year. Telstra lost 4.2 per cent after it posted a 14.8 per cent drop in earnings. The telecommunications company said it took a hit as it continued being impacted by NBN works and ""one-off"" receipts. Moody's vice-president, Ian Chitterer, said Telstra's results signalled ""an improving credit outlook"". ""Fiscal 2021 looks to have been the turning point for Telstra’s credit profile,"" he said. ""Even if the company hits the low end of its $7.5 billion-$8 billion underlying EBITDA target for fiscal 2023, we expect its debt/EBITDA to be below 2x. This is supportive of its credit profile.” In stronger news, Woodside's results show it had almost tripled its profits. This was as the oil and gas producer saw a surge in energy prices. The rise of costs for fuel, among others, have been a key driver pushing up inflation in Australia. Moody's senior vice-president, Matthew Moore, described the results as ""in line with our previous expectations"". ""Woodside benefited from strong gains in realised pricing in the period and increased trading activity, which more than offset lower production levels and slightly higher unit costs. ""As a result, the company's revenue almost doubled, while EBITDA more than doubled."" Its stock ended up 4.2 per cent by market's close. Meanwhile, Origin has announced that it is closing Australia's biggest coal-fired power generator earlier than expected. It made the announcement while posting results showing it is expecting earnings to be higher in the 2022 financial year, from $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion. Its share price ended the day up 1 per cent. Australia's biggest casino operator, Crown Resorts, has posted a half-yearly loss for the third time in a row. That's after ongoing COVID-19 restrictions on gambling and entertainment. The company recently backed a $6.5 billion offer for Crown from private equity firm Blackstone. Crown lost 0.7 per cent in today's trade. Meanwhile, the Dow closed 0.2 per cent down, while the Nasdaq fared only slightly better, with a loss of 0.1 per cent. The S&P 500 was up marginally, by 0.1pc. All had pared losses in their late trade, after the release of minutes from the US Federal Reserve. The minutes showed that, while the central bank intends to begin raising interest rates to combat inflation, it will make such decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis. ""There are a lot of crosswinds going around with Russia-Ukraine tensions but, from a domestic macro environment, the key variable driving equities is whether the Fed will increase [interest] rates by 50 basis points in March,"" said Huw Roberts, head of analytics and Quant Insight in London. At 7am AEDT, the Australian dollar was up 0.7 per cent, to 72.03 US cents.

67,"'Get rid of this fear of missing out' ahead of looming share market crash, warns veteran investor",markets,"  Jeremy Grantham says a super bubble crash may be underway. Here's where he's stashing his cash One of the world's most famous fund managers is warning that a ""super bubble"" that's been building for more than a decade may be in the process of bursting. Jeremy Grantham is the co-founder of GMO, which claims to have predicted the Japanese crash of 1989, the dotcom bust of 2000 and the global financial crisis of 2008. He is now warning of another similar crash in asset prices, with speculative tech stocks first in the firing line. And he warns the downturn is ""likely"" already happening, with Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq down 12 per cent from its peak in November and the broader S&P 500 index down almost 7 per cent from its record closing high in early January. ""I would say that is the beginning of the burst, when the specs that typically go up quite a lot more than the market go down as the market goes up,"" he tells The Business. ""So the S&P [500 index] went up 25 per cent last year, and a lot of the most speculative stocks of 2020 were already going down. ""That is very rare. It happened in 1929. It happened in 1972 before the very big decline then. It happened in 2000 before the tech wipe-out."" Mr Grantham says that process of a super bubble bursting appears to be well underway, with many of the most speculative stocks already losing at least half their value from the peak. ""At the end, the speculative stocks start to peel off and, even on the upside for the broader market, they start to go down,"" he observes. ""That started early last year — the super-duper specs, the worst of them all, started to decline. ""And then, one by one, they fell in and started to drop. And, as we stand today, something like 40 per cent of all the NASDAQ stocks are down over 50 per cent, which is pretty amazing."" Mr Grantham says the current US market is looking ""eerily similar"" to the dotcom boom and bust but, as in 2000, he warns it is not only the speculative stocks that are heavily overvalued and will fall. ""I think it would be unlikely that the market would not come down by 50 per cent from its peak — the broad market, the S&P — and it would be unusual if the specs did not do worse than that."" The good news for Australian investors is that, even though Mr Grantham thinks real estate and bonds are overvalued across most of the developed world, he believes the local stock market is nowhere near as overpriced as Wall Street. ""I am not an expert on Australian equities. It doesn't look cheap, but it doesn't look horrific,"" he says. ""When it comes to the stock market, rather like 2000 and the tech bubble, this is more an American affair than anything else. ""Outside America, the world is merely overpriced. Ho-hum, it's often overpriced. It's not that usual, not that dangerous. ""In the US, however, we have an extreme overpricing, extreme crazy behaviour, and I think we're in a rather dangerous equity bubble. ""So there's a decent chance that Australia, the UK, Japan, there's some fairly reasonably priced countries, if they come down in sympathy, they'll come down a lot less and probably rally earlier."" His preference is to look for beaten-down stock values in some of the developing markets. Australians have nervously watched their super balances plummet in recent weeks. But there are steps people can take to protect their retirement nest egg. ""Emerging markets, [and] some of the cheaper developed countries, would be very much a better idea than a massive holding of US equities,"" he says. ""If you have to own US stocks, you should [own] high-quality stocks that are in good financial shape because this can always spiral into something of a financial crisis. They often do."" Like when you go shopping, Mr Grantham says investors should be on the lookout for bargains, not paying top dollar. ""Make sure you don't buy expensive markets, expensive stocks,"" he warns. ""Emphasise value, cheapness for what you get. Hunt around for the cheaper countries, hunt around for the cheapest stocks within those countries. ""Carry some cash reserves. There'll be, perhaps, some very nice buying opportunities. ""And, whatever you do, get rid of this fear of missing out, this terrible lust to participate in profit-making that comes along at the end of every one of the great bubbles."" One area where he urges particular caution is cryptocurrencies. One month into 2022 and the debate on cryptocurrency is already heating up, with calls for regulation causing a rift between jurisdictions that are ""crypto friendly"" and those that aren't. ""Bitcoin, in particular, it does nothing for anybody and is superseded by a whole generation of smarter and more effective cryptocurrencies, many of which in turn, do not make money in the traditional way and a few do,"" he argues. ""So I'm sure the idea embedded in cryptocurrency will be around for, perhaps, forever. ""But I'm equally certain that most of the value today as a store of value is a hoax. ""That is not a store of value. Everyone can agree that the volatility is massive. It goes up and down with the high-risk stocks."" Longer term, Mr Grantham warns that stock values will be weighed down by two factors that have been boosting them for decades. One is higher inflation. He argues that the levels of inflation seen in the US since the middle of last year should already have triggered a major sell-off in stocks on expectations that record-low interest rates would need to rise. ""The market is saying about inflation that it totally ignores it,"" he says. ""It completely believes the fact that it's temporary, ephemeral, etc … and it doesn't appear to be. ""And if that seeps into the market in the usual way, it will mercilessly depress the price-earnings ratios."" He says this could mean his forecast 50 per cent US share price crash could play out over an extended period, rather than be a short, sharp sell-off. ""This could turn out to be quite a struggle, where slowly but surely the market has to readjust to higher and higher rates and higher inflation,"" he says. Unwinding the distortions created by free money won’t be easy, nor will it be quick nor painless, but it is entirely necessary, writes business editor Ian Verrender. The other factor he feels could weigh on share prices is a possible drop in the current record share of economic output going to company profits. ""Profit margins average 30-35 per cent higher than they had been in the previous 50-60 years,"" he observes. ""Everything seemed to work out — corporations got a lot of political power, the taxes on capital all dropped, tax on dividends, tax on interest rates, tax on capital gains all came down. ""Most of the regulatory bodies were somewhat captured by corporations. ""And they have had a golden era. We've never seen bigger profits. ""The concentration in each industry has increased, and the FANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google) that are remarkable companies are, in their own way, instant monopolies. ""So the monopolistic feature of our economy today, and somewhat around the world, has increased. ""This is very good for profits. It's not so good for growth, and governments are beginning to twitch a bit.""

68,"BHP first-half profit, dividends beat forecasts, but ASX closes lower",markets,"  BHP first-half profit, dividends beat forecasts, but ASX closes lower Australian shares have fallen after Wall Street indices turned sharply lower overnight as Russia-Ukraine tensions came to the boil. The ASX 200 closed down 0.5 per cent to 7,207, while the All Ordinaries index was off 0.6 per cent to 7,490. Domestic stocks were tracking a sharp sell-off in US peers as plans to close the US embassy in Kyiv, a possible sign of an imminent Russian invasion in Ukraine, prompted investors to pull back from riskier assets. The resources sector was hardest hit on a sharp pull back in iron ore futures and a decline in oil prices from recent peaks. Beach Energy slumped 10.5 per cent and bigger rival Santos was off 4.2 per cent in the oil and gas sector. Chalice Mining fell 9.6 per cent, Mineral Resources 5.3 per cent and iron ore giant Fortescue was down 5.1 per cent in the mining sector. Outside the mining and energy sector, Resmed's 4.6 per cent fall was the biggest on the ASX 200, while Westpac's 3.4 per cent slide dented the market heavily. On the flip side, Sims gained 13.7 per cent on a positive profit result, with Brambles and Seek both up more than 6 per cent. Global payments giant Block gained 4.2 per cent. BHP shares escaped the worst of the resources sell-off after an impressive profit result, closing just 0.3 per cent down at $48.18. BHP reported a first-half profit on Tuesday that beat analysts' estimates, helped by higher commodity prices, even as the rate of earnings growth slowed sequentially due to a cutback in demand from China. The miner also declared a record interim dividend of $US1.50 ($2.10) per share, up from $US1.01 per share a year earlier. BHP had a busy six months marked by sweeping changes, including selling its $US13 billion ($18.2 billion) petroleum business and a listing unification, while managing pandemic-related disruptions to its business. Iron ore prices, however, have halved from last year's record levels as China's push to curb emissions and easing construction activity in the country's debt-laden property sector curtailed demand. ""In the near term, volatility in the operating environment is expected to continue... we anticipate that the headwinds that buffeted China will diminish as the 2022 calendar proceeds,"" BHP said. The company's underlying profit attributable from continuing operations was $US9.72 billion for the six months ending December 31, compared with $US6.20 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of $US8.96 billion, according to research firm Vuma Financial. The near 57 per cent jump in profit, however, trailed a whopping 185 per cent gain in the June-half when iron ore prices hit a record high. BHP said labour costs had risen due to shortages induced by COVID-19 restrictions and headwinds from bottlenecks in its supply chain will continue through 2022. A shortage of skilled workers has hit Australian miners for months. BHP last month warned of an impact from a delay in Western Australia state reopening its borders and cut its output forecast. The company said on Tuesday it has lowered its net debt target to $US5 billion-$US15 billion from $US12 billion-$US17 billion, after agreeing to offload its petroleum business to Woodside Petroleum last year. BHP's net debt was $US6.1 billion as of December 31. The Australian dollar was down at 71.24 US cents by 06:52am AEDT. News that the US is closing its embassy in Ukraine's capital Kyiv heightened geopolitical tensions and prompted a sell-off in choppy trading on Wall Street. All three major US indexes fell after the Wall Street Journal reported that US diplomatic operations were being moved to western Ukraine, in a possible harbinger of imminent Russian invasion. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged state officials, politicians and business leaders who have recently left the country to return within 24 hours to show unity. ""We have been told that February 16 will be the day of the attack, but we will make it the day of unity,"" he said. ""Investors don't like uncertainty, and this is obviously a period of increased uncertainty and that's why you're seeing this volatility,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut. Geopolitical anxieties have been simmering in recent weeks as negotiators scramble to find a diplomatic path forward and Russia amasses troops along the Ukrainian border. US warnings that Russia could invade Ukraine at any time pushed oil prices to fresh seven-year peaks. But Brent crude oil had dropped back from yesterday's highs to just under $US96 a barrel by 4:30pm AEDT. Adding to the uncertainty were increasingly hawkish comments from St Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard, reiterating his call for a faster rate hike timeline and saying the central bank's ""credibility is on the line"" in its battle against rising prices. ""We're contending with two major concerns,"" Mr Pavlik said. ""What are we going to see from the Federal Reserve and what are we going to see from Russia?"" Recent data showed US inflation at its hottest level in decades, ratcheting up concerns that the Fed could begin hiking key interest rates more aggressively than many have anticipated. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7 per cent, the S&P 500 lost 0.58 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.11 per cent. Europe's STOXX 600 share index tumbled as much as 3 per cent and spot gold headed toward its biggest single-day gain in four months even as Russia suggested it was ready to keep talking to the West to try to defuse the crisis. Ukraine's government bonds slumped 10 per cent to their lowest level of the crisis as strength in the Swiss franc underscored the appeal of safe havens. Markets in Europe were antsy. Major regional bourses fell more than 2 per cent, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index down 1.92 per cent. European natural gas prices for delivery in a month's time jumped nearly 10 per cent to 81.30 euros per megawatt hour.

69,Crown agrees to Blackstone's $9b takeover bid; ASX higher as oil prices jump on Ukraine fears,markets,"  Crown agrees to Blackstone's $9b takeover bid; ASX higher as oil prices jump on Ukraine fears Australian shares have closed slightly higher as investors fret about deepening tensions between Russia and Ukraine, but Crown shares have jumped after it accepted a private equity takeover offer. The ASX 200 was up 0.4 per cent, to 7,244, having traded flat for most of the morning. Gold miners dominated the biggest gains. Regis Resources was up 8.2 per cent, Evolution Mining up 7.9 per cent and Northern Star 5.9 per cent higher. The benchmark was also aided by a jump in shares of Beach Energy (+9.4pc) after the oil and gas explorer said its half-year profit surged 66 per cent on the back of firmer oil prices. Energy stocks were up more than 3 per cent, tracking an uptick in oil prices as escalating fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, a top energy producer, added to concerns over tight global crude supplies. Woodside Petroleum and Santos rose 3.6 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively. The other notable gain among the top 200 firms was JB Hi-Fi, which rose 5.4 per cent, to $51.71, after announcing a $250 million share buyback to return money to investors. Its share price gain came despite the electronics retailer announcing a previously flagged 9.4 per cent fall in half-year profit, to $288 million. Despite the fall in profit from the pandemic peak last year, earnings were still around 69 per cent higher than before COVID-19, as people continued to spend on home offices and entertainment. On the downside, Novonix (-10.8pc), Liontown Resources (-7.9pc) and Imugene (-9.5pc) were the biggest losers. The Australian dollar was down, to 71.19 US cents, by 04:22am AEDT. Oil prices hit their highest in more than seven years as supply concerns stoked fears of a possible invasion of Ukraine by Russia, adding to concerns over tight global crude supplies. Brent crude oil was up, trading at $US95.64 a barrel, by 04:24am AEDT. Investors will be flooded with updates from the nation's largest companies in the next few weeks — about how much they're earning, along with the impact of staff shortages and higher inflation on their profit margins. The big local news on the market was the Crown board's acceptance of Blackstone's latest $8.9 billion takeover bid for the Australian casino giant. The US private equity firm is offering $13.10 cash per Crown share, which is around 11 per cent higher than its initial approach for the company last year. It is also nearly a third higher than Crown's share price of $9.90 in mid-November, the day before it received an acquisition proposal from Blackstone pitched at $12.50 a share. Crown Resorts chief executive Steve McCann described it as a ""compelling offer"". ""The agreement with Blackstone also highlights the strength of the Crown brand and confidence in our future as we emerge from some challenging times, which is welcome news for our people, customers and stakeholders,"" he said in a statement. The deal will still need to be cleared by the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) and by the gaming regulatory authorities in the states where Crown operates. It will also be subject to no new gaming regulatory actions being taken against Crown, and to shareholder approval. James Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings holds almost 37 per cent of Crown Resorts shares. Global shares had dropped on Friday on rising worries over escalating Ukraine-Russia tensions and the prospect of a tightened interest rate hike timeline from the US Federal Reserve in response to decades-high inflation. Benchmark Treasury yields lost ground, and German bond yields backed off the 2018 highs struck on Thursday. Gold and oil prices rose. Losses deepened in volatile trading on Wall Street after Washington said Russia had massed enough troops near Ukraine to launch a major invasion, and urged US citizens to leave the country within 48 hours after Moscow stiffened its response to Western diplomacy. Rising oil prices boosted energy shares more than 2.8 per cent , though most of the 11 major S&P 500 sector indexes declined, led by technology and consumer discretionary. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 503.53 points, or 1.43 per cent, at 34,738.06. The S&P 500 lost 85.44 points, or 1.90 per cent, to 4,418.64. And the Nasdaq Composite dropped 394.49 points, or 2.78 per cent, to 13,791.15. ""By pushing energy prices even higher, a Russian invasion would likely exacerbate inflation and redouble pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates,"" said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. ""From the Fed's perspective, the inflationary effects of a Russian invasion and higher energy prices would likely outweigh the shock's negative implications for global growth.""

70,Stewart and his family had no plans of purchasing a home in Katherine. Then they did the maths,markets,"  Housing boom hits Katherine in Northern Territory as new jobs bring transient workers While buying a house remains out of reach for many Australians, it's the much cheaper option in this small Northern Territory town — even if you have no plans to stay long-term. LJ Hooker's Wayne Nayda says bidding wars have become commonplace with a complaint filed to Consumer Affairs The discrepancy in rent prices and the cost of buying is even causing a bit of a housing boom in this town. However,  things were different just a few years ago. Even when successive interest rate cuts and relaxed lending standards resulted in rising property prices across the country, residents in Katherine could barely give their houses away. But now a swift and sharp turnaround has led to an unusual phenomenon in a highly transient town where it's almost impossible to secure a rental. ""We haven't got lovely golden beaches and such,"" real estate organisation LJ Hooker's principal director Wayne Nayda said. ""People usually come up for two-to-three years [and] just want to rent, but now they are buying,"" In an isolated and remote town that typically finds it difficult to attract and retain young professionals like teachers and GPs, Mr Nayder said the property turnaround was quite unusual. ""Katherine is in a housing boom,"" he said. Vacancy rates have dropped from about 10 per cent to far below 0.1 per cent, agencies say, pushing the rental prices up by about 30 per cent over the last 18 months. For most of January, real estate sites listed less than 15 rentals, and a plethora of properties for sale ranging from $200,000 to $500,000. Six months ago, Stewart Crowley was choosing from just four rentals, all equivalent to what he was paying in bayside Melbourne. Relocating for a high school teaching position with his wife and two children, he had no intention of buying a house and no plans to establish roots for the long-term. ""Our rental subsidy from the government finished and the rent was too much,"" he said. ""The only other option really was to purchase a property … and we worked out it was cheaper to buy a house in Katherine than it was to continue renting."" He says his mortgage repayment is ""significantly"" cheaper than what he would have to pay if he'd been renting. Hayley Downes bought a brand new house in a sought after development that's widening the fringes of Katherine. Construction workers packed up their tools last week and Ms Downes moved in on Friday. At just 23, Ms Downes never thought she'd be a home owner this early. ""It was a big decision, you could definitely say that,"" Ms Downes said. ""But last year there were a lot of incentives, including the first home buyers grant. The [government] was basically giving away money for free and interest rates were really low."" Ms Downes said she spent months sifting through rentals out of her price range and ""too expensive for what they were worth"", after payments on a two-bedroom unit she was living in with her partner rose from $500 per week to more than $600. Buying new, she said, worked out cheaper with her mortgage repayment coming to just $500 a week. ""It's a lot of money to go into debt for, but it's your own."" In 2019, house prices in Katherine slid 16 per cent, financial services company CoreLogic detailed in its June report on housing markets. More than $212 million in federal compensation finally reaches communities with PFAS-contaminated drinking and groundwater, but their concerns are far from over. A landmark class action had been formally filed against the Australian government over PFAS contamination, with Katherine residents arguing their property values had plummeted — some even said their houses were unsaleable. But according to Mr Nayda, ""that's all done and dusted"". ""We had a bit of a fright with PFAS … but at the moment the rental market is excellent. If you asked me the same question eight months ago I would have said it was in dire straights,"" he said. ""Interest rates are low, house prices are still reasonably low in Katherine — they haven't peaked yet — and rentals are obviously going up – it makes it very attractive for an investment."" At the beginning of 2020, Prime Minister Scott Morrison jetted into Katherine and announced $1.1 billion dollars in upgrades on the outskirts of town at the Tindal RAAF Base. The work includes facilities for Australia's new US-made F-35 strike fighters. This, according to Mr Nayda, was the start of the housing boom. All of a sudden, massive companies needed somewhere to home their contractors to carry out the work, Mr Nayda said. ""We had to tell them, 'Sorry, we have no more rentals left … but look at the market, find a cheaper house, and you'll probably find out in the end it will be cheaper for you to buy it,'"" Mr Nayda said. He said they started snapping them up. After 23 years in the real estate industry, peaks and troughs in Katherine's housing market have become all too familiar to Alison Ross, principal for Elders. She said the shift in the property market was something that hadn't been seen in quite a few years, with COVID-19 and an influx of projects as the critical factors. While COVID-19 crushed almost all thoughts of travelling, many people saw their savings grow much faster than anticipated. And even though house prices have skyrocketed in most pockets of Australia, Ms Ross said entering the market in Katherine was still achievable, with prices starting at $200,000 to $300,000. Ms Ross said economic development in the region and jobs had brought people to town. ""Rents have skyrocketed, and a few government agencies are no longer providing rental subsidies,"" she said. ""And so those people have to be self-sufficient and are saying, 'Let's just go and buy something. It's always a good stable rental return, so whilst we can buy something when we're moving here, we've always got that rental option when we leave.'"" In a market where inventory is low, Mr Nayda said ""bidding wars"" had become commonplace. Mr Nayda said a complaint had been filed to Consumer Affairs about some agencies advertising ""make an offer"",  which he said could supercharge the market. ""We have [agencies] outside of Katherine who have seen an opportunity to make a quid, getting in contact with owners and spiking the rents or doing rent bidding,"" he said. While frowned upon in the Northern Territory, rent bidding isn't illegal. However, Consumer Affairs said ""property agents and landlords must not mislead or deceive prospective tenants"", nor list a property without a price. The typical Australian home owner has became more than $130,000 richer on paper over the past year, and there are few signs yet that the real estate boom is about to end. Nationally, property values grew 22 per cent in 2021 and are expected to rise again this year, before falling in 2023. But Alison Ross is optimistic she will be busy with clients snapping up houses for a number of years to come – especially new houses, as long as builders are available and they can get their hands on materials. ""Rents have gone through the roof and we should have been planning and forecasting years ago,"" she said. ""A lot of people are coming here for work. ""They might be single people that are out of university or just want a small unit to rent or purchase and that's what we need to be building – which hasn't happened.""

71,'A significant blow to the government's agenda': Proxy advice regulation defeated in the Senate,markets,"  Proxy advice law which sparked fears it would reduce investor activism defeated in the Senate Three days after they were introduced into federal parliament, the Senate has overturned Treasurer Josh Frydenberg's regulations on proxy advisers. Proxy advisers are the people who advise big investors, including superannuation funds, on how to vote on issues impacting the re-election of company directors. Board directors are increasingly being taken to task by superannuation funds and other big institutional investors on a broad range of issues from CEO pay and climate change to sexual harassment and money laundering. One week out from Christmas, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg passed regulation that would have stripped these advisers of their ability to provide their services under their existing financial services licence within 52 days. The people who advise investors in big super funds how to vote on issues, such as chief executive pay and climate change, are under threat, writes Nassim Khadem. On Wednesday independent senator Rex Patrick moved to disallow the regulations, and succeeded by 29 votes to 25. The new regulatory regime which came into effect on February 7 lasted only three days. Senator Patrick's motion gained the support of the entire Senate crossbench, including One Nation. ""The Labor Party has sided with the Greens again to roll back reforms designed to improve the accountability and transparency of the proxy advice and superannuation sectors,"" My Frydenberg told the ABC. He said after voting against a number of other government reforms, the parties had ""voted against superannuation funds disclosing to their members how they voted on company resolutions"". ""Our reforms were designed to strengthen the integrity of our corporate governance regime and ensure more consistent regulation across the financial services industry,"" Mr Frydenberg said. But Senator Patrick told ABC News the laws would have been detrimental for shareholders. ""The Senate did its job today,"" he said. ""This was bad law, crafted to please Josh Frydenberg's big business mates and political donors, and the Senate rightly rejected it. ""It's been wiped from the Federal Register of Legislation, hopefully forever. ""This has got to be a world record start up then shut down of a regulatory regime. It lasted three days. It was one big thought bubble from the Treasurer that just wasted taxpayers' money and the parliament's time."" Greens senator Nick McKim called it ""a significant blow to the government's agenda of looking after its billionaire mates"". ""We need far greater scrutiny of corporations in this country, not less,"" he said. ""This was nothing less than a naked attempt to shield the likes of Gerry Harvey and Solomon Lew from scrutiny and criticism. ""The Liberals should be ensuring that billionaires and big corporations pay their fair share of tax, instead of letting them off the hook in every way possible."" Shadow Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said it was ""a great outcome for transparency and shareholders"". ""Perhaps Josh Frydenberg can now spend his time dealing with real problems in the economy, not the invented problems,"" Mr Jones said. ""I congratulate all the senators who worked together on getting a good outcome."" There are four proxy advisers in Australia — the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI), CGI Glass Lewis, Ownership Matters and ISS — and they give big investors advice by way of written reports, as well as verbally. Ownership Matters co-founder and director Dean Paatsch said ""the entire exercise was a cluster fiasco"". ""I thank the Senate, in particular Senator Patrick, [Senator Jacqui] Lambie and One Nation, who were prepared to stand up for free market principles that the government abandoned"" he said. ""It was profoundly disappointing that the government indulged crony capitalists and the major business lobbies at the expense of respect for property rights, the freedom to contract and the right to confidential advice"". He said the new laws ""weaponised financial services laws to punish advisers"" with hefty fines and would have slapped restrictions on advisers' access to capital, as well as adding constraints on who operators can employ or associate with. Advisers to big investors like super funds — known as proxy advisers — are holding company directors to account but they could soon face government regulation. The regulations had added in a requirement for proxy advisers to send copies of their reports by email to ASX companies on the same day they deliver their advice to clients. ""Advisers were required to make notes of verbal conversations about voting issues with investors and send those records to the company,"" Mr Paatsch said. He said this would have exposed advisers to fines of up to $11.1 million (for companies) and $1.1 million (for individuals) if the duties to report were breached. Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI) chief executive Louise Davidson said she was pleased the ""unprecedented rules"" had been disallowed. One of the changes would have required proxy advisers to be independent of their clients, potentially signalling the end of ACSI's current model. The organisation is owned by some of the nation's largest industry super funds. ""Proxy advisers play an important role in facilitating informed shareholder voting at listed Australian company meetings on a range of financially material issues,"" Ms Davidson said. ""The regulations were rushed through without parliamentary scrutiny and with no justification, rationale or harm identified."" She said advisers would have faced ""more onerous red tape"" including the fines of up to $11 million for ""small administrative errors"". CPA Australia spokeswoman Jane Rennie said: ""It wasn't only that the substance of these reforms was bad, the purpose and processes underlying them were manifestly inadequate."" ""The reforms were made without adequate justification, explanation, consultation and consideration,"" she said. ""These are pretty fundamental requirements for good lawmaking. It's appropriate that they have been disallowed in the Senate."" ""We were concerned that the reforms could limit investors' ability to exercise their voting rights by reducing their access to information about companies' practices and performance. ""This would in turn decrease the accountability of boards and management and deliver poor outcomes for shareholders, especially superannuation fund members."" But Australian Institute of Company Directors (AICD) managing director Angus Armour said they were disappointed that the regulations did not get up. ""The key substantive obligations of AFSL licence holders are difficult to argue against: that licensees provide their financial services efficiently, honestly and fairly; have adequate conflict management arrangements in place; and comply with financial services laws,"" he said. ""Proxy advice is a profitable, global industry."" ""Given its highly influential role in Australian markets, it is appropriate that proxy advice is regulated to these reasonable standards.""

73,"Banks weigh on ASX 200 as ANZ outlook disappoints, travel stocks jump on border reopening news",markets,"  Banks weigh on ASX 200 as ANZ outlook disappoints, travel stocks jump on border reopening news Australia shares have fallen on Monday, with ANZ's slump due to a hit to margins also dragging down stocks of other heavyweight lenders. The ASX 200 was down 0.1 per cent to 7,111, with Magellan (-11.2pc) and Appen (-5.8pc) leading the losses. Banks dropped as much as 0.4 per cent, with ANZ falling 1.9 per cent after the lender joined Westpac in flagging a hit to margins due to stiff competition in mortgage lending and the central bank's ultra-loose policy settings. CBA and NAB were down 0.1 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively, while Westpac was up 0.2 per cent. Travel stocks rallied after the federal government said borders would reopen later this month. Flight Centre (+7.8pc), Corporate Travel Management (+7pc) and Webjet (+6.2pc) were among the best performers. Investors will be flooded with updates from the nation's largest companies in the next few weeks — about how much they're earning, along with the impact of staff shortages and higher inflation on their profit margins. Casino operator Star Entertainment was up 0.9 per cent at $3.58 after it forecast a first-half loss and said it would need to remediate employees it had underpaid over six years. Healthcare stocks retreated 1.3 per cent, led by biotech major CSL sliding 1.6 per cent. Sonic Healthcare and Cochlear dropped about 1.1 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively. By contrast, Graincorp soared 12.3 per cent after the agribusiness firm forecast an at least 70 per cent growth in full-year profit, driven by global demand for Australian grain and oilseeds. James Hardie, the world's largest fibre cement maker, jumped 2 per cent after hiking its annual profit outlook for the fourth time and setting an even higher forecast for the next year. Energy stocks gained 1.6 per cent as crude oil prices hit seven-year highs late on Friday on worries about supply disruptions fuelled by frigid US weather and ongoing political turmoil among major world producers. Brent crude was up, trading at $US93.49 by 4:30pm AEDT. Woodside Petroleum added 1.9 per cent on Monday, while Santos and Ampol were up 1.6 per cent and 2.6 per cent, respectively. Technology stocks also remained buoyant and climbed 0.6 per cent, tracking a strong overnight finish on the Nasdaq. Block rose 3.1 per cent, while local tech names Xero and WiseTech Global added 0.5 per cent and1.5 per cent. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was flat at 70.86 US cents by 4:33pm AEDT. Another bumpy ride on Wall Street ended on Friday as Amazon's positive earnings capped a run of mixed big-tech numbers. Results from megacap growth stocks have dictated market moves this week, as investors seek out tangible data to support sky-high valuations. Amazon jumped 13.5 per cent after reporting robust earnings in the holiday quarter. The gain expanded its market capitalisation by around $US190 billion, the largest ever single-day increase in value of a US company. This came a day after Facebook owner Meta's disappointing results shook markets and wiped more than $US200 billion off its valuation, the deepest loss of stock market value in history by a US company. ""These are eye-watering, stomach churning moves normally associated with penny stocks, and yet they are happening in companies with billion-dollar market caps,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. Despite the earnings-driven whiplash in technology stocks, all three major stock indexes ended their first week of February higher, with the indexes posting their second week of gains in a row. While Meta lost another 0.3 per cent on Friday, other social media companies which had been dragged down with the Facebook owner rebounded strongly as they posted estimate-beating earnings of their own. Among them was Snap, surging 58.8 per cent after reporting better-than-expected fourth-quarter user growth and outlook. Pinterest also jumped 11.2 per cent after its quarterly revenue beat estimates as retailers splurged on advertising during the holiday quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21.42 points, or 0.06 per cent, to 35,089.74, the S&P 500 gained 23.09 points, or 0.52 per cent, to 4,500.53 and the Nasdaq Composite added 219.19 points, or 1.58 per cent, to 14,098.01. Meanwhile, the pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.38 per cent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.77 per cent.

The ASX 200 was up 0.6 per cent, to 7,120. Ten of 11 sectors ended higher, with industrials the best performing sector, gaining 1.2 per cent and 2 per cent for the past five days. Liontown (+6.2pc), Pointsbet (+5.1pc) and Platinum Asset (+3.5pc) were among the top movers. News Corp rose 5.7 per cent, to $33.38, after the company reported its highest quarterly revenues since 2013. Qantas jumped 4.9 per cent to $5.19 on news about international tourists could soon be allowed to return. However, Seek (-3.8pc), Arb (-3.6pc) and Adbri (-2.7pc) were leading the losses today. The Australian dollar was flat, at 71.44 US cents, by 4:32pm AEDT. Overseas, global equity markets tumbled on Thursday as frightened investors digested disappointing updates from major central banks about the outlook for inflation and interest rates. Europe's main bourses were down as the BoE delivered its widely expected second interest rate hike in three months, which helped buoy sterling and lift the euro. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost about 1.8 per cent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.2 per cent, in response to a seemingly worldwide surge in inflation, analysts said. The bank raised interest rates to 0.5 per cent from 0.25 per cent on Thursday and nearly half its policymakers wanted a bigger increase to contain rampant price pressures, which the British central bank warned would push inflation above 7 per cent. Meanwhile, the pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.34 per cent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.91 per cent, in response to a seemingly worldwide surge in inflation, analysts said. On Wall Street, Facebook-owner Meta's dour forecast sent its stock plummeting, abruptly ending a nascent recovery built on upbeat earnings from big tech companies. Facebook parent company Meta plunges 24.5 per cent, erasing more than $220 billion in market value, its largest drop in history. In the currency market, the defensive mood dented the dollar after an earlier step to regain its footing. Inflation pressures were weighing on bonds as the ECB kept its policy unchanged as expected on Thursday. Making only the smallest change to its statement, the ECB removed a clause stipulating that its next policy move could be in ""either direction"". The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about 1.5 per cent, the S&P 500 index shed more than 2 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped more than 3 per cent. ""There's a big impact from the results of Meta. It's like a real earthquake,"" said Mikael Jacoby, head of Continental European sales trading at Oddo Securities in Paris. ""We had good results here for European tech … I'm quite surprised by the resilience of the market here. ""I would say I'm not positive for markets moving forward: This is the last quarter when earnings will enjoy such a favourable comparison, year-on-year. [Interest] rates are going up and there's a major geopolitical risk."" IG Markets analyst Kyle Rodda said there was even more expected volatility in stocks to come, especially in terms of how far the Federal Reserve will go in tightening monetary policy this year. ""It doesn't look like we are out of the woods yet."" ""There's been little resolution to the key Fed questions: How many hikes? What will the pace, size and timing of quantitative tightening be? Until that becomes clearer, volatility should remain heightened."" On oil markets, prices edged higher, maintaining their upward trajectory built on expectations that supply will tighten further, even after OPEC+ producers stuck to planned moderate output increases.

75,"analysis: Why don't Australian banks offer 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, like the US?",markets,"  What's wrong with Australian mortgages? They're fixed for shareholders, not home owners If you're paying off a mortgage — or aspiring to — imagine if you didn't have to worry so much about rising interest rates. That's already the reality for US home buyers. Unlike in Australia, most mortgages in the US have a fixed-interest rate, locked in for 30 years. Instead of having to wait and see if their central bank (the Federal Reserve) raises rates each month, a US 30-year fixed mortgage at 2 per cent will still have the same monthly repayment — even after a rate rise. In contrast, when the Reserve Bank of Australia lifts rates it has huge implications for household budgets, because most borrowers still have variable-rate mortgages. Every time the cash rate increases and banks inevitably pass through that increase, our mortgage payments go up too — adding thousands of dollars to average annual repayments. This is one reason why RBA governor Philip Lowe has been so cautious about following the US Federal Reserve's strong signal about lifting interest rates. So why don't Australian lenders offer 30-year fixed-rate mortgages too, like their US counterparts? Here in Australia, an extra 1 per cent on a $600,000 mortgage means $6,000 a year more in interest payments. And these are post-tax dollars. So if you earn $100,000 and hence pay an average tax rate of 25 per cent, that's like taking a roughly $8,000 pay cut. Ouch. A 3 per cent rise in official rates over two to three years is not impossible. On a $600,000 mortgage that would mean an extra $18,000 a year in interest payments. Westpac is now expecting the Reserve Bank to start raising official interest rates as early as August. The RBA knows this, of course. It looks at Australian household debt of more than 120 per cent of GDP and knows raising rates too aggressively risks putting a significant number of Australian households into financial distress. In one sense this is good news. It means the RBA has large-calibre ammunition to fire in pursuit of its monetary policy goals (to keep unemployment low and inflation between 2 per cent and 3 per cent). But it would be better if the Australian mortgage market involved less risk for consumers. There is no reason why Australian lenders couldn't offer 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. After all, there's an active government bond market with maturities from one year to 30 years. This provides a benchmark to price mortgages. Fixed-rate mortgages have become much more popular in Australia in the past few years: the proportion of new mortgages that were fixed jumped from about 15 per cent in June 2019 to more than 45 per cent by September 2021. But even those loans are typically fixed for only three years — sometimes as short as one year, sometimes as long as five years. After that, the rate reverts to the variable rate. Longer fixed-rate loans would insulate Australian borrowers from big swings in interest rates. In the US you can refinance a 30-year fixed mortgage if long-term rates drop. So you benefit if rates go down but are protected if they go up. Another idea to improve loan contract terms for borrowers — long advocated by University of Melbourne economist Kevin Davis — is the so-called ""tracker mortgage"". These contracts limit borrowers to paying a certain ""spread"" over a benchmark interest rate. Such offerings depend in large part on competition in the banking sector. The US has lots of competition in banking. Australia has very little. When costs go up, two groups can bear that cost: customers or shareholders. In Australia when bank funding costs go up, customers bear pretty much all of the cost, and shareholders zero. That's the best evidence you'll ever get of true market power. The Reserve Bank is well positioned to drive the official unemployment rate down from 4.2 per cent to the lowest levels in 50 years while keeping inflation under control. It knows when it does increase interest rates this will transmit very directly to the real economy. The challenge for Lowe is to use his interest-rate firepower in true Goldilocks fashion: not too little but not too much. That will be the great central banking challenge of the next several years. If we could restructure the Australian mortgage market to better protect borrowers from swings in interest rates, the job of future RBA governors need not involve such a delicate balancing act.

76,Biggest one-day drop in history erases a quarter of Meta's value,markets,"  Facebook parent company Meta plummets 26 per cent, loses $332 billion in worst one-day company drop Facebook parent company Meta slumped more than 26 per cent overnight, erasing more than $US237 billion ($332 billion) in market value, the largest one-day drop in history, also taking $US29 billion ($40 billion) off the personal wealth of founder Mark Zuckerberg. This decline marked the company's worst one-day loss since its Wall Street debut in 2012, and the biggest single-day loss of dollar value by any listed firm. Mr Zuckerberg's nearly $US30 billion drop in personal wealth was the second-largest one-day personal loss in history according to US financial news outlet CNBC. According to CNBC, the biggest one-day personal drop in wealth was a $US35 billion loss for Tesla founder Elon Musk in November. However, according to the Forbes real time billionaires index, Mr Zuckerberg still has an estimated personal fortune of nearly $US85 billion ($119 billion). Mr Zuckerberg was not the only one losing a lot of money overnight. Meta's lofty stock price, as with several other big communications and technology companies, has an outsized influence on markets. That means a big swing in either direction for such a company can do much to sink or lift the broader market. The tech focused Nasdaq, of which Meta is a major part, plunged 3.7 per cent, to close at 13,879. The broader S&P 500 and blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average had smaller, but still substantial, falls. Meta sank after forecasting revenue that was well below analysts' expectations for the current quarter, a disappointment for a company that investors have become accustomed to delivering spectacular growth. It also reported a rare decline in profit due to a sharp increase in expenses. ""Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg may be keen to coax the world into an alternate reality, but disappointing fourth-quarter results were quick to burst his metaverse bubble,"" said Laura Hoy, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Meta reported a decline in daily active users from the previous quarter for the first time as competition with rivals — such as TikTok, the video-sharing platform owned by China's ByteDance — heats up. Virtual real estate is booming. So what exactly is it, what are the risks for potential buyers, and who are the Australians taking the plunge? According to Meta, about 3 per cent of worldwide monthly active users in the fourth quarter were accounts which violated its rules, while duplicate accounts may have represented about 11 per cent of usage. Big US tech-focused companies have already come under mounting pressure in 2022 as investors expect interest rate rises by the US Federal Reserve to erode the industry's rich valuations following years of ultra-low monetary policy. The Nasdaq, which is dominated by tech and other growth stocks, fell more than 9 per cent in January, its worst monthly drop since the coronavirus-induced market crash in March 2020. ""The downgrade in the earnings outlook by Meta and other companies took markets by surprise,"" said Kenneth Broux, a strategist at Societe Generale in London. ""The tech sell-off spilled over to broader equity markets this morning and, with the Fed preparing to raise interest rates, we could see more volatility going forward."" Meta was a widely held stock by various investor groups, including hedge funds, according to recent data, leaving a number of funds potentially exposed by the wipe-out in its shares. Other institutional investors were also heavy owners. It was also a popular stock for retail investors, who appeared to be enthusiastically buying the dip. Some portfolio managers also saw a reason to buy. David Jeffress, portfolio manager at Laffer Tengler Investments, said on Thursday the firm was looking to add to its stake in Meta as the stock declines. Mr Jeffress pointed to strong or increasing numbers Meta reported for user engagement, advertising and revenue per user. ""The results, taken in their entirety, were okay. It was the guidance that spooked people,"" Mr Jeffress said. He called the trading declines ""an overreaction."" Investors will be flooded with updates from the nation's largest companies in the next few weeks — about how much they're earning, along with the impact of staff shortages and higher inflation on their profit margins. The steep drop weighed on fellow social media company Twitter, which shed 6.1 per cent. Snapchat's parent company, Snap, sank 18.6 per cent. With Big Tech firms such as Apple and Microsoft ballooning in valuations over the past few years, they have also become more susceptible to investor whiplash, often resulting in losses worth tens of billions of dollars in a single day of trade. Apple shed nearly $180 billion on September 3, 2020, while Microsoft lost $177 billion on March 16 the same year.

77,"ASX lower, Westpac jumps on cuts and profit beat, Facebook owner Meta plunges",markets,"  ASX lower, Westpac jumps on cuts and profit beat, Facebook owner Meta plunges Australian shares have closed lower after two straight sessions of gains, weighed down by technology stocks, while banking giant Westpac jumped after reporting first-quarter profit above estimates. The ASX 200 was down 0.1 per cent, at 7,078. Technology stocks fell as much as 5.9 per cent, extending losses for the year so far to more than 20 per cent, weighed down by Afterpay’s new owner Block (-9.8pc) and Xero (-5pc). Novonix (-14.7pc), Wisetech (-8pc) and Zip (-9.6pc) were also leading the losses. Gaming company Aristocrat Leisure dropped about 0.5 per cent to $41.09, after its offer to buy Britain's Playtech fell through. Among the best performers were Nufarm (+20.2pc), Amcor (+3pc) and Virgin Money (+1.4pc). Mining stocks jumped as much as 1.5 per cent to be one of the three sectors in the positive territory, benefited by stronger commodity prices, with Rio Tinto (+2.4pc), BHP (+3.1pc) and Fortescue (+3.3pc) advancing. The Australian dollar was down 0.2 per cent, at 71.25 US cents, by 4:22pm AEDT. Brent crude oil was down 0.2 per cent, trading at $US89.26 a barrel, by 4:24pm AEDT. Banking group Westpac rose as much as 2.3 per cent, to $21.07, after the lender beat estimates for first-quarter profit and made headway in cutting costs. Australia's fourth-largest bank by market value said it cut its headcount by more than 1,100 over the quarter, reduced corporate functions by about 20 per cent and combined key management roles. The lender reiterated that it would meet its cost target of $8 billion by 2024, as it cut expenses to $2.70 billion in the quarter, down 7 per cent from the quarterly average of the second half, excluding notable items. Westpac also recorded a 20 per cent drop in first-quarter cash earnings and warned that steep competition in mortgages would drag margins more this year, forcing the lender to bring forward organisational changes. It expects to book restructuring charges in both its half-year and full-year results. Chief financial officer Michael Rowland said the environment ""remains highly competitive, and we continue to see pressure on margins"". Westpac is struggling with intense competition for mortgages amid record-low rates, with customers now considering a switch to fixed-rate loans that tend to be written at a lower margin than those at variable rates. The bank's stock has lost about a fifth of its value since November, when it reported a big drop in margins, a profit miss and slow progress in a costly turnaround to fix outdated software and convoluted procedures. Net interest margin, a key measure of profitability, fell 8 basis points in the first quarter to 1.91 per cent from 1.99 per cent in the second half of fiscal 2021. While the bank beat consensus estimates for cash earnings, it set aside $551 million more to cover the pandemic's hit to supply chains and certain sectors, resulting in an impairment charge of $118 million in the quarter. Cash earnings for the three months to December 31 came in at $1.58 billion, compared with $1.97 billion reported a year ago. That was higher than the $1.47 billion forecast by Citigroup and $1.38 billion by Morgan Stanley. Meanwhile, Nick Scali reported its half-yearly net profit after tax fell 6.6 per cent, to $35.6 million, hurt by supply chain disruptions caused by the outbreak of the Omicron variant. Its shares were up 1 per cent, trading at $14.54. Global stocks rallied on Wednesday to close higher as strong earnings from US technology companies and OPEC+ plans for moderate oil output helped to counter jitters over weak economic reports. Investors also shrugged off the pace of central banks' interest rate hikes. The STOXX index of 600 European companies rose 0.45 per cent, up for a third-straight session, to recoup nearly half its losses during January's global rout in shares. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.80 per cent. All three Wall Street benchmarks closed higher on Wednesday, a fourth-straight session of gains after a turbulent start to the year, aided by upbeat earnings from Google parent Alphabet and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices. The S&P 500 gained 42.84 points, or 0.94 per cent, to end at 4,589.38 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 71.54 points, or 0.50 pe cent, to 14,417.55. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 224.09 points, or 0.63 per cent, to 35,629.33. Alphabet rose 7.5 per cent after reporting record quarterly sales on Tuesday, and said it planned to undertake a 20-to-one stock split. ""Google crushed earnings and that optimism has many traders feeling that the bottom is in for the mega-cap tech giants,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst from OANDA, said in a note. ""Alphabet's earnings get an A+ after posting strong advertising revenue growth, record net income profit, impressive Google Cloud revenue, surging interest with YouTube shorts and as the company explores innovation with blockchain."" However, Facebook owner Meta's shares plunged more than 20 per cent late on Wednesday as the social media company missed on Wall Street earnings estimates and posted a weaker-than-expected forecast. Meta said it had ben hit by Apple's privacy changes to its operating system, which had made it harder for brands to target and measure their ads on Facebook and Instagram, and by macroeconomic issues such as supply-chain disruptions. Amazon dipped ahead of its earnings date on Thursday. Last month, the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell as much as 19 per cent from its all-time high in November as investors dumped highly valued growth stocks on prospects of faster-than-expected rate hikes. Traders are betting on five rate hikes this year after hawkish comments from the US Federal Reserve in January.

78,"ASX climbs on energy and materials stocks, living costs rise in December quarter",markets,"  ASX climbs on energy and materials stocks, living costs rise in December quarter Australian shares have closed higher, nearing its five-day session high. The ASX 200 was up 1.2 per cent to 7,088, with materials and energy stocks leading the way. Nine of 11 sectors ended higher, with energy the best performing sector, gaining 2.8 per cent today and 7.6 per cent for the past five days. Among the top movers were Champion Iron (+6.2pc), Auckland International Airport (+5.4pc) and Worley (+5pc). Meanwhile, Credit Corp (-6.3pc), Block (-5.6pc) and Amcor (-3.5pc) were leading the losses. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe indicated in his first speech of the year at a National Press Club lunch today that the central bank would ""take time"" before raising interest rates. He said a rising cash rate was not ""imminent"". Yesterday, the benchmark rose to its highest level in a week, after the RBA's decision to hold its cash rate but to end its bond-buying program. The Reserve Bank boss governor says policymakers are flying into uncharted economic territory, and the RBA will ""take the time"" to figure out what is going on before raising interest rates. Australian dollar was up 0.1 per cent, at 71.33 US cents, by 05:02pm AEDT. However, oil prices slipped from seven-year highs, pressured by speculation that producer group OPEC+ could decide to boost supply by more than previously flagged, as well as expectations of a rise in US inventories. Brent crude oil was up 0.4 per cent, trading at $US89.51 a barrel, by 05:03pm AEDT. The cost of living was higher in the December 2021 quarter across Australian households, according to the latest data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The living costs of pensioner and beneficiary households rose by 0.8 per cent in the December quarter, up 3.0 per cent annually to a seven-and-a-half-year high. The living costs of self-funded retiree households lifted 0.9 per cent during the same period, up 3.3 per cent annually, while age pensioner households increased 0.8 per cent, up 3.4 per cent annually to a decade high. Michelle Marquardt, head of Prices Statistics, said the surging fuel prices in the past 12 months (+30pc) was the main driver to higher living costs, alongside rising prices in domestic holiday travel and accommodation (+4.8pc) and tobacco (+2.1pc). ""Food makes up a higher proportion of overall expenditure for age pensioner households compared to other types of households,"" she said. ""Age pensioner households also experienced the highest annual increase for housing costs, with relatively higher expenditure levels on maintenance and repair and property rates. ""Consequently, this household group had the highest annual living cost increase of 3.4 per cent."" The annual increase for employee households was lower, at 2.6 per cent, thanks to lower mortgage rates, which fell 1.6 per cent in the December quarter and 7.4 per cent over the past 12 months. ""This means that employee households had the lowest annual increase at 2.6 per cent, as mortgages are a higher proportion of their overall expenditure,"" Ms Marquardt said. Telstra rose 1 per cent to $3.98 after announcing it would invest in two telecommunication infrastructure projects. They involve building and managing ground infrastructure for Viasat’s global satellite and a 20,000km extension of its existing optical fibre network. The company said it expected to invest between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion on both projects over the next five years. ""Investing in these two truly significant nation-building projects will see us continue to have the largest intercity fibre network in the country, helping to futureproof Australia's digital economy and further improving connectivity in regional Australia,"" CEO Andrew Penn said. Overseas, all three Wall Street benchmarks advanced on Tuesday and the energy index closed at a multi-year high. However, seesaw trading reflected investor uncertainty about how to play the current market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 273.38 points, or 0.78 per cent, to 35,405.24, the S&P 500 gained 30.99 points, or 0.69 per cent, to 4,546.54. The Nasdaq Composite added 106.12 points, or 0.75 per cent, to 14,346.00. Recent sessions have been choppy, as the prospect of an aggressive rate-hike campaign by the US Federal Reserve looms large and investors seek to position themselves accordingly — a task not made easy by lingering pandemic influences on the economy and geopolitical tension in Europe. But despite losing 5.3 per cent and 3.3 per cent in January respectively, the S&P 500 and the Dow have now recorded three straight days of gains, with the Nasdaq — which dropped 8.99 per cent in the first month of 2022 — posting four positive sessions in the last five. It did not look like that would happen earlier in the session, when all three benchmarks traded lower in the wake of data from the Labor Department and the ISM's purchasing managers' index (PMI). ""You're starting to see that there are a lot of investors who are concerned about valuations going forward, but there are others who are worried about growth, so it seems the wall of worry keeps on growing as the economy exits this pandemic,"" senior market analyst at OANDA, Ed Moya, said. Traders are betting on five rate hikes this year, with some Wall Street analysts expecting seven hikes. ""This will be the year when Fed will pull back support ... the markets will not be on steroids anymore and may go through a phase of detox,"" said Anu Gaggar, global investment strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network. Geopolitical tensions added to market volatility, with Ukraine's President signing a decree to boost his armed forces by 100,000 troops over three years, as European leaders lined up to back him in a stand-off with Russia and the United States demanded immediate Russian de-escalation. European shares ended higher on Tuesday, recovering some of January's steep losses. The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 1.3 per cent after January became its worst-performing month since October 2020, when concerns over rising interest rates, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical tensions knocked the index down 4 per cent. Japan's blue-chip Nikkei rose 0.28 per cent, with MSCI's world stock index up 0.85 per cent after hitting its highest in over a week. Meanwhile, a number of markets in Asia, including China, were closed for the Lunar New Year holidays.

79,'It's a lot of money lost': Rising rates and falling share prices are hitting super funds but 'now is not the time to panic',markets,"  The average superannuation fund lost $4,000 last month, but experts say 'now is not the time to panic' Since the start of the year, as a sinking share market has sparked fears among some of an imminent crash, Australians have nervously watched their super balances plummet. For 36-year-old hospitality worker Garth Boulton, seeing his $60,000 superannuation balance erode in weeks is ""a bit disheartening"". ""Those years of your life [working and contributing to super] just sort of disappear a little bit, because of something you've got no control over,"" he says. Mr Boulton says he would like to contribute more money into his super but that ""at the moment, it's just not financially viable"". ""I'm barely making enough to make ends meet currently, and then trying to make up for the period of COVID hitting … it's just been a bit of a struggle."" Retiree Beverly Baker only has a small amount of money in super, so a $3,000 dip in recent weeks has been scary to watch. ""That's a fair hit,"" she says. While the superannuation sector is now worth about $3.3 trillion, most Australians are invested in default superannuation accounts, largely leaving their super funds to manage their money. Director of research at Rainmaker Information, Alex Dunnin, says about 10 million Australians are in default accounts with investments that include a mix of shares, government bonds, property, infrastructure and cash. He says due to recent falls on the stock market, the average loss in January was about 3.9 per cent, seeing the value of default super accounts falling by about $40 billion to about $900 billion. That means Australians with default super have lost about $4,000 on average. ""It's a lot of money [lost],"" Mr Dunnin says. ""The stock market jitters caused by inflation around the world and fears it will push up interest rates caught up with us quicker than expected."" He notes the Rainmaker MySuper index is still up 12.5 per cent from where it was before COVID-19 hit. The share market is meanwhile only up 2.5 per cent, he says. Mr Dunnin says that in 2021, the Australian Stock Exchange was up about 17 per cent, which dragged super balances up by about 15 per cent. ""The pandemic has been awful, but for super fund members, home owners and investors, it's been stunningly brilliant,"" he says. The concern now is, with the market sinking and interest rates expected to rise, will double-digit returns for Australians with super accounts still be possible? Founder and chief investment officer of Montgomery Investment Management, Roger Montgomery, says not in 2022. ""We will definitely have years in the future where investors enjoy double-digit returns again from their stock market investments. But it may not be 2022."" He says Australians can still take steps to protect their retirement nest eggs in the short term. He notes that in the low-interest-rate environment, investors migrated out of cash into higher-risk sectors such as property, stocks and even, in some cases, private equity, venture capital and cryptocurrencies and NFTs. As interest rates rise, he says investors are going to find cash is once again king. ""Cash will be more attractive,"" he says. Thousands of employers are failing to pay superannuation, and it's costing workers billions every year. ""And we're going to find bonds, if they're held to maturity, will provide a better return than they have in the past."" Mr Montgomery also says the stock market sell-off in January means that investors can buy good companies at lower prices. He warns against holding big investments in technology companies and biotechnology companies that are not making any revenue or profit today but are expected to in 10 or 15 years' time. ""They're the stocks that have fallen the most already,"" he says. Despite January's losses, the industry is urging Australians not to panic. Deputy CEO of the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA) Glen McCrea says, ""super goes up and down and the share market goes up and down"". ""But over the long term, super is doing well,"" he says. ""Over the last 10 years, the average [return has been] about 8 per cent. ""Even though we've had the tail end of the GFC and we've had COVID-19, super — because it's a diversified asset investments — has resulted in a really good return. ""People shouldn't get nervous if they see their balance change. But they should monitor over a long-term basis to be comfortable."" Mr McCrea also notes that most super funds have a balanced investment approach that includes investments in domestic shares, international shares and government bonds, as well as property and infrastructure. He says most super funds hold about 25 per cent in foreign shares, 25 per cent in domestic stocks and then the rest of their investments are in property, infrastructure bonds and some cash in the bank. ""It basically means you're sharing your risk so that if there's a major change in one particular asset, say domestic equities, you're then not going to see your super fall by quite as much,"" he says. ""The most important thing is to check regularly that money's going into your super account."" Super Consumers Australia director Xavier O'Halloran also urges Australians not to get too nervous about falling balances. ""It's important to remember that superannuation is a mix of shares and cash and other assets,"" he says. ""It's really designed to be balanced so that it can ride out these kinds of shocks."" ""Right now is not the time to panic. There's some short-term volatility in the market but superannuation is really a long-term investment. And so, people should be thinking about what their strategy is decades into the future."" He says with the ATO super fund comparison tool recently introduced by the federal government, it has never been easier to compare super funds and ensure they are delivering strong returns and low fees. ""At the moment, that average fee for balanced products is around 1 per cent,"" he says. ""But there are certainly much cheaper products on the market … and it can make a huge difference in your retirement savings, potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars."" New data from the regulator shows more superannuation funds are failing to stack up to benchmarks measuring fees and investment performance. He says younger consumers can monitor performance over time. ""Usually, a rule of thumb is at least seven years is a good number of years to look at before you start changing around,"" he says. And for those that are closer to retirement, or already in retirement, he suggests they check they have enough of a cash buffer built up to ride out these kinds of short-term shocks. ""Right now, you'll be looking to draw down some of your retirement savings in the form of income to pay for your day-to-day costs,"" Mr O'Halloran says. ""You don't want to have to be worried about what's going on in the share market in order to go and buy the groceries. So really look at making sure you've got that really basic buffer in place."" Ms Baker says she is lucky she has a cash buffer that has helped lift her out of financial insecurity. Her father died and left her with an inheritance that has allowed her to pay off her mortgage, but she notes that many of her peers lack sufficient retirement savings and rely on the age pension. She says, ""very few women are going to end up with enough super for them to survive their old age and their retirement"", and wants, ""sensible policies that look at how much super women are going to earn over their life"". Ms Baker believes the stock market is a gamble and that, ""if you can hold on long enough, your gamble may pay back"". She says super fund members can also ensure their superannuation is invested in stocks less volatile to market fluctuations and rising interest rates. ""I don't take a high-risk package that's gambling on high returns,"" she says. Mr Boulton is also trying to ride out the short-term losses and is starting to monitor his super balance more closely. He recently started checking his Hostplus app and says he will be monitoring his fund's performance relative to the fees charged. He urges other Australians to use the ATO comparison tool to check if they can move to a fund with better returns and lower fees. ""The only thing we can do, really, is to basically change [to a] different superannuation [fund] with better performance."" ""Super funds have got to pick their game up a bit now.""

80,"Retail sales plunge in December, while ASX jumps on 'patient' Reserve Bank",markets,"  Retail sales plunge in December, while ASX jumps on 'patient' RBA Australian retail sales have plunged 4.4 per cent in December, according to the Retail Trade figures released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The seasonally adjusted results follows consecutive rises in November (+7.3pc), October (+4.9pc) and September (+1.3pc) last year. The 4.4 per cent fall was the largest monthly fall since April 2020, which was the first full month of the national COVID lockdown. However, retail sales remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels, with December’s monthly turnover the second-highest level in the series following November's record. ""Despite this month's fall, retail turnover remains strong, up 4.8 per cent on December 2020, with strong consumer spending continuing post the Delta Outbreak,"" said Ben James, director of Quarterly Economy Wide Statistics. ""Victorian turnover is now at the third-highest level ever, 6.5 per cent above December 2020."" Sales across all states and territories fell in December — except for the Northern Territory, which rose 3.6 per cent — as lockdown restrictions eased and the introduction of lockouts allowed more favourable trading conditions for businesses. Victoria recorded the largest fall of any state or territory, down by 8.4 per cent, followed by New South Wales (-4.2pc), South Australia (-4.1pc), Western Australia (-3.5pc), Tasmania (-3.5pc), ACT (-3.1pc) and Queensland (-0.7pc). Five of six retail industries fell in December, led by household goods retailing (-9.2 pc), clothing and footwear (-17.3pc) and department stores (-21.3pc). Food retailing, including supermarkets and liquor, was the only industry to rise, up 2.2 per cent. KPMG senior economist Sarah Hunter said while part of the fall could be attributed to the emergence of the omicron variant across the eastern states, it largely reflected continuing shifts in household spending patterns. ""The increasing popularity of Black Friday sales is pulling spending into November from December,"" she said. ""The timing of the end of the delta lockdowns was also a driver, with pent up demand in NSW, VIC and the ACT released in November."" JP Morgan said that it expects the spike in COVID cases through January will temporarily depress spending. ""Though we still expect the elevated saving rate and strong labour market will support consumption through 2022,"" it said in a note. On the share market, the ASX 200 closed higher, after the Reserve Bank's decision to keep its cash rate at a record low 0.1 per cent. The local index was up 0.5 per cent, to 7,006. The RBA said it would scrap its $350 billion bond-buying stimulus program on February 10, after its first monetary policy meeting of the year on Tuesday. However, governor Philip Lowe said the RBA would remain ""patient"" as it monitors inflation trends. Although the RBA has consistently said that interest rates won’t be lifted until annual wage growth is closer to 3 per cent, some banks expect rate hikes will be coming later this year. ANZ said it expects the RBA to lift the cash rate to 0.75 per cent by November and then reach 2 per cent by the end of 2023. While the Commonwealth Bank said ""the pre-conditions for a rate hike to be broadly met in August and tip a 15 basis point increase at the RBA Board meeting that month"". ""The RBA isn’t convinced that underlying inflation will remain in the 2-3 per cent band,"" chief economist Craig James from CommSec said in a note. ""It is also yet to be convinced that wages will lift as expected. In terms of interest rates, the RBA merely says that it will be patient."" The Reserve Bank will end its $350 billion bond-buying program on February 10. The benchmark index had a choppy start to the day. It opened with a rise to 6,980, followed by a fall to 6,951, before rising again. Ten of 11 sectors ended higher today, with information technology and utilities stocks leading the way, gaining 2.8 per cent and 2.7 per cent. Appen (+7.9pc) and Pendal (+7.3pc) were among the top movers, while Block and Zip expanded their gains from yesterday, trading at $171.20 (+6.1pc) and $3.31 (+4.8pc) respectively. On the other hand, BHP (-3pc), Brambles (-2.5pc) and Rio Tinto (-2.4pc) were leading the losses today. The Australian dollar was flat, at 70.64 US cents. Unwinding the distortions created by free money won’t be easy, nor will it be quick nor painless, but it is entirely necessary, writes business editor Ian Verrender. Oil prices were steady today, with Eastern Europe and Middle East political issues offsetting expectations that major producers will release more supply to a thirsty market. Brent crude was at $US89.63, up 0.4 per cent. Meanwhile, CoreLogic released its January home value data. It shows home prices, nationally, rose 1.1 per cent in January and 22.4 per cent over the past year. And 2021 saw the biggest increase in house prices since June 1989. The typical Australian home owner has became more than $130,000 richer on paper over the past year, and there are few signs yet that the real estate boom is about to end. Overseas, Wall Street edged higher on Monday after a rise in European shares helped stabilise investor sentiment after a series of volatile sessions. Still, investors said the backdrop for equities remains uncertain as central banks tighten policy — the Bank of England is expected to hike rates again on Thursday — and another jolt higher in oil prices adds to inflationary worries. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.84 per cent. Lunar New Year holidays made for thin trading conditions in Asia. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.02 per cent higher. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.82 per cent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq added 2.06 per cent, but has borne the brunt of selling and is down 14 per cent from a record peak last year. Meanwhile, the MSCI World index, while higher on Monday, remains down 6.2 per cent in January, its worst start to the year since 2016. Before Friday's rebound, the index had been headed for its worst January since the global financial crisis in 2008. ""This is not the classic sell-off affecting lower-quality, underperforming companies. This sell-off is driven not by fundamentals but by the action of central banks at a time when growth is very strong,"" said Flavio Carpenzano, investment director at Capital Group. ""For years you were like a spoiled child. You could get all the money you wanted and for free and you could buy what you wanted. You didn't care that much about quality. Now it's the other way round. ""You have to be more disciplined, so you need to look carefully at valuation."" The stand-off over Ukraine also remains a thorn in the markets' sides, with concerns a Russian invasion would cut vital gas supplies to Western Europe. Moscow denies any plan to invade.

81,Repairing Gippsland's saltmarshes to earn blue carbon credits 'a win for everyone',markets,"  Farmers place fresh value on Gippsland saltmarshes to earn blue carbon credits A change to the way carbon credits are counted for coastal environments means farmers on traditionally ""unusable"" properties are now considering large-scale restoration projects. In January, the federal government released its first method for calculating the amount carbon that could be sequestered when tidal zones were returned to their natural state. For Hollands Landing grazier Anthony Simpson, that changed the value of his paddocks on the Gippsland Lakes which have increasingly become saturated by tidal saltwater after a flood in 2007. ""This salt-marsh wetland is about 200 hectares of pretty much unusable farmland,"" Mr Simpson said. A team of researchers from Deakin University's Blue Carbon Lab visited his Gippsland property last week to take baseline measurements of the carbon stored in the marshes on his property. The blue carbon calculator allowed landholders to claim carbon credits on the additional carbon stored as a result of restoration projects, rather than carbon already stored. ""There's never going to be a huge grazing profit from this sort of area,"" Mr Simpson said. ""So to rehabilitate it and get paid carbon credits would be a win for the environment and a win for everyone. It's like witchcraft."" To encourage uptake of blue carbon, the commonwealth planned to fund the restoration costs of four pilot projects, with locations yet to be announced. Researchers have said the benefits of blue carbon went beyond making use of traditionally unproductive agricultural land. The Blue Carbon Lab's Dr Melissa Wartman said per square metre coastal wetlands, like those on Mr Simpson's property, were capable of storing far more carbon than forests over a long period of time. ""Coastal wetlands are able to store up to 40 times more carbon than trees, what we call green carbon,"" Dr Wartman said. That was because saltwater ecosystems were hostile to the microorganisms that consumed aquatic plants, releasing carbon back into the atmosphere. ""It's also harder to set them on fire,"" she said. Dr Wartman wrote her PhD dissertation on the Gippsland Lakes' complex ecosystem, forever altered by the artificial opening at Lakes Entrance. The owners of marginal farming land in coastal areas are being urged to refill swamps, but sceptics question whether its carbon abatement properties would have happened anyway. ""Gippsland is one of the few regions where you actually see an increase in saltmarsh,"" she said. The Blue Carbon Lab held a workshop with local landholders to explain blue carbon's potential to shape the landscape. ""They're trying to figure out what they can do to stop it [encroachment of saltmarsh], but our role here is to say 'it's not actually the worst thing,'"" Dr Wartman said. A group of 10 young Gunaikurnai people joined the researchers on Mr Simpson's property to throw boomerangs, capture bugs and take carbon samples from the soil. Leader of the Culture Connect group Aunty Sandra Nielson said the Gippsland Lakes were a hive of activity before colonisation. ""They would've been walking this land, living off this land, some of the insects and plants we're finding today would've been staples in their diets,"" Ms Nielson said. Her joint project focussed on restoration and education about cultural heritage. ""It's also a way forward for our own children to learn about it, to keep looking after it. We used to have all the elders around teaching us how to look after the land, a lot of them are gone now,"" she said. Gunaikurnai teenager Jason Mullett said he appreciated the chance to get his hands dirty while also combatting climate change. ""I reckon our culture will get better and stronger together if we do these nice activities in the community,"" he said.

82,"Oil prices surge to seven-year highs amid Russia-Ukraine tensions, ASX slips",markets,"  ASX 200 slips despite rallies on Wall St, oil prices surge to seven-year highs amid Russia-Ukraine tensions Australian shares have closed lower, with investors looking forward to the Reserve Bank of Australia's monetary policy meeting on Tuesday. The ASX 200 was down 0.2 per cent, to 6,972 points. It was driven lower by mining and financial heavyweights, although strong performances among technology stocks helped limit losses. The benchmark closed 2.2 per cent higher on Friday after a four-day losing streak. Despite the overall decline, seven of 11 sectors ended higher today. Information technology was the best performing sector, gaining 3.7 per cent and rebounding from its recent decline. Ansell was leading the losses, down 14.3 per cent, to $26.76, after downgrading its full-year guidance. Nib Holdings (-6pc), PointsBet (-4.1pc) and Blackmores (-4pc) were also among the worst performers. However, Block gained 8.1 per cent to $161.41, while ARB Corp and Zip advanced 7.9 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively. The Australian dollar was up, at 70.15 US cents, by 4:26pm AEDT. All three major US stock indexes closed higher on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.65 per cent and the S&P 500 gained 2.43 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite added 3.13 per cent. However, the pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.99 per cent on the day for a fourth week of losses, weighed down by worries over tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Economic data helped eased inflation fears, with US data showing consumer spending and labour cost rises were weaker than expected in December. ""The widely watched employment cost index came in a touch softer than expected, suggesting wages may start to cool some from here,"" Stephanie Roth, a senior markets economist at JP Morgan Private Bank, said. Mounting inflation pressures could force the Fed to rapidly hike interest rates, stifling growth, economists have warned. ""Hot wage growth has been a key factor behind the Fed's pivot, so if this trend continues that would relieve some pressure,"" Ms Roth said. MSCI's 50-country main world index rose 1.49 per cent, but remained on the brink of its worst January since the 2008 global financial crisis after shedding roughly $US7 trillion ($9.98 million) in value. Meanwhile, oil prices reached seven-year highs after the inflation data was released and as geopolitical tensions continued to raise concerns the Ukraine crisis could disrupt energy markets. US President Joe Biden and his EU counterpart, Ursula von der Leyen, pledged to cooperate on guaranteeing the energy security of Europe and Ukraine amid the stand-off triggered by Russia deploying troops to Ukraine's border. Brent crude oil price added 69 US cents, or 0.8 per cent, to $US90.03 a barrel. The US Nymex Crude price added 21 US cents, or 0.2 per cent, to $US86.82 a barrel. Investors cautiously start to buy US crude when prices fall on supply disruption concerns due to rising geopolitical tensions, Tatsufumi Okoshi, senior economist at Nomura Securities, said. ""The market expects supply will stay tight as OPEC+ is seen to keep the existing policy of gradual increase in production,"" he said. Meanwhile, the market is focusing on a February 2 meeting of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies, led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+. It is likely to stick with a planned rise in its oil output target for March, several sources in the group told Reuters.

83,"analysis: If you thought supply shortages and financial volatility were bad with COVID, a Ukraine war could take them to a new level",markets,"  As Russia and Ukraine teeter on the edge of conflict, financial markets and economists are far more preoccupied with when and how much the US Federal Reserve will lift interest rates. However, some leading global market analysts are warning that the risks of war, and even the costs of an uneasy peace, are being underpriced. Chief among them is Rabobank's global strategist Michael Every. ""We are in the unusual position of global headlines and politicians warning of the risk of a major war, and yet markets — until very recently — remain mostly unconcerned,"" he wrote this week. ""Where they are falling, it is out of fear of rates going up, not bombs going off."" Beyond share and other financial markets, the crisis is already pushing up the price of oil and gas, as well as key metals used for everything from car making and electronics to kitchenware and construction. But rather than solely focusing on the short-term implications of a Russia-Ukraine conflict on commodity supplies and prices, Mr Every has taken a deep dive into the longer-term ramifications under different scenarios. ""The Ukraine crisis represents a tipping point in a larger metacrisis: the fracturing of the post-1945, -71, -78, and -91 world order,"" he warned. ""This obviously has huge market implications!"" So, what exactly are they? In the short term, it is widely acknowledged that a Russia-Ukraine war, even a limited one, would spark a further massive rise in oil and gas prices, especially in Europe. Russia supplies about 30 per cent of Europe's oil and 35 per cent of its natural gas, which would be cut off in the event of conflict. Rabobank's energy analysts believe that could push oil prices up from already-elevated levels of about $US90 a barrel to $US125, with gas prices following higher. RBC's head of global commodity strategy, Helima Croft, also believes prices will head higher in the event of Russian supplies being disrupted, despite the US government's best efforts to source alternatives. ""While there is scope for LNG imports [mainly from Qatar] to help mitigate the impact of a Russian disruption to European consumers, available capacity is not all well connected to those that would experience disruption,"" she explained in a note. ""However, in the event of an actual Russian invasion and a concurrent spike in oil prices, we do see a path to Saudi Arabia stepping back into its central banker seat and using its spare capacity to help safeguard the global economic recovery."" Australia offers to provide liquefied natural gas to ""friends and allies"" in Europe, should Moscow decide to cut off energy supplies in light of Ukraine tensions. However, if it takes heavy sanctions against Russia to avoid conflict, Rabobank warns the price impact may be even more severe. ""Assuming all countries halt purchases of Russian energy, the potential price impact would be huge, with oil rising to $US175 and European gas to $US250,"" the report forecast. However, it noted it was unlikely that all countries would comply, with China likely to support Russia through big purchases, and even the EU unlikely to give up Russian energy entirely. That could mean higher prices in countries applying the sanctions and lower prices for those still willing to buy Russian oil and gas. Other key commodities would also be hit by either war or sanctions, with Russia the world's biggest wheat grower and Ukraine in around the top five. Large production of barley, corn, sunflower and rapeseed might also be affected. With the Russian military at the Ukrainian border, harvest in ""Europe's bread basket"" is under threat, which may leave Australian farmers to fill the gap in the world's grain supply. While other countries, including Australia, might be able to compensate for some of the loss in supply, they might be facing a handicap: fertiliser. Rabobank estimates 23 per cent of ammonia, 17 per cent of potash, 14 per cent of urea and 10 per cent of phosphates are shipped from Russia. At a time when China has already reserved much of its output of urea and phosphates for domestic use, losing the Russian products would lead to further shortages and rising prices for key fertiliser ingredients. Manufacturing supply chains also wouldn't be immune from either a conflict or sanctions against Russia. Russia's share of global nickel exports is estimated to be about 49 per cent, palladium 42 per cent, aluminium 26 per cent, platinum 13 per cent, steel 7 per cent and copper 4 per cent. ""Removing half of global nickel exports for kitchenware, mobile phones, medical equipment, transport, buildings, and power; palladium for catalytic converters, electrodes, and electronics; and a quarter of aluminium for vehicles, construction, machinery and packaging would result in huge upside pressure on prices,"" Rabobank warned. In some sense, a hostile peace with long-lasting sanctions could be a more threatening prospect for the supply and cost of these commodities than the disruption from a short, sharp war. Of course, both war and sanctions could also occur. Rabobank predicts that either war or heavy sanctions could see a flight to safety on financial markets, pushing bond prices up and interest rates lower. This might be a compelling counterweight to the current trend towards rising interest rates across many advanced economies. Any good narrative has an ending, and we may be seeing the beginning of the end of one of the greatest financial stories ever told, with Tuesday's $63 billion sell-off on the ASX the latest chapter in the saga. However, the picture would be complicated by even higher inflation driven by the potential commodity shortages outlined above. Just how much central banks are willing to look through inflation caused by foreign sources outside of their control is yet to be truly tested in the current period as the Fed prepares to raise US interest rates in March. Ironically, an extension to the period of low-interest rates might help arrest the recent market sell-off, although the offset of either a hot or cold conflict involving Russia, the EU, the US and potentially even China, and the global supply disruptions inherent in that, might far outweigh the benefit of lower rates for longer. On the currency front, Rabobank expects that the US dollar, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and gold would be the obvious go-tos in the event of a conflict. Russia's rouble would slump in the event of either war or sanctions, and the euro would also likely be out of favour. This still seems to be what markets are generally pricing in, and it is what occurred in April 2021. But even in this ""most benign scenario"", Mr Every still forecasts longer-term consequences. ""A Russian retreat under combined Western military and economic deterrence, would/should still have major policy implications given this was a very 'near-miss',"" he said. He predicted that the current Ukraine crisis would accelerate some of the global trends already underway, many of which had been sparked by the COVID crisis and China's increasingly aggressive foreign and trade policy: Mr Every argued that it was hard to see how the US could impose crippling sanctions on Russia without also crippling large parts of the global economy and financial system. Instead, he predicted the world would see an increasing trend towards close, mutually beneficial alliances with the most powerful nations, as evidenced, he noted, by the recent AUKUS and Quad pacts. Today brings a big moment for the diplomatic group, which includes the leaders of Australia, the US, Japan and India, as they sit down for their first in-person meeting to coordinate their actions across a range of areas, from counter terrorism to COVID vaccine distribution. ""As such, we would see an acceleration towards a different, more closed or more 'Great Power' form of globalisation,"" he wrote. ""While the US, with allies, may still be well placed to retain power and influence under such a paradigm, others will struggle. ""A more zero-sum global environment would represent a major challenge for many economies, especially EM (emerging market) net exporters, China, and the EU.""

85,analysis: 'The bottom isn't in yet' as ASX falls sharply into a correction,markets,"  The ASX is officially in a 'correction'. The key question now is when will the share market bottom? Stocks, collectively, trading on the Australian Securities Exchange, have entered a technical ""correction"". A correction is a drop in stock prices of 10 per cent or more from their peak. By the close on Thursday, Australia's benchmark ASX 200 index was down 10.3 per cent from its record high set in mid-August. The trillion-dollar question is, when will the heavy selling stop? Despite tens of billions of dollars having already been wiped off the local market, and trillions more globally, professional investor and author Danielle Ecuyer says there are likely further losses in store for those who remain invested in shares. ""Stock markets are increasingly gripped by a fear that four decades of successively lower interest rates is about to end, combined with geo-political risk,"" she explains. ""Then fear and selling begets more fear and selling. ""This will present another significant buying opportunity, but all technicals (charts of share price movement) suggest the bottom isn't in yet."" Low inflation can be a dream for investors. It affords central banks the ability to keep their monetary policies loose (interest rates low). The one word that kept interest rates at rock bottom during 2021 has already disappeared in 2022, and that's not great news if you have a big mortgage debt, writes Michael Janda. Low interest rates give businesses the opportunity to invest but, crucially, money generally also moves away from assets that benefit from higher interest rates (bonds, cash) and into stocks. Stock gains are heightened as more gains are made (the boom feeds on itself) and as investors hungry for bigger gains borrow money (at low rates) to invest. This accelerates share gains. When inflation begins to rise, this process reverses because central banks respond to rising inflation by raising interest rates. I'll admit, I fully accepted the Reserve Bank's theory that workers' wages, more broadly, needed to rise by quite a lot before it would need to consider lifting its cash rate target. But here's why there's no guarantee of that. What if inflation continues to rise without the contribution of higher wages growth? Some leading analysts are warning about stagflation, but what is it anyway? Fund manager Hamish Tadgell from SG Hiscock and Company addresses this question. ""The most recent Omicron wave further clouds the growth outlook,"" he warns. ""While less virulent, it is far more infectious and has seen a spike in case numbers. ""This has tempered consumer behaviour and amplified labour shortages and disruptions as workers testing positive or close contacts have been forced to isolate. ""It has also exacerbated supply chain issues and inflationary pressures."" In other words, if the pandemic continues to cause a shortage in the things we buy, inflation will remain elevated even if wages and the broader economy are stagnating. In times like these, where stock markets are coming off record highs and broader community anxiety related to the pandemic is elevated, stock markets can easily experience wild swings. We have seen that repeatedly this week on Wall Street, on Asian markets, and locally here in Australia. Any good narrative has an ending, and we may be seeing the beginning of the end of one of the greatest financial stories ever told, with Tuesday's $63 billion sell-off on the ASX the latest chapter in the saga. Some of the anxiety though has a focus: when the United States Federal Reserve will call time on the greatest economic stimulus program ever undertaken. Overnight, the Federal Reserve chairman's statement about its latest meeting noted: ""With inflation well above 2 per cent and a strong labour market, the committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. ""The committee decided to continue to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases, bringing them to an end in early March."" In short, the provision of easy and cheap money is coming to an end very soon and global investors are quite fearful of what that truly means for stock valuations. As mentioned in a previous column, companies designed specifically as vehicles to raise funds (SPACs) to buy other companies have seen record money inflows. But the process of raising money directly via the stock exchange has also been at fever pitch for well over a year. ""2021 was an exceptionally strong year for initial public offerings with the market recording the highest number of new floats in a decade, and more than the previous two years combined,"" according to the latest HLB Mann Judd IPO Watch Australia Report. ""In total, these IPOs raised $12.33 billion, a significant increase on 2020 ($4.98 billion)."" This gives you some idea of the kind of money on the line should the tables turn in favour of those who want to get out of the share market. Even before the bulk of the latest downturn since Christmas, the share price performance of these IPOs was mixed. While the average return on a 2021 IPO by the end of the year was a gain of 17 per cent, the report's author Marcus Ohm said slightly more newly listed companies posted large losses than recorded huge gains. ""These averages hide a number of individual outliers, with 50 companies recording a year-end gain of 20 per cent or more, and 57 a year-end loss of 20 per cent or more."" At the moment, even more so than usual, the share market comes with plenty of risks, not just potential rewards.

86,"ASX takes $60 billion hit as as inflation surges, Omicron hits business confidence ",markets,"  ASX takes $60 billion hit as as inflation surges, Omicron hits business confidence The Australian share market has plunged to a new eight-month low in the wake of inflation jumping more than forecast over the last few months of 2021, raising the prospect of sooner-than-expected interest rate rises. The All Ordinaries fell 2.6 per cent to 7,248, while the ASX 200 index lost 2.5 per cent to 6,962 The market opened lower, despite a late rally on Wall Street following a night of wild swings that saw the Nasdaq fall nearly 5 per cent at one point. The losses on the ASX deepened after new figures showed consumer prices jumped 1.3 per cent over the December quarter. At its low point, the local market fell 3 per cent as US futures fell, indicating there would be a drop on Wall Street overnight as the Federal Reserve commenced a two-day meeting. By the close, the All Ordinaries ended down 2.6 per cent to 7,248, wiping about $63 billion off its market value. So far it has lost $176 billion for the month in a rocky start to 2022. The ASX 200 index lost 2.5 per cent to 6,962, falling below the key 7,000-point level for the first time since May 2021. Just nine stocks rose on the ASX 200. All sectors were in the red, with oil stocks, technology firms, financial stocks, real estate firms and miners the worst hit. The inflation figures will put pressure on the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates this year and to speed up the pull back of coronavirus stimulus. The Commonwealth Bank is the latest bank to predict that the RBA will raise interest rates in August and end its pandemic-era bond-buying program at its meeting next week. The big banks plummeted, with ANZ losing 3.6 per cent and National Australia Bank down 2.9 per cent. Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing, although it also means higher profits for banks. The biggest losers on the ASX 200 were lithium miner Liontown Resources (-9.9pc), Chalice Mining (-9.8pc) and online bookmaker Pointsbet (-8.3pc). Among the few rising stocks on the ASX 200 were technology firm Codan (+16.9pc) on a profit upgrade, A2 Milk (+7.1pc) and safety application firm Life 360 (+3.1pc). The Australian dollar jumped to 71.74 US cents when the inflation figures came out, but fell back to 71.39 US cents at 4:50pm AEDT. National Australia Bank said its business confidence index saw the third biggest fall on record in December amid the spread of the Omicron COVID-19 variant. It fell by 24.5 points over the month to -12.4 points, its lowest reading in more than 18 months. Confidence fell across the country, with New South Wales and Victoria seeing the biggest declines. Sentiment fell in all industries except mining. ""The December survey showed a large hit to confidence from the Omicron outbreak, with considerable falls right across the board,"" said NAB chief economist Alan Oster. ""The confidence index fell below the level recorded at the beginning of the Delta outbreak, showing how concerned businesses are about the current virus wave."" Business conditions also weakened, but remained positive. Employment dropped as firms faced growing worker shortages, but profitability rose. Price pressures also weighed on companies, with employers reporting price growth for wages and supplies near record levels. The survey of almost 400 firms was carried out over the first two weeks of January. Zip is in discussions with fellow buy now, pay later company Sezzle over a ""potential acquisition."" Zip said the talks with Sezzle were preliminary in nature and there was no certainty that a deal would occur. ""The Zip board remains committed to ensuring any transaction delivers value to shareholders and will always be disciplined in its assessment of potential opportunities."" Sezzle also confirmed it was in talks with Zip. It said no definitive agreement had been reached in relation to any transaction. Zip shares lost their gains and closed down 2.1 per cent to $3.21. Sezzle shares rose by more than one fifth at their height. They closed up 9.8 per cent to $2.35. Zip has been expanding amid rapid consolidation in the BNPL sector. Payment giant Block bought Afterpay for nearly $40 billion, in one of Australia's biggest takeovers. Retailer Myer said the Omicron coronavirus variant had affected trading since Christmas. But sales for the five months to January 1 rose 12.3 per cent compared to the same time last year. Online sales rose by more than half. Myer shares rose 6.8 per cent to $0.40. Rio Tinto said it had reached an agreement with the Mongolian government and Canadian miner Turquoise Hill Resources over the beginning of underground mining at the Oyu Tolgoi gold and copper mine in Mongolia. The move ends a long-running dispute between the government and Rio over the nearly $US7 billion ($9.7 billion) expansion project. The mine is partly owned by the Mongolian government and Turquoise Hill, which is controlled by Rio Tinto. Rio said the Mongolian parliament had approved a resolution that resolved outstanding issues between Rio and the government. As part of the deal, Turquoise Hill will waive $US2.4 billion ($3.4 billion) in debt owed to it by the Mongolian government. Last week, Serbia rejected Rio's planned lithium mine in the country amid anger over Australia's deportation of Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic. Rio Tinto shares lost 0.8 per cent. Fortescue Metals said shipments of iron ore rose 2 per cent over the December quarter, but it said worker shortages and the squeeze in global supply chains were weighing on its operations. FMG shares fell 5 per cent. Rivals BHP and Rio Tinto have also warned of COVID-19 related disruption amid a surge in Omicron cases. US stocks ended higher after an earlier steep sell-off as investors faced higher US interest rates, growing geopolitical tension and persistent headwinds from the pandemic. The major US stock indexes bounced back in the last hour of trade, after a night of wild swings, as bargain hunting investors moved in. During the session, the S&P 500 neared a correction, a 10 per cent drop from its record closing high on January 3. Last week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq suffered their largest weekly percentage plunges since March 2020, when shutdowns to contain the pandemic led to a US recession. However, after a night of big falls, the Dow Jones index rebounded late to close 0.3 per cent higher at 34,365, the S&P 500 also put on 0.3 per cent to 4,410, and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.6 per cent to 13,855. At one point during the session, the Dow Jones index fell 1,000 points, while the Nasdaq lost nearly 5 per cent of its value. The ASX SPI 200 index was down 2 per cent to 6,909 at 7:30am AEDT, indicating a steep fall on the local share market. By 8:50am AEDT, it had pared its losses to indicate a 1.3 per cent fall, indicating that the local session may not be so bad. The Australian dollar fell 0.6 per cent to 71.38 US cents. Tim Ghriskey from Ingalls & Snyder in New York said fear was driving the market sell-off. ""From the financial market's standpoint, 2022 is a disaster so far,"" he said. ""It's a continuation of the same issues — uncertainty about the Fed, and the issue with Ukraine."" The US Federal Reserve begins its two day meeting tonight and investors will look for clues on the central bank's timeline for raising key interest rates to combat inflation. In a sign that geopolitical tensions are heating up, NATO announced it was putting forces on stand-by to prepare for a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine. The threat of potential conflict in that region saw Treasury yields dip, pausing their recent upward climb, which has pressured stocks in recent months. Meanwhile, a report from IHS Markit indicated that surging infections of the Omicron COVID variant have hurt business activity in the United States. US authorities announced they were suing Alphabet, accusing it of deceptive location practices by its Google search engine. The company's shares fell more than 2 per cent. Electric car maker Tesla fell more than 5 per cent. Kohl's Corp surged by one third after Reuters reported private equity firm Sycamore Partners was preparing to make a bid for the department store chain days after a consortium backed by activist investment firm Starboard Value proposed a buyout. Bitcoin fell to its lowest level in six months overnight as the cryptocurrency continued to get caught up in the market sell-off. It fell below $US33,000 to $32,975.76, according to Refinitiv, its lowest point since July. At 9am AEDT, it had bounced back 4.2 per cent to $US36,861. Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said the cryptocurrency could fall further. ""Bitcoin believers are trying to hold the line. ""This is a key moment for Bitcoin and, if panic selling returns on Wall Street, the $30,000 level might not prove very supportive."" In London, the FTSE 100 index slumped 2.6 per cent to 7,297, the DAX in Germany lost 3.8 per cent to 15,011, and the CAC 40 in Paris fell 4 per cent to 6,788. Oil prices declined on the rising political tensions. Brent crude fell 1.5 per cent to $US86.56 a barrel. Spot gold rose 0.3 per cent to $US1,838.58 an ounce.

87,"With 'Europe's bread basket' in the firing line, Australian farmers may need to step up",markets," ABC Rural With the Russian military at the Ukrainian border, harvest in ""Europe's bread basket"" is under threat and Australian farmers could be left to fill the gap in the world's grain supply. Ukraine is among the world's most fertile farming countries and last year exported a record 84 million tonnes of grain. It is forecast to supply 12 per cent of the world's wheat and 16 per cent of its corn this year, but with harvest still months away, a large chunk of Ukraine's fertile black farmland lies in the firing line of a brewing conflict. ""There's speculation that the Russians are interested in territory east of the Dnieper River which is [forecast to harvest] over 12 million tonnes of wheat — around 47 per cent of Ukraine's production,"" Mecardo senior agricultural analyst Adrian Ladaniwskyj said. ""Military occupation of the Black Sea ports could see a significant amount of grain blocked out of the international markets, including Russia and Kazakhstan."" Ukrainian farmers are caught between 100,000 Russian troops to the East and NATO to the West. Much of Ukraine's harvest goes to South-East Asia, predominantly Indonesia, Malaysia and Bangladesh. ""That's a region where people wake up in the morning worrying where their food is going to come from,"" Victorian farmer and chair of industry body Grain Growers Limited Brett Hosking said. He believes that after a record national harvest Australia is well positioned to deliver grain to those countries. ""That's the role of Australia, I think — making sure the world remains fed,"" Mr Hosking said. In 2014, Russia invaded and annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. The conflict put that year's harvest in jeopardy and global wheat prices spiked 20 per cent. ""In terms of global [wheat] exports, Ukraine is close to double what it was back then,"" Mr Ladaniwskyj said. ""The price kick-up that could result from conflict now could be a lot more significant than what it was in 2014."" But if the military stand-off does not escalate before the end of the European winter, the threat of large-scale conflict should subside. ""Currently they have frozen ground, which allows military machines to move over the fertile Ukrainian plains,"" Mr Ladaniwskyj said. ""But as soon as the thaw occurs, the fertility of Ukraine will actually work against any conflict — anything heavy will sink in the field."" The Ukrainian wheat harvest takes place in the summer between June and July and its corn harvest in autumn between October and September. ""If anything is going to occur, it will occur in the next few months,"" Mr Ladaniwskyj said. For his own and other Australian farmers' sake, Mr Hosking wants grain prices to rise. He can see the writing on the wall — conflict in Eastern Europe would likely mean a significant windfall for Australian farmers. ""Australia is sitting on a very large volume of grain at the moment,"" Mr Hosking said. It's stretching our ability to export it. ""If conflict occurs, you're effectively putting the world's biggest wheat exporters at war with each other and, without a doubt, some of [the price premium] will flow back to Australian growers."" The situation puts Mr Hosking's financial interest in favour of a conflict which could threaten millions of Ukrainians' lives. But he maintained it was the nature of global farming that one country's misfortune would benefit others. ""Those periods of drought in Australia, there were a lot of other countries taking advantages of premiums Australia couldn't fill,"" Mr Hosking said. ""But we do feel the pain of fellow farmers. ""I'd love to think there's opportunities for them here in Australia if they need to find somewhere else."" Despite the positive implications for grain prices if conflict escalates, Mr Hosking says the instability that could follow might easily backfire. ""Markets thrive on certainty,"" he said. ""They don't like it when things are uncertain, and long term the best outcome would be a peaceful outcome.""

88,ASX dips after global markets slump; Fortescue acquires Williams Advanced Engineering,markets,"  ASX dips after global markets slump; Fortescue acquires Williams Advanced Engineering Australian shares have fallen in a cross-sector sell-off, dented most by miners and technology stocks, as investors kept a cautious stance following a lower finish on Wall Street, amid fears of inflation and policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve. The ASX 200 closed down 0.5 per cent at 7,140, hitting its lowest level since last May. The broader All Ordinaries index fell further, losing 0.7 per cent to 7,442 by the close. Eight of 11 sectors were lower, with technology, materials and energy stocks shedding 1.7 per cent, 1.4 per cent and 0.6 per cent, respectively. Regis Resources (-14.3pc), Life360 (-8.9pc) and Novonix (-6.7pc) were among the biggest losers. Meanwhile, shares of homewares retailer Adairs took a dive, dropping 21.5 per cent to $2.99. The company estimated that COVID-related store closures reduced its sales by $30-36 million and its earnings before interest and taxes by $14-18 million in the first half of the year. ""During the half, despite significant operational disruptions, we have made strides in progressing our strategic priorities by commissioning our new National Distribution Centre, upsizing selected stores, continuing to expand our range and adding to our omni-channel capabilities,"" CEO Mark Ronan said in a statement. There were not many significant gains in the afternoon. Uniti Group (+9.3pc), REA Group (+2.9pc) and Domino's Pizza (+2.5pc) were among the top upwards movers. Australian real estate investment trusts were the best performers, with the sector gaining 1.8 per cent and rebounding from its recent decline. Fortescue Metals Group closed down 2 per cent at $20.52, echoing falls by most other commodity producers on the market. The Western Australian iron ore giant today announced that it would acquire UK-based Williams Advanced Engineering (WAE) from private equity firm EMK Capital and Williams Grand Prix Engineering for $310 million. Fortescue has been working with WAE since last year to develop a battery system that could power its mining haul trucks as part of its ambition to slash carbon emissions. It also said the two companies are working on a battery electric train concept. Aside from reducing emissions from its mines, the miner said WAE was ""an important new business growth opportunity"" that will be rolled under its Fortescue Future Industries green technologies umbrella. The Australian dollar was down at 71.74 US cents, by 4:17pm AEDT. Oil prices slid last week, pressured by an unexpected rise in US crude and fuel inventories, while investors took profits after global oil benchmarks touched seven-year highs. Brent crude oil was up, trading at $US88.66 a barrel, by 4:18pm AEDT. Risk aversion dominated global markets on Friday as stocks slumped on Wall Street and in Europe. Oil prices fell from seven-year highs earlier in the week and bond prices surged with traders scurrying for the relative safety of government debt. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.3 per cent, the S&P 500 fell 1.9 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.7 per cent. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posted their biggest weekly declines since the market crashed in March 2020. In Europe, the German, French and Italian indices fell almost 2 per cent, with the broad Euro STOXX index of 600 leading regional companies closing down 1.8 per cent. MSCI's all-country world index fell 1.7 per cent. With the Fed poised to hike interest rates as many as four times this year, fear of a hard economic landing has risen among investors. But a slowing economy in the months ahead will probably give the Fed second thoughts, said Steven Ricchiuto, US chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA LLC. ""By the time we get to the second rate hike, everything will be rolling over enough that everybody will back off from these calls,"" he said. ""The growth numbers will be slowing much more quickly than the Fed anticipated."" US Treasury and eurozone government bond yields fell as concerns about a potential conflict between Russia and Ukraine also dented risk appetite and stock market falls increased demand for safer assets. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell 7.2 basis points to 1.762 per cent, a sharp drop from a two-year high of 1.902 per cent touched on Wednesday. Meanwhile, markets overnight in Asia were broadly lower, including in China where benchmark mortgage rates were cut on Thursday in the latest move to prop up an economy soured by its property sector.

89,Wall Street posts worst weeks since pandemic started as Netflix's woes deepen slide,markets,"  S&P 500 and Nasdaq post worst weeks since pandemic started as Netflix's woes deepen the slide Wall Street's main indexes ended sharply lower on Friday, as Netflix shares plunged after a weak earnings report. It capped a brutal week for stocks that saw the S&P 500 and Nasdaq log their biggest weekly percentage drops since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. The benchmark S&P 500 posted its third straight week of declines, ending 8.3 per cent down from its early January record high. Losses also deepened for the Nasdaq after the tech-heavy index earlier in the week confirmed it was in a correction, closing down over 10 per cent from its November peak. The Nasdaq has now fallen 14.3 per cent from its November peak and on Friday closed at its lowest level since June. Prominent investor Jeremy Grantham warns US stock markets are in a ""super bubble"" that is set to crash, as major share indices fall again. Netflix shares tumbled 21.8 per cent, weighing on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, after the streaming giant forecast weak subscriber growth. Shares of competitor Walt Disney fell 6.9 per cent, dragging on the Dow. Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management, said the latest numbers were a continuation of a tech rout. ""It's really a combination of a rotation out of technology as well as very poor numbers from Netflix that I think is the catalyst for today,"" Mr Nolte said. For the week, the S&P 500 fell 5.7 per cent, the Dow dropped 4.6 per cent and the Nasdaq declined 7.6 per cent. The Dow fell for a sixth straight session, its longest streak of daily declines since February 2020. The S&P 500 closed below its 200-day moving average, a key technical level, for the first time since June 2020. Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, said: ""When markets get like they've gotten this week, the emotion is what takes over."" ""Until it finds support, no one's going to care about anything fundamental."" Stocks are off to a rough start in 2022, as a fast rise in Treasury yields amid concerns the Federal Reserve will become aggressive in controlling inflation has particularly hit tech and growth shares. Investors are keenly focused on next week's Fed meeting for more clarity on the central bank's plans to tighten monetary policy in the coming months, after data last week showed US consumer prices in December had the largest annual rise in nearly four decades. Apple, Tesla and Microsoft are among the large companies due to report next week in a busy week of earnings results.

90,'We face the largest potential markdown of perceived wealth in US history': Leading investor warns of crash as stock markets dive,markets,"  GMO's Jeremy Grantham warns 'super bubble' is bursting as Wall St, ASX fall again A prominent investor says US share markets, along with most other assets, are in a ""super bubble"" that in the process of bursting into a crash. It has been a rocky start to the year for the US share market, and Jeremy Grantham said the collapse in stocks he predicted a year ago is underway and major US indexes could fall by half. The British born co-founder of Boston-based investment firm GMO said US stocks are in a ""super bubble"", the fourth of the past century. ""This checklist for a super bubble running through its phases is now complete and the wild rumpus can begin at anytime,"" Mr Grantham wrote in a note to investors. ""When pessimism returns to markets, we face the largest potential markdown of perceived wealth in US history."" He said the US was seeing simultaneous bubbles for the first time across all major asset classes of real estate, stocks, commodities and bond markets. ""We have the most exuberant, ecstatic, even crazy investor behaviour in the history of the US stock market."" Mr Grantham sees the S&P 500 index dropping by half, to a level of around 2,500, and warned there could a even bigger fall on the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq has already entered correction territory, and is now down 12 per cent from its November record high. He noted that many people would not want to hear his ""old fogey"" advice, just as he ignored bubble warnings from more experienced investors early in his career. ""I doubt speculators in the current bubble will listen to me now, but giving this advice is my job and possibly the right thing to do,"" he said. ""So once more unto the breach, dear friends."" Mr Grantham said many speculative stocks started falling nearly a year ago, including the Ark Innovation exchange traded fund in the US, which has already lost 52 per cent of its value. The Australian share market slumped after another fall on Wall Street as investors worry about pending rises in interest rates by the US central bank. In the last hour of trade, the market fell nearly 3 per cent. By the close, the All Ordinaries index lost 2.3 per cent to 7,490, while the ASX 200 index also fell 2.3 per cent to 7,176. All sectors were sold off with miners and energy stocks leading the declines. It is the second biggest percentage fall this year. The index fell 2.7 per cent on January 6th after the US central bank indicated it may raise official rates sooner than expected. Leading the losses on the ASX 200 index were uranium miner Paladin Energy (-11pc), buy now, pay later firm Zip (-7.8pc) and rare earths miner Lynas (-7.5pc). Whitehaven Coal (-6.1pc) took a hit after it cut its coal production forecast after operations were affected by COVID-19. The top performers on the ASX 200 index were gold miners Regis Resources (+6.1pc) and Ramelius Resources (+2.9pc), and building materials maker Boral (+2.1pc). Software firm Nuix slumped by nearly 23 per cent as it said it expected earnings to fall and legal costs to rise. The company is being investigated by regulators. ANZ (-1.6pc) did the worst of the big four banks. Qantas said it would cut flights to Western Australia because of the WA Government's plans to delay the reopening of its border. It will run up to 15 flights a week from Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Darwin, and Brisbane to Perth. And Fortescue Metals said it was concerned that the lack of clarity on the reopening of WA's borders could worsen labour shortages. The Australian dollar dropped 0.5 per cent to 71.88 US cents at 4:30pm AEDT. Oil prices fell from a seven year high after a surprise gain US crude stockpiles and a rise in petrol supplies. Brent crude fell nearly 2 per cent to $US86.72 a barrel. Spot gold was up 0.1 per cent to $U1841.16 an ounce. Asian markets were also sold off. Big miner BHP got support from shareholders to unify its corporate structure to make Australia its global headquarters and primary share market listing. The world's biggest mining company is listed on both the London and Australian stock exchanges, but will soon exit the UK. More than 97 per cent of investors voted in favour of the plan at a virtual meeting in London, after more than 96 per cent of Australian shareholders supported the proposal. The move means that BHP will delist from the London Stock Exchange, where is is one of the biggest companies on the FTSE 100 index. BHP's dual listing dates back to its merger with South Africa's Billiton in 2001. Some Australian investors have criticised the move. BHP shares lost 4.8 per cent, to $45.70. Rival Rio Tinto lost 4.1 per cent as Serbia revoked its lithium exploration licences after pressure from protesters who oppose the development of the Jadar lithium project. Steaming service Netflix disappointed investors after forecasting weak first quarter subscriber growth. The world's largest streaming service forecast it would add 2.5 million customers from January to March, less than half the number forecast by analysts. Netflix said the late arrival of popular content, including period drama Bridgerton and Ryan Reynolds time travel movie The Adam Project, would likely weigh on subscriptions. It added 8.3 million customers from October to December, when it released new programming including movies Red Notice and Don't Look Up. Netflix shares fell nearly one fifth in after-hours trade. Wall Street ended lower as a rally faded in late trade, a day after the Nasdaq fell into correction territory. In futures trade, the ASX SPI 200 index fell 0.7 per cent to 7,194. The Australian dollar rose 0.2 per cent to 72.24 US cents at 7:40am AEDT. The Nasdaq turned negative in the final hour of trade after rising as much as 2 per cent. Most sectors on the S&P 500 index ended lower. The Dow Jones index fell 0.9 per cent to 34,715, the S&P 500 lost 1.1 per cent to 4,483, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.3 per cent to 14,154. Exercise bike maker Peloton Interactive fell 24 per cent after CNBC reported that it was pausing production of its fitness products because of waning demand. Concerns the US Federal Reserve would be more aggressive in raising interest rates this year than the market has priced in continue to weigh on confidence as investors look to the US central bank's policy meeting next week for fresh guidance. Travel stocks helped boost European markets. In London, the FTSE 100 index fell 0.06 per cent to 7,585, the DAX in Germany rose 0.7 per cent to 15,912 and the CAC 40 in Paris rose 0.3 per cent to 7,194.

91,"ASX rallies in late trade, Nasdaq confirms correction ",markets,"  ASX rallies as resources stocks boosted by China rate cut and higher commodity prices The Australian share market has rallied in late trade following the unemployment rate falling to the lowest in more than a decade and China cut borrowing costs again. At midday, most sectors remained in the red despite the unemployment rate falling to the lowest since August 2008. However, in the last hour of trade, the market rebounded, with miners and energy stocks leading the way. Utilities and health care stocks also ended higher, while among the losing sectors were telecommunications companies, consumer stocks and banks. The All Ordinaries index added nearly 0.2 per cent, to 7,669, while the ASX 200 index rose 0.14 per cent, to 7,342. Miners were the 10 top-performing stocks on the ASX 200. Big miners BHP (+3.1pc) and Rio Tinto (+3.2pc) rose on higher iron ore prices. Iron ore prices were boosted after China once again cut interest rates, with the borrowing costs for one- and five-year prime rate loans falling. China has lowered key policy rates this week to boost its economy. BHP investors will vote tonight on whether or not to unify the miner's corporate structure with Australia as the company's primary share market listing. Gold miner Northern Star Resources (+11.2pc) was the best performer on the ASX 200 after a strong production report and a rise in the price of gold. The worst performer on the ASX 200 index was transport firm Kelsian Group (-5.7pc). Virtus Health jumped 7.6 per cent after it received a $609-million takeover offer from European private equity firm CapVest Partners. Shares in payment giant Block, previously called Square, listed on the ASX after Square took over buy now, pay later firm Afterpay for $39 billion. As oil and gas prices jumped by more than half, Woodside Petroleum saw record quarterly sales revenue. Its sales revenue jumped by 86 per cent, to $US2.85 billion, from the September to December quarters. It also reversed impairments on its Pluto and Scarborough projects and the North-West Shelf. Woodside agreed to merge with BHP's petroleum business in November. On the back of its results, Woodside shares rose 1.5 per cent. Rival Santos also saw record annual production and record sales revenue after it took over Papua New Guinea based Oil Search. Qantas has applied to the Fair Work Commission to terminate an enterprise bargaining agreement with long haul cabin crew, a move criticised by aviation unions. If approved by the commission, unions said the move could see wages cut by 30 to 50 per cent while a new agreement is negotiated. Qantas said it wanted to change ""restrictive and outdated rostering processes"". The move comes after six months of negotiation with the Flight Attendants' Association of Australia over a new enterprise agreement, which was rejected by the union and 97 per cent of crew who voted. Meanwhile, the Transport Workers Union accused Qantas of being a ""dictator"" that was attacking cabin crew ""heroes."" ""These are heroes of the pandemic, who sacrificed their own health to bring stranded Australians home,"" said Flight Attendants' Association general secretary Teri O'Toole. ""They have been on the frontline of the pandemic since the early days, and have faced stand-downs [of] up to 20 months, far longer than any other industry."" Qantas received nearly $900 million in JobKeeper wage subsidy payments during the pandemic and other COVID-19 assistance from the federal government. It said the rejected four-year deal included a pay increase and increased allowances in return for more flexible rostering. Under the current workplace agreement, Qantas International crew are limited to working on Airbus A330s only, or on Airbus A380s and Boeing 787s. Qantas said the changes it seeks would see all crew trained to work across all three aircraft. ""We're seeking termination because we can't effectively run our business without the rostering changes we desperately need to properly restart our international network in a post COVID world,"" said Andrew David, chief executive of Qantas International. Qantas shares fell 1 per cent to $5.04. Sydney Airport said the rapid spread of the Omicron COVID-19 variant had seen the number of passengers fall in December by 70 per cent from the same time in 2019. It said that, for the first 15 days of January, international passenger numbers fell around 85 per cent and domestic passengers fell about 58 per cent from the same time in 2019. ""The outlook for passenger traffic continues to remain subdued, due to tightly controlled inbound international travel, entry requirements and restrictions into key overseas markets, and the significant domestic flight cancellations announced for Q1 [first quarter] 2022,"" the company said. Meanwhile, Westpac chief economist Bill Evans is now predicting that the Reserve Bank could raise official interest rates in August this year by 0.15 per cent, from a record low of 0.1 per cent, to 0.25 per cent. The bank is also predicting a second rate rise in October, bringing official rates to 0.5 per cent. Mr Evans had previously forecast that the first official rate rise would be early next year. He noted that RBA governor Dr Philip Lowe has firmly indicated that he does not expect to be raising rates until very late 2023 or 2024. However, the market is now predicting a June 2022 rate rise. The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite index entered correction territory, down 10.7 per cent from its record closing high in November. A correction is confirmed when an index closes 10 per cent or more below its record peak. It is the fourth correction for the Nasdaq since the coronavirus pandemic began. Tech heavyweights Apple, Tesla and Amazon weighed on the index. Technology stocks have relied on cheap borrowing to expand, so the prospect of rising interest rates hurts their growth prospects. Results from Morgan Stanley and Bank of America were well received by investors as were reports from United Health and Procter & Gamble as fourth-quarter earnings season picks up. Bank of America said quarterly profit rose by one third, while Morgan Stanley's fourth-quarter profit was better than expected. Stocks have gotten off to a rocky start in 2022 on concerns that the US Federal Reserve will become aggressive in controlling inflation. ""There's a fair amount of anxiety in terms of how the next three to six months are going to play out with a rate hike cycle set to start likely in March,"" said Michael James from Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 156 points, or 1 per cent, to 35,029, the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent, to 4,533, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.2 per cent, to 14,340. US Treasury yields fell back from two year highs. The 10-year US Government fell 2.3 basis points, to 1.854 per cent. Investors are awaiting next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting for guidance on the central bank's plan to tackle inflation. The Fed has indicated it will raise interest rates several times this year. In Europe, the FTSE 100 index rose 0.4 per cent, to 7,590, the DAX in Germany rose 0.24 per cent, to 15,810, and the CAC 40 in Paris rose 0.6 per cent, to 7,173. Oil prices rose for a fourth day after a fire on a pipeline from Iraq to Turkey briefly stopped production. And the International Energy Agency said global oil demand is on track to hit pre-pandemic levels. Brent crude oil put on 0.7 per cent, to $US88.08 a barrel. Spot gold rose on a lower greenback and a rise in political tensions over Russia and Ukraine. It increased 1.7 per cent, to $US1,842.45 an ounce. Iron ore prices added 2.3 per cent, to $US130.20 a tonne.

92,Markets tumble on expectations of higher interest rates ,markets,"  ASX and US stocks fall as bond yields rise amid expected interest rate hikes The Australian share market fell for the second day in a row to a one-month low, after US stocks slumped as investors brace for higher US interest rates. In Australia, nearly all sectors ended in the red, with the falls led by technology stocks, after a sell-off on Wall Street. Other sectors weighing on the local market were banks, miners, healthcare and telecommunications firms. All the big banks were weaker, with the Commonwealth Bank (-1.5pc) falling the most. Utility firms rose and energy stocks gained as oil prices rose to a seven-year high. Brent crude oil was higher, at $US88.52 a barrel, in afternoon trade, while spot gold fell nearly 0.1 per cent, to $US1812.06 an ounce. The All Ordinaries index fell 1 per cent, to 7,657, while the ASX 200 index dropped by the same percentage, to 7,333. Today's best performers in the ASX 200 index were artificial intelligence firm Appen (+3.9pc), electronics retailer Harvey Norman (+3pc), and retailer Premier Investments (+2.8pc). Going down were data centres operator Megaport (-16.2pc) after it posted the slowest quarterly revenue growth since March, battery materials firm Novonix (-9.7pc), and lithium chemicals firm Allkem (-6.7pc). Big miner BHP said it achieved near-record production of iron ore in Western Australia, despite bad weather and COVID-19 train driver shortages. Iron ore production rose 1 per cent over the six months to the end of December, compared to the same time last year. Output increased 4 per cent over the quarter. Iron ore production was affected by labour shortages because of COVID restrictions. BHP warned that the planned easing of Western Australia's border restrictions could cause some short-term disruption to operations. It also said workforce absenteeism in Queensland at its coking coal operations, arising from COVID-19, was expected to continue. Yesterday, rival Rio Tinto said COVID-19 had also disrupted its operations. Wet weather saw production of thermal coal, used for power, fall by nearly one third from the September quarter to the December quarter. Copper production fell 12 per cent, coking coal production declined 8 per cent, and nickel output dropped 15 per cent over the half year. BHP shares dropped 0.3 per cent, to $46.56, while Rio Tinto rose 0.2 per cent, to $109.91. Investors will vote tomorrow on BHP's plan to unify the company under a single primary listing in Sydney and delist from the London Stock Exchange. Rare earths miner Lynas said revenue from sales jumped to a record over the December quarter, thanks to strong demand for supply, despite challenges related to COVID-19. Rare earths oxide production increased by one third. Amid supply chain delays, the company said the transit time for concentrate shipped from Fremantle Port to Kuantan Port in Malaysia increased from 15 days in March 2021 to 33 days in December last year. ""Shipping delays and disruptions continue around the world and in some cases, are getting worse."" ""Many supply chains are yet to return to normal and we see this continuing for some time,"" the company told the ASX. It said it had chartered a ship to transport concentrate to Malaysia because the additional cost was outweighed by ""the benefit of ensuring continuity of supply to customers."" It has also been using air freight. The company processes rare earths in Australia, but is awaiting environmental approval for a plant in Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. Lynas shares fell 1.1 per cent, to $10.97. Investment firm Dixon Advisory has filed for voluntary administration. The firm is facing class actions by investors, claims against the company filed with the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, and a $7.2 million fine by the corporate regulator for breaches of the Corporations Act. Dixon Advisory was accused of not acting in the best interests of clients by failing to provide appropriate financial advice. Its parent company, E&P Financial Group, told the ASX it had appointed Pricewaterhouse Coopers partners Stephen Longley and Craig Crosbie as voluntary administrators. E&P managing director Peter Anderson said the appointment of an administrator had become necessary because of the increasing number of claims against Dixon and its financial liabilities. ""It has also become apparent that settling individual claims as they arise will likely lead to inequities between client creditors,"" Mr Anderson said. ""Voluntary administration provides an appropriate framework to ensure all client creditors are treated equitably."" E&P said Dixon clients would be transferred to a replacement investment advisor of their choice and a deed of company arrangement would be prepared to settle all claims. Yields on Australian government bonds followed their US counterparts higher on expectations that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its March meeting. The return on the 10-year bond rose to 2.01 per cent for the first time since October last year. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was steady, at 71.87 US cents, at 4:00pm AEDT. Westpac and the Melbourne Institute said consumer sentiment fell 2 per cent in January, to 102.2, amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. It compares to a 7.6 per cent drop in confidence seen last week by ANZ and Roy Morgan. Westpac said it was a surprisingly solid result, given the impact of Omicron and optimists still outnumbered pessimists. The 2 per cent fall compares to a 17.7 per cent collapse in confidence when the pandemic first hit in early 2020. Optimism increased in New South Wales and Victoria, but saw significant falls in Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia. ""Consumers in states impacted by Delta lockdowns appear to have been less unsettled by the rapid spread of Omicron variant than those in states experiencing their first major wave of COVID infections,"" said Westpac chief economist Bill Evans. Economic data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that the total number of home building commencements fell by 16.3 per cent from the June to September quarters. However,  dwelling starts were still up by nearly one third over the year. Wall Street tumbled as interest rates on government bonds surged and investment bank Goldman Sachs reported disappointing earnings. Investors expect the US Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates soon to curb rising global inflation. Data last week showed US consumer inflation at a 40-year high. Technology stocks fell because higher interest rates hurt growth stocks, which rely on cheap borrowing to expand. Goldman Sachs lost as much as 8 per cent after the investment bank missed quarterly profit expectations amid weak trading activity. The Dow Jones index lost 1.5 per cent, to 35,369, the S&P 500 lost 1.8 per cent, to 4,577 and the Nasdaq fell 2.6 per cent, to 14,507. At the same time, the yield on two-year US Government bonds rose above 1 per cent, the first time since February 2020, a month before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond rose to 1.86 per cent, the highest since January 2020. Rising bond yields are a sign of higher borrowing costs. In economic news, the Empire Manufacturing Index, which measures manufacturing in New York state, went backwards for the first time since early 2020 when the pandemic hit. The index fell 33 points in January, to minus 7 points, which indicates that activity slowed as Omicron cases rose. Oil prices climbed to the highest since October 2014 as investors worried about global political tensions that could worsen tight supply. Major producers group OPEC kept to its forecast for strong fuel demand in 2022, despite the spread of the Omicron COVID-19 variant and expected interest rate rises. ""Monetary actions are not expected to hinder underlying global economic growth momentum, but rather serve to recalibrate otherwise overheating economies,"" OPEC said. Supply concerns mounted after Yemen's Houthi group attacked the United Arab Emirates with drone and missile strikes that killed three people. ""The damage to UAE oil facilities in Abu Dhabi is not significant in itself, but raises the question of even more supply disruptions in the region in 2022,"" said Rystad Energy's senior oil markets analyst Louise Dickson. And concerns that Russia will attack neighbouring Ukraine is also increasing tension. OPEC countries are struggling to pump at their allowed quotas under the agreement between OPEC, Russia and allies to add 400,000 barrels per day each month. They are hoping to restore production to pre-pandemic levels by late 2022. In London, the FTSE 100 index fell 0.6 per cent, to 7,564, the DAX in Germany lost 1 per cent, to 15,773, and the CAC 40 in Paris fell 1 per cent, to 7,134.

93,"ASX ends lower, Omicron dents consumer confidence",markets,"  ASX gives up gains, weakest January consumer confidence in 30 years The Australian share market lost its gains in afternoon trade, while consumer confidence has been dented by the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. After a good start, the market reversed course, with healthcare, utilities, industrials, banks and consumer firms weighing on shares. Limiting the losses were miners, real estate stocks, communications firms, technology and oil and gas companies. The All Ordinaries index fell 0.05 per cent, to 7,736, while the ASX 200 index dipped 0.1 per cent, to 7,409. Virgin Money (-3.5pc), bookmaker Pointsbet (-3.5pc), and buy-now-pay-later firm Zip (-2.9pc) fell the most on the ASX 200 index. Battery materials firm Novonix (+6.4pc) biotech Imugene (+7pc) and lithium miner Liontown Resources (+6.3pc) made gains. Online fashion marketplace firm Redbubble fell after a disappointing trading update. Redbubble's shares dropped 22 per cent, to $2.32. It said marketplace revenue fell 18 per cent for the first half of 2022, compared to the same time in 2021. And it expects annual revenue to fall as well. Oil refiner Ampol expects to see the biggest quarterly revenue at its Lytton Refinery in Brisbane in more than four years thanks to higher fuel prices. That means it does not expect to receive any federal government subsidies, which were put in place to keep Australian oil refineries open. Ampol shares rose 2.4 per cent, to $31.27. Rio Tinto said iron ore production dropped last year because of labour shortages in Western Australia due to border closures, cultural heritage management, above-average rainfall, and delays in new projects. Limitations on travel meant the company could not conduct pre-delivery quality assurance and control at international steel and equipment manufacturers. Shipments fell by 3 per cent in 2021, to 321.6 million tonnes. They fell by 5 per cent over the December quarter. The company expects iron ore shipments this year of between 320 and 335 million tonnes. But it warned there could be more disruptions caused by COVID-19, worker shortages, and supply chain delays. ""Our guidance assumes development of the pandemic does not lead to government-imposed restrictions and widespread protracted cases related to new highly contagious variants with high severity, which could result in a significant number of our production-critical workforce and contractor base being unable to work due to illness and/or isolation requirements,"" Rio stated. The big miner said ongoing rehabilitation works at Juukan Gorge were on schedule after Rio destroyed sacred caves at the site in 2020. Rio said the relationship with the traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP), was ""constructive and considered"" and an agreement for the co-management of country and an appropriate remedy for the destruction of the Aboriginal sacred site was ""substantially progressed"". Rio Tinto shares fell 0.4 per cent to $109.65. Electronics retailer JB Hi-Fi said unaudited half-year profit dropped 9.4 per cent to $287.9 million. But it said sales momentum was strong during the first half of the financial year with continued demand for consumer electronics and home appliance products. Online sales rose by nearly two-thirds from the same time last year, but overall sales slipped 1.6 over the quarter. Chief executive Terry Smart said the company's 13,000 workers had done an ""incredible job"" despite the challenges of COVID-19. ""We are pleased to report strong sales and earnings for HY22,"" he said. ""In challenging circumstances, we have again demonstrated our ability to adapt and respond to meet the strong demand from our customers, both in-store and online."" JB Hi-Fi gained nearly 7 per cent, to $49.84. The Australian dollar slipped 0.25 per cent, to around 71.92 US cents, by 4:40pm AEDT. The Omicron COVID-19 variant has hit consumer confidence, according to ANZ and Roy Morgan. Their measure of consumer confidence fell 7.6 per cent last week to 97.9, the lowest level since October 2020, as Omicron surged across Australia and facilities came under immense strain. That was lower than during last year's lockdowns when the Delta variant surged. All the survey's subindices fell including current and future financial conditions. Nearly one in five respondents expected to be worse off by this time next year. ANZ head of Australian Economics, David Plank, said the index level of 97.9 was the weakest January result since 1992, when the Australian economy was experiencing rising unemployment. ""The result highlights the concerns about COVID have the potential to significantly impact the economy if they linger,"" he said. ANZ said spending had continued to fall because of the spread of Omicron, with a drop of 27 per cent over the first half of January, compared to the first half of December. Spending was also lower on eating out. CBA credit and debit card data indicated that spending has dropped sharply on services over the past few weeks. Commonwealth Bank economist Gareth Aird said the large number of COVID-19 cases is hurting the employment market, with an estimated 1 million people in isolation, and reduced spending on goods and services. That means many businesses have been forced to close, or reduce capacity and opening hours. He has slashed his growth forecast for the first quarter of 2022 from 2.3 per cent to just 1 per cent. ""The next few months are without a shred of doubt going to be difficult and testing for the economy,"" Mr Aird said. ""Our working assumption is that more policy support will be forthcoming, particularly stimulus that is targeted towards businesses most adversely impacted by the surge in COVID cases and isolation requirements."" Mr Aird said he expected the economy to snap back in the second quarter of 2022. The Bank of Japan kept official interest rates on hold as expected at -0.10 per cent, but lifted its inflation forecasts. One board member voted for the policy rate to be lowered further to support business. The Japanese central bank maintained its pledge for further stimulus if needed, including lower rates, despite rising global inflation. Negative interest rates encourage lending because customers have to pay a fee to deposit their money. The Bank of Japan raised its inflation forecast to 1.1 per cent for the year starting in April, from its previous forecast of 0.9 per cent that is as energy costs rise. The Nikkei 225 index fell 0.2 per cent, to 28,265. Chinese President Xi Jinping has warned nations not to slam the brakes on economic growth. Mr Xi told a virtual meeting of the Davos World Economic Forum that the world economy was emerging from the depths of the pandemic, but it still faced many constraints. He said global industrial and supply chains have been disrupted and commodity prices continue to rise. Mr Xi also said the risk of inflation was increasing. But with the US central bank flagging several interest rises this year amid surging inflation, Mr Xi warned major economies about withdrawing coronavirus stimulus. ""If major economies slam on the brakes or take a U-turn in their monetary policies, there would be serious negative spill overs,"" he said. ""They would present challenges to global economic and financial stability, and developing countries would bear the brunt."" He said countries should strengthen policy coordination and prevent the world economy from dipping again. Yesterday China's central bank cut interest rates on medium term loans and the 7 day reverse repo rate. Oil prices increased with Brent crude putting on 1 per cent to $US87.34 a barrel. An attack on oil facilities in Abu Dhabi, claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebels, left three dead and six wounded. Authorities believe the attack was carried out by drones. Spot gold eased from its overnight high to $US1817.99 an ounce. European shares gained ground with healthcare stocks lifted by takeover activity. The STOXX 600 index rose 0.7 per cent as healthcare firm GlaxoSmithKline jumped. In London, the FTSE 100 increased 0.9 per cent to 7,611, the DAX in Germany put on 0.1 per cent to 15,934, while the CAC 40 in Paris rose 0.8 per cent to 7,202.

94,ASX rises; Wesfarmers hit by COVID disruptions while China's GDP grows faster than expected,markets,"  ASX rises; Wesfarmers hit by COVID disruptions while China's GDP grows faster than expected Australian shares have edged higher, bolstered by energy stocks and a rise in oil prices, despite global stock markets stumbling. The ASX 200 closed 0.3 per cent higher to 7,417, with the consumer discretionary (+2.4pc) and energy (+1.6pc) sectors leading the way. Nine of 11 sectors were higher, along with the S&P/ASX 200 Index. Pendal Group (+7.8pc), Adbri (+7.2pc) and Magellan (+4.2pc) were among the biggest gainers. However, buy now, pay later outfit Beforepay plunged on its ASX debut, dropping 44.1 per cent, while Perseus Mining (-5.1pc) and Paladin Energy (-4pc) also declined. Energy shares were helped by prices for Brent crude oil reaching their highest level in more than three years. Brent crude oil was trading at $US86.22 a barrel, by 04:31pm AEDT. It has risen 25 per cent since the start of December. ANZ Research analysts said this is backed up by signs in the physical market. ""Physical barrels of oil are changing hands at near-record-high premiums, while the strong outlook is reflected by the market’s bullish backwardated prices structure where near-term futures are higher than longer-dated ones,"" Brian Martin and Daniel Hynes said in a note. ""Strong global demand has helped ease concerns about China, where a zero-COVID strategy has seen increased restrictions put in place. This comes after China reported relatively weak imports of crude oil in December."" The Australian dollar was up at 72.07 US cents by 04:32pm AEDT. Wesfarmers added 2.6 per cent to $55.38 after an announcement on its half-year results. The company said it expected to report net profit after tax of between $1,180 and $1,240 million, in line with current consensus expectations, for the half-year ended December 31, 2021. The group's performance for the half was supported by pleasing results in Bunnings and Wesfarmers Chemicals, Energy & Fertilisers, while results in Kmart Group and Officeworks were impacted by COVID-related disruptions and costs. Kmart and Target trading performance through the first half of the 2022 financial year was significantly impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, with almost 25 per cent of store trading days lost due to government-mandated store closures. It said combined Kmart and Target sales declined 10.3 per cent for the first half and declined 5.2 per cent on a two-year basis, while an earnings before tax (EBT) loss for Catch of between $45 and $43 million is expected for the half. Wesfarmers said although trading conditions had improved as restrictions eased during the second quarter of the 2022 financial year, customer traffic to stores was impacted by rising community transmission of COVID-19 in some states, particularly during the Christmas trading period. It said ongoing global supply chain disruptions were well managed during the period as a result of investments made to hold additional inventory domestically, but high levels of COVID-related absenteeism in New South Wales and Victorian distribution centres impacted the ability to deliver stock to stores in line with customer demand. China's economy grew 4 per cent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, faster than expected but its weakest expansion in one-and-half years, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Monday. Gross domestic product (GDP) had been forecast to expand 3.6 per cent from a year earlier, according to a Reuters poll of analysts, slowing from 4.9 per cent in the third quarter. GDP grew 8.1 per cent in 2021, the data showed, faster than the 8 per cent expected by analysts. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP rose 1.6 per cent in October-December, compared with expectations for a 1.1 per cent rise and a revised 0.7 per cent gain in the previous quarter. China's economy got off to a strong start in 2021 as activity rebounded from a pandemic-induced slump the previous year, but it has lost steam due to a property downturn, debt curbs and strict COVID-19 curbs which have hit consumption. Chinese leaders have pledged more support for the economy, which is facing multiple headwinds into 2022. Meanwhile, China's central bank has cut loan rates to cushion the world's second-largest economy as its confronts headwinds from a rapidly cooling property sector and sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it was lowering the interest rate on 700 billion yuan ($153 billion) worth of one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans to some financial institutions by 10 basis points to 2.85 per cent from 2.95 per cent in previous operations. ""China’s policy makers are easing policy at a time when developed economies, such as the US, are tightening monetary policy to combat elevated inflation,"" economist Ryan Felsman from CommSec said in a note. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones closed lower on Friday with a big drag from financial stocks as investors were disappointed by fourth-quarter results from big US banks, which cast a shadow over the earnings season kick-off. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 201.81 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 35,911.81. However, the S&P 500 gained 3.82 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 4,662.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 86.94 points, or 0.59 per cent, to 14,893.75. ""We are now entering a period where the Federal Reserve will engage in a never-before-seen experiment: raising interest rates off zero and reducing the size of its balance sheet in the same year,"" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. ""The market is still left wondering what results will come from their decisions."" Meanwhile, the consumer discretionary stocks put pressure on the indexes throughout the session after morning data showed a December decline in retail sales and a souring of consumer sentiment. The S&P 500 bank sub-sector, which hit an intraday high in the previous session, closed down 1.7 per cent. The sector has been outperforming the S&P recently as investors bet the Federal Reserve's expected interest rate hikes will boost bank profits. US stock markets will remain shut on Monday for the public holiday in honour of Martin Luther King Jr. Meanwhile, the pan-European STOXX 600 shed 1 per cent, while also marking its worst week since late November.

95,'All-clear signal to buy': ASX follows Wall St rally after Fed chair's Senate testimony,markets,"  ASX follows Wall St higher as Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell gives investors comfort The ASX has followed a strong US share rebound, with investors reacting positively to comments from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell even though they indicate interest rates are likely to rise substantially this year. The local share market was virtually a carbon copy of US trends, with local tech stocks gaining strongly alongside energy companies, battery and electronics related miners and gold producers. Afterpay was one of the leaders, jumping 4.8 per cent, to $77.00, getting an additional boost from the Bank of Spain's approval of its takeover by US fintech Block. However, rival Zip was also up 2 per cent on the general risk-on sentiment that favours more speculative tech investments. Other tech and biotech companies dominated the top of the gainers list today. Cancer immunotherapy developer Imugene was up 5.7 per cent, IT firm Appen 5.5 per cent, cloud computing provider Megaport 3.4 per cent and Polynovo a further 2.5 per cent after a big jump on a revenue report yesterday. Battery materials providers also surged, with Nickel Mines up 6.5 per cent, Liontown Resources 5.2 per cent and Allkem 4.2 per cent. Gold miners did well too, with Saint Barbara up 4.1 per cent, Silverlake 3.2 per cent and Evolution Mining up 2.9 per cent. Old school fossil fuel producers also caught the wave of buying propelled by an overnight rise in oil prices, led by a 5.3 per cent jump for Beach Energy. Woodside Petroleum (+3.3pc) and Origin Energy (+1.6pc), benefited from rising oil prices. The main losers in today's trading were more defensive stocks, such as supermarkets. Woolworths was down 0.7 per cent, Coles 0.8 per cent and Metcash (which supplies IGA supermarkets) 2.3 per cent. Companies suffering lost sales from COVID-related supply chain disruptions also took a hit, with KFC operator Collins Foods off 2 per cent, along with Domino's Pizza, which topped the losses with a 4.2 per cent slide. Overall, the benchmark ASX 200 index gave up stronger morning gains to finish 0.7 per cent higher, at 7,439, as did the All Ordinaries, to close at 7,762. The Australian dollar also benefited from the positive vibes, rising to 72.16 US cents. Traders took a generally positive view on comments by US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, even though they appeared to confirm that rate rises were imminent. The market is generally pricing in the US central bank's first rate rise in March, as it winds up its latest bond-buying stimulus program. Mr Powell's confirmation hearing testimony to the Senate did little to alter those expectations, although he did note it might take longer for the central bank to wind down its holdings of bonds. ""Wall Street now has a better understanding on how the Fed will normalise policy and with the balance run-off likely taking up to four meetings,"" OANDA's senior market analyst, Edward Moya, said. ""After Powell's testimony, some investors feel they got the all-clear signal to buy the dip."" When the Fed does start allowing its holdings of bonds to shrink, that will effectively put further upward pressure on market interest rates, along with the halt to new bond purchases and cash-rate increases. US bond yields eased very slightly on expectations that this process of allowing the Fed's balance sheet, largely these bond holdings, to shrink would not start happening until the middle of this year. However, Mr Powell was clear that the Fed was focused on inflation, with figures out this week expected to show that year-on-year price rises in the US hit 7 per cent, the highest level in around four decades. ""If we have to raise interest rates more over time, we will,"" Mr Powell told the Senate committee. ""We will use our tools to get inflation back."" Mr Powell added that, with unemployment back below 4 per cent and Omicron disruptions expected to be temporary, he believed the US economy was well placed to continue growing in the face of rising interest rates. After initial falls, US shares gained as investors cherrypicked the positives out of Mr Powell's testimony. ""Today I thought that he was more moderate than the general tone of the [Federal Reserve meeting] minutes [released last week] — and I think that's why you're seeing the dollar a little weaker and the stocks up near their highs,"" said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which has been brutally sold off at the start of 2022, was a particular beneficiary. It was up 1.4 per cent, to 15,153 points at the close. The broader S&P 500 was 0.9 per cent higher, at 4,713 and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.5 per cent higher, at 36,252. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, with growth-heavy sectors like technology and consumer discretionary contributing the most to the S&P's gains. The biggest percentage gainer was energy, which rose along with crude oil futures. Megacap growth companies, including Apple (+1.7pc) and Amazon (+2.4pc), were the biggest single-stock boosts to the S&P 500. ""The market is extremely in tune to the Treasury yield move right now,"" Matt Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management, told Reuters. ""As yields have started to slow down their ascent, that's providing support for technology related stocks. ""There weren't any real surprises to Powell's comments which perhaps is adding some stability."" While Mr Miskin saw some signs of a risk-on market on Tuesday, he said investors were also ""tiptoeing around"" as they waited for key inflation data, which is due out on Wednesday.

96,"'Brutal' tech sell-off flows from US to Australia, but mining gains limit ASX losses",markets,"  Mining gains limit ASX slide despite tech sell-off flowing from Nasdaq to Australian market The Australian share market has followed a negative lead from Wall Street, where a tech sell-off over recent weeks has dragged the Nasdaq closer to a ""correction"". A technical correction is where the value of an index falls 10 per cent or more. Since its most recent peak in mid-November, the Nasdaq has lost around 7 per cent of its value. Most of that has come since the new year started, with Wall Street's tech-heavy index off 4.5 per cent so far this year. That included a 1 per cent slide on Friday that capped off the Nasdaq's worst week in almost a year, with some big names such as Tesla included in the sell-off, with the electric car maker down 3.5 per cent that session. ""The absence of fundamental news for the tech space in this risk-off environment has catalysed a brutal surge of selling tech names to kick the year off in 2022 as valuation scrutiny remains front and centre for investors,"" noted Daniel Ives and John Katsingris from US-based Wedbush Securities. ""With nervousness building and a white-knuckle environment around tech stocks in this tightening Fed backdrop, we view this as the most important upcoming earnings season for tech stocks in many years to turn the tide and derail the negative sentiment."" Locally, the tech index mirrored Friday's 1 per cent Nasdaq fall. Tech names such as Afterpay (-2.3pc), Wisetech Global (-2.7pc) and NextDC (-1.6pc) were being sold down, but many had narrowed their early losses by the afternoon. For example, after initial heavy falls, buy now, pay later firm Zip was up 0.8 per cent at $3.85 by the close. Battery company Novonix also bucked the tech sell-off, rising nearly 11 per cent on plans to dual-list on the Nasdaq. The healthcare sector fell around 1 per cent. Biotech giant CSL finished off 0.9 per cent at $280, while Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals and Pro Medicus had bigger 3.2 and 2.8 per cent falls respectively. However, it was the consumer discretionary sector that had the biggest drop, losing 1.3 per cent amid fears about the effect of Omicron on summer retail sales. JB Hi-Fi dropped 2.4 per cent and Harvey Norman 1.2 per cent. However, after a shaky start, key travel stocks including Qantas (+1.6pc), Flight Centre (+2.4pc) and Webjet (+1pc) all gained ground. That was despite private equity-owned Virgin Australia slashing flight capacity by around a quarter for the next two months in response to Omicron, with some routes likely to be suspended altogether until the middle of the year. While tech, health and consumer stocks were generally on the nose today, the dominant mining and energy sector helped keep the Australian share market from posting bigger falls. BHP (+2.4pc), Rio Tinto (+2.3pc) and Fortescue (+1.3pc) were all strongly higher, as were many smaller miners such as South32 (+3.6pc). Energy stocks were also seeing gains, with Woodside Petroleum (+2.3pc), Santos (+0.7pc) and Origin (+1.1pc) all gaining ground. Energy generator and retailer AGL was one of the market's strongest performers, up 8.6 per cent to $6.82, in part on some positive analyst comments following previous price declines last year. Overall, the benchmark ASX 200 index ended down just 0.1 per cent at 7,447 while the broader All Ordinaries was also off 0.1 per cent at 7,766 points, with both retracing much of this morning's lost ground. In economic news, ABS data collected from local governments showed building approvals rebounded slightly in November following a steep slump in October. Approvals for new homes rose 3.6 per cent in the second last month of 2021, having slumped 12.9 per cent in October to a 14-month low. Approvals are now more than 30 per cent below a peak in April, as the effects of the federal government's HomeBuilder stimulus scheme wear off. While a jump in apartment approvals led the national increase in new homes, apartment approvals in New South Wales plummeted nearly 50 per cent to their lowest levels since February 2012. ""The increased popularity of working from home may support approvals in the short term, as could higher savings rates if the Omicron variant continues to impact spending,"" wrote ANZ economist Adelaide Timbrell. ""But there are bigger risks to building approvals looking further out, in particular higher interest rates."" The data had little impact on the Australian dollar, which was trading at 71.92 US cents around 5:20pm.

97,ASX loses gains and Dow Jones hits record ,markets,"  ASX slips back from near record levels, job ads fall The Australian share market has fallen back from near-record levels as COVID-19 cases surge across the country. The All Ordinaries index lost its early gains by midday. By the close, the index ended down 0.3 per cent, to 7,890. The ASX 200 index also declined 0.3 per cent, to 7,566. Most sectors on the benchmark index ended lower with healthcare, technology and industrial stocks leading the falls. Technology stocks tracked falls on Wall Street. But banks, energy stocks and miners limited the losses. The best performers on the ASX 200 were cement maker Adbri (+4.8pc), oil and gas producer Santos (+2.6pc) and pallet maker Brambles (+2.2pc). Going down were X-ray firm Pro Medicus (-9.7pc), Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals (-7.5pc) and biotech Imugene (-8.2pc). Buy now, pay later firms Afterpay and Zip (-5pc), and payments firm Tyro (-6.9pc) were also among the losers. Afterpay fell to the lowest in more than a year with its shares losing 4 per cent to $80.51. Its share price has halved from $160.05 in February to a low of $79.80 today after a stockbroker warning. The big banks rose and Macquarie Group climbed 2 per cent to a new record high of $217.32. Miners BHP (+0.6pc) and Rio Tinto (+0.8pc) also gained as commodity prices increased. Yesterday, the ASX 200 index rose 2 per cent to its highest level since August, and its second-highest close on record. The All Ordinaries index reached a new record on Tuesday. But share market movements are being exaggerated because of light trading volumes with many investors still away on holiday. Construction firm CIMIC said its Leighton Asia unit had won a contract to build a data centre campus in Jakarta, Indonesia, for a multinational technology company. Its shares rose 1.2 per cent. Oil prices gained after oil-producers' group OPEC agreed to a planned production increase on the assessment that Omicron would not significantly hurt demand for energy. There were also production disruptions in Libya. Brent crude rose 1.4 per cent, to $US80.12 a barrel overnight. It eased back during the day to $US79.95 a barrel. Spot gold put on 0.7 per cent, to $US1814.17 an ounce. Iron ore rose 2.8 per cent, to $US122.90 a tonne. The Australian dollar lost ground in today's trade and was buying around 72.22 US cents at 4:30pm AEDT, down 0.2 per cent. CommSec said there was a record $102.8 billion banknotes on issue at the end of December, equivalent to nearly $4,000 for every Australian. It said people appeared to be ""squirrelling away cash"" because of COVID-10 uncertainty, as well as paying tradespeople in cash. Troubled Chinese property developer Evergrande said it will hold a meeting with some Chinese bondholders later this week to vote on proposals including delaying redemption of bonds and interest payment dates to July from January. Evergrande is struggling to pay back more than $300 billion in debts but it has not missed any local bond payments. It failed to make $US82.5 million in offshore interest payments last month. Its shares fell nearly 2 per cent in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, ANZ said job advertisements dropped 5.5 per cent in December after a 17.2 per cent jump over November and October as Delta coronavirus lockdowns eased. ANZ economists said a record gain of 366,100 jobs in November was likely a big reason why ads declined in December. Job ads rose almost 10 per cent in November, to a 13-year high. However, ANZ economist Catherine Birch said it was likely that the outbreak of the Omicron COVID-19 variant had some impact. ""It's also possible that businesses have become more hesitant to hire, due to the spread of Omicron and the consequent uncertainty around consumer behaviour and worker availability."" ""ANZ observed [that] spending data show new year spending was well down on the previous year, particularly in NSW,"" Ms Birch said. Job ads were still up by more than one third over the year, at 212,098. CommSec said in a research note that the big issues at present for business were gaining and retaining staff, challenges that were playing out across the globe. Other ANZ research showed that spending on dining out has decreased in all states and mobility data showed people were moving around less. ""This is likely due to a mix of hospitality closures due to Omicron outbreaks, lack of access to food delivery and cautious behaviour by prospective customers about spending time in public,"" ANZ economist Adelaide Timbrell said. Overnight, Australian time, the Dow Jones index climbed to a record high, but the Nasdaq fell as it was weighed down by big-name tech stocks. Banks and industrial stocks boosted the Dow Jones index as worries about the COVID-19 Omicron variant eased. The World Health Organization said more evidence was emerging that the Omicron variant caused milder symptoms than previous variants. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 also reached a record high before falling back with the weaker technology sector. The Nasdaq Composite was dragged down by Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, on the prospect of higher interest rates, which increase borrowing costs for growth stocks such as technology firms. US Treasury yields rose overnight, indicating investors are expecting higher interest rates. The Dow Jones index rose 0.6 per cent, to 36,780, the S&P 500 fell 3 points or nearly 0.1 per cent, to 4,793, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.3 per cent, to 15,623. Art Hogan — chief market strategist at National Securities in New York — said investors were hopeful that Omicron cases would peak soon. ""We do know that the seasonality of the first several days of a new year brings in new money,"" Mr Hogan said. ""While we know (Omicron) is transmitting very rapidly, the symptoms seem to be far less severe."" ""And the combination of those two things gives us some hope that this will likely burn out faster than any of the other variants that we've seen."" Travel stocks rose, including airlines and cruise lines, and banks also gained ground on the S&P 500. Car maker Ford jumped 11.7 per cent after it said it would nearly double annual production capacity for its F-150 Lightning electric pick-up, to 150,000 vehicles. Technology stocks are being hit because of expectations that US interest rates will rise this year to combat a surge in inflation. The US central bank said last month it would be ending its pandemic-era bond-buying in 2022, signalling at least three rate hikes for the year. Economic data showed that US manufacturing slowed in December amid some cooling in demand for goods, according to the Institute for Supply Management. However, it said, supply constraints were starting to ease, while prices paid by factories for raw materials fell by the most in a decade. In the UK, manufacturing activity grew slightly faster than expected, while in China factory production expanded at the fastest pace in six months. Elsewhere, European stock markets gained with the STOXX 600 climbing to a new record high. The FTSE 100 rose 1.6 per cent, to 7,506, the DAX in Germany rose 0.8 per cent, to 16,153, and the CAC 40 in Paris rose 1.4 per cent, to 7,317.

98,Evergrande shares placed in trading halt after luxury island demolition order,markets,"  Evergrande shares in trading halt after China orders demolition of newly built luxury apartments Troubled Chinese property giant Evergrande's shares have been suspended from trading on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The company did not give a reason for the halt. The news came after Chinese media reported that Evergrande had been ordered to demolish 39 luxury apartment buildings on the tropical island of Hainan within 10 days. The Ocean Flower Island project, a mega-resort under development by Evergrande, consists of three reclaimed Islands in Danzhou in Hainan province. The 39 buildings are located on island number two, which is for residential purposes. It is estimated the apartments are worth about 7.7 billion yuan ($1.7 billion). Chinese media reported the planning permit for the apartments was ""obtained illegally"" and had been ""revoked"". Local authorities said in an order issued on December 30 that the project ""violated"" the urban and rural planning law. Evergrande did not respond to the ABC's request for comment, but said in a statement on Monday night that it would ""actively communicate and handle according to the order"". The Ocean Flower Island project has had a total investment of 81 billion yuan ($18 billion) so far, including exhibition centres, museums, hotels and water parks, according to the statement. It is not the first time the project has been in trouble with local authorities. In 2019, the project was fined 215 million yuan ($47 million) for ""illegal conduct"" and was ordered to rectify it, Chinese media reported. Once a symbol of glittering success, China's biggest property group is tanking, dragging many of its competitors with it, writes Ian Verrender. Last Thursday, Evergrande's shares tumbled after the developer failed to pay offshore coupons due earlier in the week. Once a darling of China's booming property sector, Evergrande has more than $400 billion in debts, triggering financial woes in the world's second-biggest economy. Evergrande chairman Hui Ka Yan vowed in a meeting last month to deliver 39,000 apartments in December, 2021, compared with fewer than 10,000 in each of the previous three months. Evergrande will face more deadlines in January for both overseas and domestic coupons. The next grace period for a total of $352 million in coupons expires on January 27.

99,"ASX follows Wall Street's modest falls, but made strong gains over 2021",markets,"  ASX follows Wall Street's modest falls, but made strong gains over 2021 The Australian share market has ended six days in a row of gains in a shortened final trading session for the year. The All Ordinaries index fell 0.8 per cent to 7,779,  while the ASX 200 lost 0.9 per cent by the close to 7,445, amid a surge in COVID-19 cases. While the share market ended the last trading day of the year in the red, the benchmark index rose 13 per cent for 2021, boosted by government stimulus, higher company profits and an economic rebound despite the pandemic. The All Ordinaries rose 13.6 per cent in 2021. The market also traded this week at the highest in more than three months. With most market participants on holiday, trading volumes have been much lighter than usual. In thin market trade, only the education sector increased, with miners giving up their gains. Among the losers were banks, real estate and consumer stocks. The best performers in the ASX 200 index were uranium miner Paladin Energy (+6pc), and gold miners Regis Resources (+4.6pc) and St Barbara (+3.9pc). Biotech firm Mesoblast rose 3.7 per cent after a positive update from US authorities on its potential treatment for acute graft versus host disease in children, where the body is attacked by donated cells or bone marrow transplants. Heading the other way were Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals (-4.8pc), investment administration firm Hub 24 (-4.6pc) and financial firm Challenger (-3.8pc). The Australian dollar was steady at around 72.49 US cents in afternoon trade. While Australia's share market gains this year have been strong, they have been left behind by US markets. With one trading day left, the S&P 500 was set to end the year more than 27 per cent higher, with the Nasdaq up about 23 per cent and the Dow's annual rise just shy of 20 per cent. It's unlikely that 2021 will be anyone's favourite year, but there were some bright spots — especially for those who invested in shares during lockdown, which have since jumped to record highs. We also spoke with market analysts about their predictions for 2022. Each of Wall Street's main indexes was poised for its sharpest three-year surge since 1997-99, despite two of those years being in the midst of the worst pandemic in a century. As the year draws to a close, some traders appeared to take some of those profits of the table. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 91 points, or 0.25 per cent, to 36,398, the S&P 500 lost 14 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 4,779 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 25 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 15,742. Only four of the 11 major S&P 500 sector indexes traded higher, led by the real estate sector. The market fell back from earlier session highs. Investors had cheered a US Labor Department report that the number of Americans filing for new unemployment claims dropped to a seasonally adjusted 198,000 in the week leading up to Christmas, from a revised 206,000 a week earlier. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast weekly applications would rise to 208,000. In other strong US data, the Chicago purchasing managers' index (PMI) delivered a print of 63.1, a monthly increase of 1.3 points and 1.1 points above consensus. A PMI number over 50 signifies expanded business activity over the previous month. ""The strong manufacturer data out of Chicago and impressive initial jobless claims continue to show an economy that is quite healthy, omitting the continued worries obviously over the Omicron variant,"" Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, told Reuters. But Mr Detrick cautioned that low holiday season trading volume could exaggerate price moves, and he was also cautious about prospects for the new year. In 2022, investors will shift their attention to expected US interest rate hikes and mid-term elections for the US Congress, where President Joe Biden's Democrats currently hold a slim majority. ""Mid-term years tend to be the most volatile out of the four-year [election] cycle,"" Mr Detrick noted. ""There's actually a 17 per cent average peak to trough correction during a mid-term year, which is the largest of the four years. ""Investors were pretty spoiled this year. So be aware that next year won't be as easy.""

100,ASX edges higher after Wall St gains; China's Evergande misses new coupon payments,markets,"  ASX edges higher after Wall St gains; China's Evergande misses new coupon payments Australian shares have closed this year's second-last session slightly higher, after the Dow Jones index and S&P 500 advanced to all-time highs on a boost from retail sales. The ASX 200 opened higher but subsequently slipped into the red after midday before staging a late rally. Meanwhile, the benchmark index was up 0.05 per cent, to 7,513 on Thursday, with materials (+0.4pc) and financial (+0.2pc) stocks leading the way. ""The financials sector benefited heavily in 2021 from the economic expansion and robust property activity, providing banks with robust balance sheets,"" chief economist from CommSec Craig James noted. ""This was reflected by the buy-back initiatives and dividend payouts announced in the previous fiscal year. ""And, despite the forecast rate hikes, rational investors may continually look favourably towards the expected strong dividend payouts of banks, as opposed to an investment in the yield curve."" Magellan (+3.7pc) and Bega Cheese (+3.2pc), Nine Entertainment (+2.8pc) were among the top movers, while Imugene (-8.1pc) and IDP (-5.1pc) were among the worst performers. All up, 100 shares were in green, 88 were in red and 12 were flat. The Australian dollar was trading at 72.52 US cents, slightly higher. Overnight, major global stock indexes were mixed on Wednesday as uncertainty over the surge in Omicron variant infections tempered optimism that harsh new curbs on business and travel may not be needed. After a weak session in Asian stock markets, European stock markets traded mixed. The pan-European STOXX 600 slipped 0.1 per cent. However, the Dow has risen six straight trading days, marking the longest streak of gains since a seven-session run from March 5 to March 15 of this year. The Dow Jones index rose 0.3 per cent, to 36,4891. Data on Wednesday showed the US trade deficit in goods mushroomed to the widest ever in November as imports of consumer goods shot to a record, as the coronavirus pandemic has limited spending by Americans on services. Some early studies pointing to a reduced risk of hospitalisation in Omicron cases have eased some investors concerns over the travel disruptions and powered the S&P 500 to record highs this week. The S&P 500 gained 0.1 per cent, to end at 4,793 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.1 per cent, to 15,766 points. ""The market started to recognise that the Omicron variant was in a strange way good news,"" said Jay Hatfield, founder and chief executive of Infrastructure Capital Management in New York. ""It will burn itself out more rapidly because it's easily transmissible, but it's less likely to overwhelm overwhelmed the hospitals, even though arguably Omicron is going to be a headwind for at least the next month."" While much of the economic optimism has centred on the United States, the main European stock index is up more than 16 per cent so far this year, showing faith in a recovery from the depths of the COVID-19 crisis. US crude stocks, gasoline and distillate inventories fell last week, while US oil production rose to the highest since May 2020, Energy Information Administration data showed on Wednesday. Brent crude oil was up, trading at $US79.17 a barrel, by 4:41pm AEDT. As 2021 draws to a close, the main US stock indexes are on pace for their third straight year of stunning annual returns, boosted by historic fiscal and monetary stimulus. The S&P 500 is looking at its strongest three-year performance since 1999. The focus next year will shift to the US Federal Reserve's path of interest rate hikes amid a surge in prices caused by supply chain bottlenecks and a strong economic rebound. Shares of Evergrande tumbled on Thursday after the embattled real estate developer did not pay offshore coupons due earlier this week. Evergrande — whose $US19 billion in international bonds are in cross-default after missing a deadline to pay coupons earlier this month — had new coupon payments worth $US255 million due on Tuesday for its June 2023 and 2025 notes. Some bondholders holding the two bonds have not yet received the coupons, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter. Both the payments have a 30-day grace period. Evergrande's shares were down 8.5 per cent, at $HK1.51, by 4pm AEDT. Bloomberg News reported earlier that the due date passed with no sign of payment by the property developer. Evergrande's Thursday decline wiped out gains from earlier this week, when the market cheered the initial progress made by the firm in resuming construction work. Company Chairman Hui Ka Yan vowed in a meeting on Sunday to deliver 39,000 units of properties in December, compared with fewer than 10,000 in each of the previous three months.

101,"ASX jumps after Christmas break, boosted by banks and miners",markets,"  ASX jumps after Christmas break, boosted by banks and miners Australian shares have jumped to their highest in 50 days as market participants grew less concerned about the Omicron variant on returning from an extended holiday weekend. The ASX 200 closed up 1.2 per cent to 7,510. The top-performing stocks were Chalice Mining (+7.8pc) and Liontown Resources (+7.5pc), while Whitehaven Coal (-2.2pc) and Afterpay (-1.8pc) were the bottom movers. Heavyweight financials rose as much as 1.1 per cent, with the so-called Big Four banks up between 0.8 per cent and 1.5 per cent in afternoon trading. Commonwealth Bank of Australia advanced as much as 1.3 per cent, while Westpac jumped 1.5 per cent. Miners rose 1 per cent, with Pilbara and Perenti Global jumping 7.1 per cent and 8.5 per cent, respectively. Energy stocks rose 1.2 per cent after crude oil prices settled higher overnight, supported by supply outages and expectations that US inventories fell last week. Major oil and gas explorer Santos added 0.3 per cent, while Woodside Petroleum rose as much as 2 per cent to its highest in nearly two weeks. Healthcare stocks jumped as much as 0.6 per cent and were set for their sixth straight session of gains. The Australian dollar was flat at 72.28 US cents. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent while the S&P 500 lost 0.1 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6 per cent. Asset classes from oil to equities are near or above recent highs, having clawed back losses from late November, when the Omicron variant of COVID-19 sent investors scurrying for safety. Delays in Britain and France on imposing more COVID curbs before the end of the year also excited investors. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.1 per cent as it continued to hover near a record high hit last month, and the pan-European STOXX 600 added 0.6 per cent to end the session at a five-week high, heading for its best month since March this year. The markets were in line with the seasonal Santa Claus rally, with CFRA Research data showing the S&P 500 had on average risen 1.3 per cent in the last five trading days of the year and first two days of the new year since 1969. ""Investors are digesting the gains from the last three days … but there are concerns such as 'How will the Omicron variant affect the market? Would that end up undoing the Santa Claus rally? What about the Fed raising interest rates, could that cause challenges for the year ahead?'"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. ""This is a holiday-shortened week. So daily movements will likely be exaggerated because of a low relative volume."" In Europe, the UK government said England would not get any new COVID-19 restrictions before the end of 2021, while the French government said it would tighten measures, though there will be no curfew for New Year's Eve and schools will reopen as planned in early January. The MSCI world equities index is up more than 17 per cent so far this year, and heading into 2022 investors are wary of risks stemming from rising price pressures, slowing corporate earnings growth and the likelihood of a rate hike cycle in the US. ""Money growth will slow in 2022, but the market strongly doubts that the ECB and the Fed are willing to truly tighten financial conditions,"" said Arne Petimezas, analyst at AFS Group in Amsterdam. ""They now face a trade-off between controlling inflation or keeping this party going"".

102,ASX rises with a 'Santa Claus rally' as Wall Street gains despite Omicron,markets,"  ASX rises with a 'Santa Claus rally' as Wall Street gains, despite Omicron The Australian share market has bought into the festive cheer, with stocks rising on Christmas Eve, in tandem with Wall Street. The ASX 200 closed on Christmas Eve up 0.4 per cent, to 7,420 points. Financials, mining and gas stocks, and tech were among the top performers. AMP had gained 6.4 per cent, while Champion Iron and Kelsian Group were up 3 per cent and 4.2 per cent respectively. This followed gains on Wall Street overnight. The Dow Jones closed 0.6 per cent higher, the S&P 500 gained 0.6 per cent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was boosted by 0.9 per cent. ""Risk sentiment increased as Omicron worries receded, while better-than-expected US economic data boosted hopes that the economic recovery is still on track,"" CBA noted this morning. Consumer spending rose 0.6 per cent last month, and the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits held below pre-pandemic levels last week. There are signs that Omicron is less likely to lead to hospitalisation, and a US Federal Drug Administration official said that data indicated that both Merck's and Pfizer's COVID-19 anti-viral pills were effective against the variant. “Today is a very calm day; it’s the relief over Omicron apparently not being as bad as we feared,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial. “What remains impressive is how strong the consumer remains. It’s a positive sign as we head into 2022. The economic backdrop is on very strong footing."" ""The bull might have a few more tricks up his sleeve before the year ends,"" Mr Detrick added. The rise of risk-on investments ahead of Christmas, dubbed a ""Santa Claus rally"" by traders, also nudged gold and oil higher. The trading session so far has put markets on course for a third successive day of gains as they recovered from a jolt on Monday when worries about Omicron pushed investors to safe-haven assets like the greenback. Oil prices extended gains on Thursday as the signs the worst effects of the Omicron variant might be containable prevailed over the threat of new travel curbs. Brent crude was up 2 per cent to $US76.82 a barrel, by 07:04am AEDT. ""Reduced fears of an Omicron-induced demand slump and US government data showing a drop in US inventories helped lift crude oil prices,"" CBA additionally noted. European shares hit a one-month high on Thursday, led by gains in banking stocks. The pan-European STOXX 600 gained 1 per cent, marking the third straight session of gains, tracking a global share rally that was also helped by robust US economic data.

103,ASX rises as Wall Street gains; Magellan rebounds while Bega Cheese tumbles,markets,"  ASX rises as Wall Street gains; Magellan rebounds while Bega Cheese tumbles Australian shares have extended gains after Wall Street advanced overnight on upbeat economic data and an encouraging Omicron update. The ASX 200 closed 0.3 per cent higher, at 7,388. Heavyweight financials climbed as much as 0.6 per cent, driven by gains in the so-called ""Big Four"" banks. Magellan led with a 5 per cent rise in a partial rebound. The company's shares slumped more than 30 per cent on Monday after the fund manager lost a major client. Meanwhile, Bega Cheese tumbled to a more-than-four-month low after the company warned of a hit to its 2022 fiscal earnings from strong competition for dairy supply in Australia, high global prices and the impact of COVID-19. The company's shares dropped as much as 10 per cent to post their biggest intraday loss since March 16, 2020. Healthcare stocks were set for a fourth straight session of gain (+0.5pc), while energy stocks rose 0.1 per cent on firmer oil prices. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was trading at 72.14 US cents by 04:31pm AEDT. Wall Street's main indexes gained for a second straight session on Wednesday, as volatility has ratcheted up in the last month of 2021 following the arrival of Omicron and an otherwise strong year for equities. A South African study suggested reduced risks of hospitalisation and severe disease in people infected with the Omicron variant versus the Delta one, but World Health Organisation officials cautioned that it was too soon to draw firm conclusions. “We are still struggling for direction in the face of the Omicron outbreak,"" said Mike Stritch, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management. ""But in the past few days … more and more evidence is building that the strain is potentially less severe than prior strains, specifically Delta, which bodes well for economic momentum in 2022.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose or 0.7 per cent to 35,754 , while the S&P 500 gained 1 per cent to 4,697. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.2 per cent, to 15,522. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.9 per cent. US consumer confidence improved further in December, suggesting the economy would continue to expand in 2022. The survey from the Conference Board showed more consumers planned to buy a house and big-ticket items such as motor vehicles and major household appliances as well as go on vacation over the next six months. Other reports showed US home sales increased for a third straight month in November, and that gross domestic product increased at a 2.3 per cent annualised rate in the July-September quarter, revised up from the 2.1 per cent rate estimated last month. All 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by consumer discretionary. The benchmark S&P 500 was up about 24.5 per cent so far in 2021. European shares ended on Wednesday at near one-week highs, led by gains in technology and industrial stocks, even as investors worried about the outlook for global recovery amid a rise in COVID-19 cases due to the Omicron variant. The pan-European STOXX 600 climbed 0.8 per cent, adding to a 1.4 per cent jump in the previous session, which was also its best day in two weeks. Technology shares led gains, followed by industrials, travel and construction-related stocks. Global markets have been on edge this month as the rapidly spreading Omicron strain of the coronavirus has pushed some countries to reimpose restrictions on daily life, disrupting travel and hampering economic activity. ""There's a lot of treading water going on and waiting for the Omicron storm to hit, as a lot of traders are hanging onto every bit of scientific data around the severity of the new strain,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""It's going to be a very cautious mood for equities, rather than any kind of euphoria, heading into Christmas."" Thin liquidity and risk associated with Omicron's spread have led to volatility in the benchmark index in recent days. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank could raise rates as soon as the end of next year, and heralding an end to ECB bond purchases would be a strong signal that the move is coming in the next two quarters, Governing Council member Robert Holzmann said. The ECB at its last meeting promised to provide monetary support by temporarily doubling its asset purchases before it ends its emergency bond buys by next March.

104,"'Two days in, it would be sold': Arizona's house prices are spiking, here's what it means for Australia",markets,"  House prices in Arizona are rising and that could be bad news for Australia's property market There's something romantically rustic and unique about Phoenix, Arizona. Renowned for its year-round warmth, spectacular vista and expansive red dirt fields dotted with giant cactus, the Valley of the Sun has long been the holiday mecca for those living in northern states during the harsh winter months. However, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, it became a refuge for those feeling captive in big cities. They didn't just travel there temporarily, they relocated long-term. As a result, house prices in the southern desert city have jumped an unprecedented 35 per cent in the year to June. ""It's kinda like we're on hyperspeed now, everything is super fast. If you hesitate, you're out,"" real estate agent Jeff Fields said. ""There are multiple offers on properties and a lot of waiving of inspections, which is crazy."" Homes in the area that were once worth $US500,000 ($703,000) are now easily selling at $US800,000. ""Some properties are receiving as much as 20 to 30 offers on the day [of listing]. That's how crazy our market has shifted,"" Mr Fields said. ""I just closed on a property for a buyer who, four months earlier, it had sold for $US100,000 less."" There are a few factors at play, but the phenomenon that's shaking out in Phoenix isn't isolated. It's happening in markets across the globe, including Australia. Young couple Amy and David Guerrero have long dreamed of owning their own home. During 2020, they ramped up their efforts to enter the first home buyer market but were priced out by out-of-state money, time and time again. They considered putting offers on up to 30 homes in Phoenix. ""We probably looked at over a hundred houses in person and thousands online,"" Mr Guerrero said. ""Eventually it turned into, new listing is up, I'd call her [Amy], we'd run to the house, we'd look in the window, call the agent, wait to get an appointment in it and then make an offer that same day. ""That's how competitive it was getting. Two days in, it would be sold."" The Guerreros — who are thinking of starting a family — finally managed to secure their first home in May, but it certainly wasn't an easy journey. They came up against prospective buyers willing to waive inspections and valuations, others putting down cash offers, while some agreed to give the seller $US10,000 once the inspections were done. ""There are a lot of ways people with money are really working the system that people who don't have as much can't really do,"" Mr Guerrero said. But others, like single father-of-four Jason Smith, haven't been so lucky. The self-employed plumber tried for months to enter the market. He eventually settled on a buying a motorhome and now lives in an RV park in North Phoenix. ""I make everybody else their dream home, but I can't even find a half dream,"" Mr Smith said. ""You really want a house, you don't want a trailer, you want something that's stable, that you can put a dog in the backyard. ""At the end of the day, when I was trying to think outside the box, I ended up buying a box to live in."" The pandemic prompted consumers worldwide to re-evaluate their lives, with many choosing to evacuate big cities in the hunt for more space as their work went virtual. Major hub cities like New York and Los Angeles were abandoned in favour of those with more space. That demand, combined with record low interest rates, a housing shortfall, supply chain delays and fast-rising inflation as the world emerged from the shutdowns, has pushed up home prices everywhere, pricing out many consumers. ""Housing prices are increasing at historically high rates — at a blistering rate right now — but, year over year, it's more like 20 per cent [in the US],"" University of Pennsylvania Wharton School real estate professor Susan Wachter said. ""It's also happening in the UK, Australia, Canada: It's a global phenomenon."" In Australia, house prices are expected to cap the year out with more than 20 per cent growth. If we've learned anything from the past week, the Australian housing market is on a one-way trajectory into outer space and no one is in any mood to alter its course, writes Ian Verrender. And what happens next in the United States could trickle down directly to the average Australian household. If the Federal Reserve chooses to lift interest rates to cool inflation and consumer spending, it will have a ripple effect worldwide. ""Then, of course, there is the monetary response to COVID, which has driven interest rates and mortgage rates to all-time lows. That is also extremely important to the outcome of unprecedented increases in housing prices, worldwide,"" Professor Wachter said. ""If inflation comes down due to the Fed's actions — interest rate increases — that's likely to be followed on elsewhere and, at the same time, other central banks are in fact following on, pre-empting the Fed, increasing interest rates now because of high global inflation."" At a basic level, raising interest rates goes hand-in-hand with appreciating currencies. In many parts of the world, the US dollar is used as a benchmark of current and future economic growth. The Australian dollar is now starting to fall against the greenback, which is only expected to further exacerbate inflation. Sick of being locked out of the housing market? You aren't alone. But there are some alternative options you may not have considered. In addition, many Australian banks fund their fixed mortgage loans in US bond markets. So, any rise to interest rates will likely flow on to Australian homeowners. ""There is a vulnerability, particularly with fixed-rate mortgages to sharp rises in interest rates, which is why central banks are preparing banks and asking for cushions and additional capital,"" Professor Wachter said. ""It is quite possible that a sharp rise in mortgage rates could spark some mortgage stress, mortgage payment shock and a rise in defaults. ""This is the real concern, it could not just slow prices but [could] cause prices to reverse and decline, and that's the major concern. ""To have price declines at the same time as unemployment increases is a recipe for macro-instability and that's what happened in the Great Recession [2007-2009]."" While she doesn't foresee a repeat of the fallout from the global financial crisis, Professor Wachter is concerned with mortgage debt increasing at the same time as record house price growth. The building supply chain has also been severely disrupted by the pandemic and is now playing catch-up. In America, as elsewhere, the result is a widening generational gap between Baby Boomers and Millennials who are watching their dreams of buying a home go up in smoke, once again.

105,"US regulators probing Afterpay and Zip over buy now, pay later consumer protections",markets,"  US regulators probing Afterpay and Zip over buy now, pay later consumer protections Buy now, pay later stocks Afterpay and Zip have taken a hit on the Australian share market today after US regulators ordered them to disclose their consumer protections. The ASX had a strong morning that dwindled over the day. It eventually closed marginally up 0.1 per cent, at 7,304 points. It had closed down 0.4 per cent yesterday. Energy, financials and consumer goods performed well, while healthcare and tech took a hit. The best performers of the day were miners, including Northern Star, Champion and Whitehaven, all with gains of around 5 per cent. All up, 135 stocks ended in the green. On the flip side, buy now, pay later (BNPL) stocks Zip and Afterpay were in for a shaky day after regulators in the US ordered the two Australian-listed companies and three of their global competitors to submit information about their products' risk to consumers. BNPL gives people up-front credit to purchase and walk away with items and then pay back the tech company over instalments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered Afterpay, Zip, Klarna, PayPal and Affirm to answer a long list of questions, including about the debt consumers were getting into, whether companies were following consumer laws, and about data harvesting. CFPB director Rohit Chopra said the bureau had ordered the companies to submit information so ""we can report to the public about industry practices and risks"". “Buy now, pay later is the new version of the old layaway plan, but with modern, faster twists where the consumer gets the product immediately but gets the debt immediately too,” she said. In a statement, Afterpay said it welcomed ""efforts to ensure that there are appropriate regulatory protections"", but defended its existing consumer protections. BNPL has exploded in the US, with the regulator saying its use spiked during the pandemic and the latest Black Friday sales period. In Australia, recent data from Treasury found one in five online sales now involves BNPL. Just this month, the Australian government announced it was also seeking to update financial laws to regulate a range of technologies, including BNPL. Afterpay and Zip were some of the biggest losers on the ASX 200, with losses of 7.2 and 5.6 per cent respectively. Affirm lost almost 11 per cent on the Nasdaq on the news as well. Over on Wall Street, the Nasdaq dumped 2.5 per cent as investors sold off tech stocks in favour of safer options. Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla tumbled between 2.6 and 6.8 per cent, hitting both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. The Dow Jones only declined marginally. It came as the Federal Reserve this week indicated it would start winding back bond-buying next year and possibly raise interest rates three times because inflation — or price rises — were at the highest rate in decades, posing a problem for the US economy. Here in Australia, our Reserve Bank is now making similar rumblings. In Europe overnight, the Bank of England surprised investors by becoming the first major central bank globally to lift its interest rate since COVID-19 began. Like Australia, it had its rate set at 0.1 per cent. That will now lift to 0.25 per cent to tackle rising inflation, which is predicted to hit 6 per cent in the UK by April. That is three times the BoE's target level for price rises. BoE governor Andrew Bailey said Omicron was already hurting retailers and restaurants but the bank felt compelled to stop the recent jump in prices from becoming a longer-term problem. ""We're concerned about inflation in the medium term. And we're seeing things now that can threaten that. So that's why we have to act,"" Mr Bailey said. The smaller economy of New Zealand lifted its interest rate last month.

The ASX 200 ended down 0.4 per cent. That was despite investors betting in the hours before open that it would do nicely off the Fed's announcement, and Wall Street also booming. The biggest loser on the ASX 200 was CSL, after it started trading again. The pharmaceutical manufacturer and flu vaccine developer announced on late Tuesday that it was buying up Swisse company Vifor for $16.4 billion. Its shares started trading again on Thursday morning and it declined throughout the day, ending eventually 8.2 per cent lower. Other losers included miners Champion (-6pc), Virgin Money (-4.3pc) and St Barbara (-4.2pc). On the flipside, medical developer Mesoblast was up 10.1 per cent. Tech and real estate stocks also performed. Overall, despite the overall loss, 142 companies gained on Thursday. Qantas had lost 0.6 per cent after releasing economic forecasts that the airline claimed showed it in a better financial position than expected. It has forecast an underlying earnings loss of up to $1.1 billion in the first half of the 2022 financial year. As previously announced, it is boosting its balance sheet by selling off land in Mascot. It is also bringing all domestic employees back to work and expects domestic flight sales to be above pre-COVID levels within months, as Australians stick to travelling locally. International capacity is still expected at 30 per cent of pre-pandemic levels for the first few months of next year. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe today indicated the central bank would likely start winding back bond-buying — or quantitative easing (QE) — by May. However, there's a big proviso. Dr Lowe says it's dependent on the latest strain of COVID not de-railing the economic recovery. ""Case numbers are rising quickly, but hospitalisations will be key,"" ANZ noted. ""The potential for government-mandated shutdowns to delay the recovery and the eventual pick-up in inflation could defer the end of QE."" Meanwhile, jobs data out today in Australia also showed unemployed had dropped again to 4.6 per cent, as Victorians and people in NSW re-entered the workforce after lockdowns. Over in the US, the Federal Reserve said it would end its COVID-era bond purchases in March. That is earlier than forecast and paves the way for interest rates to be increased by the end of 2022. It came as the US battled the highest level of inflation — or price rises — it had seen in decades. Principal Global Investors' strategist Seema Shah described the Fed's move as ""no surprise"". “The Fed apparently just woke up to the inflationary pressures consuming the US economy,"" she said. ""With CPI in touching distance of 7 per cent, it should be of no surprise to see the Fed accelerating tapering and the median forecast showing three interest rate hikes in 2022. ""Price pressures may well ease next year, but inflation will settle at a level uncomfortably high for the Fed – this is transitory plus. ""The big question for markets now is, can the US economy digest this pace of hikes without ending up with a stomach ache? ""After the 20 months we’ve had, perhaps six hikes over a two-year period looks overwhelming. ""But compared to previous hiking cycles – most pertinently 2004 to 2006 when the Fed made 17 consecutive hikes – we are tentatively confident that the US economy can handle it. Not only that, but US inflation needs it."" The Dow soared on the news with a gain of 1.1 per cent, while the S&P and Nasdaq were even higher at 1.6 and 2.2 per cent respectively. ""The US dollar temporarily jumped after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) delivered a hawkish policy announcement, though is now below its pre‑FOMC level,"" ANZ noted. ""The US/AUD was quick to regain its post‑FOMC losses and is trading near 0.7135.  Nevertheless, ongoing volatility is possible.""

107,"CSL shares still in trading halt over Vifor deal, as ASX follows US markets down",markets,"  ASX follows US markets down, while CSL shares still in trading halt over Vifor deal The Australian share market has followed global markets down on Wednesday, as US investors get spooked by fresh inflation figures and the global spread of Omicron. The ASX 200 ended the day down 0.7 per cent. Tech stocks were among the biggest losers with the core index down 2.6 per cent. That followed a hit to the tech-heavy Nasdaq on Wall Street overnight. Gold miners also lost ground on the ASX 200. The commodity traded flat on global markets overnight. Overall, 150 of the top 200 companies traded down. The few winners included Virgin Money (+4.1pc), Platinum Asset Management (+2.3pc) and Alumina (+3.9pc). CSL was still in a trading halt after announcing late on Tuesday that it is buying up Vifor. The pharmaceutical manufacturer with facilities in Melbourne has offered up $16.4 billion for the Swisse pharmaceutical group. Vifor's board has recommended the takeover. Vifor would give CSL leads in markets for kidney disease and iron deficiency treatments. It comes as CSL missed out on a deal for mRNA manufacturing in Australia, with the federal government instead striking a deal with Moderna to build a new site. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.3 per cent, the S&P 500 lost 0.8 per cent, while the Nasdaq lost more than 1.1 per. Mega tech stocks including Tesla, Google and Amazon fell between 1 and 4 per cent. Apple was down 1.2 per cent after the iPhone maker said it would require customers and employees to wear masks at its US retail stores as COVID-19 cases surge. As well as Wall Street closing down, European stocks were also down as cases of the latest strain of COVID surge there, with Omicron already becoming the dominant strain in London. The region's central banks are also meeting this week to determine economic policy. ""Equity markets will stay skittish as there is tension between Omicron,"" European analyst Nick Nelson saiad. ""While we stand between two earnings seasons. ""But we're no longer talking about the same restrictions we had in Q1 2021 or 2020, so in the near term, restrictions across Europe will only be a modest drag on growth."" In the US, the Federal Reserve is tomorrow set to make a decision on next year's monetary policy. Data just out showed the prices producers paid for inputs increased more than expected in November, adding to ongoing woes about supply chain bottlenecks and rising inflation in the US. The producer price index (PPI) for final demand jumped 9.6 per cent from a year earlier, a record in figures going back to 2010. A longer running measure of PPI for finished goods surged 13.3 per cent, the most since 1980. Two big threats are looming large across the globe: Inflation, and the Omicron variant. And both could have potentially catastrophic consequences for the economy and our wellbeing. ""Higher producer prices can flow through to higher consumer prices, supporting our view that US inflation will not ease back to the FOMC’s 2 per cent per year target any time soon,"" NAB noted this morning. The Fed is expected to pull back sooner than expected on asset purchases and potentially even raise rates earlier than forecast. Ten-year treasury yields were 2 points higher today, showing that investor believe rates will be raised sooner than previously thought. ""A steelier tone, a higher dot plot and a doubling of the pace of tapering from $US15 billion to $US30 billion are widely expected,"" ANZ forecast this morning about the Federal Reserve's meeting this week. ""If inflation forecasts are raised it would show greater uncertainty about the FOMC’s confidence in meeting its inflation target.""

108,analysis: Will Omicron and inflation be the next big global threats?,markets,"  Many people seem to have a natural desire to ""clean the slate"" before Christmas. It's a time of year where painful parts of our lives can be exacerbated — in part because there's some degree of pressure to finish up projects, party and enjoy ourselves. It's harder to have fun when you're worried about something, or several things. Right now, apart from people's daily life concerns, two overarching threats are looming large across the globe: inflation, and the Omicron variant of COVID-19. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Higher inflation has the potential to derail the property market through its impact on interest rates, pushing them much higher. And higher inflation without a stronger economy puts millions of jobs at risk. Omicron and COVID-19, meanwhile, remain a threat to our health and way of life. Let's look at inflation first. Inflation is a way of measuring the rise in prices of a basket of goods, and is calculated by the Bureau of Statistics. The latest data suggests the current lift in inflation is not subsiding and, if anything, is growing. According to the ACCI-Westpac Survey of Industrial Trends for the December quarter, input cost pressures remained elevated, with 38 per cent of firms reporting higher input costs. ""The sustained period of cost pressures over the last three quarters, at a net 39 per cent, is the highest average level since December 2008,"" the report says. Crucially, this is the cost of business rising — that is, cost-push inflation, not demand-pull inflation. The government and the business community had hoped that as the pandemic lost its sting, businesses would find it easier to obtain supplies, the mad scrambling for more inventory would subside, and business cost pressures would ease. But this has not happened, and is unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future. When Sydney's Kirby Institute pitted an Omicron sample against the antibodies of two vaccine doses, they couldn't block it — but there's still much to learn about the newest COVID-19 variant. ""Cost inflation has been a significant issue throughout the COVID pandemic and recovery, with supply chain disruptions globally and domestically, border closures and a tight labour market all viewed as contributing factors,"" the ACCI-Westpac survey notes. ""Manufacturers expect that unit costs will continue to rise, with a net 32 per cent reporting that they see further cost inflation in the next three months. ""This is up from the 28 per cent reported for the September quarter."" The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Andrew McKellar sums it up like this: ""While it is too early to tell if inflationary pressures will be longer term, businesses in Australia do need to prepare for the prospects of higher inflation."" Then there's Omicron. Many experts say it's still too early to make a call about the severity of the strain. Initially, financial markets panicked. Stocks tumbled several weeks ago when the WHO warned Omicron could pose a new threat to the world. Concerns faded in the weeks that followed as evidence emerged that fewer patients were being hospitalised. Now, new reports suggest the fast-spreading variant accounts for around 40 per cent of COVID-19 infections in London and at least one death in the United Kingdom. Wall Street received the news late in its trading session but the sell-off was swift. Shares in cruise line stocks Carnival and several airlines tumbled. A 9 per cent share price slump for Woolworths is dragging the ASX into the red, as the supermarket giant warns of slowing sales and rising costs. Omicron's infectiousness is troubling analysts and raising questions about how our immune systems handle the virus five to six months after receiving a second dose of the vaccine. ""There's the combination of other diseases, and trauma, the summer and the presence of COVID, and we still haven't seen what Omicron is going to do to us,"" Rinaldo Bellomo, a Professor of Intensive Care Medicine at the University of Melbourne, told ABC News Breakfast. ""And so I think all of us are incredibly cautious and guarded about what's coming in 2022."" The nation still seems to be well equipped to tackle both the economic problems and COVID-19. Key to tackling the economic problems will be across-the-board pay rises. There's already evidence pay is increasing in the manufacturing and wholesale industries. And while further and much bigger increases to the minimum wage would be beneficial to millions of workers, the government insists it's attempting to fix the problem of low wage growth. Meanwhile, some state governments have committed to making wage theft, or the underpayment of workers, a crime. In Victoria, new wage theft laws came into effect in mid-2021. Under the laws, Victorian employers will face up to $1 million in fines and up to 10 years in jail if found guilty of wage theft. And, of course, scientists continue to monitor the evolution of COVID-19, working overtime to ensure they understand new variants and how well current therapies handle its virulence. Ahead of delivering his Mid-Year Economic Fiscal Outlook report, Josh Frydenberg says state borders remaining open will be critical to maintaining Australia's economic recovery. Hope can be found in the data. ""Consumer confidence increased by 0.5 per cent last week driven by gains in Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia, which were substantially offset by a sharp decline in confidence in NSW,"" ANZ's latest consumer confidence survey showed. ""With Christmas just around the corner, 'time to buy a major household item' gained 2.2 per cent, more than making up for the decline last week."" The problem we now face is that over the past two years, we've become acutely aware that the world can change dramatically, fast. We've always known that. It's just that we'd prefer not to be reminded of it — especially in the lead up to Christmas.

109,analysis: Cryptocurrencies on a knife edge: Is this the slow decline of Bitcoin?,markets,"  Cryptocurrency bubble risks exposed by Bitcoin's recent slide They seem to be almost everywhere. Cool looking hipsters livin' the dream after amassing a fortune in the world of crypto. Social media sites are overflowing with them. Even old school glossy magazines, barely clinging to life, have dialled in with tales tall and not so true of the fabulous riches to be earned in the ether. There's no doubt they exist. Those that either got in early or built financial structures that facilitate trades which, none like to admit, replicate old style banks and broking houses, have socked away unimaginable riches. But what of the hoi polloi? How many newly arrived crypto traders, just for example, lost their life savings last weekend, when bitcoin and the crypto universe plummeted? Just like pokie addicts and those who frequent the track, the wins are talked up while the losses often are forgotten. The allure may be the same; the chance to strike it rich, big time. But, unlike ordinary gamblers, many crypto devotees have embraced what they believe is the future of finance with a kind of religious zealotry that insulates them from reality. Launched in 2009, Bitcoin was supposed to liberate ordinary citizens from the shackles of government and nation; an alternative, independent and truly global financial system. More than a decade later, however, and the faithful can't, or refuse to, recognise the ultimate irony. Instead of overthrowing traditional currencies, bitcoin and its 10,000 or so imitators are still priced in them. The devotees, even the famous and fabulously rich, measure their wealth not in BTC but in greenbacks, yen, pounds, euro and Aussie dollars. We all want it. We all need it. But precious few know how it truly works. Money, even good old fashioned notes and coins, is a complex and little understood phenomenon that relies on faith; that it is backed by real wealth and that it will be redeemed. Even then, there are competing theories as to how it operates, how it is created and how it is controlled and manipulated. At its most basic, it is a medium of exchange. And it usually is backed, either by the implicit promise of a government or some other store of wealth, like gold. Bitcoin was supposed to provide an alternative; an island of stability in a sea of nation-based fiat currencies that have become debased and diluted by governments, a system wracked by regular financial crises. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices have surged to dizzying heights since their creation amid the global financial crisis. We explain what's driving this, along with the pros and cons. Instead, bitcoin has become almost useless as a medium of exchange, given it is expensive and slow in transactions. But it is the extreme volatility that has rendered it truly unusable. A car dealer who accepted Bitcoin at $US68,000 a fortnight ago would have ended up nursing a mammoth loss last week. And if there is one thing the pandemic has proved, it has evolved into a purely speculative, high-risk plaything. Rather than a safe haven, which should appreciate during times of crisis, cryptocurrencies accentuate the economic wave. They soar in good times and collapse at the slightest hint of trouble. In the past year, that volatility has hit the steroids, transforming cryptocurrencies into an unstable and potentially lethal investment. As the price graph above shows, global stock and property markets — both of which have inflated enormously as interest rates have been cut to zero — have been relatively tame in comparison. That's attracted the suited and booted. Wall Street thrives on volatility and, in the past year, investment banks and global funds managers have begun dabbling in the crypto world. Even retail banks like the Commonwealth Bank have opened the door for customers to take a punt. But when banks of computers and algorithms enter the trading equation, the chance small-time players can trade their way to glory rapidly diminishes. Reserve Bank of Australia governor Phil Lowe is about as far removed from the world of grunge crypto as you could get. For years a critic of crypto, the RBA, like many major central banks, has nevertheless been exploring ways of applying the blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies for use in its own operations. Millions of Australians now regularly use digital wallets on their smartphones and, in a speech last Wednesday, Dr Lowe outlined several possible scenarios in which the RBA may issue and back digital ""tokens"" similar to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, in the same way it issues banknotes. But even that was a long shot, given our ""efficient, fast and convenient electronic payments system"". That wasn't all. He then launched a bazooka at the cryptocurrency crew when he let slip that the bank was open to the idea of allowing private players to issue an electronic dollar linked to the Australian dollar for retail users. But should that happen, it would need to be backed by high-quality assets like a bond. ""So, if privately issued stablecoins are ultimately the way things head, it will be crucial they meet very high standards,"" he said. Therein lies the biggest threat to the crypto crew. Having failed to take control of global finance, cryptocurrencies as they now stand may find themselves obsolete as the world's biggest central banks turn the tables and launch their own digital currencies. Digital currencies may be the ""inevitable future of money"" as one big crypto investor puts it, but it is highly likely they will be run by the very same central bank overlords that run global finance now. Any privately run currencies or tokens will find themselves heavily regulated and forced to play within the rules. For the second time in as many months, an Australian based crypto exchange, MyCryptoWallet, collapsed last week, leaving 20,000 investors stranded and most likely losing everything. BlockChainGlobal went under in October owing $23 million. Almost totally unregulated, investors use these exchanges to trade cryptocurrencies and usually leave their investment with the exchange for safekeeping. The alternative is to keep it yourself on a hard drive or some other form of technology that either can fail, be lost or forgotten. The overall value of cryptocurrencies now has surpassed $US3 trillion. That doesn't include the nefarious world of NFTs, non-fungible tokens, on anything from art to imaginary real estate and livestock. You can even put your imaginary paddocks up to agist imaginary horses for decent returns! If the whole thing unravels, the losses will be anything but imaginary. I don't know if Bitcoin is going to rule the world, and I don't want to bet that people will be willing to pay more for bitcoins in future than they do today. Little wonder central banks and governments are jittery and belatedly trying to rein the whole phenomenon in. More than 20 countries, including China, have banned bitcoin and many others, including Australia, are looking to impose regulations. In the event of a serious collapse in the value of these markets, there could be severe real-world economic consequences. But, given they freewheel outside the system, there is no safety mechanism or potential for a bailout. With the spectre of rising interest rates sending a cold shiver through high-risk asset markets, a shake-out in these overhyped, overvalued and overweight markets looks almost certain. And the repercussions could be far more serious than anyone anticipates.

110, How this property owner hopes to trade beachfront views for bitcoin,markets,"  Bitcoin buys beachfront views as a regional Queensland property hits market for cryptocurrency A large slice of tropical paradise bordering the Coral Sea has become one of the first properties in regional Queensland to be put up for sale for cryptocurrency. Aquila Cove, 100km south of Mackay, has been owned by the same family for generations and recently hit the market for 30 bitcoin or 440 ethereum. John De Costa, the owner of the 162-acre block of land, said he had been trying to sell the place on and off for five years for $2.2 million. At the present market rate, 30 bitcoins are equivalent to about $2,040,013. ""I think I've probably got more chance of getting a bitcoin sale than getting Aussie dollars,"" he said. ""We had people come a couple of weeks ago and look at it specifically because they hold bitcoin, and they believe in the bitcoin philosophy. ""They were looking for a property that offered them and their families a refuge from the world of COVID."" Mr De Costa is an account manager for a rural supply company, and it was his son who introduced him to the world of cryptocurrency. Last January, he said his son ""got lucky"", investing a few thousand of his savings into bitcoin when it crashed, which over the course of the next month tripled in value. ""He explained it to us, and we sort of agree with the philosophy of cryptocurrencies, and bitcoin in particular,"" Mr De Costa said. Antonia Mercorella, the chief executive of the Real Estate Institute of Queensland, said this was probably the first time she had seen a regional Queensland property being offered for sale in this way. Ms Mercorella said the infrastructure in place for property transactions was clearly based on Australian dollars. ""I don't think any of those processes are set up in a way to recognise bitcoin,"" she said. ""I would think that a prudent real estate practitioner if they're being asked to market a property in this way, you would be telling your vendor to seek legal advice about that."" Mr De Costa said he realised the use of crypto was not very common or widely understood in Australia, but he believed it was gaining momentum. ""Around the world, there's been a lot of bitcoin sales,"" he said. ""Teenagers are buying apartments in New York with bitcoin that they've mined and that sort of thing."" Mr De Costa said he suspected by using bitcoin, he would be able to attract an international buyer. ""For them to transfer bitcoin to me is a simple, low-cost, almost no-cost operation,"" he said. ""The actual transferring of the money is just instantaneous, and there are no third parties involved. ""Whereas for them to convert their currencies to Aussie dollars and pay all the fees and charges the bank is going to charge the transfer of that amount of money, there's that logistics advantage as well."" But like any sale, this one will involve negotiation. ""If the price of bitcoin drops to $20,000,  well obviously, our bitcoin price will have to go up,"" he said. Bitcoin is a digital method of decentralised payment where transactions are not verified by a central bank or authority, rather by a blockchain. They are stored in a digital wallet, and there is also a limited supply. University of Queensland Business School's Dr Christoph Breidbach said a digital wallet was essentially like an app on your phone. ""It has a unique identifier, the public key, and then there's also a private key,"" he said. ""With the keys, you can control the transfer of digital currency from one wallet to another."" Dr Breidbach said there was still a lot of novelty to transactions facilitated with cryptocurrency. ""There's only going to be 21 million bitcoin that will be available to humankind,"" he said. ""That means in a way you hedge yourself against inflation."" Dr Breidbach said one of the benefits of putting a property on the market for bitcoin was the publicity it generated. ""If I ever sell property, I might do it myself,"" Dr Breidbach said. He said the owner was fundamentally banking on the idea that the price of bitcoin would continue to increase. If that were the case, they would get a significantly greater monetary return than selling for Australian dollars. A record of the transaction is kept on the blockchain. Dr Breidbach said to the best of his knowledge, there were no legal restraints on selling a property for bitcoin. ""I mean, if you own a house, you could sell it for cocoa beans if you wanted to, or you could trade it against a grain,"" he said. Last week, the federal government announced plans to investigate a custody regime to protect consumers who trade in cryptocurrency. Dr Breidbach said conversations around decentralised finance were really about making the current financial system obsolete. ""It's a classic story of Blockbuster versus Netflix,"" he said. He said what may happen is the introduction of central bank-issued digital currencies. This is something Treasurer Josh Frydenberg hinted at this week. ""That would essentially mean a centralised digital currency run by a government, and that, of course, creates a whole bunch of issues and challenges,"" Dr Breidbach said. ""I hope we're not going to go down that road.""

111,Evergrande likely in default as debt deadline passes without payment,markets,"  Evergrande likely in default as debt deadline passes without payment Chinese developer Evergrande is edging closer to formal default, with reports suggesting that it has missed its final deadlines to pay some bondholders. Evergrande did not make payments on some $US bonds at the end of a month-long grace period, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters, setting the stage for a massive default by the world's most-indebted property developer. No-one who invested in two bonds — issued by China Evergrande Group's unit Scenery Journey Ltd — had received payment as of 1am AEDT on Wednesday, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters. Another four sources holding the bonds confirmed to Reuters that they had not received payment. All declined to be named because they were not authorised to talk to the media. Evergrande has not issued any communication to bondholders about the missed payment, one of the five sources said. ""From our point of view, it has been a question of when, not if [because of] the scale of the interest payments and then early next year redemption payments has made this [default] seemingly inevitable,"" said one bondholder, who declined to be named. Failure by Evergrande to make $US82.5 million ($116 million) in interest payments due last month would trigger cross-default on its roughly $US19 billion of international bonds and put the developer at risk of becoming China's biggest defaulter. Evergrande was once China's top property developer, with more than 1,300 real estate projects. However, with $US300 billion of debts and other liabilities, it is now at the heart of a property crisis in China this year that has crushed almost a dozen smaller firms. The 30-day grace period for a bond interest payment that Evergrande initially missed will expire this week. Adding to the crisis in China's once-bubbling property market, smaller developer Kaisa Group Holdings was also unlikely to meet its $US400 million offshore debt deadline on Tuesday, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said. Non-payment by Kaisa would push China's largest issuer of offshore debt among developers after Evergrande into technical default, triggering cross defaults on its offshore bonds totalling nearly $US12 billion. Evergrande did not respond to Reuters' request for comment. Kaisa, which in 2015 became the first Chinese developer to default on an offshore bond, declined to comment. Even in the case of a technical default, Kaisa and offshore bondholders could discuss forbearance terms, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. Kaisa said it was open to discussion on forbearance, without elaborating. Evergrande shares plunged nearly 20 per cent on Monday, while Kaisa shares lost around 11 per cent across Friday and Monday on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. However, both companies bounced back slightly yesterday, rising 1.1 per cent each. NAB's head of foreign exchange strategy, Ray Attrill, said markets reacted to the news of Evergrande's default with some perverse relief. ""News yesterday that Evergrande had missed the deadline for making a coupon payment on $US debt, and seemingly triggering a wave of cross-defaults, has been seen as more cathartic than troublesome,"" he noted. ""With this particular boil lanced, the process already looks to be underway for local authorities taking control of Evergrande — and soon, no doubt, other big developers — and doing what's necessary to protect domestic homebuyers and suppliers, in doing so, limiting broader contagion impacts."" That saw a broader rally for Hong Kong's Hang Seng share index, which climbed 2.7 per cent as China's central bank also eased some key policy settings. As speculation over Evergrande's future continues, there's a growing belief among analysts that the world's second biggest economy is heading for a slow wind-down that will be painful but predictable. The People's Bank of China lowered the required reserve ratio for most banks by 50 basis points, effectively allowing them to lend more at a lower cost, and instituted targeted rate cuts for certain borrowers. ""Neither of these moves, in isolation, constitutes a major loosening of monetary conditions, but we think that they signal a growing desire of policymakers to lower borrowing costs,"" wrote Oliver Allen from Capital Economics. However, Mr Allen warned that investors should not expect the Chinese government to simply reinflate the country's property bubble. ""In the past, turning points in China's 'credit cycle' seem to have preceded turnarounds in economic growth there, also often prompting strong gains in certain risky assets,"" he noted. ""That includes not only China's stock markets, but also industrial metals and those equity indices in many emerging markets in which commodity producers have a large weight. While jubilation flowed through Asian markets last week after China Evergrande narrowly stayed afloat, other Chinese developers are in major distress, spelling trouble for countries like Australia, writes Ian Verrender. ""This was the case following the Global Financial Crisis, China's growth slowdown in 2014-15, and the large stimulus [that] drove the economy's recovery after the COVID-19 shock early last year. ""However, we doubt that we are on the cusp of a turnaround of a similar scale. ""Unlike in most other economies, the authorities in China steer credit growth not only through influencing the price of credit, but also through various quantitative controls. ""We expect the PBOC to cut its policy rates soon. But we suspect that this will largely be aimed at lowering borrowing costs and reducing financing strains for many heavily indebted borrowers as the economy continues to slow. ""At the same time, we think that ongoing concerns about the extent of leverage within China's economy mean that the authorities there will not want to ease quantitative restrictions on credit growth substantially.""

112,"ASX edges higher after US stocks rebound, CSL slumps on Vifor takeover speculation ",markets,"  ASX edges higher, but gains limited as CSL slumps on Vifor takeover speculation The Australian share market has pared its gains amid worries about the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, with market heavyweight CSL plunging on takeover speculation. The market increased by nearly 1 per cent in the first hour of trade on Friday, after Wall Street rebounded from heavy losses. However, it fell into the red over lunchtime, before clawing back the losses. The All Ordinaries index ended up 0.1 per cent to 7,543, while the ASX 200 put on 0.2 per cent to 7,241. Most sectors ended higher, with oil and gas firms, banks and miners boosting the market, while health care firms led the falls as biotech CSL slumped by nearly 3 per cent. The best performers on the ASX 200 were radiology software firm Pro Medicus (+3.8pc) and investment firm Washington H Soul Pattinson (+3.3pc) and Corporate Travel Management (+3.1pc). All the big banks gained with NAB, ANZ and Westpac rising by more than 1 per cent. TPG Telecom slumped 8.6 per cent, the worst performer on the ASX 200, after founder David Teoh decided to sell 53.1 million shares, representing 3 per cent of the company. Also going down were technology firm Codan (-4.7pc) and online retailer Kogan (-4.2pc). The Australian dollar dipped 0.3 per cent to 70.73 US cents in afternoon trade, after new data showed that China's services industry expanded at a slower pace last month because of inflationary pressures and COVID-19 outbreaks. Vaccine-maker CSL refused to comment on media reports it was in talks to buy Swiss pharmaceutical firm Vifor Pharma Group for a reported $10 billion. In a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange, CSL said it noted the media speculation. ""CSL regularly assesses strategic opportunities that can improve its business, improve the health of people around the world and provide value to shareholders,"" it said. ""There is no certainty that any transaction will result from CSL's consideration of such opportunities and, if any transaction does result, when such a transaction would occur."" Vifor also refused to comment on the market speculation. ""Vifor Pharma Group systematically reviews options that can strengthen its market position and/or accelerate the growth of the company both organically and through partnerships and acquisitions."" CSL shares fell 2.5 per cent to $297.67. Vifor's shares surged by 21 per cent on the Swiss share market on the news. Global miner BHP said its board had approved a plan to scrap the company's dual-listed structure ahead of a shareholder vote on the proposal next month. In August,  the miner decided to simplify its corporate structure from two parent companies and two share prices, into one firm headquartered in Australia. BHP has traded on the stock exchanges in Australia and the United Kingdom since 2001, when it merged with Billiton. It will still trade on markets in Australia, London, New York and Johannesburg. BHP is the second-biggest company on the London Stock Exchange. ""The board believes that unification is in the best interest of shareholders."" ""It will result in a corporate structure that is simpler and more efficient, reduces duplication and streamlines BHP's governance and internal processes,"" BHP said. The company expects the corporate overhaul to be complete by the end of January, pending regulatory and shareholder approvals. As part of its corporate restructure, BHP is merging its oil and gas business with Woodside Petroleum. BHP shares increased 1.3 per cent to $40.23. Brent crude oil put on 1.8 per cent to $US70.94 a barrel, while spot gold rose 0.20 per cent to $US1772.45 an ounce at 4:20pm AEDT. US shares rallied, with aircraft maker Boeing surging after saying it had made progress in getting Chinese approval of its 737 MAX plane. China's aviation authority has issued an airworthiness directive on the aircraft that will help pave the way for the 737 MAX's return to service in China after two and a half years. China's aviation regulator was the first to ground the aircraft in 2019 after two deadly crashes. The market recovered ground lost yesterday, which saw a steep sell-off in the last hour of trade on worries about the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and the upcoming withdrawal of stimulus by the US central bank. Value stocks, economically sensitive smaller stocks and transport firms did the best, with travel and hospitality stocks also bouncing back. ""Obviously, there's concern about Omicron but there's a feeling that infections aren't as severe as initially thought,"" Oliver Pursche, from Wealthspire Advisors in New York, said. ""Second, economic data, particularly labour data, is coming out on the strong side."" The Dow Jones index rose 1.8 per cent, or 618 points, to 34,640, the S&P 500 rose 1.4 per cent, to 4,577, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.8 per cent, to 15,381. New claims for unemployment benefits increased less than expected last week and lay-offs fell to the lowest level in more than 28 years. Claims rose by 28,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the ending November 27. They dropped in the week before to 194,000, the lowest since 1969. That probably indicates people have found work in a tight labour market or exhausted their benefits. A US Chamber of Commerce survey showed many Americans who lost their jobs during the pandemic had not returned to work. There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of September. The total number of people receiving unemployment benefits was 2.31 million in mid-November. Investors will now turn to the latest official US unemployment figures, which are out tonight. Economists expect non-farm payrolls to have increased by 550,000 jobs last month, while the unemployment rate is expected to have fallen from 4.6 per cent to 4.5 per cent. European shares lost ground as countries ramped up restrictions to curb the spread of the Omicron variant. The FTSE 100 in London fell 0.6 per cent, to 7,129, the DAX in Germany fell 1.4 per cent, to 15,263, and the CAC 40 in Paris fell 1.3 per cent, to 6,796. Oil prices are higher, with Brent Crude up 1.9 per cent, to $US70.17 a barrel, while spot gold has fallen 0.8 per cent, to $US1,767.79 an ounce. OPEC and other major oil producers maintained their regular oil production increase of 400,000 barrels a day at a meeting overnight.

113,ASX regains some lost ground on takeover fight for Australian Pharmaceutical Industries,markets,"  Australian shares regained most of their losses helped by banks, as Woolworths launched a takeover bid for Australian Pharmaceutical Industries to rival a competing bid by Wesfarmers. The All Ordinaries fell nearly 1 per cent in the morning after Wall Street slumped in the last hour of trade on the news that COVID-19's Omicron variant had been detected in North America. By the close, the All Ordinaries index ended down 0.3 per cent, to 7,537, while the ASX 200 index fell 0.15 per cent, to 7,225. More sectors ended lower with technology, healthcare and miners leading the benchmark index down. But a rise in utilities, consumer firms and financial stocks limited the losses. Some of the best performers on the ASX 200 were engineering giant Worley Parsons (+6.1pc), plumbing giant GUD Holdings (+3pc) in a reverse of yesterday's losses, and power firm AGL Energy (+4pc). Buy now, pay later firm Afterpay slumped (-6.1pc) after it delayed an investor meeting until early next year to vote on its takeover by payments giant, Square, pending regulatory approval in Spain. Square announced it had changed its name to Block as it seeks to rebrand and expand. Also going down were fellow tech firms Netwealth Group (-6.5pc) and Xero (-5.1pc). National Australia Bank is the last of the big four banks to raised fixed-term mortgage rates above 2 per cent. Its shares rose 0.8 per cent. At 4:00pm AEDT, the Australian dollar was down 0.1 per cent to around 70.97 US cents, after falling more than 0.5 cents overnight. The Bureau of Statistics said Australia's trade surplus narrowed in October, amid lower iron ore prices, and new home loans fell 2.5 per cent, seasonally adjusted, in October. At 4:00pm AEDT, spot gold fell 0.4 per cent an ounce to $1776.49 an ounce and Brent crude oil rose 1.2pc to $US69.62 a barrel, amid a big sell-off this week. Woolworths has outbid Wesfarmers for Australian Pharmaceutical Industries. The supermarket chain has offered $872 million for API, compared to the $764 million offered by Wesfarmers in a scheme of arrangement, and said it was open to other takeover structures. Woolworth's offer is worth $1.75 a share. API — the parent company of Priceline, Soul Pattinson Chemists and the Pharmacist Advice brands — said the board had determined the Woolworths takeover bid was better than the Wesfarmer's bid and would open its books to Woolworths. ""The API Board notes that Woolworths has indicated it supports the current ownership provisions and location rules which ensure that community pharmacies are well distributed throughout the community,"" it told the ASX. Woolworths chief executive Brad Banducci said it was a compelling offer. ""Health and wellness is a large, fast growing category and API would be a fantastic addition to our food and everyday needs ecosystem."" However, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia questioned Woolworths' takeover bid. A spokesperson for the Guild said it was monitoring the bid and examining any possible implications for community pharmacies and patients. ""Why is a company with interests in the alcohol, tobacco, gambling and nightclub industries wanting to move into healthcare?"" the spokesperson asked. ""We look forward to having many conversations with the Woolworths team as well as with Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Leader of the Opposition Anthony Albanese on these important questions."" Last month, API signed a deal with Wesfarmers agreeing to its takeover bid. On the news of Woolworths' interest, API shares jumped 16.1 per cent to $1.74. Woolworths fell more than 1 per cent initially but ended up 0.4 per cent on yesterday's close, while Wesfarmers jumped 1.4 per cent. Former Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens is set to become the chairman of investment bank Macquarie Group when current chairman Peter Warne retires next year. Mr Stevens was appointed to Macquarie's board in November 2017 and chairs the board's risk committee. Macquarie shares increased 1.5 per cent. Disgraced casino operator Crown Resorts has again rejected a takeover offer from US private equity firm Blackstone. It said the $8.5 billion takeover bid of $12.50 a share was not high enough and was not  ""compelling value"" for investors. However, it did open its books to Blackstone to undertake due diligence so it could raise its takeover bid. ""The Crown Board has offered Blackstone the opportunity to access non-public information to allow Blackstone to undertake initial due diligence inquiries on a non-exclusive basis so it can formulate a revised proposal that adequately reflects the value of Crown,"" the company told the ASX. Crown shares rose 0.7 per cent, reversing their earlier fall. Premier Investments said retail sales rebounded last month as stores reopened in New South Wales, ACT, Victoria and New Zealand. Premier owns retail chains, including stationery seller Smiggle and fashion chain Portmans. ""Premier Retail was able to open all stores globally for the first time this financial year, with sales up 10.1 per cent on the same three weeks last year."" Premier said it had to close more than half of its stores around the world for significant periods of time because of government-mandated COVID-19 shutdowns. ""The Group  has lost over 42,000 trading days this financial year."" Sales for the 17 weeks to the end of November fell 3.5 per cent. Premier shares lost 0.8 per cent. Supermarket chain Coles Group fell 0.5 per cent after the Fair Work Ombudsman accused it of underpaying workers and launched legal action in the Federal Court. Stocks on Wall Street slumped in late trade in a volatile session with investors jittery about the latest COVID-19 variant, surging inflation and US Federal Reserve policy. The US Centers for Disease Control confirmed the first case of the Omicron COVID-19 variant had been detected in the country and that the person had returned from South Africa late last month. US central bank chief Jerome Powell said policymakers needed to be ready to respond to the possibility that inflation may not recede in the second half of next year as expected. New York Life Investments economist and portfolio strategist Lauren Goodwin said it was not surprising to see volatility as investors digested substantial uncertainties, including the lack of information on the Omicron variant and the latest signals from the Federal Reserve, which were both ""potentially, major changes in market expectations"". However, investors were also reacting to strong private payroll and purchasing managers' data which reminded investors ""that the economic and corporate backdrop for this market is really strong"". ""For many investors, this volatility is a buying opportunity,""  Ms Goodwin said. Figures showed that US manufacturing activity had picked up in November amid strong demand for goods, and private employers in the US hired 534,000 people with the latest official US unemployment figures out tomorrow. The positive data saw the S&P 500 rise by nearly 2 per cent at one stage during the session. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.3 per cent, to 34,022, the S&P 500 fell 1.2 per cent, to 4,513, and the Nasdaq fell 1.8 per cent, to 15,254. Utilities was the only sector to rise on the S&P 500 index, with the falls led by consumer and industrial stocks. Merck lost its gains, despite a panel of advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration narrowly voting to recommend the agency authorise the pharmaceutical company's antiviral pill to treat COVID-19. The World Health Organisation said it expected to have more information on the transmissibility of the Omicron variant within days, and that the agency believed the existing COVID-19 vaccines would work against the new variant. Over in Europe, stocks rebounded from the previous day's losses. In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 1.6 per cent, to 7,169, the DAX in Germany rose 2.5 per cent, to 15,473, and the CAC 40 in Paris put on 2.4 per cent, to 6,882. Oil prices lost their gains after weekly fuel stockpiles rose in the US. Brent Crude fell 0.3 per cent, to $US69.04 a barrel, and spot gold rose on concerns about Omicron to $US1779.37, up 0.3 per cent.

114,Stocks fall amid COVID-19 Omicron variant concerns ,markets,"  The Australian share market finished off its lows as the economy contracted by less than expected over the September quarter and despite worries about the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. The ASX 200 index dropped 0.3pc to 7,236, while the Australian dollar rose 0.6pc to 71.65 US cents at 4:30pm AEDT. The All Ordinaries index fell by nearly 1 per cent around midday just after the GDP data came out, as investors fretted about the increase in Omicron cases in Australia, and news that the US Federal Reserve was considering pulling back stimulus sooner than expected. But it pared those losses by the close and ended down 0.4 per cent to 7,558. The ASX 200 index dropped 0.3 per cent to 7,236 with nearly all sectors in the red, aside from miners. Among the losers were education stocks, consumer firms, utilities and real estate. The top movers on the benchmark index were miner South32 (+4pc), real estate investment trust Waypoint (+3.1pc) and rare earths miner Lynas (+2.7pc), which hit a record high. Iron ore miners rose on a rally in iron ore prices in futures trade. The worst performers were plumbing and car accessories firm GUD Holdings (-7.6pc) after a discounted share placement, radiology software firm Pro Medicus (-7.4pc) and IDP Education (-6pc). The Commonwealth Bank has finalised the sale of more than half of investment arm Colonial First State to US private equity giant KKR. It rose 0.8 per cent. ANZ acknowledged it was facing a class action in the Federal Court over alleged unfair contracts for credit card holders. ANZ shares pared their losses and fell 0.2 per cent to $26.64. Disgraced casino operator Crown Resorts announced that former Telstra boss Ziggy Switkowski was elected as chairman by the board. Crown shares fell 0.7 per cent to $10.94. The Australian dollar fell to 70.64 US cents overnight but gained ground to 71.65 US cents, up 0.6 per cent at 4:30pm AEDT,  after the latest GDP figures showed the Australian economy contracted by 1.9 per cent over the September quarter, much better than forecast. Spot gold tumbled by 5 per cent overnight to $US1,775.51 an ounce, but rose to $US1,779.68 in Asian trade. Brent crude oil slumped 4.1 per cent overnight to $US70.22 a barrel after vaccine maker Moderna cast doubt on whether coronavirus vaccines would work against the Omicron variant. It regained some lost ground in Asian trade to $US71.11 a barrel, up 2.7 per cent. Commonwealth Bank commodities analyst Vivek Dhar said China bought 2.8 million tonnes of Australian coal last month, the first official coal imports from Australia since November 2020. China imposed an unofficial ban on coal from Australia in October 2020 because of a diplomatic row. But Mr Dhar said last month's purchases appeared to be a pragmatic move, with the nation's power industry suffering a shortage and the Australian coal being bought from stockpiles at Chinese ports. Thermal coal at the Port of Newcastle fell 4.6 per cent to $152 a tonne. US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the risk of higher inflation had increased and the US central bank is considering winding down bond purchases earlier than forecast. In his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr Powell said the US central bank could revisit its plan to scale back bond purchases at its meeting in two weeks because of a strong economy and surging inflation. Mr Powell told the committee the US economy continued to strengthen, job growth remained robust and high inflation was expected to last longer than the US central bank expected. ""At this point, the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are high and it is therefore appropriate, in my view, to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases, which we actually announced at our November meeting, a few months sooner,"" he said. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York, said the Federal Reserve was being hawkish despite the emergence of the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus. ""Right now, there were some expectations that we'd hear a more dovish Federal Reserve, but we're not,"" he said. ""We're hearing a more hawkish Fed, but not that hawkish to the extent that people are betting that they'll raise rates sooner next year."" Mr Powell's comments weighed on markets that were already concerned about the Omicron variant. That's after Moderna's chief executive issued a warning about the effectiveness of COVID-19 shots against the strain. The vaccine maker's shares dropped 4.4 per cent, while Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell after it said its COVID-19 antibody treatment and other similar drugs could be less effective against Omicron. The Dow Jones index ended down 1.9 per cent to 34,484, the S&P 500 fell 1.9 per cent to 4,567, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.6 per cent to 15,538. The declines were broad based, with all the 11 major S&P sectors down, led lower by utilities, consumer firms, banks and energy stocks. The uncertainty has triggered fresh alarm at a time when supply chain logjams are weighing on economic recovery and central banks globally are contemplating a return to pre-pandemic monetary policy to tackle a surge in inflation. US consumer confidence slipped in November amid concerns about the rising cost of living and the COVID-19 pandemic. In Europe, inflation in the eurozone hit a record 4.9 per cent over the year to November. The FTSE 100 in London fell 0.7 per cent to 7,059, the DAX in Germany dropped 1.2 per cent to 15,100 and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 0.8 per cent to 6,721.

115,ASX takes a 1.7pc hit as Appen dives and travel stocks hit by Europe woes and COVID variant fears,markets,"  ASX takes a 1.7pc hit as Appen dives and travel stocks hit by Europe woes and COVID variant fears The Australian share market has lost almost 2 per cent on Friday, with travel stocks falling as lockdown woes re-emerge in Europe. At 10:45am AEDT, the ASX 200 was down 0.5 per cent. It ended the day down 1.7 per cent at 7,279. The day's biggest loser was Appen, which dived 18 per cent after Macquarie downgraded its rating from ""neutral"" to ""underperform"". The loss was the data company's biggest since August, when it posted lower profit than expected. The hardest hit sector was travel, including Qantas (-5.3pc), Corporate Travel Management (-5.9pc) and Flight Centre (7pc). Those stocks have been taking a hit this week because of increasing COVID restrictions in some parts of Europe and a worrying new COVID variant that has emerged in southern Africa, which have dampened expectations about a boom in global travel. Italy is currently tightening social distancing measures while Germany is holding off for now. But that did not hit the European markets overnight. The major indices there were all up around 0.3 per cent. Minutes from the European central bank meeting were in focus on markets there. ""Unsurprisingly, Governing Council members generally agreed that the ""hump"" in inflation will subside next year, although supply bottlenecks will last longer than originally anticipated,"" ANZ noted this morning. ""It is of the view that a sustained rise in price pressures will require more rapid wage growth."" On the flip side, miners included St Barbara, Evolution and Newcrest performed with gains of between 0.8 and 2.2 per cent. Wall Street was closed for US holidays.

116,"ASX closes up, ACCC allows NAB's Citi credit card takeover",markets,"  ASX closes up, ACCC allows NAB's Citi credit card takeover The Australian share market has closed slightly higher, after US investors were seemingly nonplussed over America's Black Friday sales boost. After spending most of Thursday slightly lower, the benchmark ASX 200 gained 0.1 per cent to close at 7,407. The broader All Ordinaries rose 0.1 per cent at 7,736. Miners and industrials boosted the main index and rose about 1 per cent on the back of strong iron ore prices. Tech stocks also did well. Financials dragged on the market. EML Payments soared 32 per cent after its Irish subsidiary was told it could take on new customers. Other stocks leading the gains were Nickel Mines (+6pc), Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation (+4.5pc), Technology One (+4.5pc) and Mineral Resources (+4.4pc). The worst-performing stocks on Thursday were AMP Limited (-4.7pc) and Kogan (-4pc), which copped a protest vote at its AGM from investors unhappy with the retailer's renumeration policies. It was also a bad day for Kelsian Group (-3.4pc), Bendigo and Adelaide Bank (-3.1pc), and A2 Milk Company (-2.4pc). The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will not block NAB’s takeover of Citi’s Australian consumer business. Citi is the fifth-largest issuer of credit cards in Australia, behind the big four banks, and was the first foreign bank to be granted a banking licence, in 1985. The deal will see NAB take on Citi's credit card, personal loans and wealth management services. The ACCC said NAB would continue to face competition from a range of suppliers of credit cards. “Credit cards continue to be an important product for consumers, despite increasing use of other unsecured lending products such as Buy Now, Pay Later,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said. ""However, market feedback suggested that Citi is not unique with respect to its credit card offering, and many different credit card providers remain for consumers. NAB today is smaller in credit cards than its major bank rivals, and we don’t consider adding Citi’s card operations to NAB will materially change the level of competition."" NAB stocks were down 0.6 per cent despite the good news. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 closed 0.23 per cent higher at 4,701.46, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 0.44 per cent to end trading at 15,845.23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost just 9.42 points and settled at 35,804. Retail stocks had mixed fortunes despite the US sales period known as Black Friday kicking off. The imported sales period has now begun in Australia too. Nordstrom and Gap both plunged more than 29 per cent and 24 per cent respectively after each reported weak quarterly reports. Both also warned of supply chain problems just ahead of Black Friday. Even the retail index was flat after US consumer spending data showed Americans had been spending more in October. This suggested consumers had already done their bargain-hunting ahead of the sales period. Meanwhile, inflation concerns are continuing in the US. The US dollar rose against currencies as investors mulled that the US Federal Reserve would indeed begin hiking rates sooner than expected to tackle record-breaking inflation.

117,"Commodities lead ASX up as tech tumbles, after Powell tapped for another term as Fed chair",markets,"  Commodities lead ASX up as tech tumbles on Jerome Powell's reappointment as Federal Reserve chair Australian shares have ended Tuesday higher, after Wall Street reacted to news that the US central bank will continue to be led by Jerome Powell. The ASX 200 traded increasingly higher as the day progressed, ending up 0.8 per cent, at 7,411 points. Top performers included Fortescue Metals, with a gain of almost 10 per cent. Other commodity stocks — including BHP, Champion Iron, Rio Tinto and Whitehaven Coal — all made gains of up to 8 per cent. That was despite a CBA briefing note which said the bank expected prices for Australia's four key commodity exports to fall. ""The first half of 2021 saw non-rural commodities rise strongly with the prices of Australia's four main commodity exports, iron ore, thermal coal, coking coal and LNG, all lifting,"" CBA noted. ""The second half of 2021 has seen some divergent trends with iron ore falling but coal and LNG rising sharply. ""A priority to reduce emissions in China, weakness in China's property sector and concerns around a colder than usual winter in the Northern Hemisphere are three of the key factors driving commodity prices at present."" Meanwhile, Bapcor ended the day down almost 10 per cent. Local tech stocks WiseTech Global, Megaport and Afterpay were down several per cent, following steep losses for US tech firms overnight. In the United States, the S&P500 briefly hit a new high on news of the Federal Reserve's chair Jerome Powell being nominated by President Joe Biden for another four-year term. However, it gave up those gains to close 0.3 per cent lower, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished fairly flat, up just 0.1 per cent. Lael Brainard, the Federal Reserve board member who was the other top candidate for the job, will be vice-chair, the White House said. “While there’s still more to be done, we’ve made remarkable progress over the last 10 months in getting Americans back to work and getting our economy moving again,"" Mr Biden said in comments emailed to reporters. ""That success is a testament to the economic agenda I’ve pursued and to the decisive action that the Federal Reserve has taken."" Mr Powell will need to be confirmed by the Senate, which is currently controlled by Mr Biden's Democratic Party but with a narrow majority. The news had investors rallying at the prospect of an earlier-than-expected US interest rate hike in 2022. The Federal Reserve had been sticking to a longer timeline, but concerns about rising inflation and a better-than-expected post-COVID recovery have seen sentiment from the central bank towards withdrawing stimulus harden. The payback on two-year Treasury yields hit a high, too. Bets on earlier rate rises saw the tech-heavy Nasdaq end 1.3 per cent down. Treasury yield rises hit big stocks such as Google and Amazon. Apple, however, rose 2 per cent. That was on news from analysts at JPMorgan that the tech company may be boosting supply of its new iPhone 13 in coming months.

118,Crypto has been deemed not halal in Indonesia. This is what it means for nearly 7 million investors,markets,"  Indonesian Muslim cryptocurrency enthusiasts find a way around Islamic fatwa Baca dalam Bahasa Indonesia Trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin has been declared forbidden for Muslims by the national council of Islamic scholars in Indonesia, as the popularity of digital currencies grows in the world's largest Muslim-majority country. During a recent online forum, Indonesia's quasi-governmental Ulama Council declared a fatwa, or a non-binding religious ruling, that cryptocurrency is haram — forbidden under Islamic law. An Ulama is a Muslim scholar who is recognised as having specialised knowledge in Islam. According to Islamic law, a transaction should follow certain requirements, such as having a physical form and definite value. ""Cryptocurrency as currency is forbidden because it has elements of uncertainty, harm and doesn't meet the Islamic requirement according to Shariah [law],"" KH Asrorun Niam Sholeh, the council's head of religious decrees, said in the forum. However, Mr Sholeh added that although cryptocurrencies as a currency is forbidden, it could be traded as a commodity or digital assets if they meet requirements. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices have surged to dizzying heights since their creation amid the global financial crisis. We explain what's driving this, along with the pros and cons. The council has served as an authority on Shariah compliance in Indonesia, but they have been criticised for other controversial fatwa. In 2018, it issued a fatwa raising concerns about a measles-rubella vaccine due to it containing traces of pork and human cells. The council also issues halal certificates — the opposite of haram — for food and other consumed products in the country. Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) is one of the world's biggest Islamic organisations with around 90 million members and followers. In October, its East Java branch also issued a fatwa declaring cryptocurrencies haram. Deputy Chairman of the East Java NU, Ahmad Fahrur Rozi, known as Gus Fahrur, told the ABC the fatwa was based on the results from a forum discussion of issues on Islamic jurisprudence. One of the conclusions that came from the discussion, attended by both crypto and Islamic legal experts, was that crypto trading tends to involve ""fraudulent practices and gambling"". ""Just like it's not allowed for a person to buy indistinct objects, like 'fishes in the sea' or 'birds in the air',"" Gus Fahrur told the ABC. He said cryptocurrencies was also similar to gambling because people speculate about the value without knowing the cause. Practices such as gambling are not allowed in Islam, since the value and price are indefinite and could financially and physiologically harm those involved. In comparison, he said stocks had a clear value and the price increased or decreased depending on the company’s performance. Because of the huge elements of speculation over the value of cryptocurrencies, they considered it ""inappropriate to be used as an investment instrument"", he said. ""It can increase by 1,000 per cent or 5,000 per cent, but it can also be zero. It's not an investment."" According to Indonesia's Ministry of Trade data, the number of crypto investors in the country had grown from 4 million people at the end of 2020, to 6.5 million people by the end of May 2021. It has exceeded the number of investors in the share market, which is around 2.4 million according to Bank Indonesia — the central bank. Putri Madarina, a certified financial planner and founder of Halal Vestor, a Shariah financial planner and education service in Jakarta, said the flourishing interest in crypto investing in Indonesia was partly due to social media, especially TikTok. It is spruiked as an ethical alternative, but Islamic banking has remained on the margins in Australia. A group of Muslim-Australians and industry veterans are behind efforts to change that. ""It is even booming during the COVID-19 pandemic, we are actually in the second wave of the crypto trend,"" Ms Madarina told the ABC, referring to the crypto boom three years ago. Ms Madarina has been investing in crypto since 2017 and said the Islamic decree hadn't deterred her from continuing to invest in crypto. ""What we bought is a digital commodity, like a collection that we consider valuable,"" she said. ""The price is driven by the higher appreciation from the people, like vintage cars."" She also considered crypto as a 'mal' — an Islamic term for property — which can take in many forms. ""So, as a medium of exchange, I think it's not a problem,"" said Ms Madarina, who is also a treasurer of an Islamic fintech association in Indonesia. ""As a property, I don't see any Islamic ruling being violated, unless it was made to be a means of deception, which is also an external factor that we can't control."" Ainun Najib is an Indonesian NU member based in Singapore who works in IT. He only started investing in cryptocurrencies in January 2021. He said he knew about the halal and haram controversy, but there was no official fatwa from any religious organisations at that time. He considered buying Bitcoin just like buying land or gold, but in a digital form which was protected by ""mathematically impenetrable encryption"". ""I initially intended [to keep bitcoin] as an asset, as my long-term savings. By long term, I'm talking about 10 to 20 years."" But in less than a year Mr Najib decided to release all his bitcoin assets worth $45,000 in total. ""Because of the fatwa [from NU East Java],"" he said, explaining the reasons behind his decision. He said although he understood the blockchain technology used in cryptocurrencies, for him the fatwa was an ""expert recommendation"", like how doctors recommend a patient with a high risk of cancer to quit smoking and drinking alcohol. He feels that given he has no knowledge on religious law, he needs to hand those decisions over to experts in the field, like the Kyai — an expert in Islam — or religious scholars. ""I am a Muslim. In the context of Islam, I follow the fatwa,"" he said. ""[But] it's our choice whether to follow it or not. But I think the right decision would be to follow it."" Cryptocurrency is still being discussed widely among Islamic scholars and institutions around the globe. In 2018, the Grand Mufti of Egypt banned Bitcoin trading as it was prone to risks for the traders due to the price fluctuations. Haitham al-Haddad, a British Muslim scholar, also considered cryptocurrencies not halal since it is a virtual currency with ""no tangible worth"". Similar views have also shared by individual Muslim scholars in countries such as Turkey, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia. After surging by 310,000 per cent, the value of a cryptocurrency, based on the popular Netflix show Squid Game, has crashed to $0 in what is likely to have been a ""rug pull"" scam. But others have taken the opposite view, including South Africa's Darul Uloom Zakariyya, Pakistan-based Shariah Adisory Muhammad Abu Bakar, and other Muslim scholars in Qatar and United Arab Emirates. Ms Madarina said cryptocurrency was such a ""hot topic"" in the Muslim world. She added the new Islamic decree would less likely impact the decisions of cryptocurrency investors, and instead be an ""an eye-opener"" for investors or those who are about to enter the market. ""The more people wanted to know whether it's halal or haram, the more they are going to learn about cryptocurrencies,"" she said. ""And I haven't seen yet a drop in numbers of interest."" Gus Fahrur said fatwa were not rigid and the views of Islamic scholars on crypto trading may change. ""The fatwa is dynamic. If [cryptocurrencies] no longer contain an element of speculation and … if there is an official regulation from the state which protects it from speculators, then we will have no issues."" He emphasised the fatwa at the moment was aimed at protecting the community. ""Everyone wants to make a profit, right? But please don't speculate,"" he said. ""What if cryptocurrencies collapse because they were not built on a valid and strong foundation, what will happen? ""That's why we have to be careful."" And for Mr Najib there is a possibility for him to get back into investing in cryptocurrencies in the future. ""When the expert changes [their] view, it's fine, we can also follow it again … if there is an updated fatwa, then I will follow it again.""

119,"ASX rises after four days of losses, BHP investors approve climate plan",markets,"  ASX  surges on higher commodity prices, BHP investors back climate plan and Woolworths' renewables pledge The Australian share market has recouped the week's losses and big miner BHP has won approval from investors for its plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The market surged more than 1 per cent during Friday's trade, after four days of losses, as iron ore and copper prices jumped as Chinese property giant Evergrande again managed to stave off default, with Beijing working behind the scenes to keep the heavily indebted property developer afloat. That saw iron ore prices rise above $US90 a tonne. By the close, the benchmark ASX 200 index came off its highs, but still rose 0.8 per cent to 7,443, while the broader All Ordinaries also increased 0.8 per cent to 7.766. Mining and oil stocks led the gains with nearly all sectors higher aside from the healthcare sector. Top stocks were building materials supplier James Hardie (+5.2pc), nickel miner IGO (+4.8pc), and Canadian focused iron ore miner Champion Iron (+4.7pc). Going down were Fisher & Paykel Healthcare (-3.2pc), mapping firm Nearmap (-2.9pc), and mining contractor Monadelphous Group (-2.9pc). The Australian dollar fell 0.14 per cent to 72.86 US cents at 4:30pm AEDT as the greenback rose to a 16-month high on the prospect of higher US interest rates following October's strong inflation data. Oil prices edged lower on the higher greenback with Brent crude oil at $US82.62 (-0.3pc) a barrel at 4:30am AEDT. Spot gold also fell slightly to at $US1,858.22 (-0.2pc) an ounce. Stronger iron ore and copper prices boosted mining giant BHP with its shares surging 2.8 per cent to $37.70. The company gained approval for its climate transition action plan, with 84.5 per cent of votes cast by Australian shareholders at its annual general meeting, in favour of the roadmap. Nearly 12 per cent of investors voted against the plan, with London shareholder advisory groups saying the roadmap lacked detail. The mining giant has promised to achieve net zero emissions in its operations, including steel mills and shipping companies, by 2050. BHP chairman Ken MacKenzie said the miner had clear goals and targets in place to combat global warming. ""BHP's climate action transition plans are well developed and … have been strongly endorsed by our shareholders,"" he said. This week, BHP said it would sell a stake in BHP Mitsui Coal, which mines coking coal in Queensland. Coking coal is used to make steel. It is still trying to sell its Mount Arthur thermal coal mine in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales and Mr Mackenzie conceded a sale was proving ""challenging"" and he said ""all options remained on the table"". Fortescue Metals Group last month set a 2040 target to achieve net zero customer emissions. Investor advisory group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) dubbed BHP's climate action plan ""a greenwash"". Dan Gocher, director of climate and environment at the ACCR accused BHP shareholders of rubber stamping a plan that was ""lacking in ambition"". ""Given BHP would have been expecting shareholder support to exceed 95 per cent, this level of opposition demonstrates that a significant number of shareholders expect BHP to go further,"" he said. ""This is the lowest 'Say On Climate' vote globally since the mechanism was introduced earlier this year. Even still, it is disappointing to see investors fail to match their words at COP26 with action."" Supermarket giant Woolworths has pledged to use only renewable power in its operations by 2025, becoming the largest Australian firm to join global renewable energy initiative RE100. The supermarket chain is one of the country's Australia's largest energy users, but is targeting ""net positive"" carbon emissions by at least 2050. RE100 is a global initiative bringing together the world's most influential businesses with combined revenue of $US6.6 trillion ($9.1 trillion) committed to renewable power. Woolworths said its commitment to RE100 would reduce emissions and create clean energy jobs across Australia. Chief executive Brad Banducci said the company used about 1 per cent of Australia's electricity. ""We're proud to be joining RE100 and contributing to the collective effort towards a greener future,"" he said. ""Moving to 100 per cent renewable electricity is the right thing to do, and something a growing number of our customers, team members and shareholders expect us to lead on."" Mr Banducci said Woolworths would invest tens of millions of dollar into renewable energy partnerships and new green energy projects. The retailer has installed a network of solar panels in more than 150 locations nationally and will sign agreements with wind and solar power firms. RE100 Australian coordinator Jon Dee said he was delighted Woolworths would join RE100. ""As Australia's largest retailer, Woolworths is demonstrating that renewable energy not only makes environmental sense, it makes business sense too,"" he said. ""With Woolworths joining RE100, we expect that this will trigger a domino effect across Australia, with many more businesses stepping up to transition to 100 per cent renewable electricity."" Woolworths has more than 3,000 stores across the country and employs more than 200,000 people serving 29 million customers every week. Nearly 270 companies have joined RE100 globally, including 14 companies in Australia worth almost $438 billion. Among them are Woolworths, Westpac, Suncorp, QBE, Macquarie, Atlassian and ANZ. Woolworths shares rose 0.7 per cent to $39.47. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq inched higher overnight, with chipmakers helping the indices resume their climb after hotter-than-expected inflation reports dampened investor sentiment and halted a streak of record closing highs. Walt Disney fell in the wake of a disappointing earnings report, dragged the Dow into the red. Oliver Pursche, senior-vice president at Wealthspire Advisors in New York, said the market was rebounding from yesterday's sell-off. ""This story has not changed much,"" he said. ""We're going to continue to make improvements in the economy, to have pretty strong earnings growth."" ""Yes, there are going to be COVID-related headwinds, but those are going to disappear."" The bond market was closed for Veterans Day. In the absence of economic data and with the third-quarter earnings season winding down, there were few catalysts to move markets in either direction. Investors favoured growth over value and economically sensitive smaller firms outperformed the broader market. With US inflation jumping last month, investors are worried the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, may raise interest rates sooner rather than later. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent 35,921, the S&P 500 edged up by 0.05 per cent to 4,649 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.5 per cent to 15,704. Miners led the gains on the S&P 500, while utilities led the fall. Shares of Walt Disney sank 7 per cent to $US162.23 and were the heaviest drag on the Dow following its disappointing earnings release, in which the media company reported shortfalls in streaming subscribers and theme park revenues. Electric car maker Rivian Automotive's shares jumped by one-fifth a day after closing 29 per cent above its offer price in its debut as a publicly traded company. Rival Lucid Group shares jumped by 9.6 per cent. But Tesla slipped 0.2 per cent following news that chief executive Elon Musk sold about $US5 billion ($6.9 billion) of the stock in the company over the last few days, following his infamous Twitter poll on whether he should shed 10 per cent of his shares in the firm he founded. European stocks gained some ground. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.6 per cent to 7,384, the DAX in Germany added 0.10 per cent to 16,083 and the CAC 40 in Paris gained 0.2 per cent to 7,060.

120,EV maker Rivian valued at more than Ford despite only having made 150 cars,markets,"  EV start-up Rivian valued at $US100b after Nasdaq debut Amazon-backed electric vehicle start-up Rivian is now worth more than Ford, after listing on the US stock market in the biggest initial public offering of the year so far. Shares of Rivian surged as much as 53 per cent on its Nasdaq debut on Wednesday, giving the EV maker a market valuation of more than $US100 billion. It was the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO) this year and made Rivian the second most valuable car manufacturer behind Tesla ($US1 trillion), and ahead of General Motors ($US86 billion) and Ford ($US65.96 billion). Ford is also an investor in Rivian and owns about a 13 per cent stake in the company. Amazon is the biggest shareholder, with a 20 per cent stake. Rivian is based in California and is building an electric SUV and ute fitted out with high-tech gadgets and ""vegan leather."" Other big Wall Street investors like BlackRock and T Rowe Price are also betting Rivian will be the next big player in the EV market, currently dominated by Tesla. Rivian's share price opened at $US106.75, soaring ahead of the offer price of $US78, and rose as high as $US119.46. The success of the IPO means Rivian has raised about $US12 billion to fund the company. So far the start-up has only delivered about 150 vehicles to customers. It also lost about $US1 billion this year. Surveys show Australians want to buy electric vehicles, but they continue to languish at less than 1 per cent of new car sales. What's going on? But with nations like the UK pledging to ban petrol cars, the fast-growing EV market has attracted interest from big-name investors. Ezra Beeman, managing director of Energeia, a consulting firm that has modelled Australia's electric vehicle market for government agencies, said light trucks and utes had been the missing link in the EV market. Mr Beeman said Rivian was a viable threat to Elon Musk's Tesla. ""I think it has got the lead. Tesla seems to have cracked the passenger car, but to date nobody has had a pick-up truck,"" he said. ""It's [Rivian] backed by one of the biggest manufacturers in the world [Ford], and it's got deeper pockets."" Gail Broadbent, a post-graduate researcher at the  University of New South Wales, said Rivian's debut was another sign the world was moving away from internal combustion engine cars. ""What it's saying is that we are moving forward and this is the future and we are leaving fossil fuels behind,"" she said. This week the federal government unveiled its electric vehicles policy, pledging to partner with the private sector to build 50,000 charging stations in Australian homes. But the long-awaited Future Fuels strategy does not include subsidies, tax incentives, sales targets or minimum fuel emission standards that would make electric vehicles more affordable, according to industry groups. Ms Broadbent said Australia's lack of policies to incentivise people to buy electric vehicles meant it would be last on the list for overseas car makers. ""Why would they still come here? We don't have the rules around emissions standards, they will supply other markets first,"" she said. ""We just have to move Australia forward. None of this looking backwards. And we just have to get on board and go along for the ride.""

121,Stocks fall as unemployment and US inflation rise,markets,"  ASX tumbles after national unemployment rate jumps above 5 per cent and US inflation surges The Australian share market has fallen for a fourth day, after the national unemployment rate jumped last month and US inflation soared. The All Ordinaries index lost 1.1pc to 7,655, the ASX 200 index fell 1.2pc to 7,337 and the Australian dollar was steady at 73.26 US cents The Bureau of Statistics said the jobless rate rose 0.6 per cent from 4.6 per cent in September to 5.2 per cent in October, on a seasonally adjusted basis with 46,000 jobs lost over the month. That came as more people looked for work ahead of coronavirus lockdowns easing. EY economist Jo Masters downplayed the figures because of the shortened survey period and said more recent data showed that the jobs market had improved. ""Today's labour force survey was not what many expected it to be, largely reflecting the timing of the survey, which took place earlier than normal because of the Census and the fact that fewer full-time workers took annual leave during recent school holidays. It's old news,"" she said. ""Higher frequency data sources like payrolls clearly show the labour market is back on track and recovering at a faster speed than following previous lockdowns."" The ASX opened lower after Wall Street slid as consumer prices surged in North America, with petrol and food prices fuelling US inflation and raising rate hike fears. By lunchtime the Australian market had fallen more than 1 per cent, with almost all sectors in the red aside from miners. But by the close, the market had come off its lows. The All Ordinaries index closed down 0.5 per cent to 7,701, while the ASX 200 index lost 0.6 per cent to 7,382 with all sectors in the red aside from miners. The Australian dollar fell further against a stronger greenback, down one-third of a percentage point to around 73.04 US cents at 4:30pm AEDT. Leading the falls on the ASX were oil stocks, after oil prices fell overnight because of a rise in US inventories. The best performers on the benchmark index were nickel miner Chalice Mining (+9.6pc), iron ore miner and green hydrogen company Fortescue Metals (+8.2pc), and gold miner Regis Resources (+5pc). Gold miners were among the gainers because the precious metal is seen as a hedge against inflation, with seven gold miners the top-performing stocks in the first 20 minutes of trade. The worst performers on the ASX 200 were aerial mapping firm Nearmap (-12.3pc), cloud services firm Xero (-6.2pc) which said half-year before-tax earnings fell one-fifth of a per cent, and buy now, pay later company Zip (-5.2pc). Private hospital operator Ramsay Healthcare fell 4 per cent to $69.38 after it said quarterly unaudited net profit slumped by nearly 40 per cent to $58.1 million. It said activity continued to be disrupted by COVID-19. Electrical poles and wires firm AusNet saw revenue fall for the half year. Net profit dropped by one fifth to $177.5 million and investors get an interim dividend of 4.75 cents a share. It said its takeover by Brookfield Asset Management was expected to be completed by February or March next year. AusNet shares fell 0.4 per cent to $2.58. Brent crude oil fell overnight to nearly 3 per cent to $US82.41 a barrel but it rose 0.3 per cent in Asian trade to $US82.85 a barrel. Spot gold put on one-fifth of a per cent to $US1852.88 an ounce. after the market closed, banking regulator APRA released its long-awaited framework for rules aimed at curbing risky lending by banks and protecting the country's financial system. US consumer prices rose 0.9 per cent in October, led by increases in meat, eggs, fish, vegetables, cereals and bakery products, petrol and the global supply chain squeeze. It was more expensive to eat out, but alcohol prices fell. Over the year to October, the US Consumer Price Index rose by 6.2 per cent, the biggest jump since 1990. Core inflation, a measure closely watched by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, gained 0.6 per cent over the quarter and 4.6 per cent over the year. The global energy crisis has seen Brent crude oil rise by nearly two thirds this year, although it slumped overnight. At Brent crude oil was down 2.8 per cent to around $US82.41 a barrel, while West Texas crude lost 3.6 per cent to $US81.15 a barrel. Westpac economist Imre Speizer said the rise in inflation was stronger than expected. ""The gains were led by an expected surge in energy prices, but there were additional large gains for new and used cars, tobacco, medical care, and food,"" he said. ""Supply chain disruptions are continuing to lift prices, and there are few signs that energy price pressures are abating."" The surge in price rises added to concerns that rampant inflation will push the Federal Reserve to raise official interest rates sooner rather than later. Inflation pressures are also brewing in the labour market, where an acute shortage of workers is driving wages higher. High inflation is eroding wage gains, adding to political risk for President Joe Biden, whose approval rating has been falling as Americans grow more anxious about the economy. Last week the Federal Reserve restated that high inflation was ""expected to be transitory"". Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics, said US inflation could stay high longer than previously estimated. ""Risks are clearly shifting toward US inflation remaining elevated longer than previously thought, but that doesn't mean that it's permanent,"" he said. ""The Fed could face a situation where higher consumer prices begin to weigh on consumer spending, reducing GDP growth."" The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits fell to a 20-month low last week, other data showed. Weekly jobless claims dropped by 4,000 to 267,000 initial claims for unemployment benefits. US shares extended their sell-off as investors worried that the rise in inflation could be here to stay. All major share indexes finished in the red. The Dow Jones index fell 0.7 per cent to 36,080, the S&P 500 lost 0.8 per cent to 4,645, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.7 per cent to 15,623. Tech stocks weighed down the index as they are dependent on low interest rates to expand. But electric vehicle maker Tesla rose more than 2 per cent at one stage, after big sell-offs this week on signals that founder Elon Musk will sell a big stake. Meta — the new name for Facebook — and Microsoft announced a partnership to integrate Workplace and Teams. Electric vehicle start-up Rivian made its public debut on the Nasdaq in a listing expected to raise more than $US100 billion ($136 billion). Its shares jumped 26 per cent to $US98.56 at 7:15am AEDT. Major indexes rose in Europe. In London, the FTSE 100 rose 0.9 per cent to 7,340, the DAX in Germany put on 0.2 per cent to 16,068, and the CAC 40 in Paris increased slightly to 7,045. Iron ore prices fell, with iron ore at Dalian port in China falling to a one-year low on a gloomy outlook for Chinese demand. At Qingdao port in China, benchmark iron ore prices were down 2.5 per cent to $US88.60 a tonne.

122, ASX loses gains and consumers expect jobs market to boom,markets,"  ASX runs out of steam and consumer confidence rises with unemployment expected to fall The Australian share market has lost its gains and Australians are more confident about their job prospects, with expectations of a rise in unemployment at their lowest in nearly three decades. The latest Westpac Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment found more people expected the unemployment rate to fall than rise over the next 12 months. The Unemployment Expectations Index dropped 11 per cent from 107.1 to 95.3 over the month, the lowest level since 1994. Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said this was the lowest level for the index since the mid-1990s, when strong growth sparked sustained falls in unemployment from the very high levels seen during the recession of the early 1990s. Confidence for both women and men is at record highs, with workers in real estate, accommodation, food, media, telecommunications, healthcare and retail the most optimistic about the jobs market. ""This may be an indication of where labour shortages are likely to emerge in coming months,"" Mr Evans said. The unemployment numbers for October are out tomorrow and market economists forecast the unemployment rate will rise from 4.6 per cent in September to 4.8 per cent last month. Overall there was little change in consumer confidence, with the index increasing by 0.6 per cent from October to November — almost the same level as the same time last year. The latest payrolls and wages data from the Bureau of Statistics showed that jobs rose by 1.3 per cent over the fortnight to October 16, 2021, after a fall in the last half of September. The ABS said payrolls jobs increased through the first half of October as lockdowns and other restrictions eased, with employment in New South Wales doing the best as payroll jobs surged by 3.5 per cent. The Australian share market gave up its gains to end lower for the third day in a row after producer prices in China surged. By the close, the All Ordinaries index lost 0.24 per cent to 7,737, and the ASX 200 index dipped 0.14 per cent to 7,424. More sectors ended lower than higher with miners and energy stocks leading the falls. Going up were utilities, banks, technology and real estate firms. Nickel miner Chalice Mining was up 4.9 per cent on the ASX 200, followed by brewer United Malt (4.6pc) and National Australia Bank (+4.4pc). Losing ground were steelmaker BlueScope Steel (-5.8pc), lithium miner Orocobre (-4.7pc), aerial mapping firm Nearmap (-4.9pc). Prices at the farm and factory gate in China surged to the highest level in nearly three decades, partly because of the global supply chain squeeze. The producer price index for October jumped 13.5 per cent from the same time a year ago, the highest level in 26 years. Consumer prices rose 1.5 per cent over the year to October, up from a 0.7 per cent rise in September, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. That was slightly higher than predicted by economists. Worries about the solvency of Chinese property developers weighed on Asian shares, ahead of a deadline for cash-strapped China Evergrande Group to make a bond coupon payment. Evergrande is the world's most indebted property developer, owing more than $US300 billion. But so far the Chinese real estate giant has avoided a formal default. However, an overdue bond payment of $US148 million is due today. In afternoon trade, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong and the Shanghai Composite index both lost about 1 per cent of their value. Off the back of a new green bonds scheme, iron ore miner and emerging renewable energy firm Fortescue Metals has inked a green hydrogen supply deal with US-based Universal Hydrogen. Under the deal, FMG's Fortescue Futures Industries will supply green hydrogen to the aviation industry until 2035. FFI chief executive officer Julie Shuttleworth AM said demand for green hydrogen in the aviation industry was forecast to surge as new climate targets were set globally. ""This deal reinforces that green hydrogen has the potential to be a powerful fuel for a range of difficult-to-decarbonise industries, including aviation,"" Ms Shuttleworth said. FFI holds a stake in Universal Hydrogen. Last week it signed multi-billion-dollar deals with two UK companies to supply green hydrogen, which FFI said made it the UK's biggest supplier. And Rio Tinto will partner with a US not-for-profit group. Resolve, to set up a firm to clean up mine sites. The global miner will invest $2 million in Regeneration, which will process minerals from mine waste to raise money to fund mine closures and habitat restoration. It can cost billions of dollars to clean up mines and restore the landscape. Weaker iron ore prices saw FMG fall 2.1 per cent to $14.28 and Rio Tinto lost 1.7 per cent to $87.51. The Australian dollar had dropped nearly 0.3 per cent to around 73.55 US cents by 4:50pm AEDT. All three major US stock indexes lost ground with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq snapping their run of eight record closing highs in a row. The labour department's producer prices (PPI) report showed inflation continued to gather heat as ongoing goods and labour supply challenges sent price growth soaring. Investors are also looking to tomorrow's consumer price index report for clues regarding the extent to which producer prices are being passed along to the consumers. Jay Hatfield, chief executive of InfraCap Advisors in New York, said investors were selling shares at a high to make profits. ""It's a risk-off day,"" he said. ""After PPI today and with CPI tomorrow, it's reasonable that we take a pause. Earnings season is nearly over and we're at all-time highs."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 167 points or 0.5 per cent to 36,265, the S&P 500 lost 0.4 per cent to 4,683 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6 per cent to 15,886. General Electric surged 2.5 per cent after the 129-year-old industrial conglomerate announced it would split into three separate public companies to simplify its business. The split marks the end of the conglomerate, once the most valuable US company and a symbol of US industrial might. General Electric shares rose 2.6 per cent on the news. Tesla plunged nearly 12 per cent, weighing down the consumer discretionary sector and extending losses, after chief executive Elon Musk's Twitter poll proposing to sell a tenth of his holdings garnered a 57.9 per cent vote in favour of the sale. Mr Musk's move raised questions as to whether he violated a settlement with the US corporate regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission. Shares of Robinhood Markets dropped 3.4 per cent after the online retail trading app reported a security breach affecting about 5 million of its customers. Major European markets ended in the red. In London, the FTSE 100 index lost 0.4 per cent to 7,274, the DAX in Germany was flat at 16,041, down 0.04 per cent, while the CAC 40 in Paris fell 0.06 per cent to 7,044.

The All Ordinaries index has dropped 0.15pc to 7,756, while the ASX 200 index has lost 0.24pc to 7,434 The Dow Jones index has risen 0.3pc to 36,424, S&P 500 has risen 0.2pc to 4,706 and the Nasdaq Composite has risen 0.25pc to 16,012 NAB has seen 2021 cash earnings jump by 77pc to $6.56 billion, net profit for 2021 rose 149pc to $6.36 billion The last of the big four banks to report its profits, NAB saw its cash earnings jump by just over three-quarters to $6.56 billion in 2021, better than predicted by analysts. Net profit for 2021 rose 149 per cent to $6.36 billion. The big profit surge came as the bank wrote back the billions of dollars it had set aside to cover loan losses from COVID-19. NAB chief executive Ross McEwan said it was a difficult year, with revenue declining by more than 2 per cent because of lower income from its Markets and Treasury divisions, although expenses fell by 13.2 per cent. ""Our results this year demonstrate we have navigated a challenging environment well while delivering better experiences for customers and colleagues, resulting in safe growth across our business,"" he said. ""While some uncertainties exist in the outlook including the impact of tapering support … we are well positioned for the expected economic rebound in Australia and New Zealand,"" he said. Profit margins from interest incomes slipped six basis points because of low interest rates, which reduced income from lending, and a shift towards fixed rate loans. Investors get a dividend payout of 67 cents a share, fully franked. That takes the full-year dividend payout to $1.27 per share, fully franked, up $0.67 from 2020. National Australia Bank shares gave up their gains and were down 2.2 per cent to $28.47 at lunchtime. Pressure from environmental activist groups have forced NAB to introduce limits on oil and gas lending. Mr McEwan said a review of fossil fuel lending policies had led to a new cap on oil and gas ""at default"" exposures of $2.5 billion to 2025, and reductions after that to be aligned with the International Energy Agency by 2050. ""We've had a number of very strong activist groups say to us, we want you to abide by the IEA. Actually, we think that's the right thing to do and that's what we've actually done,"" Mr McEwan said. NAB, which is also being targeted by activists for financing gas projects in Australia, said it would limit its ""direct"" funding to projects that played a role in national energy security. The bank will not directly finance greenfield gas extraction projects outside Australia, but it will continue to finance integrated liquefied natural gas in Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and other selected regions. ""The new policy contains so many allowances and loopholes that it's unclear how it will materially impact the bank's lending for new fossil fuel developments moving forward,"" environmental campaigner group Market Forces said. EY Region Banking and Capital Markets leader, Oceania, Tim Dring said the impact of global warming could not be ignored by major financial institutions. ""Climate change risk is also high on the agenda in the wake of COP26, particularly as the major banks participate in the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's (APRA's) first climate vulnerability exercise assessment,"" Mr Dring said. An analysis by accounting giant EY found the combined headline cash earnings for the four major banks was $26.8 billion in 2021, an increase of 55 per cent or $9.5 billion on last year as banks rebounded from the coronavirus recession. Credit impairment charges decreased 107 per cent compared to last year for a write-back of $0.8 billion. Mr Dring said bank earnings had rebounded, but revenue and profitability remained under pressure. ""Across the big four banks, key measures of asset quality remain resilient, with bad debt charges lower due to provision releases and low levels of write-offs,"" he said. ""While deferrals remain significantly lower than they were at the height of the COVID-19 crisis in mid-2020, the banks will need to keep a close eye on this in the coming months, with the recent lockdowns in Victoria and New South Wales likely to have put increased pressure on borrowers who were already facing repayment difficulty."" EY said strong borrower demand and low interest rates drove strong demand for home loans over the past year, with mortgage lending growth almost doubling over the 12 months to September. Mr Dring said competition for home loan market share was intense between lenders. ""Not all the major banks have benefited equally from the surge in housing credit, with strong competition and volume-processing challenges resulting in a marked divergence in home loan performance between individual banks,"" he said. ANZ said spending has returned to pre-Delta levels for the first time since lockdowns were imposed along much of Australia's east coast in July. Spending was boosted by the reopening of retail and travel in NSW and Victoria, with  Victoria leading the way in non-food retailing, and a return to the national average for dining and shopping in New South Wales. Accommodation spending in regional NSW rose from a low of 15 per cent of its pre-Delta level in the last week of 26 August to a full rebound in the first week of November after travel restrictions within the state were lifted. The lifting of restrictions helped increase spending on eating out in regional NSW, which is now at 90 per cent of pre-Delta levels. The Australian dollar lost most of its gains in morning trade, down 0.24 per cent to 74.03 US cents at 12pm AEDT. But crypto currencies were on a roll, with bitcoin sometimes seen as a hedge against inflation ahead of the latest US and Chinese inflation data out later this week. Bitcoin jumped past $US68,000 per digital coin for the first time in Asian trade, and Ethereum also set a record high of above $US4,820. At 4:45pm AEDT, bitcoin was up 4.1 per cent to $US68,045 and ethereum rose 2 per cent to $US4,822.28 according to Coindesk. Both currencies have more than doubled in value since June and are up by more than two-thirds against the greenback since the start of October. The market value of crypto currencies is more than $US3 trillion according to crypto price and data aggregator CoinGecko. The Australian share market was weighed down by the banks with the NAB losing 0.8 per cent to $28.89 despite more than doubling its statutory profit and final dividend. Stocks lost their gains and by the close the All Ordinaries index fell 0.15 per cent to 7,756. The ASX 200 index lost 0.24 per cent or 18 points to 7,434 with more sectors in the red, led lower by oil and financial stocks. Going up were education firms, miners and healthcare stocks. Top performers were base metals miner Chalice Mining (+29pc) which soared after it announced the biggest nickel sulphide discovery in more than 20 years in Western Australia, followed by rare earths miner Lynas (7.6pc) and bookmaker Pointsbet (6.3pc). Some of the worst performers on the ASX 200 were poultry producer Inghams (-4.5pc), building materials firm CSR (-4,1pc), AGL Energy (-2.9pc) and gold miner Newcrest Mining (-1,6pc) after it bought Canadian miner Petrium. Building materials supplier James Hardie saw net profit jump 182 per cent from $US96.2 million to $US271.5 million for the half-year thanks to record quarterly sales. Investors get a first-half interim dividend of $US0.40 cents per share. Its shares fell 0.7 per cent to $53.94 in afternoon trade. Fujitsu Australia is the latest company to require all people entering its workplaces, including data centres, warehouses and offices, or attending a Fujitsu work related event be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The policy will allow exemptions on a case by case basis and the policy will take effect at the end of the month. The Dow Jones index hit a new record high on Wall Street in the wake of US President Joe Biden's $US1 trillion ($1.34 trillion) infrastructure bill passing the US Congress. Sentiment was also boosted by positive US employment numbers on Friday. The latest US and Chinese inflation figures will be out later this week. Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in the US, said the market was looking at several factors: ""The positive earnings environment, the COVID Delta variant has lessened, we're getting this infrastructure spending bill and we've gotten through questions about what the Federal Reserve is going to do, with tapering."" ""That's what helped propel the market to this point, and as we move to December, the question becomes where to invest in 2022,"" he said. The passage of the infrastructure bill saw oil prices extend their rally, even though a broader social safety net plan has not been passed. Data out over the weekend also showed China's exports beat forecasts in October to deliver a record trade surplus, although weaker than expected imports added to evidence of a slowdown in domestic demand. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record high on Monday. It closed up 0.3 per cent to 36,424. The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 4,706 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.25 per cent to 16,012. Tesla fell 3.3 per cent after CEO Elon Musk tweeted on Saturday he would sell 10 per cent of his holdings if Twitter users approved the plan. ""The majority voted for him to sell, which effectively signals that he is going to dump stock on the market,"" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said. In Europe, major markets were mixed. The FTSE 100 in London ended flat, down 0.05 per cent to 7,300, the DAX in Germany fell 0.05 per cent to 16,047, and the CAC 40 in Paris rose 0.1 per cent to 7,047. Oil prices firmed as the passage of the US infrastructure bill and China's export growth supported the outlook for energy demand, while Saudi Arabia's state-owned producer, Aramco, raised the official selling price for its crude. West Texas crude oil rose 1.1 per cent to $US82.15 per barrel while Brent gained the same percentage to $US83.64 a barrel. Spot gold added 0.5 per cent to $US1,825.06 an ounce.

124,"CBA pleads guilty to selling customers 'junk' insurance, while Crown settles class action",markets,"  CBA pleads guilty to selling customers 'junk' insurance, while Crown settles class action The Australian share market is wrapping up a week of trade with Commonwealth Bank admitting to selling more than 150 customers dud insurance and Crown Casino settling a class action against it. CBA has pleaded guilty to 30 criminal charges against it for making false or misleading representations over consumer credit insurance (CCI). CCI is often dubbed 'junk insurance' and it has been an endemic problem in the financial sector for years. The action was brought against CBA by the corporate regulator ASIC. “We no longer sell these products and the 165 customers who are the subject of these proceedings have been sent compensation,"" the bank said in a statement. ""We reiterate our apology to customers who were affected by these issues. This conduct was unacceptable.” The bank had already joined 10 other financial institutions in stumping up $380 million for 825,400 customers as part of a major remediation program implemented by ASIC after the banking royal commission. Scores of people nationally are clawing back hundreds of millions in cash from the finance sector after paying for so-called ""junk"" insurance. It comes as new federal reforms are implemented to curtail the sale of the financial product. CBA is also being pursued as part of a class against over CCI, along with ANZ and Westpac. NAB has already settled. Westpac's also being pursued by ASIC over this sort of insurance. CBA's stock closed down 2 per cent. Meanwhile, Crown announced on Friday that it had settled a class action against it for $125 million. The action was brought against the casino operator by shareholders, after the company's stock plunged in 2016 amid revelations employees were arrested in China for promoting illegal gambling. Crown's Melbourne casino licence is effectively on a two-year probation, but the fallout from its wrongdoing could have been so much more severe. Crown said the settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing. It also said its insurance might cover some of the payout costs. It came just days after it was revealed Crown would keep its operating licence in Victoria despite a royal commission into its operations finding its behaviour had been ""disgraceful"". Crown's stock has only been on the up all week after its escape. It is now coming off that high with a loss of 1.5 per cent on Friday, yet is still ended the week up 2.9 per cent. The ASX 200 started the day in muted territory and things only got worse as the day went on. It closed down 1.4 per cent as the Reserve Bank waved a white flag on government bonds. Overall, the ASX 200 ended the week down 1.3 per cent. The Reserve Bank again fails to defend its 0.1 per cent bond yield target and that means interest rates could be rising sooner than previously expected. The top performers included Reece (+5.6pc) and Pilbara Metals, JB Hi-Fi and Resmed, all with gains around 4.5 per cent. Champion Iron was also up 2.3 per cent. That was after Citi forecast that its September quarter was marginally ahead of expectations, with its iron ore concentrates up 5 per cent on estimates. Mining stocks fared badly on Friday, as commodity prices hit shares. Perseus, Chalice and Ramelius took hits of between 1 and 3 per cent. The website Carsales ended down 3 per cent after its annual general meeting. The platform for people to upload cars for sale takes money off listings and commission, and it noted during its presentation that ongoing car shortages were hitting revenue. ""Reduction in revenue reflects a challenging OEM advertising environment due to the significant reduction in new car sales in H1 an OEM supply constraints,"" it said. ""New car sales remain below historical levels due to supply chain challenges and semi-conductor chip shortages."" Yet there was a silver lining - the strong demand for used cars during COVID has seen it boost takings through dealerships. ""This has translated into improved dealer profitability outcomes."" It noted it was trying to diversify by pushing further into finance, insurance and non-car markets. It's not just Australian companies battling stock issues. Apple has revealed that supply chain woes have cost it roughly $US6 billion ($7.95 billion) in sales in its last quarter. What do you get when you combine the huge surge in demand for consumer electronics that we've seen over the past year, with snowstorms in Texas and a drought in Taiwan? Chipageddon. The company's chief executive Tim Cook said that the impact will be even worse during the current holiday sales period. He told global media that was caused  by ""larger than expected supply constraints"" as well as pandemic-related manufacturing disruptions in South-East Asia. While Apple had seen ""significant improvement"" by late October in those facilities, the chip shortage has persisted and is now affecting ""most of our products"", he said. ""We're doing everything we can do to get more [chips] and also everything we can do operationally to make sure we're moving just as fast as possible,"" he added. While Apple's shares did close higher, they have since slumped in after-hours trade. Both the S&P and Nasdaq closed at record highs on Wall Street. Solid results from companies, including Caterpillar and Merck, helped ease concerns about slowing economic growth denting profits. US Treasury yields also rose, despite fresh economic data there that was not as rosy as hoped. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar is higher against the greenback at 74.50 US cents. ""Yesterday, AUD largely ignored the commotion in the bond market as markets continued to rapidly price in a more aggressive rate hike cycle,"" ANZ noted. ""Today, focus will once again be on whether the Reserve Bank of Australia defends its 0.1 per cent yield target on the April 24 bond."" ""Our CBA Economics team now expect the RBA will exit yield curve control (and therefore the 2024 cash rate guidance) at its May 2022 Board meeting because rapid vaccination has improved the economic outlook. ""But the risk is the RBA moves as soon as the November Board meeting next week."" Over in Europe, its central bank has left policy settings unchanged after a meeting overnight. NAB is speculating it will start formally confirming setting changes at its December meeting.

125,"ANZ profit soars on home loan boom, while ASX follows Wall Street down",markets,"  ANZ profit soars on home loan boom, while ASX follows Wall Street down The Australian share market has followed Wall Street down on Thursday, as inflation woes and commodity prices worry investors. The ASX 200 had a shaky day on Wednesday, amid news that inflation was rising. It eventually ended flat. The benchmark had lost 0.4 per cent on open but recovered some ground by midday. It ended the day 0.3 per cent down. The major losers include miners and other cyclical stocks, following a trend on Wall Street that hit these sectors, too. Champion Iron was down 4.7 per cent, Mineral Resources down 1.9 per cent, and Alumina had lost 4.7 per cent. Crown has stopped making gains, two days after it was announced the casino operator was unlikely to lose its licence in Victoria. It ended down 1.8 per cent on Thursday. However, it has still overall gained around 7 per cent this week. On the flip side, ANZ was up 0.8 per cent after releasing its annual results. Its profit is up 72 per cent to $6.1 billion. The bank's chief executive, Shayne Elliott, said some of that growth was due to growth in home loans during the COVID property boom. ""Home loan revenue growth was in the low double digits,"" he said. ""Home loans grew 11 per cent while still taking proactive steps to bring balance to the housing market, such as lifting the deposit required for investor lending. ""However, second-half volumes were impacted by a competitive refinancing market, customers paying down their loans faster and processing issues."" Boral had also gained 4.6 per cent while JB Hi-Fi was up 3.3 per cent. The Australian share market's downer mood on Thursday follows mixed fortunes on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 being dragged lower by oil prices and a pullback in Treasury yields. But the big news was out of Canada, where its central bank made some surprising statements. The Bank of Canada signalled that its rates could rise as early as April 2022. It's also ending quantitative easing or bond buying. That was due to what it said was robust economic growth, high vaccination rates, and strong employment gains as the pandemic eases. ""There is an outside chance of a hike in January 2022,"" ANZ notes. The local currency is relatively stable against the greenback, after a spike yesterday when Australia's inflation data was announced. That was due to investors betting interest rates would rise sooner than expected. ""AUD/USD is roughly unchanged just above 0.75 after yesterday's CPI induced volatility,"" ANZ notes. ""Underlying inflation was stronger than both the RBA and the market expected. ""In our view, the RBA will need to see evidence of accelerating wages growth before revising up their inflation forecast or shift their forward guidance on the cash rate."" The European Central Bank meets on Thursday and is expected to take a dovish stance. The German government cut its 2021 growth forecast for this year, as supply bottlenecks for semiconductors and rising energy costs delay recovery in Europe's largest economy. Germany's 10-year bond yield fell to its lowest in more than a week and its yield curve flattened.

126,"Australian dollar jumps on inflation surge, ASX closes flat",markets,"  Australian dollar jumps on inflation surge, ASX closes flat After struggling for direction for most of its day, the Australian market finished trading flat as investors mulled the possibility of interest rate hikes happening sooner, rather than later. The ASX 200 gained 5 points (or 0.1 per cent) to close at 7,449. The broader All Ordinaries index slipped by just 1 point to end at 7,758. Despite starting its day higher, the local share market fell into negative territory after the ABS released its September quarter inflation figures. The data showed that consumer prices jumped by a 2.1 per cent (on an underlying basis) over the past year — its highest level since 2015. This caused the Australian dollar to spike as high as 75.35 US cents (up 0.4 per cent), wirth traders increasingly betting the Reserve Bank will be forced to announce a rate hike before 2024. By 4:30pm AEDT, the local currency was buying 75.16 US cents. ""Markets are now pricing a cash rate of around 1 per cent by the end of 2022, compared to 0.6 per cent before the CPI [consumer price index] print,"" said Commonweal Bank currency strategist Kim Mundy. ""Markets are now fully pricing the first hike by May 2022. Despite the upward inflation surprise, we still believe markets are pricing rate hikes too soon. ""In our view, it will take more to move the RBA's view on inflation. Notably, the RBA will need to see evidence of a lift in wages growth before they make any major surgery to their profile for underlying inflation."" A2 Milk was one of today's worst performing stocks, after it lost 12 per cent (to $6.03). This was after the company said its instant milk formula sales in China were expected to be significantly lower in the first half of the current financial year. It said it is considering opportunities for sales growth of other products in China, Australia and the US, as well as assessing opportunities in new emerging markets. Woolworths' share price fell by 3.2 per cent after the supermarket chain released its quarterly results. The company flagged that consumer spending was slowing down as COVID lockdowns lifted. Shares in Woolworths and its rival Coles have been booming as stuck-at-home Australians cook from home. ""This has arguably been one of the most challenging quarters for our business since the onset of COVID-19,"" chief executive Brad Banducci said on an analyst call. ""We have changed the way we live, even when we're not in lockdown. (Overseas) we've seen elevated home consumption even in the time post the lockdown."" He added that Woolworths would rely more than usual on a pick-up in the year-end holiday season trading. Wall Street closed modestly higher overnight. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 hit fresh records, however gains were subdued as Facebook shares fell in the wake of its quarterly earnings. Facebook was the biggest drag after the company warned Apple that new privacy changes would weigh on its digital business. However, the benchmark S&P index scored a new high, lifted by names with big market capitalisations. Nvidia Corp closed at a record high, while Amazon and Apple also rose.

The Nasdaq — which includes Tesla's stock — closed 0.9 per cent higher, while the other two indexes finished up too. Tesla's market value hit the $US1 trillion ($1.33 trillion) mark after landing its biggest ever order for its electric vehicles (EVs). Rental car company Hertz is buying 100,000 Teslas to use in its fleet. Tesla shares surged almost 15 per cent to $US1,045. The cars will make up 20 per cent of Hertz's fleet. ""Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,"" Hertz interim chief executive Mark Fields said. ""We absolutely believe that this is going to be competitive advantage for us."" Hertz declined to disclose how much it was paying for the order. The type of Tesla it's buying usually goes for $US44,000, meaning the order could be worth more than $US4 billion. It'll get the cars by the end of 2022, and is upgrading its network to install electric charges. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will have access to 3,000 Tesla supercharging stations throughout the United States and Europe. There is no word on whether any Tesla's will be brought to Australia for people here to rent. The Australian share market followed the US markets on Tuesday morning, rising 0.3 per cent on opening. It softened throughout the day but still finished up marginally, at 7,443 points. Crown Casino soared in early trade after it was revealed it would not lose its Victorian licence, despite a royal commission finding its conduct had been ""disgraceful"". It ended up 8.7 per cent higher, with other stocks in casinos and gambling gaining too. Other gainers included Nanosonics (+9.4pc), Afterpay (+3.3pc) and BlueScope Steel (+2.7pc). On the flip side, miners were trading down. Mineral Resources lost 7.1 per cent, Regis was down 6.2 per cent, and Fortescue had shaved off 0.9 per cent. Those miners have a mixed portfolio across lithium, iron ore and gold. Inflation concerns are also continuing. ""Markets are still expecting central banks to respond to these pressures,"" NAB says. ""The Bank of England is still well priced for a rate hike at the next meeting in November. ""While for the US Federal Reserve a rate hike is fully priced by July/August 2022 and for the RBA by August 2022."" Interest rates in Australia are still at historical lows. Meanwhile, one of the other biggest stocks in the US isn't faring as well on Tuesday. Facebook is forecasting that its fourth-quarter revenue will be below estimates. A former Facebook data scientist has told Australian politicians the company fears regulation and Australia should team up with the US in a bid to rein in its power. That is off the back of Apple's new privacy rules, which the social media giant said kept digital advertisers from using its advertising services. The company expects fourth-quarter revenue to be in a range of $US31.5 billion to $US34 billion. Analysts had forecast $US34.84 billion. On global markets overnight, the price of oil continued to rise. ""US equity markets edged higher while Brent oil set another cyclical high,"" ANZ noted.

128,"Evergrande reportedly pays bondholders $110 million, averting default for now",markets,"  Evergrande reportedly pays bondholders $110 million, averting default for now China's Evergrande may have averted a formal default by wiring funds for a US dollar bond interest payment, initially due September 23, just a couple of days before a grace period was set to expire. A Reuters source corroborated a story in the Chinese state-backed Securities Times on Friday that ""the company had remitted $US83 million ($110 million) in coupon payments to a trustee account at Citibank on Thursday"", allowing it to pay the overdue interest owed to bondholders before the grace period expired on October 23. ""They seem to be avoiding short-term default and it's a bit of a relief that they have managed to find liquidity,"" said a Hong Kong-based restructuring lawyer representing some bondholders. ""But still, Evergrande does need to restructure its debt. This payment might be a way for them to get some sort of buy-in with stakeholders before the heavy work needed on the restructuring."" Evergrande remains at risk of China's largest ever corporate default, with debts totalling more than $400 billion. The developer will still need to make payments on a string of other bonds, including a $US47.5 million ($60 million) interest payment that it initially missed on September 29. The 30-day grace period for a bond interest payment that Evergrande initially missed will expire this week. The 30-day grace period is also expiring on those debts. Missing the grace period would result in a formal default by the company and secured creditors could place the Evergrande into liquidation if that happens. The Evergrande debt crisis has triggered economic woes across the real estate and construction industries in China, with the country's GDP growth slowing down to 4.9 per cent in the third quarter. The ABC has approached Evergrande for comment and Citi declined to comment on this matter. So far, there has been no formal announcement on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange from Evergrande confirming the bond payment. News of the remittance has sent a positive signal to the share markets and will likely bring relief to investors and regulators. Evergrande's shares jumped almost 8 per cent, a day after they dropped sharply after a potential deal between Evergrande and its rival developer Hopson fell through. Both companies informed the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that they were unable to agree to terms and resumed trade on the share market on Thursday after weeks of suspension. Liu Zhongrui, a senior official from China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said Evergrande's debt issue is an ""individual"" problem. ""The foundation of the credibility of Chinese-funded enterprises lies in the stability of China's macro-economy,"" Mr Liu said in a press conference on Thursday. ""Individual enterprise will not have a major impact on the reputation of the entire industry or all Chinese-funded enterprises."" Once a symbol of glittering success, China's biggest property group is tanking, dragging many of its competitors with it, writes Ian Verrender. He added that the Evergrande crisis was not a direct threat to China’s banking system as its bank debt only accounts for less than one-third of the total liabilities and that debt is widely spread among banks. That echoes what governor Yi Gang from People's Bank of China (PBoC), China's central bank, said on Sunday. He argued that Beijing can ""contain"" risks to China's financial system and economy stemmed from Evergrande's debt crisis. The Chinese government is concerned about the level of debt linked to the real estate market and last year introduced policies to curb it. Moody's has given Evergrande's debt a junk rating of Ca, the second-lowest category, reflecting ""its high liquidity and default risks"" and ""the weak recovery prospects for Evergrande's creditors if there is a default.""

129,Evergrande 'may be very close to liquidation'. So what happens then?,markets,"  China's Evergrande to face its day of reckoning as default looms. So what happens next? After weeks of radio silence since being suspended from trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Chinese property giant Evergrande is about to face its day of reckoning. The 30-day grace period for an offshore bond payment that the company initially missed on September 23 is going to expire at the end of this week. Once a darling of China's booming property sector, Evergande is now at risk of the country's largest-ever corporate default with more than $400 billion in debts, triggering financial woes in the world's second-biggest economy. So how is this likely to play out in the coming days? What happens next if a formal default occurs? Investors are watching closely whether Evergrande can make Saturday's deadline of $110 million in interest payments. A further $60 million interest payment was missed on September 29 and the grace period is also expiring on those debts. Moody's has given Evergrande's debt a junk rating of Ca, the second-lowest category, reflecting ""its high liquidity and default risks because of its sizable debt maturities over the next six to 12 months"". ""It also reflects the weak recovery prospects for Evergrande's creditors if there is a default,"" Moody’s said in a report. Fighting for survival, Evergrande has been scrambling to raise funds by selling assets and offering discounts on apartment sales. Earlier this month, its shares were halted on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, sparking speculations of potential asset sales. The Chinese media previously reported that Evergrande was in talks with another Hong Kong-listed Chinese developer Hopson about selling a majority stake of its property services unit to raise more than $7 billion much-needed cash. However, that deal has fallen through, with Hopson and Evergrande both informing the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that they were unable to agree to terms. Hong Kong media reported on Tuesday that ""the transaction didn't win blessings from the Guangdong provincial government."" Both companies will resume trade on the share market today. Jim Harrowell, the former president of the Australia China Business Council NSW branch and partner at law firm Hunt & Hunt, told the ABC that a formal default seems inevitable. ""At this stage, it would seem from reports coming out of China that it is highly likely Evergrande will formally default,"" Dr Harrowell said. ""In the current situation, it would be very difficult for Evergrande to raise funds from disposing of assets as potential purchasers are more likely to wait until the company collapses and deal with a liquidator."" It was once a darling of China's booming property sector, but share markets around the world now watch in horror as Evergrande threatens to sink. But Weiping He, a researcher in financial markets regulation and company law from Monash University, isn't convinced that a formal default will happen. ""In my view, it is not likely,"" Dr He told the ABC. ""Even if it defaults, the implications for the markets in China would be limited or managed to the minimum."" On Sunday, governor Yi Gang from People's Bank of China (PBoC), China's central bank, said in a virtual meeting of the G30 that Beijing can ""contain"" risks to China's financial system and economy stemmed from Evergrande's debt crisis despite admitting that it has caused ""a little bit of concern"" for Beijing, according to Bloomberg. Last week, Zou Lan, the head of financial markets from PBoC, signalled that Beijing was eager to protect the interests of consumers who are exposed to Evergrande. Dr He said the Chinese government is reluctant to bail out Evergrande at this stage. ""Their approach so far seems to be that financial institutions and local governments would assist to complete unfinished housing projects thus to minimise the impact on housing consumers,"" she said. ""Based on the investigations into the books of Evergrande on the part of the government, the PBOC so far has held the view that the externalities could be managed. ""Things might get worse if there are more revelations, but it would take time."" Dr Harrowell echoed Dr He's view on the bailout but said: ""Secured creditors are likely to run out of patience very soon and may move to exercise their rights under their security unless there is a credible plan."" ""From various sources, it appears the company may be very close to being placed into liquidation and, if that occurs, one would expect that there will be a default under most of its finance agreements,"" he said. Fears of a contagion effect have been intensifying in the past weeks as two smaller Chinese developers, Sinic and Fantasia, have defaulted. Richard Holden, a professor in economics at UNSW, told the ABC that a formal default can cause various disruptions. ""A formal default kills confidence, leading to a potential downward spiral where new capital cannot be raised, more defaults occur, and so on,"" he said. ""And it can trigger cross-default provisions in other loans, but also over-the-counter securities held by other institutions — that is one way it can trigger mass contagion."" Once a symbol of glittering success, China's biggest property group is tanking, dragging many of its competitors with it, writes Ian Verrender. Although the embattled company is headquartered in Shenzhen and listed in Hong Kong – two different jurisdictions – Dr Harrowell said the basic legal frameworks in both Shenzhen and Hong Kong dealing with loan defaults and corporate failures are very similar. ""Australia, China and Hong Kong have basically codified their laws relating to insolvent companies — corporations that cannot pay their debts,"" said Dr Harrowell. ""The formal procedures may differ, but the essential framework is the same. ""[A formal default] is grounds for secured creditors to call in their security and for placing the company into liquidation."" He said, if Evergrande collapses, its considerable stock of properties, including partly completed projects, would likely flood the market at less than cost, which will inevitably drive property prices down and make it hard for other developers to maintain their prices. ""Those who have bought properties off the plan from Evergrande are likely to lose the funds invested, so they won't be able to buy elsewhere,"" Dr Harrowell said. ""And those thinking about buying a property will be nervous about the potential of other developers failing, making it hard for them to find buyers for their properties."" So far, Evergrande has more than 70,000 investors and stalled construction on homes for more than 1 million home buyers. Evergrande's debt crisis has already had a knock-on effect both in China and beyond – causing disruptions on the Australian share market and for commodity prices. On Monday, China's National Bureau of Statistics revealed that the Chinese economy grew at its slowest pace in a year in the third quarter of 2021, at 4.9 per cent, with the real estate and construction industries shrinking 1.6 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively. The property market has been a key driver of economic growth in China since the mid-1990s and accounts for around a quarter of the Chinese economy by some metrics. As speculation over Evergrande's future continues, there's a growing belief among analysts that the world's second biggest economy is heading for a slow wind-down that will be painful but predictable. Economist James Laurenceson, the director of the Australia-China Relations Institute at UTS, told the ABC that Beijing will be focused on two objectives to contain the crisis. ""Shoring up social stability, such as by protecting the thousands of households that have put down cash for yet to be completed apartments,"" he said. ""Second, limiting contagion so that an Evergrande default doesn't spiral out of control to become a much bigger property bust and debt crisis. ""But beyond these constraints, all indications are that Beijing is going to allow Evergrande and its investors to incur serious losses."" However, Professor Laurenceson said if a formal default occurs for Evergrande, the direct impact on Australia would be relatively small. ""Australian investors have a very limited exposure,"" he said. ""We'd only need to be concerned by a bigger contagion scenario that slowed China's growth more generally, hitting demand for iron ore and causing Chinese households to tighten their purse strings. ""But Beijing will be keen to prevent that happening in the first place. We also shouldn't forget there's other mitigation mechanisms in place. ""For example, RBA research shows that Australia's flexible exchange rate is an impressive shock-absorber when the local economy is hit by adverse developments overseas.""

The ASX 200 closed up by 0.6 per cent to 7,365 points on Friday. Shares in travel companies jumped after NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet announced on Friday morning that the state will scrap quarantine for international arrivals from November 1. Shares for Qantas, which announced it would bring forward some international flights to match the NSW quarantine-free travel date, were up by 2 per cent (to $5.69). Webjet's share price surged by 4 per cent to $6.43 and Flight Centre gained 3.8 per cent to $22.56. But the Australian market's gains were capped by Rio Tinto, after its share price fell by 1 per cent. This was after the mining giant significantly downgraded its guidance for iron ore shipments in 2021, following a 4 per cent fall in production during the September quarter. It now expects to ship between 320 million tonnes (mt) and 325 mt of iron ore from the Pilbara — down from its previous range of 325 mt to 340 mt. The miner blamed it on a ""tight labour market in Western Australia"" and delays in the completion of its new new greenfield mine at Gudai-Darri. Among the biggest gainers were financial service company Hub24 (+5.8pc), four-wheel drive accessories business ARB Corp (+5.6pc) and Star Entertainment (+5.4pc). Pendal Group was down 11.5 per cent, Platinum Asset Management shed 6.9 per cent, and Harvey Norman dropped 3 per cent. The overall positive mood follows big gains on Wall Street, with all three major indexes closing up more than 1.6 per cent higher. The S&P 500 especially performed well (+1.7pc) off the back of better-than-expected earnings from the likes of Bank of America and UnitedHealth. It was another strong quarter for the four biggest consumer banks in the US as the rebounding economy allowed them to release more cash they had set aside for pandemic losses. They have released a combined $6 billion in funds that had been put aside for pandemic loan losses that have not materialised, thanks to extraordinary government stimulus, aid programs and loan repayment holidays. The banks also say consumer spending has boomed as the US re-opens after 19 months of pandemic restrictions. Overall, though, executives were cautiously optimistic that the economy is on a healthy trajectory, despite some risks on the horizon, including the latest wave of COVID-19 infections and inflation worries. Meanwhile, the corporate regulator ASIC is taking Insurance Australia Group to court over its alleged failure to pass on discounts to almost 600,000 customers. IAG's share price fell by 3.2 per cent to $4.92. One of the country's biggest insurance companies allegedly fails to pass on $60 million in discounts to hundreds of thousands of customers, leading to court action by the corporate regulator. The Australian dollar was steady at 74.23 US cents. Brent crude oil was up 0.9 per cent to $US83.91 per barrel. ""Equities rose sharply and commodity prices are generally firmer,"" ANZ noted on Friday. ""AUD/USD is trading higher, near 0.7415, thanks to the weaker USD and firm commodity prices. AUD underperformed other commodity currencies with AUD/CAD and AUD/NZD falling. ""A fall in iron ore prices might explain some of the under-performance. ""RBA deputy governor Guy Debelle discussed the risks posed by climate change to the Australian financial system yesterday.

131,ASX ends higher despite Evergrande's woes spilling over and a surprise Singaporean rate rise,markets,"  ASX ends higher despite Evergrande's woes spilling over and a surprise Singaporean rate rise The Australian share market got a boost on Thursday, but the woes were continuing in China with Evergrande's risk spreading. The ASX 200 was trading up by 0.8 per cent throughout the day. It closed half a per cent higher at 7,312 points. Winners included super fund Netwealth, with a gain of more than 15 per cent. That was after it told the stock market this morning that it had a record $4 billion quarter. It has increased the quantum of funds under its belt by $4.8 billion. Other stocks that did well included milk company A2 (+4.2pc), Hub24 (+8.7pc) and Afterpay (+4.5pc). Gold miners also performed well. Stocks that dragged down the market included AMP (-2.2pc), Whitehaven Coal (-2.1pc) and Platinum Asset Management (-1.2pc). Redbubble shed a massive 12.5 per cent. The online aggregator for artists who make everything from paintings to clothing told the ASX its gross profit was down $42 million. Overall, 158 companies ended the day up, amid renewed optimism from Sydney's lockdown ending and Melbourne soon set to emerge from it too. Technology, real estate, consumer goods, and the finance sector all performed well. That was a reiteration of its financial year outlook. Jobs data out today shows the official unemployment rate only rose 0.1 per cent to 4.6 per cent last month. That data covered a month where both Sydney and Melbourne were in lockdown. The local currency rose 0.4 per cent overnight, to 73.79 US cents. There's been fresh downgrades of several Chinese property companies, as the Evergrande crisis continues there. S&P has downgraded two of the sector's biggest firms, Greenland Holdings and E-house. It is warning it could cut their ratings further. Australia's Reserve Bank only just warned about the potential of a spillover crisis last week. Evergrande's stock tumbled before it was suspended from trade at the end of September. Its woes have been shaking markets since it was revealed last month that it is missing repayments. It missed a third round of interest repayments on its international bonds last week. Evergrande is one of China's biggest developers, with $300 billion in liabilities and 1,300 real estate projects in more than 280 cities. The $US5 trillion property sector accounts for around a quarter of the Chinese economy by some metrics. ""We see a risk that a disorderly correction in the property market could cause sharp price declines, hitting the personal wealth of homeowners,"" Kim Eng Tan, a credit analyst at S&P Ratings, said in a report. ""Such an event could also contribute to large-scale losses by investors in wealth management products, and the contractors and service firms that support the developers."" While a 30-day grace period means Evergrande has not technically defaulted, investors say they are expecting a long and drawn-out debt restructuring process. Singapore's central bank unexpectedly tightened its monetary policy on Thursday. It says the move will ensure price stability over the medium-term. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) manages monetary policy through exchange rate settings, rather than interest rates, letting the Singapore dollar rise or fall against the currencies of its main trading partners within an undisclosed band. The Singapore dollar jumped about 0.3 per cent after the announcement, to hit a three-week high of $S1.3475 per dollar. The tightening surprised some economists, who had been forecasting that it would not happen yet.

132,"Westpac profit to suffer $1.3 billion hit, ASX drops for second straight day",markets,"  Westpac profit to suffer $1.3 billion hit, ASX drops for second straight day Australian shares have dropped for the second day in a row, as a global energy crunch fuelled inflation fears, clouding investor sentiment before the US corporate earnings season. The ASX 200 index closed 0.3 per cent lower at 7,281 points. Shares in casino group Star Entertainment fell by another 2.7 per cent, on reports that it enabled ""suspected money laundering"" (which it has denied). That was on top of yesterday's 23 per cent plunge. Seven out of every 10 stocks fell, including tech companies Appen (-3.9pc), Afterpay (-2.7pc), and Zip Co (-3.2pc), along with Ansell (-4.6pc), Worley (-3.4pc) and REA Group (-3.5pc). Mining and metal stocks were some of the best performers, like Alumina (+4.2pc), Perseus Mining (+4.3pc), Ramelius Resources (+2.3pc) and BlueScope Steel (+1.8pc).

""Risk markets had a mixed start to the week amid light data flow and ahead of the US earnings season,"" ANZ analysts said in a note. ""Economies appear to be entering a more challenging phase of the cycle and we think investors and corporates will be monitoring how the economic data and earnings results fall before making assessments of near term direction."" Shares in Westpac fell by 1.7 per cent, after the bank warned investors that its second-half profit would suffer a $1.3 billion hit from a number of significant write-downs. Australia's second-largest bank also lowed its earnings outlook, citing ""subdued"" financial markets. The biggest component of the one-off ""impairment"" was Westpac's decision to slash the value of its institutional banking (WIB) division by almost $1 billion. Australia's second largest bank said it was for the purpose of ""reducing risk in the division through the exit of energy trading, consolidating our Asian operations and reducing our correspondent banking relationships which have all impacted earnings"". ""At the same time, medium term expectations of a prolonged low interest rate environment, subdued financial markets income and elevated compliance expenses have impacted WIB's earnings outlook,"" the bank added. It also flagged $172 million in legal costs, customer refunds and oher costs associated with settlings lawsuits. It's currently being pursued by ASIC over consumer credit insurance. Westpac will also take $267 million in previously flagged separation and transaction costs related to the sale of its Life Insurance business. The bank is scheduled to report its full-year results on November 1. It was expected to post a cash profit of $6.5 billion, according to the average forecast of 13 analysts polled by Refinitiv — nearly triple the previous year's result (which was impacted by COVID-19 loan repayment freezes and other macroeconomic shocks). However, that was before today's write-downs were announced. A measure of Australian business conditions slipped in September as long-running COVID lockdowns cut into sales and profits, though sentiment was boosted by the prospect of an imminent easing in restrictions. Tuesday's survey from NAB showed its index of business conditions fell 9 points in September to (+5 index points), taking it just below the long-run average. Yet the survey's measure of confidence rebounded by 19 points (to +13 index points), as firms in NSW looked forward to an easing of stay-at-home rules beginning this week. Victoria and Canberra should start opening up later in October. ""Businesses are really looking forward to reopening, and confidence increased markedly on the back of NSW and Victoria's reopening roadmaps,"" said NAB chief economist Alan Oster. Confidence in NSW alone jumped 42 points in the month, while Victoria saw a rise of 16 points. ""Still, confidence is more about hope for the future than what is happening in the present,"" Mr Oster added. ""On that front, conditions really deteriorated which shows that lockdowns are taking a toll, despite the resilience the economy has shown."" The NAB survey's measure of sales halved in September to +10, with whole sectors of retailing shut in Sydney and Melbourne, while profitability fell 13 points to +2. The employment index fell 8 points to +1. Capacity utilisation dropped to 78.4 per cent in September, almost 7 percentage points down from its peak in April and a sign of considerable slack in the economy. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has argued that the economy would likely recover once the lockdowns eased and forecast strong growth for next year. ""With NSW achieving its 70 per cent vaccination target and further thresholds expected to be achieved in coming weeks, the economy is well placed to recover in October and November as activity is allowed to restart,"" Mr Oster said. Meanwhile, the latest consumer confidence data from ANZ has shown a rise in optimism as Sydney geared up to re-open. ""Consumer confidence rose 1 per cent last week, its fifth straight week of small but consistent gains,"" ANZ noted. ""Anticipation of yesterday's reopening of Greater Sydney, after over 100 days of strict restrictions, likely added to last weekend's positive outlook. ""The rise was partially offset by a drop in confidence in Adelaide (-3.4pc) and Melbourne (-3.6pc). ""The dampened outlook in Melbourne may reflect rapidly rising COVID case numbers in the city."" However, the bank forecasts confidence will rise in the Victorian capital soon as it reaches vaccination targets and prepares to come out of lockdown in a few weeks. The Australian market's subdued performance came after a weak overnight session on Wall Street. The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell by around 0.7 per cent each. While energy stocks were propped up by surging oil prices, that was not enough to boost US markets. ""Oil hit its highest level since 2014 with an intra-day high of US$82.18 to settle up 1.5 per cent to $US80.50,"" NAB analysts wrote in a note. ""The rise in energy prices is fuelling concerns that the transitory lift in inflation seen in the wake of the pandemic may prove to be longer-lasting."" That is lifting inflation concerns and boosting the US currency. ""AUD/USD bucked the broad USD trend and is trading higher near 0.7350 amid gains in oil and base metal prices,"" ANZ analysts wrote. ""The more positive Australia US 10-year bond spread may also be supporting AUD/USD. ""Nevertheless, easing growth momentum in China remains a weight on AUD."" The bank's analysts also expect that the easing of restrictions in Sydney while parts of New Zealand continue to be locked down would support the Australian currency against the NZ dollar. ""Yesterday, the New Zealand government announced that Auckland will remain under Alert Level 3 restrictions for at least another week,"" the ANZ analysts noted. ""The stark contrast between relaxed restrictions in NSW and extended restrictions in NZ will support AUD/NZD in the near term.""

133,"analysis: An Evergrande collapse is 'likely' without government support, but a bailout has its own problems for China, RBA warns",markets,"  'China's financial system could collapse': What the Reserve Bank's Evergrande bombshell means for Australia The Reserve Bank of Australia has made some startling observations about the possible consequences of the collapse of China's second largest property developer, Evergrande. The central bank made no reference to China or Evergrande in its October Monetary Policy statement, but it's more than made up for that in its latest Financial Stability Review. The RBA warns: ""Vulnerabilities in China's financial system remain elevated and authorities face a difficult balancing act."" The slow-motion train wreck that is Evergrande remains a crucial aspect of those ""vulnerabilities"". ""If they act too quickly in addressing these vulnerabilities, confidence in the implicit guarantees that underpin much of China's financial system could collapse, which would lead to financial distress,"" the RBA says. ""In contrast, if they act too slowly, the probability of more severe financial stress in the future will increase. ""Continued bailouts also risk further entrenching perceptions of implicit guarantees."" In short, the RBA believes China's authorities have found themselves caught between a rock and a hard place on managing the wind-up of the world's second most indebted company, whose ""collapse could trigger wider stress in China's financial and real estate sectors."" Financial markets still fear for the future of China's second largest property developer, while another global financial crisis has been considered a distinct possibility. More immediately though, serious questions are being asked about the health of the Chinese property sector and what that means for countries — like Australia — that are heavily dependent on robust Chinese economic growth. Another crucial question, then, is: How can Australia achieve strong, sustainable economic growth without significant help from China? Rumblings of a debt crisis began earlier this year, when Chinese authorities demanded several of the country's heavily leveraged property developers rein in their debt exposures. Developers were told that if they failed to meet one, two, or all of the three debt ""red lines"", regulators would place limits on the extent to which they can grow debt. Chinese developer Evergrande is suspended from trade in Hong Kong, after missing a bond interest payment last week. The crisis shifted up a gear last month when Evergrande failed to meet several debt payments. It became clear to global financial markets that Evergrande had been relying too heavily on debt for growth. The fear was that Evergrande was insolvent which, in a worst-case scenario, could lead to a company wind-up, crashing property prices as investors and off-the-plan buyers fled the market, and a Chinese economic collapse — given China's reliance on the property market for economic growth. However, most analysts agreed China would ensure home buyers and investors would be protected. The Chinese Central Bank also promised it would help ring-fence any local-level banking crisis. But what about Evergrande's offshore debt tentacles? Bloomberg's David Qu is watching developments closely and says there's little risk of an Evergrande collapse triggering a global financial crisis. ""Overseas investors' exposure to Evergrande is limited,"" Qu says. Investors that are exposed, though, are expected to receive a significant so-called ""haircut"" on their investments. If we park the possibility of an international financial crisis, the next step is to consider the ongoing threat of a contained domestic economic crisis (despite suggestions of government financial support). Reuters this week reported that court filings showed two Hong Kong property agencies were suing China Evergrande Group over unpaid commissions. Centaline is trying to recover $HK3.1 million in overdue commissions, while Midland Holdings, according to the South China Morning Post, is claiming unpaid commission of $HK43.45 million for two developments in Hong Kong. Do you see what's happening? On a weekly basis, Evergrande is unable to pay its bills, and those bills are piling up. It points to the possibility that China's entire real estate sector is staring into the abyss. ""The real estate sector has been important [for China's economic growth] over the past 30 years,"" David Qu says. ""If something happens to Evergrande, the confidence of investors [in] the real estate sector should be weakened."" An Evergrande collapse would send financial shockwaves across China's real estate sector. Multiple property sector collapses would likely lead to a full-blown national economic crisis — a scenario which this week became a possibility. Fantasia Holdings Group, a Shenzhen-based property developer, failed to repay $US205 million of debt due on Monday. With a market value of $415 million, Fantasia is not considered to carry any economic weight. Fantasia Holdings Group fails to make payments on debt obligations. But its cash flow problems only add to worries the entire real estate industry is at risk of a sector-wide crunch that could put further pressure on China's slowing economy. The epicentre of this debt crisis is Evergrande, and it's looking OK — for now. The company was placed into a trading halt on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange earlier this week, pending an announcement ""containing inside information about a major transaction"". At the same time, rival Hopson was also placed into a trading halt on a different stock exchange for similar reasons. Local media put two and two together and began speculating Hopson was going to offer to buy Evergrande's property management arm, netting Evergrande roughly $5 billion in cash — which would theoretically cover its international bond payments for the next six months. It has around $500 million in coupon payments due by the end of the year, followed by a $US2 billion bond maturity in March. Overall, though, Evergrande is sitting on over $US300 billion in debt, so its financial problems are nowhere near being resolved. Yun Jiang, managing editor at the School of Regulation and Global Governance at the Australian National University, believes the Chinese Communist Party is still debating whether to let Evergrande collapse. ""I'm looking for how the government will try to help the investors and the customers of Evergrande, without creating a moral hazard,"" she says. Moral hazard is created, Jiang adds, when a government authority financially supports a company in financial distress as a result of reckless behaviour. ""We know the Chinese government has been focusing on the initial debt and doesn't want companies to continue to accumulate debt,"" she says. ""The other companies and investors will think certain companies are too big to fail and that is not good for the future of debt accumulation in China."" For now, we'll have to wait for an Evergrande company announcement, or news of some other development from the Chinese property sector. China is nearing the end of a seven-day holiday, and so far there's been no word from regulators on Evergrande. On Wednesday, China's central bank urged financial institutions to cooperate with relevant departments and local governments to maintain the ""stable and healthy"" development of the property market and safeguard consumers' interests. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken implored China to act ""responsibly"" when it comes to addressing the potential impacts of Evergrande's financial crisis. The key for Evergrande, analysts say, is to get project construction going and sell inventory, so it can start paying its way again. In its latest Financial Stability Review, the Reserve Bank also noted the steps Evergrande is taking to rescue itself from financial disaster. ""Evergrande has: sold properties at steep discounts; sold other assets; delayed payments to suppliers, holders of its wealth management products and on some of its other liabilities; and sought to offer debt holders discounts on properties in lieu of payments,"" the RBA notes. But what if it can't save itself? The Reserve Bank warns a company collapse is likely. ""These steps appear insufficient and Evergrande is widely expected to collapse without some type of government support. China is Australia's largest trading partner and everything from the health of the federal budget (via the price of iron ore) to Australia's capacity to pay for the pandemic economic stimulus package depends on the health of China's economy. That's not to mention millions of superannuation balances and the trajectory of Australia's unemployment rate and outlook for interest rates. A lot is riding on how China manages Evergrande's financial woes, and analysts say it's simply too early to say it's going to be OK.

All Ordinaries index has lost 0.5 pc to 7537, while the ASX 200 has dropped 0.4 per cent to 7,248 The market fell as much as 1 per cent before recovering from its losses in the afternoon. The All Ordinaries index ended down 0.5 per cent, to 7,537. The ASX 200 dropped 0.4 per cent, to 7,248, with most sectors in the red. After the close of trade, law firm Slater and Gordon announced it was launching a class action lawsuit against dairy firm A2 Milk, on behalf of investors who bought shares over a nine-month period, during which the infant formula maker posted four earnings downgrades. There were no surprises coming out of the Reserve Bank's monthly board meeting today. It kept the cash rate target at 0.1 per cent for another month. The RBA decided to continue purchasing $4 billion of government securities a week until at least mid-February next year. And it has maintained the 0.1 per cent target for Australian government bonds. All three measures are designed to keep the level of interest rates lower than otherwise in Australia's economy, to support economic activity and states enduring lockdowns. The cash rate target has been at a record low of one-tenth of a percentage point, or 10 basis points, for 11 months now. RBA governor Philip Lowe reiterated the official cash rate would stay at 0.1 per cent until 2024 at the earliest, unless conditions cause the level of inflation to rise sustainably above the central bank's  2-3 per cent inflation range before then. Dr Lowe says the Delta outbreak in New South Wales and Victoria has interrupted the recovery of Australia's economic recovery and gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to have declined materially in the September quarter. However, he still thinks the setback in the economic recovery will only be temporary. ""In our central scenario, the economy will be growing again in the December quarter and is expected to be back around its pre-Delta path in the second half of next year,"" he said in a statement. Dr Lowe said he was conscious that historically low interest rates were supporting rapid increases in house prices. He said the Council of Financial Regulators had been discussing the medium-term risks to macroeconomic stability and rapid credit growth, and he reminded banks to keep their lending standards responsible. ""In this environment, it is important that lending standards are maintained and that loan serviceability buffers are appropriate,"" he said. The Reserve Bank is concerned about booming home values because property prices have surged by 25 per cent over the past year because of government stimulus and record low interest rates, propping up the housing market. Commonwealth Bank senior economist Kristina Clifton said in an economic note that she expected regulators to take action to cool red hot prices. ""We expect macro-prudential policy to be reintroduced (late this year or early next year) with a lift in the loan serviceability floor rate the most likely action."" National Australia Bank's director of economics and markets, Tapas Strickland, said there was a chance that the Reserve Bank could raise borrowing costs sooner rather than later because of moves by central banks overseas in response to rising global inflation. ""NAB's view remains of the RBA being on hold until 2024, though markets will continue to price the risk of the RBA moving in 2023."" ""Global inflation trends and other central banks starting to either hike rates, or pave the way to hike — e.g., Norgesbank, RBNZ this week — will keep markets pricing in the chance that the RBA achieves its inflation target earlier than 2024,"" he said in an economic note. Ahead of the RBA decision, economist Stephen Koukoulas said he expected the meeting to be ""boring"". ""It is likely to be one of the least-anticipated meetings on record, with no-one expecting any change in rates, and most analysts are likely to show only passing interest in what the RBA has to say,"" Mr Koukoulas said. Both the share market and the Australian dollar were little changed after the RBA kept rates on hold. At 4:45pm AEDT, the local currency was buying around 72.53 US cents, down 0.4 per cent. Oil stocks were higher after energy prices rose to a three-year high overnight. Brent crude oil rose 2.5 per cent, to $US81.26 a barrel overnight after major oil producers OPEC confirmed they would stick to their current output policy as demand for fuel rebounds. Spot gold rose 0.4 per cent overnight, to $US1,767.39 an ounce, which boosted gold miners on the market but it pulled back in today's trade to $US1756.05, down 0.7 per cent. Leading the ASX 200 gainers were gold miners Gold Road Resources (+7,2pc), Silver Lake Resources (+5.7pc), and oil giant Woodside Petroleum (+4pc). Tech stocks tracked Wall Street lower, with buy now, pay later firm Zip (-4.8pc), tourism firm Sealink Travel Group (-6.3pc), and artificial intelligence firm Appen (-5pc). According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Australia made a record trade surplus in August, boosted by LNG and coal exports, despite a pullback in iron ore prices. ANZ said consumer confidence rose 0.9 per cent last week, the fourth consecutive week of small gains. Confidence increased in Sydney, Melbourne and regional South Australia, while it fell in Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth. US investors dumped big tech firms and other growth stocks as yields on US government Treasury bonds rose on worries about rising inflation. The Dow Jones index fell 0.9 per cent, to 34,003, the S&P 500 lost 1.3 per cent, to 4,300, and the Nasdaq slid 2.1 per cent, to 14,255. Apple and Amazone (both down 3 per cent), Microsoft (-2.4pc), and Alphabet (-2.1pc), the US stock market's four most-valuable companies, all dropped. Facebook, the fifth-most valuable company, slumped 4.9 per cent after its app, its photo-sharing platform Instagram, and messaging service WhatsApp, suffered a major outage. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in the US, said the technology sector was seeing a market correction. ""For Big Tech, this is a short- to medium-term thing, part of a correction process,"" he said. ""Rates were clearly too low, due in large part to central bank policies, and now as investors anticipate those policies getting clawed back, rates are moving closer to their real value."" US Treasury yields rose as investors fretted about the lack of a debt ceiling fix in the US Congress and looked ahead to the release this week of September employment data, which could pave the way for the tapering of Federal Reserve asset purchases. US President Joe Biden says he cannot guarantee the government will not breach its $US28.4 trillion ($39 trillion) debt limit unless Republicans join Democrats in voting to raise it, as the United States faces the risk of a default in just two weeks. Recent data showing increased consumer spending, accelerated factory activity and elevated inflation growth have fuelled bets that the US Federal Reserve could start tightening its accommodative monetary policy sooner than expected. Wall Street's main indexes were battered in September, hit by worries including the fate of a massive infrastructure spending bill and the meltdown of heavily indebted China Evergrande Group. Yesterday the Chinese property developer suspended its shares in Hong Kong because of a pending market transaction amid speculation that another Chinese firm would buy its property business. The S&P 500 has fallen about 5 per cent from its record high close on September 2. Nearly two-thirds of S&P 500 stocks have declined 10 per cent or more from their 52-week highs, including 73 stocks down more than one-fifth. Spooking investors further, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank president James Bullard warned that inflation could remain elevated for some time. Some pockets of the market enjoyed a bounce, with energy stocks and utilities gaining. Tesla rose 0.8 per cent after the electric vehicle maker reported record quarterly deliveries that beat estimates. The FTSE 100 index fell 0.2 per cent, to 7,011, the DAX in Germany lost 0.8 per cent, to 15,037, and the CAC 40 in France fell 0.6 per cent, to 6,478.

135,Lambskin market reaches three-year high on back of China demand,markets," ABC Rural China sheepskin demand brings silver lining to farmers' pockets Lambskins were virtually worthless this time last year but a shortage of supply and the resurgence of demand from China has led to prices climbing to $11 a head. Wagga Wagga-based livestock agent James Tierney described the skin market as a ""free kick"" for sheep producers, who are already selling into a lucrative lamb market. ""There's been a massive change. This time last year, sucker [new season lambs] skins were either worthless or $1 maybe $2 a head,"" Mr Tierney said. ""Fast forward to now and the last couple of months and they're all making from $8 to $11 a head."" As an animal by-product, sheepskin supply is directly linked to the number of sheep being processed. But the market can still be difficult to predict with demand largely dictated by China's fashion industry, particularly the footwear sector. ""It's hard enough to read the meat market, the skin market is more and more fickle,"" Mr Tierney said. ""It probably goes into what's happening in China … everyone's got to eat but not everyone has got to make use of skins."" The Dubbo-based sheepskin manager for Fletcher International Exports, Gerald Webster, said there were usually two or three Chinese buyers and tanneries who drove the market. ""Their demand is domestic and I think as COVID-19 is opening up markets are opening up. It's increasing the domestic sales,"" Mr Webster said. Getting sheepskins to China has been challenging, with both processors and shipping held up by COVID-19 disruptions. ""Most processors have had reduced production, labour is probably the biggest thing that has caused that but there have been outbreaks in certain areas and that's slowed factories down,"" Mr Webster said. ""Shipping is bad and it probably hasn't reached its crisis level yet."" Although sheepskin prices have soared to the highest levels seen since May 2018, commodity analyst Matt Dalgleish said it was still far from the record of nearly $20 a head a decade ago. ""I don't think we're going to see it as high as that, but certainly there's not going to be a big rush of animals coming out of the woodworks,"" Mr Dalgleish said. ""Supply for all of these co-products is going to be pretty tight still and that's going to underpin these prices somewhat. ""But seasonally we do see an influx of lambs hit the Victorian market in the next few months, which might take some of the immediate movement out of that price. ""I don't think we'll see it collapse but it might stabilise a bit as those lambs move through.""

136,analysis: I just sold my home in Sydney's hot property market — this is what I learned,markets,"  The pandemic is pushing Australia's hot property market to a whole new level — and the regulator is watching closely You could argue the Australian property market has never been ""hotter"". That is, property price growth is at or near record highs, repaying a mortgage has never been cheaper and buying a first home has never been harder (in terms of the size of the deposit required). But what is it actually like selling property right now? We just sold our two-bedroom apartment in Sydney and I was genuinely shocked by the market's appetite for a new listing. The speed at which it sold — in just 10 days — points to a once-in-a-generation property market phenomenon. An already existing property boom has been raised to a whole new level with the aid of the pandemic — and the supply shortfall that came with it. It's in a time like this you can learn a thing or two about how the housing market, and its participants, operate — because otherwise subtle or niche developments become more obvious. The pandemic has revealed the strength of the demand for both apartment and detached houses, especially when supply is constrained. We prepared ourselves to move all the clutter from our place to and from the garage at least four or five times so prospective buyers could move through the open home inspections without tripping over a toy or two. As it happened, we did that just twice: Our property was on the market for 10 days in total. The statistics were extraordinary. Within the first 48 hours of the property being advertised there were 80 inquiries. The first Saturday open home saw 21 people move through the apartment (one at a time), and seven of those asked for contracts. Within the first week our online property listing had clocked up 1,000 page views. There was a second open home on Wednesday. An offer was made on Thursday and a bidding process began over the phone and on email. It was finalised on Friday evening with an exchange of contracts. The Treasurer gives a strong indication that new limits on large home loans will soon be introduced. Due diligence was done; all parties had lawyers in tow, and strata and building reports were requested and downloaded. However, apart from all parties concerned abiding by Real Estate Institute and Department of Fair Trading guidelines, there were no rules. The bottom line was a property was for sale in an area where supply was low — very low — and both investors and owner occupiers were waiting to snap it up. The demand in the market was so strong that the idea of a Saturday street auction — once the norm in Sydney — was never really entertained. Indeed, an auction date was never set. Our experience, it turns out, was a microcosm of the greater Sydney market. According to CoreLogic there were 841 auctions held in Sydney last week, compared to 786 over the previous week and 812 over the same week last year, overtaking the previous week as the busiest auction week for Sydney since late June. There's evidence some agents are also acting as auctioneers, stretching the limits of the market. Janice Andrews recently sold her mother's Dingley Village unit in Melbourne. She chose Kevin Chokshi as her agent because he pitched the benefits of being both an auctioneer and agent simultaneously. What's the advantage of this? Well, it gives the agent plenty more work to do but the idea behind it is that it prevents an in-person or online auction from slowing down. Auctioneers thrive off a pacey auction. This is one way to achieve that. Janice Andrews says her agent told her that he could be ""quite responsive"" if the auction ""wasn't going well"". In other words, with the vendor's permission, the auctioneer makes on-the-spot decisions depending on how the auction is unfolding. It's evidence that when a market reaches a heightened state, participants find ways to squeeze every last drop out of sales prices, which can lead to unorthodox and potential risky sales tactics. It's also clear the property market is feeding on itself and being driven by emotion. Di Jones real estate agent Linda Ratcliff has been selling homes in Sydney for 26 years and says properties are on the market for the shortest period she has ever seen. What's striking to her, though, is that it's showing no signs of slowing. ""It's been consistently like this for about 2.5 years, it's just getting stronger now,"" Ratcliff says. ""It's been the longest consistent market that I've worked in — and it comes down to the supply."" Importantly, she says, vendors have high expectations on price, and it's pushing prices up. If a vendor hasn't already bought a property, they're compelled, in Ms Ratcliff's experience, to spend all of the proceeds of their sale on a new home, further inflating property prices. ""They think, 'I'll spend what I've got to spend to get back in again',"" she says. ""It's emotional for everyone at the moment."" Like any other market, it's impossible to accurately predict how prices for apartments and detached dwellings will track over coming months. What we do know is that record low interest rates, fewer listings (due to pandemic restrictions), relatively low rates of unemployment among property owners, a willingness from the banks to lend, and fear of missing out (FOMO) are also supporting and, in many cases, consistently pushing property prices higher. If we've learned anything from the past week, the Australian housing market is on a one-way trajectory into outer space and no one is in any mood to alter its course, writes Ian Verrender. What I and other vendors have learned from our recent sales experience is that the sales process itself is fuelling the rapid rise in prices. The market, on occasion, represents something of a frenzy. It's also what is now concerning policymakers. The regulator APRA confirmed to the ABC it's now looking ""particularly closely"" at price-to-income ratios (currently six times, according to Treasury). This is an ever-so-small policy shift, but it's a rare shift all the same. The Council of Financial Regulators, meanwhile, is stalking what's become a highly strung property market. It's just inched a little closer to its prey.

137,analysis: Markets rally as Evergrande nearing default: It is like 'old-fashioned glue-sniffing',markets,"  Markets rally as Evergrande nearing default: It is like 'old-fashioned glue-sniffing' Why are investors so relaxed at the moment? On Monday last week, Australia's share market suffered its worst trading day since February. There were fears that Chinese property giant Evergrande would explode ,with debts totalling more than $400 billion, and cause an economic crisis in the world's second-biggest economy. However, by Friday, the market had recovered most of its losses. It did not seem to matter that Evergrande had not fixed its debt problems, nor that it had missed a coupon payment to bond holders on Thursday. Markets even rallied on Thursday. So what's going on? Michael Every, Rabobank's global strategist, wondered the same thing on Friday. In his daily note, he put the Evergrande situation on a long list of other events that you would think would be damaging optimism, but which are not. Apparently, the momentum of the ""reflation trade"" — that's been driving global stockmarkets higher ever since 2020's lockdowns ended — is still too powerful. Property prices are soaring globally. Supply chains are under intense pressure. Labour markets are not in the healthiest condition. The virus is still laying waste to some economies. But stock markets are still bubbling. ""As we all know, markets can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent, and they are encouraged to do so when monetary and fiscal authorities encourage them to sniff solvent,"" Mr Every wrote on Friday. It was once a darling of China's booming property sector, but share markets around the world now watch in horror as Evergrande threatens to sink. ""However, yesterday's 'reflation!' trade appears to be old-fashioned glue-sniffing without any help from the central banks or governments."" He said that, when a bunch of central banks are starting to talk about gradually lifting interest rates and reducing their bond-buying, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) was playing the ""usual game"" last week with net liquidity injections as the Wall Street Journal reported that local Chinese governments were being told to prepare for Evergrande to fail. Should that news have been enough to scare investors? Apparently it was not. ""This is taken as bullish by some, because it means China is being proactive,"" Mr Every wrote. ""Then again, so is the firm being 'saved' by being broken into three and nationalised, another story doing the rounds, which implies losses for bond and equity holders, and a new economic model. ""Chinese local governments actually rely on land sales to the likes of Evergrande for 30 to 40 per cent of their income, so who is going to step in to stop them failing? ""We know the assumed answer, but do we know the un-assumed impact on the exchange rate? It isn't reflationary — at least outside of China."" He also questioned the lack of information coming out of China on Thursday regarding Evergrande's solvency. Was the silence an ominous sign? Apparently not. ""Nobody seems to hold any Evergrande foreign debt that may now be defaulting after missing a coupon yesterday, and starting a 30-day grace period countdown. Nobody. The firm clearly sold all those bonds to itself,"" he wrote. ""And Chinese junk-rated dollar bond issuers were already back in the market yesterday as the 'Evergrande to fail"" headline hit - even junk-rated property developers."" So, are markets just enjoying a short-term reprieve before reality hits? By the end of Mr Every's sardonic note, you got the feeling we should all strap in. However, AMP Capital's head of investment strategy, Shane Oliver, in his weekly market wrap on Friday, said even though short-term correction risks remained, disorderly default and liquidation of Evergrande was unlikely. ""Fears about Evergrande causing a global 'Lehman moment' have receded but we could still see more volatility over the next month or so. There could still be more bad news out of Evergrande before a restructuring occurs,"" he said. While Chinese authorities ""want to teach property developers and investors a lesson"" about the dangers of too much debt, he said, they were ""most unlikely"" to allow Evergrande's failure to mushroom into a major credit-squeeze that would drag in other property developers and end up collapsing the property sector and economy. He listed four reasons why a disorderly default was unlikely: Dr Oliver said the ""resolution"" of Evergrande's debt payments due on Thursday last week, and the relative calm in China's own debt markets afterwards, were ""possible signs"" that authorities were working towards a restructuring. At any rate, it was enough to see Evergrande fears recede by the weekend. Earlier last week, Barclays analysts in Hong Kong were among the crowd of people saying Evergrande's problems would be unlikely to morph into a Lehman-style event. They said Chinese authorities were monitoring Evergrande's situation and had been doing so for months. The banking system's exposure to the property sector, they said, had been declining steadily since the Chinese government's de-leveraging drive five years ago, with loans to the property sector falling from 37 per cent in 2016 to 26 per cent in 2021. Instead, they said, the risks were higher from a property price correction spilling over into other sectors in China's economy. ""We think the risk of a fallout is more directly related to the real estate sector — contagion effects for other developers, housing-market sentiment and activity, suppliers, property buyers, investors in wealth-management products — and, hence, its macro effects are more on economic growth,"" they wrote. Evergrande's looming default is already sending shock waves to Australia and around the world of finance. Reuters reported that Evergrande had 800 projects under construction. Of those, 500 have been suspended and another 300 projects are at risk of suspension due to lack of funds to pay suppliers and workers. The base-case scenario for what could happen in China, Barclays analysts said, was for a visible housing market slowdown in the coming two quarters, with property investment slowing towards 0 per cent. And, given that weakening investment, there could be some spillover effects in other sectors. ""We think steel, cement and other construction materials would be hit as the Chinese property sector cools,"" they said. ""With China, the construction sector accounts directly for almost half of all steel consumption. ""We expect some spillover effects on commodity imports, given the property sector — along with infrastructure investment — consumes a big chunk of imported commodities. ""Major commodity imports — such as iron ore, copper — have weakened this year from a peak in mid-2020. ""We think the weakness in the property sector will also spill over to downstream sectors, including furniture, electronics and services industries."" However, surveying the larger global situation last week, Mr Every did not have much faith that authorities had a grip on things. After considering the problems with global supply chains, and the amount of central bank money printing occurring around the world, he wondered if anyone was pricing risks correctly, or if investors were high on adhesive. ""Then again, in the face of a global pandemic and [its] socio-economic body-blow, the US saw household net wealth increase by $5,849 billion in the second quarter alone. Almost six trillion dollars. In three months,"" he wrote. ""When supply chains were collapsing and the labour market wasn't doing that much labouring. ""It takes a LOT of glue to hold that kind of number together, trust me,"" he concluded. He could have said the same thing about Australia's property market.

138,ASX dips as Evergrande sell-off resumes and IMF warns on Australian house prices,markets,"  ASX dips as Evergrande sell-off resumes and IMF warns on Australian house prices Evergrande's stock has taken another hit as investors mull whether the troubled Chinese property developer will pay back some of its debt as promised. At 4:30pm AEST, Evergrande's stock was down almost 11 per cent on the Hong Kong market. It has taken a 45 per cent hit in the last month, although this week investors started to calm and it had regained some lost ground. The renewed sell-off comes after no word about whether Evergrande has made a $US83.5 million bond interest payment. The payment was due on Thursday. It announced on Wednesday that it had ""resolved"" one coupon payment due on Thursday on its Shenzhen-traded 5.8 per cent September 2025 bond via ""private negotiations"". If you know one thing about Evergrande, it's that the company's in bad shape. Read this and you'll know a few more things about the embattled Chinese developer. Evergrande's financial woes and failure to pay back debt on time have been rocking markets globally and leading to fears of a 'Lehman' style collapse. It also has a $US47.5 million dollar-bond interest payment due next week. Wall Street had only just been shrugging off the saga, however. On Thursday (US time) traders appeared to be taking succour in the fact that Evergrande has a 30-day grace period on the US-dollar bond payment before technically falling into default. The sanguine attitudes were reflected in comments to Reuters. ""The US market has shrugged this off,"" Chris Detmer, managing director of Washington Wealth Group of Steward Partners, told the financial news service. ""It's noted it, reacted to it, but now has shrugged it off."" Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, was one of those shrugging it off. ""There are a host of risks out there. Evergrande is well down the list. Evergrande's looming default is already sending shock waves to Australia and around the world of finance. ""But as an investor, you have to look long term. You have to look beyond the short-term risks. ""If you're looking for clear skies and no traffic to be able to invest, you're never going to."" These sentiments saw the benchmark S&P 500 index rise 1.2 per cent, the blue-chip Dow Jones index jump 1.5 per cent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq rise 1 per cent. The gains may not be sustained if Evergrande ultimately does succumb to a major debt default, but Mr McBride said that was a problem for another day. ""It's one of those things where I don't have to outrun the alligator, I just have to outrun you. ""It's what's deemed to be the weakest link, where markets could really seize up. ""Credit is like oxygen to a fire. If the flow of credit is interrupted, economies and markets seize up very quickly."" The local share market is less buoyant than Wall Street, with the benchmark index on track to close the week lower, despite a mid-week rally. The ASX 200 closed down 0.4 per cent. Shares that made a gain included Computershare (+5.7pc), Virgin Money (+2.8pc) and Woodside Petroleum (+1.7pc). Energy stocks, including Woodside, rallied as the price of Brent crude continued to rise. China's trade ban on Australian resources is behind the latest price surge for metallurgical coal, despite an iron ore downturn. Premier Investments did nicely (+5.5pc), a day after the retailer posted a 100 per cent rise in profit. Financials were up, with the big four all marginally higher. On the flip side, gold miner Ramelius took the biggest hit of the day (-6.1pc) as the price of the commodity dropped. It was down 1.4 per cent to $US1,743, as investors abandoned safe havens assets in favour of more risk. Iron ore prices held firm, while Brent crude oil prices rose another 1 per cent to $US77.22. The risk appetite saw the Australian dollar climb to 72.9 US cents overnight and remain around that level by the middle of the day AEST. However, US treasury yields rose to 1.43 per cent, as investors eyed interest rate rises sooner rather than later. The International Monetary Fund has recommended sweeping changes to Australian policy to contain rising property prices. House prices are surging in a pandemic amid a swirl of factors, including record-low interest rates. In its annual note on Australia, the IMF said the nation should ditch stamp duty, strongly hinted at removing negative gearing and recommended tighter lending standards. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe says he understands concerns about rapid house price growth, but it's helping household wealth to grow. ""Surging housing prices raise concerns about affordability and financial stability,"" it warned. ""Structural reforms to boost housing supply and targeted support for low-income households are needed to improve housing affordability. ""Macroprudential policy should be tightened and lending standards closely monitored. ""Options include increasing interest serviceability buffers and instituting portfolio restrictions on debt-to-income and loan-to-value ratios. ""Transitioning from a housing transfer stamp duty to a general land tax would improve efficiency by providing a more stable revenue source for states and territories, while promoting labour mobility. ""Such reforms could be complemented by reducing structural incentives for leveraged investment by households, including in residential real estate."" New Zealand this week further tightened lending standards to reduce the amount of loans that can be given to people with less than 10 per cent deposit. New Zealand is in an even bigger housing boom than Australia right now, but authorities have moved to stop it. Will Australia follow the Kiwis' lead? Australia's neighbour has also been experiencing a COVID property boom. Markets have also been speculating New Zealand's central bank will also soon raise its cash rate amid the housing boom and it's plummeting unemployment rate. Norway is the latest country to raise interest rates from rock-bottom levels, lifting its benchmark rate to 0.25 per cent. ""There is a strong recovery in the Norwegian economy,"" Norges Bank Governor Oeystein Olsen told a news conference. ""It's time to start a gradual normalisation of the policy rate."" The bank's monetary policy committee said its forecast for four more hikes by the end of 2022 to a rate of 1.25 per cent had become even more likely. The Bank of England's (BoE) meeting last night was also seen as opening the possibility of an interest rate rise there before the end of this year. ""The move in [bond] yields came in the wake of a more hawkish BoE overnight which flagged the possibility of hikes even before the end of its QE [quantitative easing] program and also concluded the case for some modest tightening had strengthened,"" wrote Tapas Strickland from NAB. ""UK markets now price 15 basis points of hikes by February with 50 basis points of hikes priced for 2022.""

139,What's going on with Evergrande? Why is the Chinese real estate giant on the brink of collapse?,markets,"  What's going on with Evergrande? Why is the Chinese real estate giant on the brink of collapse? Even if you're not a close follower of financial markets and Chinese real estate firms, you might've heard about the company Evergrande over the past few days. And if you know one thing about Evergrande, it's that things aren't going well for it — and that could have big implications. There were fears the company could default on a couple of interest repayments today. However, it's promised that won't happen for at least one of them. But its woes still have the potential to send a shock wave through the global economy. Here's what you need to know. Evergrande (pronounced ever grand) is one of China's largest property developers, claiming to own more than 1,300 projects in more than 280 cities across China. It's also expanded its business into a number of offshoots including electric vehicles, media, financial services, sport team ownership, health services and theme parks. Riding high during a boom earlier this decade, it borrowed huge amounts of money to finance its growth. It used that money to build apartments. And the construction binge meant it also racked up debts and obligations to building suppliers and people who purchased off-the-plan apartments. All this has led to Evergrande being considered the most indebted company in the world, owing more than $US300 billion ($400 billion) in various forms. The Chinese government has been getting increasingly concerned about the level of debt linked to the country's real estate market, and last year it introduced policies to curb it. The real estate industry crackdown clipped Evergrande's wings, stopped it taking on more debt and had the flow-on effect of forcing it to sell apartments at a discount so cash would continue rolling in. Further reducing the value of some Evergrande developments is an abundance of empty apartments in some of China's less populous and attractive cities. A company announcement on the Hong Kong stock exchange last week said a downturn in contracts meant the company expected ""tremendous pressure on the group's cash flow and liquidity"", blaming ""negative media reports"" for a drop in buyer confidence. What does all this mean? Evergrande is worried it won't be able to sell apartments quickly enough to meet its debt repayments. Suppliers and even some employees who were encouraged to invest in the company have been showing up outside its headquarters, demanding restitution. Adding to its woes is the fact it has already sold an estimated 1.4 million as-yet unbuilt apartments to off-the-plan buyers, and it's not clear if it can afford to finish building them. As a sign of the depth of its problems, its second-largest shareholder, Chinese Estate Holdings, has announced it will pull out of Evergrande, having already jettisoned $32 million of its stake. Real estate makes up a substantial share — more than a quarter — of China's economy, which is the second largest in the world. There are fears that if Evergrande goes under, that could spark a domino effect that impacts the wider Chinese property market and economy. It was once a darling of China's booming property sector, but share markets around the world now watch in horror as Evergrande threatens to sink. As China is Australia's biggest trading partner, there could be ramifications here too. ""If there is a major slump in China's property market, then it has a major effect on economic growth, which of course has a huge impact on global growth, and of course is bad for Australian commodities,"" Shane Oliver from AMP capital said. Australian iron ore is exported to China to make steel, much of which is used for for construction, so a crash in property sales and apartment developments could hit our exports. For context, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says Australia exported almost $85 billion worth of iron ore and concentrates to China in 2019-20. Iron ore prices have already tumbled by as much as 60 per cent from record levels set just a few months ago, as fears about China’s economy have intensified. Since highs reached in mid-Janurry, Evergrande's share price has plummeted 85 per cent, as the extent of its problems have become clear. Things came to a head this week amid intense speculation the company would default on a series of key repayments. The immediate concern over the company has abated somewhat, after the company vowed to pay some of the bond interest payments it had been feared to default on today. It has not elaborated on how it will achieve this, other than saying it has reached an agreement with some creditors. But questions remain over a separate $115.5 million payment due today, or a $65.7 million dollar bond interest payment due next week. In the wrong circumstances, financial panic can be as contagious as a cold. Much has been said about the potential (or lack thereof) for Evergrande to end up like US investment bank Lehman Brothers, whose collapse marked a turning point in the global financial crisis. However, experts have said an Evergrande collapse would be far less likely to trigger a global crisis. “A managed default or even messy collapse of Evergrande would have little global impact beyond some market turbulence,” Simon MacAdam of UK economics research firm Capital Economics said. However, that hasn't stopped global markets falling as D-Day for Evergrande has drawn nearer. It's not clear. Although, as we mentioned, the company says it will meet some bond interest repayments due today. That announcement was met with relief in global markets, however the underlying issues with the company remain, and experts expect the Chinese government will step in at some point. Investors are waiting to see what Chinese regulators might do, but analysts say they appear to be focused on protecting home buyers by ensuring apartments already paid for are completed. The Chinese government has injected money into other insolvent companies in the past, but economists say Beijing appears determined to avoid doing that with Evergrande. However other options, like a debt restructuring arrangement, may be on the table.

140,"Evergrande's partial debt payment boosts markets, ASX gains 1 per cent",markets,"  Evergrande's partial debt payment boosts markets, ASX gains 1 per cent Australians shares have followed Wall Street's positive mood, as market focus remains on Chinese property developer Evergrande and its pledge to pay back part of its mountain of debt. By the close, the ASX 200 index was 1 per cent higher at 7,370, while the broader All Ordinaries index posted an even stronger 1.2 per cent rise. All sectors of the local market gained, led by a 2.9 per cent jump in energy stocks based on rising oil prices, and 164 of the top 200 companies gained ground, compared to just 28 that fell. Mining giant BHP was among the most notable declines, slipping 0.7 per cent, while gold miners dominated the list of falls as investors walked away from 'safe haven' assets such as the precious metal. On the flip side, consumer cyclicals did well on the general optimism, with travel companies such as Flight Centre (+5.2pc), Webjet (+5.6pc) and Corporate Travel Management (+6.6pc) among the top 10 gains on the ASX 200. News Corp (+8.4pc) had the strongest rise, with Whitehaven Coal (+7.2pc) and Kogan (+6.4pc) also performing strongly. Buy now, pay later firm Zip rose 4.9 per cent to $6.83 after yesterday announcing a foray into the Indian market with a $70 million investment in ZestMoney. Premier Investments gained 4.4 per cent just after posting its full-year results. The retail chain controlled by Solomon Lew boosted its net profit by almost 100 per cent. Net profit rose from $137 million in the 2019-2020 financial year to $271 million the following. That period covers much of the pandemic and was despite some of its stores being closed nationally and overseas due to COVID lockdowns. Sales were buoyed by online shopping. The company has stood firm on only returning $15.6 million in JobKeeper that it has received during the pandemic. It already announced it would return this in May. The company also received another $68.7 million in wage subsidies that it hasn't returned. It said this covers subsidies received in global markets too and the company will not reveal how much of that amount relates to JobKeeper payments from the Federal Government. It also noted that it stopped receiving JobKeeper subsidies altogether in late September 2020. Premier owns retail chains including Peter Alexander, Just Jeans, Jay Jays, Portmans, Dotti and Jacqui E. Its stock pared back to a 3.1 per cent gain by the close. But all the focus is now back on Evergrande. Evergrande's financial woes and failure to pay back debt on time have been rocking markets globally and leading to fears of a 'Lehman' style collapse. However, yesterday the company soothed fears by pledging to make a bond interest payment this week. Its main unit, Hengda Real Estate Group, said it had ""resolved"" one coupon payment due on Thursday on its Shenzhen-traded 5.8 per cent September 2025 bond via ""private negotiations"". It did not specify how much interest would be paid or when. Nor did Hengda mention Evergrande's other pressing debts, leaving it unclear what this means for $US83.5 million in dollar bond interest payments due on Thursday. It also has a $US47.5 million dollar-bond interest payment due next week. It was once a darling of China's booming property sector, but share markets around the world now watch in horror as Evergrande threatens to sink. Evergrande's woes have seen its shares fall 85 per cent from a peak earlier this year. However, they mounted a stunning recovery on the Hong Kong stock exchange today, up 18 per cent for the session by 4:30pm AEST, despite continued uncertainty over what will happen to the rest of the company's massive debt pile. ""We are uncertain of how far and how strong the ripple effect would be on the housing market and the developer industry,” analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a recent note. “We think investors should remain on the sideline until there is more clarity.” NAB analysts this morning noted that commodity prices were indicating that the Evergrande saga may not have as wide an impact as initially feared. Iron ore is needed in construction and it is Australia's biggest export to China. ""The biggest market reactions since the local market shut shop yesterday have been in commodities, but these pre-date the Fed announcements,"" NAB said. ""On the Singapore futures exchange, iron ore had recovered to around $US100 at 4:00pm AEST Wednesday and is currently near $US110, while both WTI and Brent crudes are up +/- $US1.50. ""Base metals are smartly higher, both copper and aluminium by more than 3 per cent. ""So for now, fears that Evergrande, and perhaps other China property developers’ woes will see sharply reduced demand for home building commodities (and where Australia would be most directly impacted) look to have eased somewhat."" The Australian dollar continues to yo-yo, buying 72.5 US cents at 4:30pm AEST. Meanwhile on global markets, the US Federal Reserve said that it would ""soon"" start to wind back spending on asset purchases, initiated during the pandemic's height to help the economy, a process known as ""tapering"". It boosted Treasury security buying by at least $US80 billion per month in late 2020 and agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $US40 billion per month. ""These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses,"" the board said in a statement. ""If progress continues broadly as expected, the committee judges that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted."" While trading was choppy following the Fed's latest policy statement and comments by chairman Jerome Powell, stocks finished close to where they were before the central bank news. ANZ analysts noted that investors actually responded more to comments made by Fed chair Jerome Powell at a press conference, which were stronger than the statement. ""The US dollar spiked by 0.5 per cent because of FOMC Chair Powell’s hawkish remarks at his press conference,"" the analysts said. ""Powell said a taper announcement 'could come as soon as the next meeting' and that the tapering process will be completed by mid‑2022. ""His comments suggest tapering will be at a pace of $US15/bn per month. ""We continue to expect the FOMC will announce a taper at its November meeting, with implementation in December."" Mr Powell said the tapering would depend on the next round of jobs data. The Fed left interest rates at 0 to 0.25 per cent. However, half of its members now expect a rate hike in 2022. ""Judging from the market reactions across bond, currencies and equities, we can conclude that Mr Market did a remarkably good job of correctly anticipating what would be revealed out of the latest FOMC meeting,"" NAB analysts said this morning. ""The Fed’s communication strategy deserves to be applauded, all the more so given some wildly differing views evident in the public utterances of Fed official in recent months."" Ten-year Treasury yields are slightly down.

141,ASX closes higher as Evergrande vows to pay interest and Fed tapering looms,markets,"  ASX swings around as 'Lehman' fears over Evergrande debated, while Fed tapering looms After a rocky start, the ASX 200 finished on a high on Wednesday and Wall Street responded positively to Evergrande's pledge to make bond interest payments. In early trade, the ASX 200 was down 0.3 per cent. That was following mixed trade on Wall Street, the possibility of US tapering, and the ongoing woes of Chinese property developer Evergrande. But by afternoon trade, the ASX 200 had turned around and even touched 0.8 per cent up. It eventually finished 0.3 per cent higher. That turnaround in sentiment came as Evergrande told the market that it would make a bond interest payment this week, after a Chinese annual holiday. There had been fears that Evergrande would default on payments and lead to a 'Lehman' moment for the Chinese construction industry. Shares in the Hong Kong-listed company had dived on open this morning but it recovered in morning (local time) trade. At 4:30pm AEST, it was down 0.4 per cent. It was once a darling of China's booming property sector, but share markets around the world now watch in horror as Evergrande threatens to sink. Meanwhile, Dow Jones futures also rose on the news. At 4:30pm AEST, they were up 0.5 per cent. The offshore yuan was also rebounding as the People's Bank of China boosted liquidity to avert a potential systemic credit crunch. Evergrande's pledge to pay bond interest payments came after its director tried to soothe the market as well. In an effort to revive battered confidence in the firm, Evergrande's chairman Hui Ka Yuan said in a letter to staff the company was confident it would ""walk out of its darkest moment"" and deliver property projects as pledged. Yet Mr Hui did not elaborate how that would be achieved. Shares in other Chinese property stocks were still being rattled on Wednesday by the saga. However, the real estate index had started to rise by 3 per cent after starting down nearly 2 per cent. China's banking sub-index was down nearly 3 per cent. ""We are uncertain of how far and how strong the ripple effect would be on the housing market and the developer industry,” analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a recent note. “We think investors should remain on the sideline until there is more clarity.” NAB analysts said initial catastrophic fears over the Evergrande saga were overstated. ""Market sentiment remains fragile ahead of the (Federal Reserve meeting) and also ahead of Evergrande’s interest payments on two bonds worth $119.5m, due on Thursday,"" they said. ""Overall though it appears market fears of an Evergrande's 'Lehman' moment have calmed as analysts put their faith in China's authorities to undertake an orderly restructuring."" This all came after a mixed trade in the US. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 were both near flat, however the Nasdaq finished 0.2 per cent up, with gains by the likes of Tesla (1.26pc), Apple (0.3pc) and Facebook (0.5pc). Other headline agendas that could influence the market include a looming meeting by the US Federal Reserve. It is set to meet in the next 24 hours, where it could possibly move to taper economic stimulus brought in during the pandemic. Strong performers on Wednesday on the ASX 200 included energy stocks. Some of the top performers were iron ore company Champion Iron with a 5.3 per cent gain turning around losses earlier in the week. There had been fears that the collapse of Evergrande could have wider ramifications on the construction industry in China, which relies heavily on Australia's biggest export. Benchmark iron ore futures also slumped on Friday as Beijing considered including more cities in its environmental controls. The iron ore price has halved in the past six weeks to $US106 a tonne and experts predict it may yet fall to $US70, but the WA government says there is no need for panic. Rio Tinto was also up 2.7 per cent, BHP up 2.4 per cent, and Fortescue was up 4.2 per cent. Other performers on the ASX 200 included energy stocks Worley (+5.5pc) and Beach (+5.31pc). Drags on the market included Premier Investments with a loss of 4.5 per cent. Premier, which owns retail chains like Just Jeans and Peter Alexander, is set to disclose its company results on Thursday. Financials also took a hit. Overall, 121 stocks ended up on Wednesday. In some other major news to come out of the UN General Assembly, Chinese president Xi Jinping has said the superpower would stop building coal-fired power plants overseas. Environmental activists have hailed the move, because China currently supports more than half the coal power projects in pre-development in other countries. The president said that, instead, China would step up its support for developing nations to build green and low-carbon energy. South Korea and Japan have also pledged to stop building coal-fired power stations overseas. ANZ analysts noted today that commodity markets had stabilised after a heavy sell-off on Monday, although price performance ""varied across sectors"". ""Energy gained some ground with prices inching higher for oil, gas and coal,"" the analysts said. ""Precious metals benefitted from safe-haven demand and the weaker US dollar."" Gold is down 0.2 per cent, to $US3.10. In other news, Disney has lost 4.1 per cent after its boss announced that the resurgence of COVID-19 was delaying the production of some of its TV shows.

142,analysis: Evergrande's collapse could be very bad news for Australia and the world. Here's why,markets,"  Evergrande's collapse could be very bad news for Australia and the world. Here's why For the first time since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in late 2008, there is a serious risk of global financial contagion. That is, there is a possibility that investors, en masse, will withdraw their cash from major institutions around the world and those banks in turn will not be able to meet their own funding or lending obligations. It's colloquially known as a ""credit crunch"". If that ensues, much economic activity will grind to a halt and unemployment will spike. You end up in a deep global recession, as happened during the global financial crisis of 2008, after Lehman Brothers collapsed. In the weeks ahead, we could see a development that has the potential to spark such a series of events. China is the world's second biggest economy. Its property sector makes up 25 per cent of gross domestic product or GDP. Evergrande is China's second biggest property developer, the world's most indebted, and it's in severe financial distress. Inside sources have told financial news service Bloomberg that Evergrande already missed interest payments to two of its largest bank lenders on Monday. To the relief of financial markets Evergrande Group's onshore property unit, Hengda Real Estate, says it will make a 232 million renminbi ($49.5 million) interest payment for its 5.8 per cent 2025 bond ton Thursday. The bond covenants also state there's a 30-day grace period before a missed payment on that dollar note would become a default, according to the bond covenants. But there are at least eight more coupon payments due before the end of the year, one which is more than double the size of Thursday's repayment. Do you see where this is going? AMP Capital's head of investment strategy, Shane Oliver, says there's a ""serious risk"" of financial contagion. ""It could set off a contagion through the Chinese credit system, making it harder for other property developers and other borrowers to get funds,"" he warns. ""But it could also set off forced sales of properties, having the effect of pushing down, or crashing, the Chinese property market."" A Chinese property market crash would cripple China's economy. China is Australia's largest trading partner, so this has obvious and sizeable flow-on effects for Australia's economic growth, stock market and superannuation balances. Once a symbol of glittering success, China's biggest property group is tanking, dragging many of its competitors with it, writes Ian Verrender. ""If there is a major slump in China's property market, then it has a major effect on economic growth, which of course has a huge impact on global growth, and of course is bad for Australian commodities,"" Oliver explains. BHP Group is already down 30 per cent from its peak earlier this year as the price of its signature product, iron ore, has collapsed more than 60 per cent, albeit from record highs. The share market is also just coming off all-time highs, and analysts say will be easily spooked by any news that has the potential to rattle investors. Freefalling stock markets also have the potential to drag economies down too, as firms pull back on investment projects and delay the hiring of workers. However, there is another financial bogey man. Many emerging countries, including China, borrow in US dollars. As it stands, there's a total of $4 trillion in outstanding debt held by all emerging economies, according to Canadian research and analytics company BCA. China's outstanding foreign debt, according to China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, totals $US2.29 trillion. Investors are concerned that if there's even a whiff that some large Chinese companies may struggle to make good on their foreign debt obligations, other emerging economies might quickly find themselves in trouble. China has wiped out more than $1 trillion from its biggest tech firms, and the billionaires facing the greatest risk are the ones whose power and influence rivals that of Xi Jinping. It is a reminder of the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998, and other emerging market US dollar debt crises before and since. This presents the risk of another global financial crisis, according to private investor and financial writer Danielle Ecuyer. This is especially the case if global nervousness around property market developments in China cause investors to buy up billions of US dollars as a safe haven investment. ""The dual effect — slowing [Chinese] economic growth, or problems in the property market, and you've got US-dollar-denominated debt, and the currency (US dollar) is strengthening — then you can see how the payments become more untenable,"" Ecuyer says. That is, other large Chinese companies would be at risk of struggling with their own debt repayments because the value of the US dollar was rising. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Both Shane Oliver and Danielle Ecuyer say the Chinese government will attempt to restructure Evergrande's debt. Global banking giant Barclays' China team also points out that most of Evergrande's roughly $2 trillion renminbi ($419 billion) in debts are domestic unlike, for example, Lehman Brothers' global exposure. ""More than 50 per cent — over RMB1 trillion — is accounts payable and acceptance bills,"" they note. ""Another RMB279bn — $US42 billion, which is 14 per cent of liabilities — is wealth management products (WMP), sold to  retail investors [mainly Chinese households]. It was once a darling of China's booming property sector, but share markets around the world now watch in horror as Evergrande threatens to sink. ""These could be a source of social trouble in the event of large-scale defaults [Chinese authorities have bailed out some WMPs in other cases, but each case seems to be handled on its own merits]."" Rabobank analyst Michael Every also believes the financial risks will be contained. ""This is a property developer, not a bank,"" he emphasises. ""We are well aware of how vulnerable the international system is now top to bottom, left to right, whereas pre-Lehmans there was this assumption that everything was going to be fine. ""And most of what is happening is going to be ring fenced within China. ""There's a way to thread the needle, potentially. ""You make sure bond holders get hit – anyone who dived in and thought speculating on this is the right way to go, they can get punished. Equity holders can get hit. ""You can then bailout ordinary households and say ordinary people shouldn't be hit and, more importantly, on the other side, what do you think Evergrande should look like if it still exists."" This risk though is that Evergrande is the tip of the iceberg in terms of companies' debt exposure, and global financial markets anticipate this in coming days, causing mass selling of all assets. European banks, according to Bloomberg, are directly exposed. They include UBS and BNP Paribas, with other global financial giants such as BlackRock and Royal Bank of Canada also in the firing line. This is unlikely to be another Lehman Brothers moment simply because Evergrande is not an investment bank, and we're unlikely to discover a global chain of trillions of dollars in worthless mortgage-backed securities held by major investment banks, as happened in 2008. However, China's ability to contain a financial disaster is about to be tested and, if it fails, an over-excited and leveraged financial system may not be able to cope with the fallout. The world's financial system might well be staring at its biggest test since the global financial crisis, even as economies struggle to regain lost ground from the COVID pandemic.

144,"Global markets take a hit amid fears of Evergrande 'contagion', but ASX ends up",markets,"  Global markets take a hit amid fears of Evergrande 'contagion', but ASX ends up The ASX 200 has defied global sentiment to make a gain on Tuesday, despite international markets trending down on fears the potential collapse of Chinese property developer Evergrande would have a ""contagion"" effect. The ASX 200 started the day's trade in negative territory but by lunchtime, it had turned around. It ended up 0.4 per cent up to 7,274 points. The day's top stock was AusNet Services after it received yet another takeover bid, this time from APA Group at $2.60 a share. Several mining stocks, including Whitehaven and Champion Iron, also ended up around 4 per cent. BHP was also up 0.6 per cent, Rio Tinto up 0.5 per cent, and Fortescue up 0.3 per cent. This was after losses to mining stocks on Monday and ongoing concerns about a construction downturn in China. Meanwhile, stocks hit by the COVID downturn, including Flight Centre and Corporate Travel Management, were up around 3.5 per cent each. On the flip side, financials were down. NAB was the biggest loser with 0.9 shaved off its stock. CBA lost 0.5 per cent, Westpac was 0.4 per cent down, while ANZ was flat. APA Group was by far the day's biggest loser with 4.7 per cent off. That signalled investors didn't like its upped bid for AusNet to $2.60. Overall, 130 of 200 top stocks ended up. On Monday, the benchmark ASX 200 dived 2.1 per cent, or 155 points, to close at 7,248.2 points — taking it back to where it was in June. It suffered as iron ore-dependent stocks were struck by diving commodity prices. The steel made from iron ore is a key material in the construction sector and Australia's most crucial export to China. The commodity's slumping price comes amid concerns over the future of one of China's biggest property developers, Evergrande. The Australian dollar remains near US$72.50. ""Weaker iron ore prices and contagion fears from China’s Evergrande are weighing on AUD,"" CBA analysts noted on Tuesday morning. The day's ASX trade came after US markets took a hit overnight. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 both lost 1.7 per cent. However, it was the tech-heavy Nasdaq that dived the most, with a loss of 2.2 per cent, down to 14,714 points. This is all happening over fears about China's slowing economy and the woes of property developer Evergrande. Evergrande's woes began when Beijing slapped strict rules on the Chinese real estate industry last August. Economists say the potential collapse of that company could ""be the biggest test that China's financial system has faced in years."" Shares in Evergrande on the Hong Kong share market closed down 10.2 per cent, at $HK2.28. The company has been scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders, suppliers and investors. Investors moved into safe havens overnight, with US Treasuries gaining in price, pulling down yields, and the gold price rising. ""It started with the problems with China's Evergrande real estate company and I think it just has become a contagion,"" said US analyst Peter Tuz. ""Everybody was kind of afraid of September for this very reason. ""It seems to be the month [that] you have significant sell-offs and here we go."" It was once a darling of China's booming property sector, but share markets around the world now watch in horror as Evergrande threatens to sink. Another US analyst, David Bahnsen, said he did not see any ""systemic risk"" to the global economy from the Evergrande saga. ""While the Evergrande situation is front and centre, the reality is, stock market valuations are overstretched,"" he wrote in a note. ""And the market has enjoyed too long of a break from volatility and Monday's stock market declines are not surprising. ""On a down market day, it's easy to look to the nearest headline like Evergrande and attach a cause and effect. ""But this market has experienced almost no downside volatility for a long time and a pullback was long overdue."" The Evergrande saga will continue to ramp up this week with a decision on its debt levels looming. ""Evergrande will likely default on its debt this week,"" CBA analysts said this morning. ""However, we doubt the government will bail out Evergrande by using public funds. Instead, we believe the most likely scenario is that local government in Guangdong province will nominate a working group to manage an orderly restructuring. ""We expect the restructuring will take years to complete."" Once a symbol of glittering success, China's biggest property group is tanking, dragging many of its competitors with it, writes Ian Verrender. Local analyst Michael Every said the bigger picture question was what happens after the Evergrande saga comes to a head. ""Everyone knows that China's property sector is over-leveraged and its households are over-leveraged,"" Mr Every wrote today. ""Far too much 'productive' physical output is channelled into building empty concrete high-rise boxes as a 'store of wealth', despite the fact they crumble over time and the population is about to shrink. ""Indeed, the key question is what the Chinese growth model looks like after Evergrande is resolved?"" ""It is a question that everyone is looking for an answer to. The West, with similar problems, has no idea. ""That’s why all we do is blow asset bubble after asset bubble while burbling 'Build Back Better'."" Meanwhile, AusNet has received another takeover offer. Shares in AusNet surged 19.2 per cent on Monday after the power grid owner received an improved $9.6 billion takeover offer of $2.50 a share by Canadian infrastructure giant Brookfield. The owner and operator of Victoria's electricity transmission network, AusNet, has now received a bumped-up offer from APA. APA told the ASX this morning its bid was for $2.60 per share. It had previously offered $2.32 in early September. APA is a local energy infrastructure group and the company said a merger would create a company with $20 billion growth potential and the ability to pursue the decarbonisation of Australia's energy needs.

145,Is your area one of Brisbane's new million-dollar suburbs?,markets,"  Brisbane has welcomed five new suburbs to the million-dollar club. Property experts say the new additions have come about as a result of the pandemic, low interest rates and a market playing catch up. So what's driving prices up the ladder and is it as simple as supply and demand? These are the Brisbane suburbs where the median house price just moved above the $1 million mark, according to data from the Real Estate Institute of Queensland (REIQ): REIQ chief executive Antonia Mercorella said the results might surprise some Queenslanders. ""There are a few surprising suburbs making that list, the likes of Wishart, Stretton and Morningside,"" she said. ""Of course, Woolloongabba also features on that list and Windsor, so certainly those aren't surprising."" It is no surprise to real estate agent Alistair Macmillan, who had in excess of 100 inspections for a two-bedroom, one-bathroom property in Windsor recently. ""On the day of the auction we ended up with 22 registered bidders,"" Ms Macmillan said. ""The reserve on the property was at $1 million, we announced it on the market at $1,000,020 with the final sale price being $1,220,000."" It was a great outcome for the Brown family, who bought the property six years ago. ""It's probably exceeded our expectations, but we knew that it was close to the city, had access to trains, nice parks, nice street — we knew that it would appreciate, but we just weren't sure how it was going to go,"" Drew Brown said. ""It's definitely given us a great foundation for the next part of our life."" Ms Mercorella said Brisbane was playing catch up on house prices. ""We've had quite modest growth over a number of years so some of this is just catching up,"" she said. ""Of course, then when you factor in very low interest rates and a pandemic over the top of that, it is making property incredibly appealing."" Mr Macmillan said for those looking to sell, the current market is exceptional. ""It doesn't get any better than this; huge demand, stocks incredibly tight,"" he said. Real estate agent Darren Bonehill said he had seen the same trend at Morningside in Brisbane's south-east. ""We've seen increasing demand, there's a lot of buyers out there driven by the low interest rates and that's pushing people to pay more and more for properties,"" Mr Bonehill said. ""It's creating a competitive environment and with a massive shortage of stock the prices are really accelerating at the moment."" It is a market giving the Chandler family confidence to upsize. ""We need some more rooms for the kids, bigger land and just a bit more play area for everyone,"" Ross Chandler said. They were happy to hear Morningside had made it to the million-dollar club after buying in the area 17 years ago. ""We just knew we had to get into the market at the time and back then we were told we paid too much for it, so the market's been very exciting over the years and particularly now,"" Mr Chandler said. Ms Mercorella said strong growth looks set to continue for some time. ""There's no signs of anything slowing down at this stage,"" she said. ""We have very low interest rates that are likely to remain low for a number of years to come. ""Queensland has just been announced as the Olympic winner and whilst that's still some time away, we will of course benefit from the extraordinary infrastructure that will be put in place for that event. ""Interstate migration rates are the highest they've been for over two decades, so all of those factors combined tend to indicate that the property market will continue to move at a very strong and northerly pace."" In short, the news is not good for prospective buyers. Mr Macmillan said he doesn't anticipate things getting easier anytime soon. ""It's very difficult to see that the market is going to retract in the coming years, certainly in the short term,"" he said. ""Perhaps maybe it can't sustain the level of growth that it has done over the previous 12 months, but certainly the notion that the market's going to retract in the short term is not accurate."" While the median sale price is $780,000 in the local government area of Brisbane, the median across Greater Brisbane is a more manageable $575,000. Ms Mercorella said there is still hope for those wanting to get their foot in the door. ""There is still relatively good affordability here in Brisbane — and indeed in Greater Brisbane — so it really is just a matter of doing your research,"" she said. ""You may not be able to buy in your preferred suburb of choice, but look for those neighbouring suburbs that are on the rise."" The latest data from REIQ shows more suburbs are expected to join the million club within the next 12 months. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. That will be good news for home owners in these suburbs: Ms Mercorella said it is important to remember that while prices are high, sellers need to consider the fact that they'll be buying back into the same market. ""Really important that if you are selling and then looking to buy again, that you might want to consider the order of things,"" she said.

146,Bitcoin price slumps as El Salvador makes it legal tender,markets,"  Bitcoin price tumbles as El Salvador makes it legal currency; commodities weigh down ASX Bitcoin plunged on the day that central American country El Salvador adopted the cryptocurrency as legal tender. Meanwhile, technology stocks drove the Nasdaq to a new record high. The Federal Court found Colonial First State deceived superannuation customers by causing them to stay in a higher-fee fund El Salvador's sovereign bonds fell as much as 6 percentage points in secondary market trading, to 87.11, as the price of bitcoin dropped sharply. Bitcoin prices dropped as much as 18 per cent, to around $US43,119, a low not seen since mid-August, according to financial markets news service Refinitiv Eikon. At 4:50pm AEST, Bitcoin had recovered some losses and was at $US45,240 per digital coin. Market traders have said the sharp sell off was also caused by a Supreme Court ruling allowing El Salvador's President, Naib Bukele, to serve two consecutive terms. In June, markets reacted negatively when El Salvador said it would become the first country to accept the cryptocurrency as legal tender. The local share market ended the day lower after commodity prices fell overnight and a number of companies traded ex-dividend. Miners, healthcare stocks, consumers and real estate companies weighed on the market. Banks, oil stocks and utilities made gains. The All Ordinaries index dropped by one-quarter of a percentage point to 7,808, off its lows. The ASX 200 index lost the same percentage and closed at 7,512. The best performer on the ASX 200 was investment bank Macquarie Group (+4.7pc) after it delivered a trading update. Macquarie rose despite predicting a ""slightly lower"" first-half profit. Also going up were investment firm Washington H Soul Pattinson (+5.6pc) and business software firm Technology One (+4.7pc). Technology One soared to a record high after it agreed to buy Scientia Resource Management, a UK company servicing the higher education sector. Leading the falls were gold miners St Barbara (-6.7pc), Northern Star Resources (-5.3pc), and auto parts firm Eagers Automotive (-5.9pc). Logistics and transport firm Qube rose 4.6 per cent after saying it would pay $90 million to buy export grain facility Newcastle Agri Terminal in NSW. Gold and oil prices fell again overnight as investors worried about demand for fuel and amid rising COVID-9 infections around the globe. But they steadied today. At 4:50pm AEST, spot gold was flat at $US1,794.65 an ounce and Brent crude oil rose half a per cent to $US72.04 a barrel. The Australian dollar was down one-fifth of a per cent in late afternoon trade to around 73.70 US cents, coming off the day's high. A court has found that the Commonwealth Bank-owned investment firm Colonial First State (CFS) misled and deceived superannuation customers to keep them in a higher fee fund. In a case brought by the corporate regulator, the Federal Court ruled the trustees of CFS's First Choice fund were liable for encouraging members of the fund to reamin rather than move to a cheaper MySuper product, a low-fee product required by law. The court found that, on at least 12,978 occasions, Colonial First State made misleading representations regarding investment decisions. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said superannuation fund members needed to ""receive clear and accurate information to make informed decisions"". ""ASIC alleged Colonial made misleading representations which may have impacted members' decisions about where to keep their funds and may have resulted in members' funds being kept in higher fee-paying super products that included commissions,"" Ms Court said. ""These actions did not put members' interests first,"" Ms Court said. The Court declared that, between March 18, 2014, and July 21, 2016, CFS engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct by sending 12,911 letters to members containing misleading representations about investment directions. It also found that CFS made false or misleading representations and engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in 70 calls to members about investment directions and failed to provide a ""general advice warning"", as required by the Corporations Act in 17 calls to members. Colonial agreed to the declarations being made and a penalty hearing will be held next month. It is the latest investment firm found to have misled superannuation customers. Commonwealth Bank shares rose three quarters of a per cent to $102.92. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq reached a new record high, driven by IT giant Apple and streaming service Netflix. The S&P 500 closed lower as investors balanced worries about the slowing pace of economic recovery with expectations that the Federal Reserve would maintain its accommodative monetary policy. Apple rose almost 1.6 per cent and Netflix added 2.7 per cent, both hitting record highs. Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Tom Martin said investors were gravitating towards Big Tech. ""As people feel a bit uncertain about how COVID will play out, you don't have your reopening worries with those companies,"" he said. The rest of the market was less optimistic. Of the sub-indices, eight of the 11 traded lower, with economy-sensitive sectors such as industrials, utilities and real estate indices all dropping. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8 per cent, to end at 35,100 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.3 per cent, to 4,520, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.07 per cent, to 15,374. The S&P 500 remains up about 20 per cent, year to date, and the Nasdaq is up about 19 per cent. Boeing dropped 1.8 per cent after Ireland's Ryanair said it had ended talks with the plane-maker over the purchase of 737 MAX 10 jets worth tens of billions of dollars, due to differences over price. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced higher taxes while Bank of England policy maker Michael Saunders said interest rates rises are expected to be limited. The tax increase is to help rescue Britain's health system, the National Health Service, from huge backlogs caused by the COVID-19 crisis. National insurance, a payroll tax, will rise by 1.25 per cent from next year with the increases expected to raise 36 billion pounds ($67 billion) over the next three years. The FTSE 100 fell 0.6 per cent, to 7,149.

147,"ASX 200 recovers after early losses, Telstra flags mandatory vaccination policy",markets,"  ASX 200 recovers after early losses, Telstra flags mandatory vaccination policy The Australian share market has recovered to finish in positive territory, as Fortescue takes a hit and another major company flags mandatory vaccination of its staff. At 1:30pm AEST, the ASX 200 was down 0.5 per cent to 5,448. But it recovered to close 0.1 per cent up. More than 100 companies finished in the green. The biggest loser was Fortescue Metals, which shed 10.9 per cent. That latest drop has plunged Fortescue's share price down 30 per cent from the record high of $26.58 it reached at the end of July. It comes as FMG shares go ex-dividend today for its upcoming final dividend payment. FMG announced during its recent company results that shareholders will get a sizeable dividend of $2.11. Other losers on Monday included Pro Medicus (-5.8pc), Pro Medicus (-5.8pc), Pilbara Metals (-5.3pc), Lendlease (-4.3pc) and Viva Energy (-3.1pc). The financials had a mixed day, with Westpac marginally down (-0.1pc) but rivals CBA, ANZ and NAB all up between 0.2 to 0.8 per cent. On the flip side, the strongest performer was Appen, with a gain of 4.6 per cent. Miners in gold and metals performed well. Telstra has emailed its staff with a proposal to make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for 8,300 frontline staff. That staff are those who work in customer-facing roles. It does not include staff who work from home or offshore. Chief executive Andy Penn told staff they would consult for a week over the policy. ""We will start a one-week consultation period with you, our unions and some of our partners on a proposed COVID vaccination policy,"" he wrote. ""We would require people in these roles to get their first vaccination by 15 October and the second by 15 November. That said, we would be flexible if there are vaccine supply issues. ""We would also add this requirement to employment contracts for new starters in these types of roles – whether they are new to Telstra or transferring from another role. ""At this stage we are not proposing to make getting vaccinated a requirement for people who can work from home. But this is something we may consider down the track, particularly once more of us start to head back into the office and meet up in person. ""I understand some people may choose not to get vaccinated – whether that is for personal or medical reasons. But given what’s at stake when it comes to protecting people’s health we would only consider exceptions on established medical grounds."" It follows several companies now coming out with various vaccination policies, including food company SPC. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia is set to make a decision on whether it will reduce, or taper, its economic stimulus at its monthly meeting on Tuesday. Analysts are predicting that it will hold off for now as COVID cases continue to rise, locking down Sydney and Melbourne. ""An alternative choice is to continue with taper, but delay the next review until February,"" ANZ predicted. ""We think a simple delay is much easier to communicate than this alternative. ""We would emphasise that this decision is likely to be a close call.""

148,ASX falls but Woolworths resilient despite COVID crisis,markets,"  ASX in the red, Woolworths sees profit surge but other big names stung by coronavirus pandemic The Australian share market has ended a three-day winning streak amid mixed earnings reports, with supermarket chain Woolworths making an annual profit, but travel firms such as Qantas and Flight Centre posting coronavirus-linked losses. By the close, the All Ordinaries index lost half a percentage point to 7,770. The ASX 200 ended down 0.5 per cent to 7,491 with most sectors in the red, led lower by utilities, miners and oil stocks. Education companies were among the few bright spots. Whitehaven Coal (+5pc) was the best performer on the ASX 200 despite swinging from profit to loss for the year because of lower sales and writedowns at its Narrabri mine in New South Wales. The coal miner made an annual after-tax loss of nearly $544 million but had an upbeat outlook that cheered up investors. There was no final dividend payout for investors. Healthcare company Blackmores soared by 15.4 per cent as its annual net profit rose nearly 90 per cent to $28.6 million as it sold more vitamins to China. Investors get a final dividend payout of 42 cents per share. Technology firm Appen plunged by one fifth after its half-year profit fell by 55 per cent to $6.7 million. Link Administration (-12.6pc) fell after it posted an annual after-tax loss of $163.4 million, despite a $150 million share buyback. Supermarket giant Woolworths saw sales rise for the 2021 financial year as online sales soared by more than half despite coronavirus challenges including supermarkets now facing worker shortages as COVID-19 positive staff go into isolation. Net profit last financial year jumped by nearly 78 per cent to just over $2 billion. Woolworths' chief executive Brad Banducci said it was ""another challenging year for our team"" and vaccination rates were the key to the economic future. ""COVID will continue to have a profound impact in F22 but making any further predictions about the year ahead remains very difficult,"" he said. ""It has become clear that vaccination is key to the safety of our team and the easing of restrictions, and we are committed to supporting vaccination efforts across the broader community,"" he said. Investors will get a higher final dividend payout of $0.55 a share along with a $2 billion share buyback in the wake of it spinning off its drinks and poker machines business Endeavour Group in June. Woolworths shares rose 0.4 per cent to $40.99. Endeavour made a net profit in 2021 of $445 million with online sales rising by one-third. Endeavour Group shares fell 2.2 per cent to $7.05. The coronavirus brought the travel industry to its knees in a year that Qantas boss Alan Joyce called ""diabolical"". After a nearly $ 2 billion loss in 2020, it made an after-tax loss of $1.7 billion for 2021. Qantas took a $12 billion hit from the COVID-19 crisis because of the closure of international borders and coronavirus restrictions at home. Not surprisingly, investors get no dividend payout for the year. Qantas shares rose 3.5 per cent to $5.04. Another firm that suffered during the coronavirus pandemic was travel agency Flight Centre, which made an annual net loss of $433 million, although it was smaller than the $662 million loss in 2020. Revenue slumped by nearly 80 per cent hit with the company hit hard by the end of the Federal Government's JobKeeper wage subsidy. Flight Centre boss Graham Turner said 2021 was ""another challenging year.....but conditions have gradually started to improve"". ""When lockdowns and borders have reopened — as they have just started to do in a more meaningful way outside of Australia and New Zealand — we have typically seen immediate and strong travel recovery, which is what we have now started to see in key locations like the US, Canada and Europe,"" he said. The travel agency said increasing vaccination rates helped its recovery gain momentum. Investors get no dividend payout for the year. Flight Centre shares rose 4 per cent to $17.01. Milk producer A2 Milk said revenue plunged by nearly one-third to $1.2 billion over last financial year. It saw net profit slump by 79 per cent to $80.7 million after stock writedowns. A2 Milk said COVID-19 had no significant impact on its business. A2 shares fell 11.8 per cent to $6.05 after it warned of continued uncertainty in supply chains and growth in China, its biggest market. COVID-19 restrictions have all but wiped out its informal diagou trade. Investment firm IOOF made a statutory loss of $143.5 million for 2021 partly because of a goodwill writedown and the costs of buying investment firm MLC from the National Australia Bank. Investors get a final dividend of 11.5 cents a share. IOOF shares fell 10.4 per cent to $4.55. Logistics and transport company Qube saw net profit for 2021 rise nearly 5 per cent to $91.6 million on an increase in revenue. Qube said the result reflected high volumes of trade across its markets including containers, grain, forestry and energy products. Qube shares fell 0.3 per cent to $3.04. Fruit and vegetable grower Costa Group saw net profit for the first half of 2021 come in at $37.5 million although revenue was flat. Investors get an interim dividend of 4 cents a share. Costa's shares fell 4.4 per cent to $3.24. South Korea's central bank has raised official interest rates by one quarter of a percentage point to curb the growth in consumer debt. Bank of Korea (BOK) governor Lee Ju-yeol and other board members lifted the seven-day repurchase rate to 0.75 per cent from a record low of 0.5 per cent. It was the first rate rise in almost three years and the Bank of Korea is the first major Asian central bank to move away from ultra low borrowing costs. Inflationary pressures are building around the world as the global economy rebounds from the pandemic. The Australian dollar slipped 0.3 per cent to 72.50 US cents at 4:50pm AEST. Spot gold dropped to $US1,784 an ounce. Brent crude oil rose 1 per cent overnight but dipped in Asian trade to $US71.90 a barrel. A new milestone has been reached for Australia's top 200 companies. For the first time in history, there are no all-male boards among ASX 200 companies, according to the Australian Institute of Company Directors (AICD). In 2015, 28 boards had no women directors. But now the last two all-male mining boards have just appointed women. When the AICD began its quarterly reporting of women on ASX 200 boards in 2015, there were 28 all-male boards. AICD CEO Angus Armour said Australia's top companies needed to continue to increase board diversity. ""This is an historical milestone for Australia that should be celebrated,"" he said. The AICD works with the 30 Per Cent Club, which campaigns to have at least one-third board of positions filled by women. 30 Per Cent Club Australia chief Nicola Wakefield Evans said when the push for gender diversity on the ASX 200 began there was a view there was not enough qualified women to meet the target. ""With nearly 500 ASX 200 board positions now held by women, that myth is well and truly busted,"" she said. ""The calibre of women on our leading boards is exceedingly high, from those who are well established to emerging directors achieving their first listed role."" The AICD is pushing for at least 40 per cent of director seats to be held by both men and women, with flexibility over the remaining 20 per cent of seats. US stocks have hit record highs ahead of the annual meeting of global central banks, with no wind back of stimulus expected just yet. Financial stocks and chipmakers helped to push the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes to record closing highs. The Dow Jones index added 0.1 per cent to 35,406, the S&P 500 put on 0.2 per cent to 4,496 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.15 per cent to 15,042. The session marked the S&P 500's 51st record high close so far this year. Investors are looking to the annual Jackson Hole Symposium, being held virtually this year, for signs from US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell that the US central bank will not ease back on stimulus and raise interest rates sooner than forecast. That was reinforced by tame economic data which showed that new orders for core capital goods were little changed last month, suggesting that business investment in equipment could slow down after robust growth earlier in the year. David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York, said it was a quiet week for investors. ""Positive news on vaccination approvals, and expectations that the Fed won't shock markets at Jackson Hole, are helping to keep equity prices higher,"" he said. ""(The) expectation is that Fed won't scare markets, and will announce only a cautious tapering."" Rising US Treasury yields boosted interest rate sensitive financial stocks and sectors that stand to gain most from economic revival, such as smaller firms and transport stocks. More companies are forcing workers to get coronavirus vaccines or penalising them if they do not after the Food and Drug Administration gave full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine The Pentagon and Delta Air Lines have mandated vaccinations and other firms such as car maker Ford are expected to follow suit.

149,ASX went ahead with system upgrade despite not being ready,markets,"  ASX crash caused by gaps in project testing as it went ahead with upgrade despite not being ready The Australian market operator says it will put in place all the findings from a report that investigated the reasons why the stock market crashed late last year after updating its operating system. The market suffered a series of outages after a new version of the Nasdaq trading system went live in mid-November. The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) commissioned the review by IBM in consultation with the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Reserve Bank. The report found gaps in project testing and compliance and the ASX failed to meet 17 out of 75 issues assessed. It said the market operator went ahead with the upgrade despite not being ready. ASIC chairman Joe Longo said the ASX's actions did not meet industry standards. ""The conclusion that the project was not ready to go live is very disappointing,"" he said. ASIC said the report discovered several key shortcomings. It is also conducting its own investigation into the outage. Dominic Stevens, ASX managing director and chief executive officer, said the outage fell short of the ASX's high standards. ""We believed that the software was ready for go-live, as did our technology provider Nasdaq,"" he said. ""Clearly there were issues, which was particularly disappointing given the significant progress we have made on resilience in recent years."" Mr Stevens said ASIC and the RBA would oversee the implementation of the recommendations. ""The report does point to some important areas for improvement and we will address all of its recommendations,"" he said. ""ASX is well advanced in developing a detailed response plan for execution over the next 12 to 18 months, and we'll commission the independent expert to review our actions to meet its recommendations."" ASX shares were up 3 per cent to $88.50 at 1:20pm AEST. Westpac was fined $10.5 million by the Federal Court after ASIC took the bank to court accusing it of breaking the Corporations Act. That's after two of its firms including BT Funds Management made 14 phone calls to consumers to encourage them to rollover their superannuation in breach of the law. The court found the subsidiaries broke the law because they did not act in the best interests of clients and were required to act honestly, efficiently and fairly. Westpac shares rose 0.1 per cent to $25.78. The Australian share market rose on Monday after the worst week since November 2020, pulled down after BHP said it would delist from the London Stock Exchange The All Ordinaries index increased 0.5 per cent to 7,761. The ASX 200 rose 0.4 per cent to 7,490 with most sectors higher, led by education, healthcare, consumer staples, real estate, banks and miners. Oil stocks and consumer discretionary firms fell. The top performing stocks were lithium firm Pilbara Minerals (+11.4pc), aerial mapping firm Nearmap (+7.4pc) and artificial intelligence company Appen (+7pc). Leading the losses were insurer NIB Holdings (-11pc ), online retailer Redbubble (-5.9pc) and early childhood education provider G8 Education (-5.7pc), which warned that lockdowns and tightening COVID-19 restrictions have hurt occupancy levels in several states. That is despite the preschool firm swinging from a net loss of $244.1 million to a net profit of $25.1 million for the half year. The Australian dollar rose 0.3 per cent to 71.56 US cents at 4:50pm AEST. Spot gold was up 0.3 per cent to $US1785 an ounce, while Brent crude oil ended a seven-day losing streak, up nearly 2 per cent to $US66.31 a barrel in afternoon trade. Fuel refiner Ampol, which was formerly known as Caltex, has made a nearly $NZ2 billion ($1.9 billion) takeover bid for New Zealand's biggest petrol retailer Z Energy. Ampol's chief executive, Matt Halliday, said buying Z Energy would make his company a marker leader across Australia and New Zealand, giving it ""regional scale"". ""Z Energy is a logical growth opportunity for Ampol as both companies are market leaders in their respective markets and have very similar business models,"" he said. Z Energy said Ampol had made three previous takeover bids while Ampol said it made a first takeover offer on June 2 and a second bid a month later. Spark Infrastructure Group accepted a takeover offer from US private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board. The bid values Spark at $5.2 billion. Spark shares put on 1.8 per cent to $2.82. It is another big week of profit results, with Qantas and Woolworths reporting later in the week. Ampol swung loss to profit for the half year driven by higher revenue from its fuel business and convenience stores. Profit for the six months to the end of June went from a loss of $626 million for the same time in 2020 to $326 million thanks to increased demand for oil because of the coronavirus rebound. Government subsidies for Ampol's Lytton refinery in Brisbane helped boost the  result. Investors get an interim dividend of 52 cents a share, fully franked, meaning the company pays the tax. However Ampol shares fell 4.8 per cent to $26.22 by the close. Insurer NIB Holdings said annual net profit surged 85 per cent to $160.5 million, which was boosted investment income of nearly $52 million and a 19 per cent return on investments. NIB managing director Mark Fitzgibbon said the ""extraordinary disruption"" of the pandemic did not prevent the company from producing a strong result. ""Neither FY21 or FY20 can be considered ""normal"" given fluctuation in healthcare utilisation and claims experience,"" he said. ""We've supported our members by postponing premium increases, providing premium waivers and suspension options, expanding cover for COVID-19-related treatment at no extra cost,"" Mr Fitzgibbon told the ASX. Real estate firm McGrath saw revenue jump by one-third for the year thanks to the booming property market. Net profit soared from just $700,000 in 2020 to $19 million in 2021. Investors get a final dividend of 1 cent a share. McGrath shares put on 3.8 per cent to $0.55. Plumbing firm Reliance Worldwide said annual net profit more than doubled to $188.2 million. Investors get a final dividend payout of 13 cents a share. Reliance shares fell 0.8 per cent to $5.89.

150,"Star and Treasury Wine lose revenue over COVID and China, while ASX 200 follows Wall Street down",markets,"  Star and Treasury Wine lose revenue over COVID and China, while ASX 200 follows Wall Street down The Australian share market is sliding on fears that economic support will be curtailed in the US, while Australian company results are mixed, due to COVID-19. The ASX 200 closed down 0.6 per cent. The worst performers included Sims (-7.6pc), Mineral Resources (-6.6pc), BHP (-6.3pc) and Codan (-8.3pc). Almost half the benchmark's stocks ended in the red. The top mover was Redbubble, with an almost 19 per cent gain. That was after the online fashion retailer posted a profit of $31 million. A 58 per cent rise in marketplace revenue was driven by sales in its biggest market, the United States. One of the biggest positive movers was civil construction company NRW Holdings (+17.4pc), after it disclosed a 11.5 per cent revenue jump in the last year. Profit also increased by $75 million. Joint NZ-listed telecom company Chorus surged by almost 15 per cent, its highest rise in nearly six years. Chorus announced that New Zealand's Commerce Commission was valuing its fibre business with a conservative estimate of $NZ5.4 billion ($5.1 billion). Origin's share price was down 4.1 cent after it posted a loss of nearly $2.3 billion. The loss was after the energy provider wrote down the value of its assets by $2.2 billion and got a tax bill. But investors still get a final dividend of 7.5 cents a share. It said conditions were challenging because of low prices, which were due to the rise of cheaper renewable energy entering the system and the impact of COVID. Australia's biggest wine company saw its profit grow only marginally after a massive hit from Chinese trade embargoes. Treasury Wine Estate's profit was up 1.9 per cent to $250m. Revenue was basically flat (+0.2pc) at $2.6 billion. Treasury has household wine brands such as Penfolds and had a big reliance on selling wine into China. China brought in almost unfeasible tariffs on Australian wine late last year, along with a range of other economic measures as trade tensions heated up. Its tariffs on Australian wine are set to last at least five years. Treasury said Chinese wine sales were down by $77 million and Asia sales overall were down 15 per cent. It reiterated that it was making up the difference by focusing on other export markets such as America and Europe. Shareholders will get 13 cents per share in dividends, fully franked. Treasury's share price was down 1.5 per cent. Another one of the big names disclosing results today is Star Entertainment. The casino operator has taken a hit of 6.5 per cent to revenue during the pandemic, although it's posted a $60 million profit rise off the back of falling operating expenses. ""COVID-19 related property shutdowns, operating restrictions and border closures materially impacted revenues across the Group's properties,"" the company said. The revenue of its Sydney casino was 30 per cent down to $8.32 billion during the 2021 financial year, with the biggest hit to its VIP base which often includes international visitors. It dubbed the restrictions on customer numbers to its Sydney casino ""onerous"". It fared marginally better at its Gold Coast casino (-28pc) but was up at its Brisbane operations (+28pc). Meanwhile, Star noted the door is still open to exploring options with the embattled Crown Resorts. Star last month withdrew its bid to merge with Crown, after a royal commission in Victoria heard Crown had been involved in illegal conduct. In its company report, it said it ""remains open to exploring value-enhancing opportunities with Crown"". Star was up 6.8 per cent. Meanwhile, gold miner Newcrest has posted a record profit for the 2021 financial year. It posted an annual after-tax profit of $US1.1 billion dollars ($1.5 billion) which was up by 80 per cent over the year. It said this was driven by higher prices of the precious commodity. The safe haven has been rising during global instability and COVID-19 with its US price up a staggering 19 per cent in the last two years. Newcrest investors will get a final dividend of 40 US cents a share, partially franked, which means the company pays part of the tax on the income. That's more than doubled last year's final dividend. Newcrest ended 1.1 per cent up, as the price of gold continued rising on commodity markets. The latest jobs data out today showed Australia's official unemployment rate dropped early on in the latest round of lockdowns. But that was because the number of people looking for work fell. The unemployment rate dipped from 4.9 per cent in June to 4.6 in July, even though only 2,200 extra people were employed. The main reason that unemployment fell, according to the ABS data, is that the participation rate dropped 0.2 percentage points to 66 per cent, as many people gave up looking for work during lockdowns. ""Because of the way the ABS measures employment, the impact of the (Sydney) lockdown on jobs will not show up until the August and September releases,"" CBA analysts said this morning before the data was released. The Bureau of Statistics says the official unemployment rate fell in July for one main reason — people in NSW stopped looking for jobs. The Australian benchmark closed marginally up yesterday. But today it took a hit after Wall Street posted losses. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 both lost more than 1 per cent in Wednesday (local time) trade with the Nasdaq only faring marginally better (-0.9pc). That comes after the release of the meeting notes from the US central bank's late July meeting. The account of the July 27-28 meeting showed officials largely expect that later this year, they will reduce the central bank's emergency monthly purchases of $US120 billion ($165.9 billion) of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. But consensus on other key issues appeared elusive, including the start date and pace of the bond-buying ""taper,"" and whether the bigger risk to the recovery is posed by inflation, ongoing joblessness, or the lurking chance that resurgent COVID cases may throw things into reverse. CBA analysts said in a briefing note this morning that it is sticking to its forecasts on tapering. ""It is worth remembering the FOMC’s July meeting took place before the bumper July non‑farm payrolls report where the unemployment rate dropped from 5.7 per cent to 5.4 per cent,"" they said. ""In addition, there will probably be some time, weeks if not several months, between an announcement of tapering and an implementation of tapering. ""So we retain our call the FOMC will announce a tapering in September followed by implementation in October or possibly November."" Despite the losses on Wall Street, US Treasury yields (future interest rates) are flat. They've been losing ground on the crisis in Afghanistan and a resurgence of the Delta strain globally. The US dollar has also dipped from its almost five-month high. That high pushed the Australian currency down towards 72 US cents yesterday. At 7:15am AEST, it was still at 72.30 US cents.

151,"CSL confirms mRNA push, as Australian dollar slips and BHP dives on Woodside deal",markets,"  CSL confirms mRNA push, as Australian dollar slips and BHP dives on Woodside deal Global investors have had mixed reactions to BHP's plan to merge with Woodside, with Australian shares in the company the biggest loser on the ASX 200 on Wednesday. Despite instability and losses on Wall Street, the ASX 200 opened up this morning. It eventually closed marginally down (-0.1pc) with 112 companies in positive territory. BHP ended down 7.1 per cent on the first day of trade after it released company results and announced a massive deal to merge with Woodside. Sims, Netwealth, and Pilbara metals were also down several percentage points. The local benchmark has been dropping all week. The Australian dollar slid further (-1pc) against the greenback overnight to just 72.52 US cents. That's a low for our local currency for 2021. Pizza chain Dominos was Wednesday's top-performing stock (+7.1pc) after it released results showing a 32 per cent rise in profit to $184 million. The global fast food chain is one of many to benefit from the pandemic, with more people ordering takeaway during lockdowns. Other top performers included Beach Energy and EML Payments. Coles revealed a net profit growth of 2.8 per cent to just over $1 billion. Much of its growth came from liquor sales rather than core supermarkets. Coles had a bumper year last year, driven by panic-buying at the start of the pandemic. It ended the day flat. Healthcare company and Australia's AstraZeneca manufacturer CSL has banked a 13 per cent profit rise during the pandemic. Net profit rose to $US2.375 billion ($3.27 billion) in 2021, with growth led by production of its core product, influenza vaccines. It distributed a record 130 million doses globally. CSL is the only company in Australia making a COVID-19 vaccine for population use and it also was working with UQ University to make a second one here until trials into that were halted. Chief executive Paul Perreault declined to reveal in a media briefing how much it had received from the federal government for the AstraZeneca deal, but said it had not been hugely profitable. ""It's absolutely not been material to date,"" he said. CSL has also confirmed that it's investigating mRNA technology, which is used in the COVID vaccines pioneered by Pfizer and Moderna. ABC News confirmed last month that CSL was one of 12 bidders to the federal government's proposal to make mRNA vaccines onshore. ""We have accelerated our research in mRNA technology, in the next-generation self-amplifying mRNA for influenza,"" CSL said. Phase one human trials are expected to start next year, it said. ""We've made what we think is a strong submission to the Australian government through their marketing process,"" Mr Perreault told the media briefing. ""We're hopeful to be able to engage in discussions around bringing onshore development and manufacturing capability to Australia."" Mr Perreault confirmed it had not engaged either Pfizer or Moderna to make their COVID vaccines here. He added that CSL's bid to the federal government's callout did not include any specific mRNA COVID vaccine partner but that the company believed its factory in Melbourne was the best-placed to make these sorts of vaccines if given a partner. CSL's share price lost 1.5 per cent. The Australian dollar is dropping as the US dollar rises on global markets for its second day. That is as investors put their weight into the safe-haven currency amid the crisis in Afghanistan and the resurgence of COVID. ""A safe-haven bid boosted the USD across the board with the kiwi leading the G10 decline over the past 24 hours,"" NAB analysts said. New Zealand's currency is sliding as it goes into a snap COVID lockdown. The nation is awaiting a policy announcement from its central bank today, with some predicting a rate hike to deal with its heated property market. ""NZD has found a base just above NZ69 cents while the AUD makes a new YTD low,"" NAB said. The overall tone in financial markets overnight was one of caution, with shares on Wall Street in the red. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.9 per cent, while the Dow Jones was down 0.8 per cent and the S&P 500 lost 0.7 per cent. BHP's stock was not only losing ground on the Australian market. In the US, BHP's listed stock plunged by almost 8 per cent to US$69.70. That was after the massive miner announced it is merging with oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum, pending regualatory approval. The $20 billion merger will create one of the world's biggest energy companies. BHP has oil and gas fields in Australia, the Gulf of Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago and Algeria. While US investors did not back the deal, BHP's stock on the UK markets did rise in trade there by 3.4 per cent. Overall, the FTSE rose by 0.4 per cent, while the DAX in Germany was flat. BHP's results were released after the Australian share market closed, which means today it could be a stock to watch when trade opens. Meanwhile, BHP's prospective partner Woodside posted a doubling in half-year profit to nearly $437 million. It said a strong rebound in fuel demand, as well as post-COVID lockdowns, helped boost its profit. Investors will get an interim dividend payout of 30 US cents a share. Woodside ended the day down 2.1 per cent. We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

152,"ASX drops as Breville loses 9pc on profit result, Domain hands back JobKeeper after property boom",markets,"  ASX drops as Breville loses 9pc on profit result, Domain hands back JobKeeper after property boom Companies are booming during the pandemic, with real estate listings site Domain making the decision to hand back JobKeeper after posting profit. The ASX 200 closed 0.9 per cent on Tuesday, with a broad sell-off that includes consumer goods, technology, mining and financials. Almost 140 of the top 200 ended in the red. The local benchmark took a slight hit on Monday too, with a loss of 0.6 per cent as extended lockdowns in Melbourne and Sydney rattle the country. The Australian dollar was down 0.5 per cent to 73.35 US cents. However, some companies are clearly profiting during the pandemic, as revealed in company results. Reporting season was in full swing on Tuesday with a long list of companies announcing results. Those disclosing results were Breville, Brambles, real estate company Charter Hall, Domain, Dexus, Magellan, Shopping Centres Australasia, SG Fleet and Sims. BHP will also release its results just after the ASX closes. Domain banked a net profit of $34.2 million. That is a 50 per cent rise on the previous period. Its stock was the day's best performer on the ASX 200 with a gain of 4.7 per cent. Overall, Domain took in $289 million in the financial year, which was also a 10 per cent rise on the previous period's revenue. Domain, which is majority-owned by media giant Nine, has been growing as the property market climbs to new heights during COVID. In March, it reached a new audience record, with 9.6 million viewings across print and digital. After announcing its growth and ""increased confidence in the property market outlook"", the company said it will hand back JobKeeper wage subsidies it received last year from the federal government. That will see it return $5.7 million to the ATO. It comes after sustained pressure on companies to hand back the subsidy if they reported an increased profit. The ABC revealed recently that $4.6 billion had been taken by companies that saw profits grow. Tax commissioner Chris Jordan has defied a Senate order calling on him to out the large companies that received JobKeeper. Meanwhile, appliance maker Breville cracked $1 billion in sales for the first time as people stuck at home during lockdown or working from home bought coffee machines and other kitchen appliances. Its overall profit is up 42 per cent to $90 million. As well as coffee machines, Breville also sells kitchen appliances like slow cookers and owns the Nespresso coffee pod brand. Breville saw sales growth in Europe, after it expanded its sales into France, Portugal and Italy. It also pushed further into the US market, although its bricks and mortar expansion there was disrupted by COVID. Most of its sales growth in the Asia-Pacific was in the first half of the financial year, as working from home patterns were entrenched over Australia's winter during COVID. Breville's bottom line was helped by higher prices. It promoted its more expensive range, and spent less on advertising. It expects the next 12 months to be a ""transitional"" year. That's based on assuming people will be spending less time at home in the kitchen, as the world opens back up again as people are vaccinated. But the devil was in the detail for Breville. It actually missed some investors' profit expectations. Its share price ended 9 per cent down, making it one of the day's worst performing stocks. But the wooden spoon on the ASX 200 went to Magellan (-10.2pc) after it revealed lower profits in its company report. The fund manager's net profit after tax was down 33 per cent at $265 million. That took its net profit down 6 per cent. Energy companies Lynas, Pilbara, Mineral Resources and Beach all ended down around 5 per cent. Westpac is considering handing money back to its shareholders when it reports its full-year results in a few months, saying it has ""excess capital and franking credits"". The bank's third-quarter update revealed that both ""stressed assets"" and 90-day mortgage delinquencies were down 9 basis points compared to the previous quarter, although 1.11 per cent of Westpac home loan customers were at least 90 days behind in their repayments. However, Westpac said there have been a ""relatively small number"" of new COVID repayment deferrals as a result of the latest lockdowns (to August 11), with around 3,700 mortgage and 725 business customers putting repayments on hold, with a total value of around $1.6 billion. The report shows about 12,000 customers with mortgages valued around $5 billion are receiving hardship assistance, such as a reduction or deferral of repayments. Westpac revealed it had 199 properties in possession in the June quarter, up slightly from the previous three months but down from 256 in the September quarter of last year. The bank also said it would account for the alleged fraud of nearly $300 million from Westpac by Forum Finance in the third quarter. The bank is currently engaged in a court case against Forum Finance and its owners, including football identity Bill Papas. Despite flagging an increased return to shareholders, Westpac was following the rest of the banking sector and the ASX lower. It ended the day 1.3 per cent down to $24.45. Oil and gas producer Santos said it looked forward to signing its agreement to take over Papua New Guinea energy firm Oil Search in coming weeks. Santos said it saw record production and record sales for the half-year as the global economy bounced back from lockdowns. The firm made $482 million for the six months to the end of June. That's after asset sales, and a big improvement from the same time last year, when it had to write down projects. Investors will get an interim dividend of 55 US cents a share. Santos ended the day 0.8 per cent down, following broader losses to the mining and mineral sector. US markets had mixed results overnight, with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 both up 0.3 per cent, but the tech-laden Nasdaq down 0.2 per cent. The biggest story rocking the Nasdaq was news that US authorities are going to investigate Tesla over its Autopilot cars crashing into emergency vehicles. Elon Musk's Tesla dropped 5 per cent on that news. One of the world's biggest companies could face a recall of its cars if the probe does not go its way. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said that since January 2018, it had identified 11 crashes in which Tesla models ""have encountered first responder scenes and subsequently struck one or more vehicles involved with those scenes"". The vehicle safety agency said it had reports of 17 injuries and one death in those crashes. One of those includes the December 2019 crash of a Tesla Model 3 that left a passenger dead after the vehicle collided with a parked fire truck in Indiana. Tesla has built 765,000 Autopilot cars since 2014 in the US. After investigating, NHTSA could opt to take no action, or it could demand a recall, which might effectively impose limits on how, when and where Autopilot operates. Any restrictions could narrow the competitive gap between Tesla’s system and similar advanced driver assistance systems offered by established carmakers. Mr Musk, one of the world's richest people, has repeatedly defended Autopilot. In April he tweeted that ""Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle.""

153,analysis: How can property and share markets hit record highs during an economic downturn?,markets,"  There's a bizarre narrative playing out in the Australian economy right now. As we stare down the potential of a so-called ""double-dip recession"", asset markets are booming. Treasury and most market economists now forecast the economy will contract by more than 2 per cent in the September quarter. There's also a credible risk economic growth in the December quarter will be negative, which would produce another ""technical"" recession. Meanwhile, both the stock and property markets keep powering ahead, with the share market regularly pushing all-time highs. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic At a fundamental level, record-low interest rates have helped drive billions of dollars worth of investments into shares and property, but there's more to it than that. While the present-day reality of COVID is being felt by millions of Australian households, the stock and property markets are looking through this to the other side, and they see blue skies. The signs of present economic weakness are clear. Retail sales slumped in June after the Greater Sydney lockdown had only been in effect for a week and the construction industry has also had disruptions — both will have ripple effects across the economy. But it's business investment that makes up a fair whack of gross domestic product, which now looks very shaky. Australian house prices are rising at their highest rate in 17 years, largely driven by the return of investors helped by housing tax breaks. One way you can tell how keen bosses are to spend on their businesses is via their hiring intentions. The latest National Skills Commission Report (August) shows the damaging economic impact of COVID-19 restrictions, particularly in New South Wales. The state recorded the strongest decline in recruitment activity over the month, down by 10.3 per cent (8,100 job advertisements). This was twice the rate of decline in the Northern Territory (down 5.2 per cent), which recorded the second-strongest percentage fall in the month. Victoria recorded the only increase in job advertisements during July 2021 (up 3.9 per cent) after recording the strongest fall in job advertisements in June 2021 (down 4.2 per cent). But the National Australia Bank's July business survey captures the overall plight of businesses: ""Both [business] conditions and confidence deteriorated sharply in [July], with the latter now back in negative territory,"" the bank reported. ""Overall, the survey shows that the strength in the business sector seen in early-to-mid 2021 has faded on the back of fresh disruptions in the economy."" On the flip side, the Australian share market has never looked so shiny. After taking the biggest dive in a generation, which began in February and March last year, stocks have since soared to new heights. There are a few key reasons for this, according to AMP Capital's head of investment strategy Shane Oliver. ""The combination of improving global growth and earnings helped by more fiscal stimulus, vaccines allowing reopening once herd immunity is reached, and still-low interest rates augur well for shares over the next 12 months,"" said Dr Oliver. You see, the share market isn't valuing companies for today, it's projecting what businesses will likely be worth in 6 to 12 months from now. The share market is right now looking through to the end of this year, and early next year, and sees a fully vaccinated population with little if any need for lockdowns. And record low interest rates and ongoing fiscal stimulus remain key in providing broader economic support for the market. Several investment analysts and market economists keep saying the same thing to me over and over: ""There really is nowhere else for money to go apart from the stock market."" Record low interest rates are also driving the property market. But COVID-19 and lockdown restrictions have made it very challenging to go through due process when selling a property. What it's led to, said the Real Estate Institute, is a massive demand and supply imbalance. That is, there's still plenty of demand for property but supply is enormously constrained. This is forcing property prices higher. Most banks now have home prices rising between 15 per cent to 20 per cent this year before slowing to around 5 per cent next year. Record low mortgage rates and the fear of missing out (FOMO) remain the key price drivers. It's clear there are factors looming that could slightly cool down the market by next year: poor affordability, fewer government home buyer incentives, rising fixed mortgage rates and the potential for a reintroduction of macro-prudential tightening by the regulators. For now, though, the property market remains robust. But there's a significant wildcard: the vaccine rollout. Without 70 to 80 per cent of the eligible population vaccinated, states and territories face the risk of extended lockdowns. As the CEO of the Australian Industry Group, Innes Willox, put it, ""businesses don't like lockdowns"". Speaking publicly this week, he said businesses need ""momentum"" and ""continuity"" and lockdowns act as a circuit-breaker. At least one major bank believes Greater Sydney will exit lockdown sometime in September. AMP Capital forecasts 70 per cent of the eligible population vaccinated in November and 80 per cent by December, which would obviously see restrictions eased across the country at that time. But as Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe pointed out before a parliamentary economics committee last week, it's difficult to predict exactly what will happen in terms of the vaccine rollout. Yes, more doses of Pfizer, for example, may be available, but will a critical number of Australians get the jab? It's impossible to say at this point. Precisely how much the stock market is banking on 70 to 80 per cent of the eligible population being partially or fully vaccinated is also impossible to work out. However, if short-sharp lockdowns continue, as is the federal government's wish (in the absence of a fully vaccinated population), the economy will continue to suffer and, as Dr Oliver puts it, ""shares remain vulnerable to a short-term correction with possible triggers being the upswing in global coronavirus cases."" The property market is less vulnerable. As we saw last year, if there's even a whiff property prices may drop materially, the banks begin sandbagging the market by offering grace to mortgagors in terms of repayments. The banks are certainly well capitalised now, so offering mortgage deferrals again shouldn't be a problem. NAB chief economist Alan Oster summed up the paradox of robust financial markets and a crumbling economy. ""[The market is] looking through the lockdown,"" Mr Oster said. ""That is a fair reading on what's going on."" And it is a fair reading. For now. The reality though is that property and share markets, fundamentally, rely on robust economies for growth (notwithstanding short-term government income support). If Australia does not reach a 70 per cent to 80 per cent vaccination rate for the eligible population, you can throw out the economic forecasts — because it'll be anyone's guess as to how ongoing short-sharp lockdowns will influence the economy and financial markets.

154,"NAB seeks to buy Citigroup's consumer arm despite ACCC concerns, as ASX ends flat",markets,"  NAB seeks to buy Citigroup despite ACCC concerns, as Suncorp banks $1b profit and Transurban faces $3.3b blowout Australian investors have had a busy day, with NAB announcing it wants to buy a large chunk of Citgroup and company results moving big names Transurban, Aurizon and Suncorp. Mid-afternoon trade was dominated by news that NAB wants to acquire Citigroup's consumer banking business. In April, the global bank put its consumer banking business up for sale in Australia and 12 other countries, including India and China, in order to focus on more profitable parts of its business such as investment banking. Citi is the fifth-largest issuer of credit cards in Australia, behind the big four banks, and was the first foreign bank to be granted a banking licence in 1985. Its consumer business includes credit cards, loans, retail banking and mortgages. It is also a credit card provider for big brands that offer credit lines including Coles, Kogan, Qantas and Suncorp. NAB announced on Monday afternoon that it wanted to buy the consumer business arm under an asset and liability transfer plus a premium of $250 million. While NAB investors heard in an afternoon briefing that the acquisition focus was on Citigroup's unsecured lending business, NAB is also taking $7.9 billion in residential mortgages, $9 billion in bank deposits, and $4.3 billion in unsecured lending. NAB says 800 Citigroup employees will go over to the bank. The acquisition is set to be finalised by March, pending regulatory approval. But there is a big hurdle: the ACCC. Citi is Australia's fifth-largest credit card provider, but it is planning to sell up and get out of the consumer market. One investor raised concerns the purchase of Citigroup would not be allowed by the competition regulator, given it would further reduce the competition between who controls credit cards across the Big Four. The ACCC's Rod Sims told the ABC in April the regulator would look with ""extremely close interest"" at any bid for Citigroup by any of the big four banks. In a statement to the ABC on Monday, Mr Sims reiterated that this sort of deal would be closely scrutinised. ""Any further consolidation involving the large players in the banking sector will be looked at extremely closely,"" he said. ""Competition between the big four banks is muted at best. We have seen them accommodating each other rather than competing aggressively on products and pricing. ""Citi is a major credit card issuer. In reviewing NAB’s proposed acquisition of Citigroup’s Australian retail banking business, we will be carefully considering credit cards, including white label credit cards, among other areas of overlap. ""Past acquisitions, where the majors purchased smaller banks, should not be taken as an indication of our position on future possible transactions. Those decisions were made in very different market conditions."" Mr Sims did add that neobanks and smaller banks were making the credit card market more competitive, however. NAB told investors it did not believe it would have a major issue but any decision was ultimately up to the ACCC. NAB ended up more than 1 per cent higher on the news. Other financials also buoyed the share market, including CBA which gained 1.5 per cent and Westpac with 1.2 per cent gain. Westpac announced the sale of its domestic life insurance business to Japan's Dai-ichi Life Holdings for $900 million, as part of efforts to focus on its core businesses. After all was said and done, the ASX 200 ended the day flat. It last week reached a record high, despite ongoing lockdowns and concerns Australia's economy was taking a renewed hit from the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting season is in full swing, with Transurban's stock dropping on revelations its beleaguered West Gate Tunnel project is facing a $3.3b cost blowout, and insurance company Suncorp banking a $1b profit. Suncorp was the ASX 200's biggest mover, with the insurance company gaining around 8 per cent after it revealed its results. The insurance and finance company's earnings rose by nearly half over the 2021 financial year due to record low interest rates and higher insurance profits. The firm said a higher number of natural disasters caused by the La Niña weather pattern saw a rise in the number of premiums it had to pay out. It also gave COVID-19 support to more than 85,000 customers. Suncorp's cash earnings increased 42 per cent to $1.04 billion, while net profit rose 13.1 per cent to around the same amount. Investors are set for a final dividend of 40 cents a share, and 8 cents a share special dividend. The bank is also returning $250 million to investors through a share buyback. Rivals IAG and QBE also gained around 4 per cent each. Meanwhile, hauling company Aurizon reported lower earnings from coal freight, because of disruptions from COVID-19 and China's ban on Australian iron ore. Net profit for the year was flat at $607 million. Its share price still rose by 1.3 per cent. Transurban was one of the biggest names revealing results today. The operator and developer of urban toll road networks posted a statutory net profit of $3.3 billion. But it also revealed its key project in Melbourne is facing a cost blowout of the same figure. The West Gate Tunnel project has been mired by issues due to the discovery of PFAS-contaminated soil, disputes on where that should be stored, and staff being laid off. The joint venture with the Victorian government and CPB John Holland was originally due to be completed in 2022. ""As previously noted, project completion in 2023 is no longer considered achievable,"" the company said. ""A further update on the expected project completion date cannot be provided at this stage. ""The contracted total cost of the project was $6.7 billion. ""[Transurban] estimates the D&C subcontractor's construction costs could increase in the order of $3.3 billion."" The company's share price lost more than 2 per cent in the day. Other drags on the market included News Corp (-7.8pc) and a range of gold miners. That was after the price of gold dropped globally on fears that the US would soon start winding back economic stimulus.

155,"'Huge dividend payments' loom, keeping Australian dollar higher as shares eke out gains",markets,"  ASX slightly up as Wall Street rises and gold prices are down The Australian share market has ended the week on another record high, despite a raft of negative economic news as three capital cities battle through COVID lockdowns. The ASX 200 closed 0.4 per cent higher at 7,538. That breaks a record close figure made just earlier this week. It was also despite an announcement from the Reserve Bank today that the economy will contract in coming months, due to the Delta outbreak. RBA governor Philip Lowe said he could not rule out economic activity contracting for six months in a row, although he thought that was ""unlikely"" at this stage. RBA governor Phil Lowe says Australia's economy will contract in coming months, and much depends on our rate of vaccination nationally. There have also been estimates from economists today that Sydney could lose 300,000 jobs from its extended lockdown. Consumer goods, real estate and the banks performed well. The top gains included News Corp (+7.9pc) and Westfield (+5.6pc). Webjet also gained 5.2 per cent despite the lockdowns that are stopping people from travelling nationally. Buy now pay later darling Afterpay is still gaining after a record-breaking takeover bid from US company Square this week. It is now up 5.5 per cent to $132.15. On the flip side, gold miners suffered as the commodity dipped. Perseus, Ramelius and Northern Star have also lost a few per cent each. Australian reporting season has begun, with furniture retailer Nick Scali yesterday doubling its full-year net profit, as it continued to benefit from the COVID trend of people updating their homes. The company's profit climbed to $84.2 million, as sales revenue rose more than 42 per cent. The Australian dollar was buying 74 US cents. In a note today, Westpac said despite lockdowns in Australia being extended, the dollar has held in well. ""We tend to see this as a reflection of tectonic capital flow movements,"" the bank said. ""Huge dividend payments coming late August and into September, which we now estimate could mean that as much as $17.5 billion of the Australian dollar will need to be bought for conversion alone.""

156,"ASX closes on record high, Wall Street gains, as gaming sector grapples with Chinese regulation",markets,"  ASX closes on record high, Wall Street gains, gaming sector grapples with Chinese regulation Interest in mining and energy stocks has seen the Australian share market chalk up another record closing high, with investors also taking a positive lead from Wall Street. The ASX 200 posted another record daily close, up 0.38 per cent to 7503.2, while the broader All Ordinaries finished up 0.2 per cent to 7,778. The top 200 companies index was boosted by the mining and energy sectors, but it was litigation funder Omni Bridgeway that came out on top, up 5.5 per cent. Other top performers included cement and concrete maker Adbri (+4.4pc), Blackmores (+4pc), and Pilbara Minerals (+4.5pc). Qantas shareholders were not feeling so optimistic, however. The airline's shares ended trading down 0.4 per cent, a day after the company announced it was standing down 2,500 workers to deal with border closures. Other losers were Chalice Mining (-4.3pc), GUD Holdings (-4.1pc) and Inghams (-2.8pc). The local currency edged higher overnight, after the Reserve Bank announced it would push ahead with tapering off COVID help. ""We expect the RBA will continue to buy bonds at a pace of $4 billion per week from November 2021 until February 2022,"" ANZ analysts noted this morning. ""Nevertheless, our view remains that the RBA will start its tightening cycle earlier than its forecasts currently imply. ""Our central scenario has the first RBA [interest] rate hike in May 2023."" In Australia, after an extraordinary few weeks of the ASX 200 closing at record highs despite ongoing lockdowns, reporting season is also set to begin. Retail sales fell 1.8 per cent in June compared with May, but were 2.9 per cent higher than a year ago. Food retailing, or supermarket sales, rose 1.5 per cent as lockdown restrictions took hold. The largest falls were in cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services (-6.0 per cent), clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing (-9.5 per cent), and department stores (-7.0 per cent). Hundreds of Australian companies are about to reveal how they've fared over the past year. If you invest in shares or are looking to get into the market, here's why it matters. On Wall Street, all major markets closed higher. The Dow and S&P both gained 0.8 per cent and the Nasdaq added 0.6 per cent. The tech-laden Nasdaq was pushed along by blue-chip stock Apple, which gained 1.3 per cent. But gains were capped by other heavyweight technology stocks, including Netflix, Tesla and Facebook, which continued to edge lower. Deepening regulatory scrutiny in China also sent jitters through the global technology sector. Shares in US and European-listed gaming companies fell after a steep sell-off in China's social media and video games group Tencent. An article in a Chinese state media outlet branding online video games ""spiritual opium"" has stoked fears the gaming sector could be next for regulation. The article by an outlet affiliated with China's biggest state-run news agency Xinhua cited Tencent's Honor of Kings, saying minors were addicted to online games. It called for more curbs on the industry. In the US, the creator of Grand Theft Auto, company Take-Two Interactive Software, plunged 7.7 per cent after it issued a disappointing sales forecast.

157,'The secret fairy dust' that helped Afterpay go from zero to $39b in Australia's biggest ever corporate takeover,markets,"  For most global businesses, the COVID-19 pandemic has been nothing short of a train wreck. For Afterpay, it's been a blessing in disguise. The $39 billion takeover of buy now, pay later darling Afterpay by US payments giant Square may have seemed unfathomable more than a year ago, when the company's share price tanked at around $8.90. Now it's making media headlines around the world as the subject of the biggest corporate takeover in Australia's history. ""It turned out, COVID-19 meant e-commerce was about to get a jab in the arm,"" write Australian Financial Review journalists Jonathan Shapiro and James Eyers in their book released this week about the incredible Australian success story of Afterpay's co-founders Anthony Eisen and Nick Molnar. ""Afterpay would not be asphyxiated by the crisis; on the contrary, it had been pumped full of oxygen"". In just six years (the company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in 2016) the two neighbours who created Afterpay in their home in the affluent suburb of Rose Bay, Sydney, have managed a spectacular triumph over the naysayers. With more than 16 million customers and 100,000 merchants around the world, and a market capitalisation of under $40 billion, Mr Eisen and Mr Molnar will take stakes in Square worth about $2.7 billion from the deal (to be paid out in stocks). The duo will join the US-listed company as employees once the deal is completed in the first quarter of 2022. It still needs the Treasurer's sign-off, with Foreign Investment Review Board approval pending. But if the takeover proceeds without hurdles, the deal will further boost the fortunes of Afterpay's two co-founders. Mr Molnar, 31, and Mr Eisen, 49, are already billionaires, ranking in the AFR's list of richest bosses as well as richest individuals. To pull off what they have – against constant regulatory pressure — is extraordinary, according to even the harshest critics. Those who think Afterpay is overvalued — note that the $39 billion price represents 42 times Afterpay's 2021 revenue – still give praise to the founders. ""You've got to say, they've played their hand as best as they could and so you have to give them an A+ for execution,"" says one analyst. The analyst did not wish to be named but contends there's long been much hype surrounding Afterpay – a company that still hasn't turned a profit nor paid out any dividends. The pandemic could have been the factor that caused Afterpay to implode. Instead, coronavirus lockdowns spurred online shoppers onto their platforms. Shapiro and Eyers write how on March 23, when Afterpay shares dropped to under $9.00, ""Eisen, speaking to global investors, felt their widespread panic"". ""For some of Afterpay's early investors, the plunge was too much to bear,"" they write. But it was not long before Afterpay shares surged again. In May that year, Chinese technology giant Tencent paid $300 million for a 5 per cent equity stake in Afterpay and by June that year, the company was riding high again. By February this year, the share price hit a record $160 and its founders were touting new products that would challenge the big banks. While the majority of Afterpay's revenue comes from the 4 to 6 per cent fee it charges retailers for each transaction, it's the company's ability to be the payment platform of choice for millennials that's helped it gain new merchants. Millennials had already come to love the brand since 2018, when Afterpay became a payment option available for hip retailers from fashion stores like Urban Outfitters and Forever 21 to Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty empire. The lockdowns throughout much of early 2020 meant Australian millennials were stuck at home with extra cash (thanks to the $1,500 JobKeeper subsidy at the time) and became repeat users, spending an average of about $150 for every purchase. As Nick Molnar said when Square announced its second-quarter 2021 earnings on Monday, ""Afterpay has become a leader in the global buy-now, pay-later space"". ""We have flipped the traditional credit model on its head to drive significant value to both merchants and consumers,"" Mr Molnar said. ""Our model is based on trust."" Gaining trust hasn't been an easy feat for Afterpay's co-founders. And it's not just the trust of consumers and shareholders that's been critical. Afterpay is one of several buy now, pay later players that have had to contend with constant fire from consumer groups who warn that using their services can be risky for vulnerable consumers. The alarm bell was raised as recently as last week following an Afterpay ad featuring Hollywood star Rebel Wilson, who in one scene tells a young girl that, ""if credit cards and cash had a baby, you could pay it over time without ever paying interest"". Financial Counselling Australia chief executive Fiona Guthrie said the campaign went a step too far and complained to regulator Ad Standards to have it pulled. The Afterpay duo have also spent much of the past few years fronting parliamentary inquiries, explaining how their products have in-built protections that stop consumers being able to spend money on the platform once they hit a certain limit. They argue that far from being a risky offering, their product is far safer than credit cards (consumer groups argue the risk is just as high as people often use buy now, pay later debt in addition to other forms of debt and because the products are aimed at a far younger audience). From Canberra to Washington, Afterpay hired top-notch advisers to help gain the support of regulators and politicians who still needed convincing. In 2019, former World Bank chief economist Larry Summers joined Afterpay to advise it on its US expansion. Summers, who had been an economic adviser to president Barack Obama, had been convinced by the former economic adviser to prime minister Kevin Rudd, Andrew Charlton, to be part of Afterpay's advisory board. While a number of factors have led to Afterpay's rise, as Shapiro and Eyers detail in their book, political connections and financial perks that came with being part of the Afterpay empire were a big factor. ""Afterpay's management had come to appreciate the incredible power of incentives that could be harnessed through stock options,"" they write. ""In some respects, it was the secret fairy dust that motivated those with little interest in Afterpay's cause to publicly fight hard for its future, or to privately tug strings."" Employee stock options were also extended to external consultants. ""At no upfront cost, lobbyists would embrace the Afterpay cause and get stinking rich doing so, if they helped it succeed,"" they write. ""The payout would come in the form of new shares being issued but, if the share price was materially higher in the future, everyone would win."" ""With Afterpay's shares having the demonstrated potential to double, triple or better, the stock option was a powerful currency. ""The same could not be said of the stock of Australia's lumbering big four banks, which paid a healthy dividend but lacked the allure of rapid, life-altering wealth creation."" The book says among those granted share options was a former Rudd and Shorten staffer, Sharon McCrohan, who was brought in to assist Afterpay with its external affairs. Afterpay also recruited top-end public relations firm Cato & Clegg—a partnership between communications specialist Sue Cato and investment banker and media executive Brett Clegg. Clegg personally took stock options. The firm also brought in and gave stock options to David Gazard, who previously was an adviser to former treasurer Peter Costello and remains a close confidant of Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Afterpay also hired Damian Kassabgi, a former adviser to Labor prime ministers Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd, as its director of public policy after he held a similar role with Uber. Mr Kassabgi, who had been in Rudd's office the day the National Consumer Credit Protection Act had been passed by the federal parliament in 2009, ""brought that regulatory arbitrage mentality to Afterpay, which needed to remain out of reach of the credit act"", according to the book. But Liberal senator Andrew Bragg, who chaired the recent Senate inquiry into fintech that was considering regulating buy now, pay later platforms like Afterpay, rejects the notion the company has won any favours with Canberra. He says Afterpay has succeeded because of its ""innovative"" business model that boosts competition in the financial sector. Consumer groups had wanted Afterpay to be regulated under the same laws as credit card companies, but in the end both the Senate inquiry and regulators rejected that. ""The committee felt that it was important to value innovation and that the big four [banks] were not able to quash consumer choice,"" Senator Bragg says. The regulators carried out their own reviews but none went as far as imposing new regulation on Afterpay and its rivals. In November, Australia's corporate watchdog ASIC released a review into six buy now, pay later players including Afterpay, finding that some players were causing consumers harm but stopped short of recommending that they be regulated in the same way as credit card companies. And in December, Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe said buy now, pay later providers can continue to prevent retailers imposing a surcharge when shoppers use the services (in contrast, debit and credit card providers cannot prevent merchants from adding a surcharge to cover payment costs.) Square CEO Jack Dorsey has been clear that the payments company plans to integrate Afterpay into Square's two business units – Seller and Cash App. Afterpay's 16 million consumers will be able to manage their instalments and repayments directly in Cash App. He told investors on Monday the deal would help Square ""reach sellers that we have not been able to serve in the past, and that includes larger, more enterprise, global retail sellers"". They will be able to use Cash App's financial tools, including money transfer, stock and bitcoin purchases and Cash Boost. Square's Amrita Ahuja says there are ""tremendous"" growth opportunities, with online payments likely to grow to $US10 trillion by 2024. ""We're excited by our compelling cross-sell opportunities,"" she said on the investor call on Monday. ""By integrating Afterpay directly into our cash app and seller ecosystems, we can expand each brand's customer base, strengthen each other's products and build connections."" CEO and managing director of payments consultancy McLean Roche Grant Halverson believes Afterpay's financial fundamentals are still dubious, but he applauds them for pulling off the deal with Square. Mr Halverson says Afterpay isn't a new idea since the idea of lay-by has long been in existence, and its customer base is still low when compared with bigger global players like Klarna Group, which has about 90 million consumers and 250,000 merchants using its platforms across 17 countries. He also criticises Afterpay for the way it presents its year-on-year financial comparisons – which he claims makes them appear like they are growing more rapidly. ""If you look at the numbers, quarter to quarter, their sales are only up 14 per cent. And in Australia, they are minus 3.3 per cent for the last quarter,"" he says, adding that that is why the timing of Afterpay's founders to sell is ""exquisite"". ""Now the competition's heated up, they [Afterpay's founders] are getting out,"" he says. Mr Halverson thinks Australian shareholders will most likely sell their Afterpay stock rather than retain shares in US-based company Square as that opens them to currency fluctuation risks. ""The problem you've got now is if you're if you're a mom and pop in Australia, you're now going to have a US dollar risk,"" he says. ""You're going to have a company that's operating in the US which, you know, how do you keep track of all that if you're just a normal investor? That's pretty hard.""

158,"Afterpay and Square continue to surge on record-breaking $39b takeover bid, as ASX 200 ends down",markets,"  Afterpay and Square continue to surge on record-breaking $39 billion takeover bid, as ASX 200 ends down The record-breaking takeover of Afterpay by US company Square dominated the Australian share market again on Tuesday, with the buy now, pay later stock surging. On Monday, Jack Dorsey's fintech Square announced plans to take over Afterpay in a deal that valued the Australian company at $39 billion. That makes it the biggest buyout deal in Australian corporate history. Afterpay closed 18.8 per cent higher on Monday on that news. On Tuesday it gained another further 11.8 per cent to close at $128.30. Afterpay's rival Zip rode on its coattails, gaining 7 per cent to a much smaller $7.75. Other performers on the ASX 200 on Tuesday included Chalice Mining (+7pc), Appen (+5.2pc), and Redbubble (+4.9pc). But overall, 106 of the top 200 companies ended in the red, including those across healthcare, real estate, energy, and financials. The ASX 200 closed down 0.2 per cent at 7,475 points. Miners were among the biggest losers, with Whitehaven Coal, BlueScope, Ramelius, and Evolution Mining all down between 3 and 5 per cent. That came after concerns that a resurgence in COVID cases in China could dampen the nation's appetite for iron ore. The biggest loser on Tuesday was Pointsbet Holdings which lost 11.2 per cent. The benchmark index had closed up 1.3 per cent up, or 7,491 points, on Monday, surpassing its previous record high. ABS data out today showed home loan commitments easing slightly from their high, and the value of new housing loan commitments falling 1.6 per cent in June, seasonally adjusted. Overall loans remained at an historically elevated level of $32.1 billion. “The largest contribution to the fall in owner-occupier loan commitments was a fall of 17 per cent in the value of loan commitments for the construction of new dwellings,"" ABS head of finance and wealth Katherine Keenan said. ""In addition to this, there was no growth in lending for the purchase of existing dwellings."" The number of new loan commitments to owner-occupier first-home buyers fell for a second consecutive month, down 7.8 per cent in June. But the level of commitments remained elevated, similar to that seen in November 2020. Australian house prices are rising at their highest rate in 17 years, largely driven by the return of investors helped by housing tax breaks. The federal government's COVID construction subsidy HomeBuilder ended a few months ago, and there are ongoing rumblings that historically low interest rates could rise by as early as next year. CoreLogic data out yesterday showed Australian house prices still rising at their highest rate in 17 years, largely driven by the return of investors. The overall drag on the Australian market comes as Wall Street closed down and as Australia awaits a policy decision from the Reserve Bank. The Dow and S&P 500 both closed in the red (0.3 and 0.2 per cent respectively) although the tech-heavy Nasdaq was up very marginally. On the Nasdaq, Square surged 10 per cent on its bid to takeover Afterpay. Square is run by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. Oil prices are down almost 3 per cent, over concerns about supply and also rising COVID cases in China. The Australian dollar is slightly higher against the greenback at 73.63 US cents. The Reserve Bank of Australia is pushing ahead with easing off on economic stimulus, despite ongoing COVID lockdowns. The RBA announced last month that from September it would purchase $4 billion worth of government bonds per week, down from the current $5 billion. Economists had expected the RBA to reverse that decision at its monthly meeting today, in light of the ongoing lockdowns in Greater Sydney and other parts of Australia. But RBA governor Philip Lowe is standing firm. ""The economic recovery in Australia has been stronger than was earlier expected,” he said in his post-meeting statement. ""The recent outbreaks of the virus are, however, interrupting the recovery and GDP is expected to decline in the September quarter. ""The experience to date has been that once virus outbreaks are contained, the economy bounces back quickly."" NAB was among those predicting that the RBA would stick to buying $5 billion a week until February. ""The RBA is further away from its goals of full employment and inflation sustainably at target,"" the NAB analysts said this morning. As expected, the RBA has maintained the cash rate at its historic low of just 0.1 per cent.

159,"'You're not a princess who needs her own room, are you?'",markets,"  Julia Szlakowski sparked AMP's 'me too' moment, but it wasn't the first time she'd been forced out of a job due to sexual harassment The woman whose complaint sparked the sexual harassment scandal that rocked AMP, Julia Szlakowski, says years before her mistreatment at the financial services firm she was fired from another job for not sleeping with her boss. AMP's initial decision to promote Boe Pahari to the head of AMP Capital — despite the sexual harassment case against him mounted by Ms Szlakowski in 2017 — caused widespread investor anger and sent its share price tumbling at the time. Mr Pahari has since announced he is leaving the company. But he had earlier been promoted despite issuing a public apology and having part of his pay docked after settling the sexual harassment case brought by Ms Szlakowski. In a pre-recorded speech to be delivered via Zoom at the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI) conference on Wednesday, US-based Ms Szlakowski, whose family moved as refugees from Poland to America when she was a child, details how she has been the victim of ongoing sexual harassment across workplaces. The harassment, perpetrated by various male colleagues and/or superiors started when she was a waitress in her college years, continued during a stint with a political consulting firm in Los Angeles some years later, and happened again most recently at AMP, resulting in her leaving the company. Ms Szlakowski says she had thought that in joining AMP to head up their North American distribution efforts in 2016 she would ""be safe, where my personal and professional choices would be supported and respected"". ""Everyone now knows how deeply mistaken I was,"" she says. ""I never imagined that as an experienced and qualified professional in a company that holds the public's trust, I would still be treated no better than when I was a waitress in that restaurant."" Ms Szlakowski, now 41, says while men were the harassers, throughout her time at AMP there were women who allowed the harassment to flourish and treat it as though it never happened by demanding that she return to work for her harasser. ""The same individuals who shamelessly touted AMP's culture to encourage me to join, were also the ones who demanded I return to work for my harasser even after my credible complaint against him was investigated and verified,"" she says. ""What may come as a surprise is that these individuals were all female."" Ms Szlakowski says when she was hired in 2016, AMP was a top-20 company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), and one-in-four Australians was an AMP customer. AMP's promotion of Boe Pahari raises bigger questions for corporate Australia about how companies treat sexual harassment ""Since July 1st, 2020, when news of my 2017 sexual harassment complaint broke, AMP shares fell approximately 40 per cent or $2.8 billion in market capitalisation,"" she says. ""Between last July and March of this year, investors withdrew $9 billion in assets under management from AMP Capital — approximately $2 billion in corporate pension assets and about $8 billion in total wealth management products."" ""A number of pension funds withdrew hundreds of millions from AMP's ethical investment options and a $5 billion property fund recently changed ownership. ""Now, this 172-year-old company is no longer in the top 20 or the top 50 on the ASX — and its market capitalisation continues to shrink. ""Over the past year, dozens upon dozens of talented senior and junior staff have left, not to mention almost every single executive. ""My harasser [Boe Pahari], however, is set to finally depart next month, with a reported $50 million golden parachute."" But AMP was not the first workplace where Ms Szlakowski faced sexual harassment. She says as a college student in the early 2000s she worked double-shifts as a waitress to help fund the costs of studying political theory. ""During this time, I became acclimated to an environment where 'the customer is always right' — drunk men, who regularly made sexually explicit comments at my expense, were treated with deference by male and female managers alike. ""I made $5.75 an hour and developed a thick outer shell, never imagining that such behaviour would be tolerated in other industries."" She later, in her mid-20s, was offered a role to manage a small party race, on behalf of a political consulting group, during a national convention in Los Angeles. Upon checking into the hotel, where the event was being held, she discovered a room hadn't been reserved under her name but was reassured by a female superior that she would have a place to stay. Late in the evening her boss, a man 30 years her senior, requested she meet him at the hotel bar for a debrief. ""He had already ordered two drinks and started walking away from the crowd, motioning me to follow him,"" she recounts. ""We eventually arrived at his hotel room, which was furnished with a bed, a chair and a desk. I opted to sit in the chair, clipboard tightly clenched in my hands — guarding my torso.' ""My eyes were fixed on the room's only exit. Suddenly, he dispensed with the formalities, discarded his jacket and invited me to join him on the bed to watch a movie. ""I sheepishly declined so as not to irritate him and insisted we get some work done. He ordered me to try my drink and started flipping through the channels. My heart began to pound when he informed me that his room should be sufficient for my stay at the convention. Women across corporate Australia want to see an end to ridiculous excuses like, ""There's no point promoting you. You're just going to run off and get pregnant"". ""He reinforced his argument by pointing out that we were on a tight budget and remarked, 'You're not a princess who needs her own room, are you?' ""At first I froze but, thankfully, my fight or flight instinct kicked in and I managed to leave. ""The next day, my fresh-faced candidate unseated an astonished incumbent. In no state to celebrate the victory I returned home, only to be met with news of my termination. ""For some time, I struggled with the complicated feelings that arose from the unequivocal fact I got fired for not sleeping with my boss. ""I had naively thought I immigrated to a country that functioned as a meritocracy… Like most women, I never complained. I could afford neither legal advice nor therapy."" At age 30, Ms Szlakowski entered the world of private equity, where she was often ""the only woman in the room"". She says she once dyed her hair brown, so that she would be called by her first name rather than just be referred to as ""the blonde"". ""I learned to control my facial expressions at sexist comments, how to steer a conversation away from overly personal inquiries and how to bear the brunt of humiliating jokes,"" she says. ""Most women I know possess these skills; they are just not listed on their resumes."" Ms Szlakowski says workplace sexual harassment is a ""notoriously underreported human rights issue, a health and safety violation and a professional crisis"". She says the lesson for AMP and other organisations is that sexual harassment needs to be treated seriously or it can erode a company's value, noting that a 2018 report by Deloitte quantified the cost of sexual harassment at $3.8 billion to the Australian economy. From AMP sexual harassment to Rio Tinto destruction of Juukan Gorge, ACSI CEO Louise Davidson tells corporate Australia's main men why their actions aren't in sync with investor expectations. ""I think it should be painfully clear, especially to the stakeholders, how a company's toxic culture — where sexual harassment is not taken seriously and handled with the dignity and urgency it requires — can degrade and devalue not only the survivors who report it but an entire company's global workforce and its underlying market value,"" she says. ""Companies like AMP ultimately serve a broad cross-section of the population as customers. These companies must conduct themselves within the moral and ethical norms of their customer base, or rightly risk extinction."" She noted that Allan Gary's Simon Mawhinney, one of AMP's biggest shareholders, summed this up when he said: 'Companies must have a social license to operate above all else or ultimately it will be your company's downfall'. ""Many things had to line up for this case to catalyse corporate Australia's #MeToo moment but none more instrumental than when some of the major shareholders, and their representatives like ACSI, held AMP to account — sending a firm message that sexual harassment is simply bad for business,"" Ms Szlakowski says. ""Investors recognise that poor corporate culture ultimately impacts investment outcomes and it's investors who can, and should, push companies to reconsider the serious implications of continuing to do business as usual by prioritising short term gains over long-term sustainability."" But she says calling out sexual harassment should not exclusively rest on the shoulders of the survivors. ""Those of us who do decide to speak up almost never work in our chosen professions again,"" she says. ""And I would be remiss not to mention that my experience would undoubtedly be exponentially worse if I still spoke with an accent, worked for minimum wage, lived in a non-democratic country, didn't have white skin, wasn't able-bodied, didn't possess a resilient mind or identified as anything other than heterosexual.""

160,"ASIC abandons AMP criminal case, ASX ends higher despite widening restrictions",markets,"  ASX comes back despite lockdown fears, ASIC drops criminal charges against AMP over fees for no service scandal Australian shares have ended higher and the corporate regulator has dropped criminal charges against investment house AMP over the fees for no service scandal. The All Ordinaries index rose 0.2pc to 7,631 and the ASX 200 rose 0.2pc to 7,348 The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions says there is not enough evidence against AMP to proceed with the fees for no service case AMP is among several financial institutions that charged fees to clients but failed to provide financial advice. It was revealed during the banking royal commission that AMP lied to the regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and charged fees to the estates of dead people. It was told that AMP wrongly charged customers of financial advice businesses bought by the investment firm, and the company misled ASIC about it. But ASIC has now said that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions found there was not enough evidence to bring a criminal case. AMP said it welcomed the decision to drop the legal action and said it had compensated affected customers. AMP refunded former customers charged fees for no service through new superannuation accounts — set up with AMP, and charging high fees for poor performance. ASIC is taking separate civil action against AMP over allegedly charging fees to the estate of dead customers. The fallout from the royal commission saw AMP's chairman, chief executive and half its board resign. ASIC said AMP had compensated more than $153 million to more than 200,000 people so far. Australia's largest banking and financial services firms have so far paid back $1.24 billion in compensation to customers who were wrongly charged advice fees. AMP shares fell 0.9 per cent to $1.10. The local share market staged a late rally despite more than 12 million people being in lockdowns in Sydney and Melbourne and more coronavirus restrictions being added across the country. The All Ordinaries index rose 0.2 per cent to 7,631 with most sectors coming off their low point. The ASX 200 also rose by nearly one-fifth of a per cent to 7,348, with most sectors higher led by education firms, consumer stocks, healthcare and technology stocks. Oil stocks and a miner weighed on the market. Going up were Whitehaven Coal (+4.4pc), data centre firm Next DC (+4.1pc) and mining contractor NRW (+3.8pc). Going down were gold miner Evolution Mining (-5.3pc) on lower production guidance, biotech firm Mesoblast (-4pc) after its remestemcel-L failed to significantly reduce deaths in COVID-19 patients on ventilators and financial software firm Hub 24 (-3.3pc). The Australian dollar slipped 0.8 per cent overnight but gained 0.3 per cent today to 74.32 US cents. Australian fitness franchise F45 was valued at nearly $2 billion as it listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The business was co-founded by Australian man Adam Gilchrist (not the cricketer) in Sydney in 2012. Inflation in New Zealand rose at the fastest pace in a decade over the June quarter because of higher prices for housing, food and petrol. The consumer price index rose by 1.3 per cent over the June quarter. The data has reinforced forecasts that the country's Reserve Bank could raise official interest rates later this year. Rio Tinto said high rainfall in the Pilbara in Western Australia lowered production and shipments over the second quarter. It was also impacted by COVID-19 travel restrictions which led to a shortage of workers, especially in Western Australia and Mongolia which raised costs. Pilbara iron ore production of 75.9 million tonnes was 9 per cent lower than the second quarter of 2020 due to above average rainfall in the West Pilbara, shutdowns to enable replacement mines to be tied in, processing plant availability, and cultural heritage management after the destruction of the Juukan Gorge sacred site. Rio warned that iron ore shipments could fall because of the disruptions. Its shares came off their lows and finished down 0.4 per cent to $130.60. Despite rental growth slowing over recent months, CoreLogic said property investors enjoyed the highest annual increase in rents since 2009 during the June quarter despite the coronavirus pandemic. Regional rents continued to outpace rents in capital cities as more people move to the regions from capital cities because they can work from home. Rental growth in the regions jumped by 11.3 per cent over the year to June. CoreLogic said this was the highest annual growth on record. Head of research Eliza Owen said the same drivers pushing up home prices had pushed up rents. ""These factors include increased government stimulus through COVID-19, accumulated household savings through lockdown periods, the swift economic recovery seen as restrictions eased, and a lack of rental supply in some markets have also exacerbated rental price increases, particularly in major centres of regional Australia,""  Ms Owen said. Rents jumped by more than one-fifth over the year to a median $548 a week in Darwin but fell by 1.3 per cent in Melbourne to a median of $444 a week because of the impact of COVID-19 and international border closures. In a new report, CoreLogic found mortgage repayments were cheaper than rental payments in one-third of the country. US stocks have pared their losses while initial claims for unemployment benefits in the US hit a pandemic low. New claims for unemployment benefits in the US fell to 360,000 last week, the lowest since March last year as the US economy continues to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The total number of people receiving benefits fell to 14.2 million in June, down from more than 33 million a year ago. Manufacturing activity in New York reached a record high in July with new orders and shipments jumping. The data fuelled investor worries about rising inflation and the prospect of interest rate rises sooner rather than later. Supply bottlenecks and worker shortages are fuelling price rises as demand bounces back. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC that she expects to see several more months of rapid inflation and is worried about the impact on home buyers. ""I think over the medium term, we'll see inflation decline back toward normal levels. But, of course, we have to keep a careful eye on it,"" Ms Yellen said. ""So I don't think we're seeing the same kinds of danger in this that we saw in the run-up to the financial crisis in 2008."" US consumer prices jumped to the highest level in 13 years in June. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell told Congress he anticipated the shortages and high inflation would abate. US stocks came off their lows but the Nasdaq and S&P 500 ended in the red as investors worried about inflation. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 14,543, the S&P 500 lost 0.3 per cent to 4,360, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 0.15 per cent to 34,987. The Nasdaq was pulled down by Apple, Amazon and other big technology companies. The fall in weekly jobless claims added to investor concerns about rising inflation. Nvidia tumbled 4.4 per cent and Amazon lost 1.4 per cent. Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes reached new record highs this week. Oil stocks weighed on the S&P 500 with expectations of more supply as OPEC producers neared a deal on production increases. Morgan Stanley rose 0.2 per cent after its quarterly profit came in better than expected thanks to record investment banking activity. Blackstone will pay $US2.2 billion for a 10 per cent stake in American International Group's life and retirement business. In Europe, the FTSE 100 dropped 1.1 per cent to 7,012, the Dax in Germany lost 1 per cent to 15,630 and the CAC 40 in Paris fell 1 per cent to 6,493. Brent crude fell a further 1.9 per cent overnight to $US73.33 a barrel while spot gold rose 0.1 per cent to $US1829.51 an ounce.

161,"Sydney Airport rejects takeover bid, ASX falls on lockdown fears",markets,"  Sydney Airport rebuffs $22 billion takeover offer, ASX in the red despite lowest jobless rate in decade Sydney Airport has rejected a more than $22 billion takeover bid from a consortium of infrastructure funds, as worries about the economic impact of Sydney's lockdown have weighed on the Australian share market. The operator of Australia's largest airport said the board had unanimously agreed the $22.26 billion bid undervalued the airport and was not in the best interests of shareholders. The takeover offer from the Sydney Aviation Alliance, a consortium involving IFM Investors, QSuper and Global Infrastructure Partners, offered $8.25 a share. But the board said the buyout plan was opportunistic because the value of the company had been hit by the coronavirus pandemic which had disrupted global aviation and impacted the share prices of travel stocks. ""Sydney Airport is a well-managed and capitalised asset with a long-term concession lease,"" it said. ""The indicative price is below where Sydney Airport's security price traded before the pandemic."" The board said it recognised Sydney Airport's share price was likely to trade below the takeover offer in the short term. Sydney Airport's share price reached nearly $9 a share in late 2019 but it plunged below $5 last year because of the coronavirus pandemic and the shutdown of air travel. The airport has a core aeronautical business as well as retail space, property, car parking and ground-transport revenue. But it made a $145 million loss last year because of the closure of international borders and coronavirus lockdowns. The board took an optimistic view of the future and said the company had rapidly adapted to the COVID-19 environment by cutting costs and raising money through a share sale. ""Sydney Airport is strongly positioned to deliver growth as vaccination rates increase,"" the board said. If the purchase went ahead it would be one of Australia's biggest buyout deals, with record-low interest rates fuelling a multi billion dollar takeover frenzy for Australian firms this year. There are also reports that Macquarie Group is looking to make a rival bid for the airport, as investors look to capitalise when international borders eventually reopen. Sydney Airport shares closed up 0.1 per cent to $7.81. And electricity infrastructure firm Spark Infrastructure rejected a $4.9 billion takeover bid from private equity firm KKR and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. Its shares jumped 6.1 per cent to $2.63. Macquarie Group shares fell 0.9 per cent to $153.71. The Australian share market closed down despite the unemployment rate dropping to a 10-year low of 4.9 per cent. Predictions of a contraction over the September quarter because of the impact of coronavirus lockdowns on the economy weighed on the market. The All Ordinaries index fell 0.2 per cent to 7,617. The ASX 200 index lost 0.3 per cent to 7,336. Most sectors were in the red, led down by real estate, healthcare, industrial stocks, technology and banks, while miners rose on higher iron ore prices. Among the gainers were car accessories firm ARB Corporation (+7.2pc) and gold miner St Barbara (+7pc). Whitehaven Coal (+4.6pc) rose as it predicted more strong demand and higher prices despite China's ban on Australian coal and a fall in production and sales over the third quarter. Going down were buy now, pay later firm Zip (-5.6pc), medical firm Polynovo (-8,7pc) and troubled software firm Nuix (-4.9pc). Buy now, pay later firm Sezzle rose 5.2 per cent after it announced US based credit card provider Discover Financial Services would invest $40 million in the firm. Woodside Petroleum fell 1 per cent even though quarterly sales revenue rose as global demand for oil surged because of the global economy recovery. Brent crude fell 1 per cent to $73.92 a barrel as investors braced for more supply, with OPEC close to a deal on output. Spot gold was up 0.3 per cent to $US1,833 an ounce at 5:00pm AEST. The Australian dollar fell 0.3 per cent to 74.57 US cents after new figures showed China's economy expanded slower than expected over the June quarter. At 5:00pm AEST it was trading around 74.76 US cents, down 0.1 per cent. The Chinese economy expanded by 7.9 per cent on an annual basis over the June quarter amid a rise in coronavirus cases, higher raw-material costs and a reduction in manufacturing. That is a big slowdown from the 18.3 per cent annual growth rate recorded over the March quarter as the economy bounced back from the coronavirus pandemic shutdown last year. US stocks ended mainly higher after the US central bank chairman said the Federal Reserve is still some way off winding back its massive stimulus program despite a surge in inflation last month. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated in a statement to the US Congress that the current rise in consumer prices was likely to be temporary with household spending rising at a rapid rate, strong demand for housing and solid business investment. ""Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating,"" Mr Powell said. He said that monetary policy will deliver powerful support until the recovery is complete and there was still a long way to go for the US employment market. His comments come a day after economic data showed that US inflation hit its highest in 13 years last month. The Federal Reserve expects to increase interest rates sooner rather than later. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones index ended higher after the reassuring comments from the  Federal Reserve chairman. Utilities, real estate and consumer staples were the best performers on the S&P 500, which briefly hit a new record high during the session. It rose 0.1 per cent to end at 4,374, the Dow Jones index gained 0.1 per cent as well to 34,933 and the Nasdaq dipped 0.2 per cent to 14,645. Apple shares hit a record high of $US149.57 after Bloomberg reported the IT giant will launch a buy now, pay later service and that the company wants suppliers to increase production of its upcoming iPhone by one fifth. PayPal which yesterday launched a BNPL product in Australia saw its shares fall more than 0.1 per cent to $US300.75. Microsoft closed at a record high after saying it will offer its Windows operating system as a cloud based service. Bank of America fell after it outlined the impact of low interest rates on its bottom line despite a surge in net income to nearly $US9 billion in the second quarter. Wells Fargo and Citigroup also made profits over the quarter. Spot gold jumped 1.1 per cent to $US1827.06 an ounce. Brent crude oil fell 2.5 per cent to $US74.58 a barrel after a report that major oil producers group OPEC were nearing a compromise deal to lift output.

162,ASX up as Wesfarmers takeover bid for Priceline's owner sees API skyrocket,markets,"  ASX up as Wesfarmers takeover bid for pharmaceutical chain sees API skyrocket The Australian share market has started the week on a high, with Priceline's owner, Australian Pharmaceutical Industries (API), skyrocketing on a takeover bid from Wesfarmers. The ASX 200 ended Monday up 0.8 per cent. That saw it rise after a sell-off on Friday. The day's top performer by far was API, which gained 19.7 per cent in the day's trade on the back of the unsolicited bid by Wesfarmers. API owns the pharmacy chain Priceline and Soul Pattinson chemists. Wesfarmers is offering $1.38 a share which works out at $680 million. API's gain has taken it to within an inch of that offer at $1.37. Wesfarmers owns Kmart, Bunnings and Officeworks, and has previously made proposals to have pharmacies inside its stores. API's largest shareholder, Washington H Soul Pattinson, is voting in favour of the takeover. Other strong performers on Monday included Viva (+3.4pc), Mineral Resources (+4.2pc) and Pilbara Minerals (+2.7pc) as commodity prices gained. Financials and real estate were also trading up. NRW ended the day up 12 per cent, giving it its best day of trade since August. The mining services contractor said it will sell a unit's equipment to reduce its debt by nearly a third to $34 million. In the red, Redbubble was down 2.9 per cent, Worley lost 1.1 per cent, and Hub24 was just shy of that loss. The Australian dollar took a slight dip overnight and was hovering at 75 US cents. Meanwhile, ABS data shows Australia is coming down from its HomeBuilder high. Building approvals for residential dwellings hit a record high in April. But the latest ABS data shows private sector houses fell 10.3 per cent in May to 13,571 approved. Private sector dwellings, excluding houses, increased 1.2 per cent in May, driven by a rise in apartment approvals in Western Australia. The rush to build new homes in Australia has come amid reports of global shortages of building materials such as bricks and timber. The federal government's HomeBuilder scheme ended in March.

163,Top-performing super funds revealed as experts weigh fees versus performance,markets,"  Superannuation’s top performers for lowest fees versus highest performance revealed Like many young Australians, Molly Kane hasn't paid much attention to her superannuation. She's had several casual jobs and with them, five super accounts. She says every cent that went into them got eaten away by fees. ""Knowing that the money that's meant to be going towards your retirement is now non-existent because of fees that you didn't know existed, it really sucked,"" Ms Kane says. ""The biggest reason why young people lose out with super at the moment is because we leave it as a set-and-forget type of scenario — we don't look at it, we don't think about it. ""Often, the only time you'll hear from your super is in an annual statement, if you happen to open it. ""It's not something that's in the forefront of a lot of people's minds. And because of that, we tend to forget we end up with multiple accounts, we end up with paying too many fees. And at the end of the day, it just hurts us."" Excluding insurance premiums, Australians spend more than $30 billion in super fees every year, according to the 2019 Productivity Commission review into superannuation. Investment expenses: $8.7 billion Admin & operating expenses: $10.6 billion Total expenses: $19.3 billion *Note, this table is based on APRA data to June 2021 but does not represent the full cost of fees. The Productivity Commission in 2019 found Australians pay more than $30 billion a year in super fees -excluding insurance premiums. Total electricity    $15.9 billion Source: The Australia Institute. Even taking more recent estimates from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) based on data super funds report to the regulator — which does not count all fees and charges — we are estimated to spend about $19.3 billion. That's well over the $15.9 billion we spend on electricity bills annually. If you've got $100,000 in just one superannuation fund and the fee is 1 per cent — that's not a one-off $1,000 payment. It is 1 per cent of your total assets in fees, each and every year. As your account balance grows from contributions and investment earnings, so do your fees. After 10 years of compounding, assuming your balance has increased to over $200,000 by your employer contributing 10 per cent of your wages, you'll have paid more than $17,000 in fees, according to Australia Institute analysis. Even in bad years when negative investment returns mean your account balance goes backwards, you could still be paying over $1,000 a year in fees. University of Melbourne PhD student Kate Ferris knows the feeling of losing out on fees. She also had multiple super accounts by working casual jobs over a number of years. ""About 20 years ago, I had about four jobs and each one of those jobs was attached to a different super fund,"" Ms Ferris says. ""Each one of those super accounts was being eaten away by fees and charges. ""I estimate that I lost about $3,500, and that accumulates interest [compounds] over time. So in actual fact, I've lost a lot more than that. ""I was pretty gutted and disappointed when I've done the sums and figured that all out."" But fees are not the only equation that needs to be considered — how your fund performs also matters, and experts say ideally, consumers should be opting for low-fee, high-performance funds. According to a Rainmaker Information analysis of fees compared to five-year performance, industry super funds generally came out on top. Super Consumers Australia did an analysis of highest-fee and lowest-fee funds based on March 2021 APRA data. Its analysis does not cover fees versus performance. It only shows highest- and lowest-fee single strategy MySuper products (in other words, not all funds) with at least five years of investment returns data.

It's just showing highest and lowest-fee funds. Analysis only covers single strategy MySuper products  with at least five years of investment returns data to ensure comparability. To make it easier for Australians to identify whether they are in a high-fee, low-performance fund, the Federal Government recently passed the Your Future, Your Super law. The government's latest laws make it easier for Australians to compare the performance of My Super products, which cover many of the most popular superannuation funds. Its next step will be collecting data that allows people to compare fees and performance across all super funds. ""The superannuation funds have been put on notice that under-performing funds are not welcome in the system, and that high fees can no longer be hidden,"" says Superannuation Minister Jane Hume. Senator Hume says the Government has passed one of the biggest reforms since compulsory superannuation began in 1992. ""[It] will save around $17.9 billion [by placing it] back into the retirement savings of everyday Australians over the next 10 years. ""The only money superannuation trustees have to spend is yours, your retirement savings. ""We want to make sure when superannuation trustees make decisions about expenditure or make decisions about investment, that they do so with the best financial interest of their members of mind."" The government's changes also prevent people from being pushed into a new fund every time they start a new job. From now on, they will be stapled to their existing fund. ""[Those measures are about] getting rid of those duplicate accounts that proliferate throughout the system, getting rid of two sets of fees, two sets of insurances, and sometimes even more,"" Senator Hume says. Consumer groups have generally welcomed the reforms, although the industry funds lobby group, Industry Super Australia, has warned that many people could be stapled to dud funds. Super Consumers Australia director Xavier O'Halloran says it is time some super funds stop taking advantage of Australians. ""Unfortunately, at the moment, people are being charged really high fees for pretty poor outcomes in some accounts,"" Mr O'Halloran says. ""There's about $30 billion a year that people are spending on superannuation fees, and the average person's probably getting about 1 per cent of their superannuation creamed off the top in fees, which really adds up."" ""Superannuation is one of those things that's really hard to keep track of  — the fees aren't in your face, you're not getting letters [from the provider] as often. ""And a lot of people miss out and don't realise that they've paid quite high fees each year in superannuation."" Mr O'Halloran says fees are made up typically of investment fees, which make up about 70 per cent of the cost, and administration fees, which make up about 30 per cent. ""You're looking at things like customer service, maintenance of the website for those administrative fees,"" he says. ""And then for investment fees, it's a lot of money going to fund managers to pay them to pick the best investment options to deliver good returns for you."" He says consumers paying above the 1 per cent average fee should shop around and look at the returns and the performance over the long term. ""Even if you're getting charged low fees, returns over the long term are going to be the really important factor,"" he says. ""Around tax time is a good time to check to see what you're paying, where your superannuation is, what types of returns it's delivering over the long term, and what kind of risk they're exposing you to for those types of returns."" He also notes that in order to attract new members, some funds also spend a lot of money on sponsorships but that they may not be delivering good returns and are ""essentially wasting members' money"". Executive director of research firm Rainmaker Information, Alex Dunnin, says currently superannuation funds are delivering amazing returns. ""It's just over a year since the worst of the COVID financial crisis hit,"" he says. ""The stock market has pretty much been riding the crest of a wave for the last 12 to 13 months, and super funds are now sitting on average [annual] returns of almost 20 per cent. ""And now with the results coming in for the financial year, super funds have just had their best year ever since when we starting keeping records 34 years ago - it's phenomenal the returns they're getting."" Mr Dunnin says there's now a massive push for super funds to lower their fees. ""Over the next few years, we expect super fund fees to come down a lot further than they are now, to the point where it could actually revolutionise the superannuation industry in Australia,"" he says. He says switching is easy and funds can no longer charge thousands of dollars when consumers want to exit a fund. ""You can just go to any super fund, click on the website and say, 'I want to join your fund'. And that fund will then do the administration work for you."" But Mr Dunnin also advises consumers to not only search for the lowest-fee fund. ""In itself, being in a low-fee fund doesn't matter. It's always the returns you get,"" he says. As more funds are put to the test, it's possible that some will fail and exit, while others will merge and become more competitive. ""If you look out over the next five to 10 years, I certainly think you'll see more consolidation in the superannuation industry,"" says Aware Super chief executive Deanne Stewart. ""The reason for that is that scale matters."" Aware Super is one of the better-performing funds in terms of fees versus performance and Ms Stewart says the Government's new laws will help by making sure that Australians don't have multiple accounts charging fees. ""Ultimately, you should have lower fees and therefore, better retirement savings,"" she says. ""Performance makes a huge amount of difference to someone's retirement balance."" The Productivity Commission review into superannuation looked at the performance of top-performing and bottom-performing funds. ""And then it showed if an average Australian worker started in a poor-performing fund and stayed there for the rest of their working life, they may end up with $600,000 less — that has a significantly greater impact than actually the fees on multiple accounts."" The Productivity Review also found that Australian funds were not as competitive compared to pension funds in European countries and Canada. But Ms Stewart says ""we are not comparing apples with apples"". ""They have a very different superannuation system to ours,"" she says. ""They're either government-run, or in some cases, they are privately run. But they are what's called defined benefit. So essentially, it's not about choice. It's not about investment options. It's about essentially guaranteeing a percentage of your income. ""You don't need any servicing or the administration side until you're nearing retirement. ""And so you've got a very different cost structure [overseas] to the Australian funds that are much more open, much more open to choice."" Part-time worker Molly Kane has now consolidated all her super accounts into one low-fee fund. But she says Australians have the power to change their fund anytime if it's not delivering. ""Look at your account — are you losing anything in fees?"" she says. ""Is your money growing or shrinking? Really have a look and see if there's anything better out there."" Ten years ago Ms Ferris consolidated her funds into one account and now pays closer attention to her fund's performance. ""I would advise go online, check your fees and charges, check your balances — you have control. It's your money,"" Ms Ferris says.

164,The cattle property market is red hot and Gina's ready to sell,markets,"  Australia's cattle property market is red hot, with rich listers like Gina Rinehart cashing in Record cattle prices, low interest rates and good seasonal conditions have fuelled a property boom in northern Australia's beef game, with some high-profile names set to cash in. The famous Wave Hill Station in the Northern Territory sold earlier this year for more than $100 million — at the time a record for a single pastoral holding. But that has now been eclipsed with the sale of Miranda Downs in Queensland's Gulf Country, which reportedly went for around $180 million. According to Rural Bank, the median price per hectare for Australian farmland increased 12.9 per cent last year. ""Across the board for all commodities, [farmland] values are up,"" said Will Rayner, Rural Bank's chief operating officer. ""But anything to do with red meat is behaving very well and we've seen some sensational results in the beef cattle sector in particular."" In terms of being able to generate a return from such huge farmland investments, Mr Rayner said the fundamentals were strong. ""The ability to get a return on investment is dependent on a range of factors, such as the volume of produce you can produce off the land, the price you can achieve for that, and then the price of debt — and all of those are looking pretty good at the moment,"" he said. ""I think what you're seeing with some of this sustained growth, is that there's no more farmland being produced, it's a finite resource, and Australian farmers are getting really good at producing more from that same parcel of land. ""Particularly in the northern cattle region, where you see investments in better dog fences and water infrastructure, it means the productivity is improving and it's driving farmers to pay these sorts of dollars."" An ABARES report into the financial performance of livestock farms found the average rate of return for NT cattle stations had almost doubled in the last 12 months to 3 per cent, and the average business profit for NT stations now sat at $707,000. Mr Rayner said it would take a few factors to change for the market to ""cool"". ""But we certainly don't subscribe to a boom-bust scenario in this instance, because we think those fundamentals are pretty strong."" ABC Rural has been told the highly-anticipated sale of Gina Rinehart's northern portfolio of cattle stations in WA and NT is on track to be finalised this month. The portfolio includes seven cattle stations, one feedlot and around 100,000 head of cattle. ""After a very high level of interest, a number of parties were short-listed into the stage-two process,"" said Elders agent Tom Russo. ""Physical inspections of the properties were delayed because of the north's above average wet season, but have now been completed. ""Short-listed buyers are making their final offers and it's anticipated the properties will be sold in July."" Mr Russo said the sale had attracted a mix of foreign and domestic investors, as well as established local beef producers looking to expand their operations. Retail billionaire Brett Blundy must also feel the time is right to sell, putting more than 1 million hectares of NT cattle country on the market, Up for sale is Amungee Mungee, Cresswell Downs and Walhallow Downs, which Mr Blundy bought in 2014-15 It has been estimated the combined value of the Rinehart, Blundy and North Star Pastoral stations up for sale in the NT could exceed $680 million — although with records continuing to fall, the pay days for these large corporates may end up being more. Mr Rayner said it was clear ""some of them are going to make some really handsome profits"".

165,analysis: It's the start of a new financial year — and economists are predicting it'll be a bumpy one,markets,"  Australia's economy will be weak and in need of support after the pandemic, top economists say Australia's economy will limp along after recovering from the pandemic, failing to regain the growth it had either in the years leading up to the crisis or the much higher growth in the decades before. That's the consensus of the 23 leading Australian economists assembled to take part in The Conversation's July 1 forecasting survey — a panel that includes former Treasury, Reserve Bank and International Monetary Fund officials and modellers and policy specialists from 13 Australian universities. On balance, the panel expects year-average economic growth (the measure reported in the budget) to slide from 4 per cent this financial year to just 2.2 per cent by 2024-25, well below the average of 2.6 per cent assumed in this week's intergenerational report. The panel forecasts much weaker business investment than does the budget and lower household spending, but higher wage growth and lower unemployment. It expects a flat share market, and slower growth in house prices. During the decade leading up to the COVID-19 crisis, economic growth averaged 2.6% per year. During the 27 years between the early 1990s recession and the crisis, it averaged 3.2 per cent. The panel's average forecast of 2.2 per cent by the end of the four-year budget forecasting horizon is lower than both the budget forecast of 2.5 per cent and the 2.6 per cent in the intergenerational report. Economic modeller Janine Dixon expects growth of just 1.7 per cent. She says after Australia has soaked up unemployment, its future economic growth can only be driven by population growth or improved productivity. With population growth expected to be weak for several years, GDP growth will be weak unless dwindling productivity growth rebounds. Forecasting veteran Saul Eslake says on the other hand, for as long as borders remain closed Australia should enjoy an ""artificial boost"" to domestic spending of more than A$50 billion per year from Australians who can't spend abroad. The two most optimistic forecasts of 3 per cent growth, from Angela Jackson and Sarah Hunter, are contingent on borders reopening and tourism and immigration restarting. The panel expect extraordinarily strong growth in the United States of 5.2 per cent throughout 2021 on the back of what panelist Warren Hogan calls massive government stimulus and a full-vaccination rate approaching 50 per cent. China's growth is forecast to rebound to 7.9 per cent, but will come under pressure from what panelist Mark Crosby describes as an attempt by some of China's customers to diversify the sources of supply away from China. The panel expects actual living standards to be higher than the bald economic growth figures suggest. This is because high iron ore prices boost Australians' buying power (by boosting the Australian dollar) and boost company profits in a way that isn't fully reflected in gross domestic product. In recent months, the spot iron ore price has been at a record US$200 a tonne, a high the budget assumes will collapse to near US$63 by April next year as supply held up in Brazil comes back online. The panel is expecting the iron ore price to stay high for longer than the Treasury — for at least 18 months, ending this year near a still-high US$158 a tonne. There's agreement that at some point the unusually high price will fall, with one panelist saying there might be ""one more year to ride this wave, then who knows"". Because the panel expects a higher iron ore price than the government in the year ahead, it expects a greater rise in nominal gross domestic product — the measure of cash pouring into wallets. The panel forecasts an increase of 5 per cent this financial year compared to the budget forecast of 3.5 per cent. But it expects consumer caution to limit growth in household spending to 4.2 per cent, much less than the budget forecast of 5.5 per cent. The panel expects unemployment to fall more quickly than the government does, to 4.7 per cent by mid-2022, a low the budget didn't foresee until mid-2023. The unemployment rate is already 5.1 per cent, something the May budget didn't expect for a year. However, it is to some extent artificially assisted because jobs that used to go to temporary foreign workers and were not counted in the employment statistics are now being taken by domestic workers who are counted. As foreign workers return to Australia, the process will unwind, putting upward pressure on the recorded unemployment rate. The May budget forecast wage growth of just 1.5 per cent in 2021-22 (less than forecast price growth), followed by only 2.25 per cent in 2022-23 (merely matching price growth), in part because of legislated increases in employers' super contributions. The forecasting panel is more optimistic for the year ahead, being able to take account of the Fair Work Commission's 2.5 per cent increase in award wages announced in June. Warren Hogan calls 2.5 per cent the new ""baseline"", with some labour shortages forcing some employers to offer more. Even so, the panel's average wage growth forecast for 2021-22 is 2.2 per cent, only marginally above expected price inflation of 2.1 per cent. The panel expects weaker home price growth in the year ahead, with the CoreLogic Sydney price index climbing 6.4 per cent after a year in which it soared 11.2 per cent. Melbourne prices should climb a further 5.2 per cent after a year in which they gained 5 per cent. The panelists say much will depend on how long mortgage rates remain at their record lows, what action authorities take to restrain lending and when immigration restarts. Over the past year, the bond rate at which the Commonwealth government can borrow for ten years has jumped from 0.9 per cent to 1.5 per cent in accordance with moves overseas. The panel expects further increases to a still-low 1.8 per cent by the end of this year and to 2.2 per cent by the end of next year. Even so, the panel expects no increase in the Reserve Bank's cash rate — the one that drives variable mortgage rates — for almost two years, until April 2023. Former Reserve Bank head of research Peter Tulip, now with the Centre of Independent Studies, says the bank meant it when it said it said it wouldn't lift the record-low cash rate of 0.1 per cent until actual inflation was ""sustainably within"" its 2-3 per cent target range, something that wasn't likely until 2024. Other panelists, including economic modeller Warwick McKibbin, believe those criteria might be met sooner, some as soon as mid-2022. The panel doesn't buy the government's bold prediction of a jump in non-mining business investment in response to budget tax measures. The budget predicts year-on-year growth of 12.5 per cent in 2022-23 after 1.5 per cent in 2021-22. Instead, the panel predicts 3.7 per cent in 2021-22 and 5.8 per cent in 2022-23, citing low population growth and the likelihood that most investment that could have been brought forward by tax measures has already been brought forward. Former IMF official Tony Makin also points to the relatively high tax rates facing foreign investors and the increasingly restrictive approach of the Foreign Investment Review Board. Other panelists cite lack of clarity about the rules governing investment in renewable energy and growing shortages of labour and materials as reasons to expect only restrained growth in business investment. On balance, the panel expects the US-Australia exchange rate to stay where it is at around 76 US cents as it has for years, noting that much will depend on the iron ore price and the strength of the US economy. On average, it expects no change in the Australian share market after 12 months in which the ASX200 has soared 24 per cent. The average hides sharp differences. Some panelists expect the ASX200 to climb a further 10 per cent, while others expect it to fall 10 per cent. One panelist, economic modeller Stephen Anthony, expects a collapse of 55 per cent, saying it ""smells like a blood bath is coming"". This year's budget forecast is for a deficit of 5 per cent of GDP after last year's near-record 7.8 per cent of GDP. Asked at what point over the next four decades the budget deficit would shrink to 1 per cent of GDP, three panelists replied ""never"". Six others said not before 2030. Only four nominated the decade ahead. Angela Jackson said any improvements in the budget position delivered by a better-than-expected iron ore price would be spent. Saul Eslake saw no appetite for either the tax increases or spending cuts that would be needed to eliminate the deficit, adding that, fortunately, there was no ""urgent requirement to do so"". Forecasts often don't come to pass. This time last year, mid-pandemic in a rapidly evolving situation, the panel forecast unemployment of 8.8 per cent, no share market growth and ultra-low wage growth of just 0.9 per cent. That these things didn't happen was in part due to the role of such forecasts in persuading the government to respond in an unprecedented fashion, a point made by Treasurer Josh Frydenberg launching the intergenerational report on Monday. This year's forecasts, prepared in a less-hectic environment, might have more staying power. They point to a weak recovery and an economy reliant on government support for some time to come.

166,Southern NSW farmers re-write the record books again selling Australian White ewes for $994 a head,markets," ABC Rural Southern NSW farmers re-write the record books again selling Australian White ewes for $994 a head Records are made to the broken and the Adler family made short work of the high price they set just seven days ago when they sold their Australian White ewes for $988 a head. Colin and Rosemary Adler who farm at Barmedman in southern NSW offered 60 station-mated-ewes on AuctionsPlus this week, with a draft of 20 ewes selling for a staggering $994 a head. It is understood this is a record commercial ewe price for Australian White breed and for AuctionsPlus. The remaining 40 head sold for $992 a head. The ewe lambs were nine to 11 month old and weighed on average 55.9 kilograms (liveweight). The ewes were joined to Tattykeel rams and were Tattykeel Certified Australian White commercial blood ewes. The ewes were in demand with AuctionsPlus recording combined 595 bids across the three lines, with all lots clearing the reserve by well over $300 each. AuctionsPlus reported the 60 ewes were sold in three lots and were all bought by Victorian buyers. They were sisters to last weeks run of 41 scanned-in-lamb ewes the Adlers sold for $988 a head and bought by a Condobolin farmer. AuctionsPlus chief economist Tim McRae said last week's result was a very pleasant surprise and this week's result was the cream on top. ""People are willing to pay record prices to get their hands on these genetics,"" Mr McRae said. He said the ewes were scanned undetectable of a lamb in early May and were then rejoined to Tattykeel Australian White rams. ""They were station-mated so it was a riskier decision for buyers, so it's obviously a genetics buy and it's an indication of where buyers want to be taking their own flocks on-farm,"" Mr McRae said. ""It is a very good result and very strong evidence the Australian White breed is very hot at the moment."" Mr McRae said based on sales from the online auction platform last week restocker pregnant ewes were in demand with almost a 100 per cent clearance rate. He said the 8,000 head of scanned-in-lamb (SIL) Merino ewes they sold averaged $254 a head and the 2000 SIL shedding ewes they sold averaged $480 a head. ""While the bulk of ewes aren't being sold for anywhere near the record prices, there is still very strong demand and the optimism out there from producers is very strong in the middle of winter,"" Mr McRae said. As far as Mr McRae was aware the Adlers  did not have any more ewes ready to market. ""They will certainly be checking every paddock given what they are worth at the moment,"" he said.

167,"Cryptocurrencies crash, while ASX dips despite Wall Street gains",markets,"  ASX dips despite Wall Street gains, as Bitcoin price sinks below $US30,000 The Australian share market has closed lower, as analysts from most of Australia's major banks predict an interest rate hike far sooner than expected. The ASX 200 closed 0.6 per cent lower at 7,298 points, with most sectors ending in the red. The major bank stocks all lost ground, led by a 2 per cent fall for Westpac, while Commonwealth Bank shares lost 1 per cent. During the afternoon, some CBA customers could not access the bank's app and NetBank site. It followed a widespread outage affecting a number of businesses last week. Travel stocks lagged as a COVID-19 cluster in Sydney's east grew, with further restrictions introduced, limiting the travel of Sydney residents just days out from the NSW school holidays. Flight Centre shares fell 3.5 per cent, while shares in Webjet dropped 2.3 per cent. A number of states banned people from several of the Sydney hotspots entering, while South Australia and Western Australia imposed a hard border with NSW. Materials was the only sector to gain ground during the session, with gains for Boral (+4.5pc) and miners BHP (+1pc) and Rio Tinto (+0.7pc). Technology stocks were also among the top performers, after similar moves on Wall Street, led by Zip Co (+6.4pc), Appen (+3.3pc) and Afterpay (+3.2pc). The Australian dollar was slightly weaker against the greenback, buying around 75.4 US cents at 4:30pm AEST. The falls for Australian shares came as analysts from major banks predicted the nation's historically low cash rate would be raised far sooner than the Reserve Bank's current timeline. While it has been sticking to its deadline of 2024, Commonwealth Bank economist Gareth Aird now believes a hike is on the cards by late 2022. ""For the past six months, CBA's economic forecasts for the Australian economy have been at odds with the RBA's '2024 at the earliest' forward guidance on the cash rate,"" he said. ""But we have refrained from calling a hike in the cash rate until now because we believed that markets were more focused on the RBA's policy decisions around yield curve control (YCC) and the bond buying program."" He estimated the cash rate could go from 0.1 per cent to 0.5 per cent by end of 2022, and then peak at 1.25 per cent by mid-to-late 2023. There are also ongoing rumblings that very low interest rates in the US could also be raised sooner than expected, as inflation rises there. The Nasdaq finished 0.8 per cent higher overnight, helped along to a record high by blue-chip names Microsoft and Facebook. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones also ended in the green. But the focus on Wall Street was once again on the US Federal Reserve, with another round of comments from chair Jerome Powell. Fears interest rates could begin rising as soon as next year in the US in response to rising inflation drove stocks lower at the end of last week. In his address to the US House of Representatives, Mr Powell noted again that he expected the recent surge in inflation to be temporary. ""As these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer-run goal,"" he said. US Treasury yields (interest) were broadly lower overnight, suggesting that investors were soothed by Mr Powell's comments. ""Powell once again acknowledged the risk that reopening frictions on inflation 'have been larger' and 'may turn out to be more persistent' than expected,"" CBA analysts noted. ""However, Powell said he had 'a level of confidence' that the lift in inflation will prove transitory and that 5 per cent year-on-year inflation would be unacceptable."" The bank believes because underlying inflation has been more modest, that the Fed will largely stick to its guns. ""Indeed, trimmed inflation suggests underlying inflation in all economies we cover, with the exception of Canada, remains subdued,"" CBA said. The US dollar dropped, which in turn pushed the Australian currency slightly higher to 75.60 US cents. Iron ore is also up 3 per cent to $212.70. That was after it took a hit yesterday, on news that China was going to start investigating Australia's most lucrative export. The controversial cryptocurrency briefly dropped beneath $US30,000 overnight for the first time since early this year. At one point, it even dipped to $US28,600, a five-month low. Bitcoin dropped as China continued to make moves to crack down on the unregulated currency. An intensifying Chinese regulatory crackdown sends bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies into a renewed price dive. The latest rumblings from the superpower is that China's south-west Sichuan province has ordered cryptocurrency mining projects to close down. Other cryptocurrencies were dragged down with Bitcoin, including the also popular Ether. It is now back above $US32,000. Senior market analyst Edward Moya said Bitcoin is in the ""danger zone"" where a drop beneath US$30,000 could soon see it plunge further to $US25,000. ""The bull case for Bitcoin is falling apart and some longer-term investors might worry that the $20,000 level might not be defended as short-term fundamentals continue to deteriorate,"" he said. ""Cryptocurrencies are crashing across the board when you consider how low all the top coins are down from their respective highs. ""Bitcoin and Ethereum are down over 50 per cent, while Dogecoin has lost over 70 per cent of its value since peaking in May.""

168,Wool back in the black for five-week streak,markets,"  The Australian wool market is back on track after a five-week winning streak for growers in the auction room. The Australian Wool Exchange Eastern Market Indicator (AWEX EMI) is now trading at 1,448 cents a kilogram, which was 309 cents a kilogram higher than the same time last year. Clearance rates were also good with just 4.6 per cent of the 42,496 bales passed in at auction between the three selling centres at Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle- which meant almost $70 million worth of wool was sold. The big winners have been fine wool growers with 17-micron wool and finer clips commanding above 2,500c/kg. Southern New South Wales wool broker Marty Moses from Temora said an emerging trend was some urgency from China as the wool buying season comes to an end and the three-week July recess for auctions loomed. ""Chinese processors are trying to get ahead of the curve and get stock on the water,"" Mr Moses said. ""It is reportedly for domestic consumption and mainly knitwear that's being purchased online in China. ""The Chinese seem to be enjoying our wool and are willing to pay, so let's hope that continues."" China is still the biggest buyer in the room, so far for 2020/2021 securing 85 per cent, about 196 million kilograms (Mkg) of the Australian wool clip. A long way behind is the Czech Republic which has purchased 4pc (8.4Mkg) of the clip; India 3pc (7.6Mkg) and Italy 2pc (4.9Mkg). Mr Moses said wool was now flowing onto the market after farmers were delayed from shearing at their regular times during the COVD-19 travel restrictions, when New Zealand shearers were unable to come to Australia. He said wool previously passed in at auction was reoffered in the higher market. The reoffer percentage of 7pc for fleece wool in the Sydney and Melbourne markets and 13pc at Fremantle. With only Melbourne and Sydney auction rooms in action this week it was anticipated the EMI could lift further, as the national offering was reduced to 34,600 bales. ""The market is starting to get back to this really profitable level, in particular for the fine and superfine wool,"" Mr Moses said. ""It's such a volatile market environment that it could even get dearer, it's a pleasant surprise to see that EMI around the 1450 mark, I didn't think it would get there,"" he said. ""Is 15 bucks possible? Maybe. Is 1,350c/kg the next destination? Who knows what is going to happen in spring."" The northern New South Wales region of New England is well known for its superfine wool growing. After years of drought and volatile prices, growers were welcoming the buoyant market alongside good seasonal conditions. Walcha superfine wool grower Martin Oppenheimer said the lift in demand was good news for growers. ""At the moment we're really happy to see the prices lift ,"" Mr Oppenheimer said. ""It will make a massive difference, particularly in the New England, because most of our merinos are fine, superfine or ultrafine and that's where there has been a big lift in the market,"" he said. Mr Oppenheimer believed the constant demand for the fibre and the lack of supply across the industry would bolster prices for some time. However, due to years of drought merino ewe numbers had declined, and as a result, so too had wool production. While numbers of merinos were stabilising following the drought, there was still limited wool available to supply the increased demand. Mr Oppenheimer said flock numbers were the biggest hurdle the industry had to overcome. ""The potential growth we're seeing in sheep numbers in the national flock is coming from the non-merino ewes, so we have got a problem with supply,"" Mr Oppenheimer said. ""But for those of us that have been in the industry, we have got the sheep and we can breed our way out and it will be pretty good for some time for us."" Meat and Livestock Australia projected the Australian sheep flock would grow by 6.3 per cent in 2021 to 68.1 million head. This follows the flock falling to its lowest level on record in 2020, at 64 million head, after years of drought. By 2023, the flock is expected to be 75.4 million head.

169,"Canola price falls, but market remains volatile",markets," ABC Rural Golden canola price loses some lustre as prices fall After reaching record highs, global oilseed prices are falling due to improved weather conditions in key growing areas of the Northern Hemisphere. In the past month, Australian canola prices have dropped by around $100 per tonne, while Canadian futures have lost $150 Canadian a tonne. The price drop is not good news for Australian farmers who have planted their largest canola crop area of just under three million hectares. But volatility in the market at this time of year is normal, according to Thomas Elder markets analyst Andrew Whitelaw. ""We've seen really quite a bit of a sell-off in all commodities in the past week to two weeks, everything from wheat, corn to soybeans, to even lumber and forestry products,"" he said. ""This time of year, between the end of May and the middle of August, is when things are really exciting for pretty much all grains. ""The reason behind that is that the majority of the world's wheat, corn, soybean and canola crop is in the production phase in that period. ""If something goes wrong, like a little bit of hail in France or a bit of flooding in the US, it can cause the market to react."" American soybean futures prices experienced their largest single-day fall last week but bounced back the next day, another reflection of market volatility. Mr Whitelaw said oilseed prices had also softened due to large global planting areas of canola and soybeans, including Australia's record canola crop planting. Canola prices in Australia neared $800 a tonne last month, and while Mr Whitelaw said prices had been ""overheated"", they may yet spike again. ""The reason why canola increased in value so much was off the back of weather concerns in the US and Europe, however, things have started to improve,"" he said. ""We are seeing some pretty beneficial weather across large tracks of the US soybean growing area, and a little bit of improvement in areas of Canada where the canola crop is grown."" However global stocks of oilseeds remain very tight, and this could easily see prices rise again. ""If something does go majorly wrong in one of these growing areas, then we have potential to see some pretty strong upward movement, back up to where things have been, or at least half the way,"" Mr Whitelaw said. He said even at its reduced price of just over $700 a tonne in WA and just under $700 in the east, in a historical context, Australian canola prices were still very strong. ""Historically a lot of farmers that we speak to would say anything with a six in front of it is good, so anything with a seven in front of it is fantastic, and hopefully some people did some forward selling when there was an eight in front of it,"" he said.

170,Westpac tips rate rise by early 2023 as Australian shares end the week higher,markets,"  Westpac tips interest rate rise by early 2023 as ASX ends the week higher Westpac is now tipping the Reserve Bank will start raising interest rates at the beginning of 2023, more than a year ahead of previous expectations. The forecast comes from one of Australia's most respected rate watchers, the bank's long-serving chief economist Bill Evans. Mr Evans said he and his team changed their views on the interest rate outlook after reviewing yesterday's ""stunning"" decline in unemployment. ""The May employment report is a major 'game changer' for policy. It underscores the strength of momentum in the economy and endorses the range of other measures pointing to a very strong labour market,"" Mr Evans wrote in a note to clients. ""The recovery is now clearly into a self-sustaining upswing and the need for emergency stimulus policies has eased significantly. ""Taken with yesterday's clear signal from the Federal Reserve that wider economic risks from the health emergency have eased and policy normalisation can be brought forward, the challenges facing the RBA are changing."" Mr Evans is forecasting an unemployment rate of just 4 per cent in a year's time, which would lead to upward pressure on wages and inflation. He said this is similar to, but six months ahead of, the Reserve Bank's own ""upside"", or best-case, forecasts. Mr Evans is expecting the first rate increase to come in the first three months of 2023. However, he forecasts that the increases will be small and gradual, with only a 15-basis-point increase in the March quarter, followed by another 25-basis-point rise in the second quarter and one more 25-basis-point increase in the fourth quarter. That would take the cash rate from 0.1 per cent now to 0.75 per cent by the end of 2023. It is the most aggressive rate forecast so far from a major bank, coming soon after ANZ's economists tipped rate rises starting in the second half of 2023 (although that was ahead of yesterday's jobs report). The Australian share market finished the week on a high, unlike the local currency and commodity prices, which took a hit. However, local shares gave up stronger earlier gains, with the ASX 200 closing just 0.1 per cent higher at 7,369. The broader All Ordinaries index did better, closing up 0.3 per cent at 7,624. Education (+3.3 per cent), industrials (+2.3 per cent) and technology (+2 per cent) led the way amongst the top 200 firms. Friday's top winners included tech stocks, such as Afterpay (6.5pc) and rival Zip (+9.9pc). That was after the tech-laden Nasdaq in the US also rose 0.9 per cent overnight. Healthcare and consumer goods stocks also traded up, including Mesoblast and Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals with gains above 7 per cent. Meanwhile, energy companies took a hit as commodity prices globally faltered and the price of crude oil dropped. The losers included BHP (-2.5pc), Santos (-3.6pc), and Oil Search (-2.9pc) in a broad-based sell off. Gold miners also lost some of their shine, with the biggest of them on the ASX, Newcrest, off 3 per cent to $25.96. Supermarket chain Woolworths fell 1.6 per cent to $42.67, in contrast to a 0.4 per cent gain for rival Coles. Woolworths was already trading down this week, but it has now been hit with news that the Fair Work Ombudsman is suing it for allegedly underpaying managers. Finance stocks were down 0.4 per cent. Among the biggest losers were CBA (-1.7pc), Challenger (-1.9pc) and AMP (-0.6pc). NAB was also down 0.4 per cent. This morning the bank announced it has settled a US class action against it for an undisclosed amount of money. The class action related to it and other Australian banks' alleged manipulation of the bank bill swap rate (BBSW) last decade. A quick guide to the rate rigging scandal. BBSW is the interest rate at which banks are lending to each other. It is also used as a reference point to set interest rates on many business loans, and other lending. ASIC sued NAB, Westpac, CBA and ANZ last decade over their use of the BBSW between 2010 and 2012, alleging they had rigged the rates. All four paid penalties. A US trader and two US investment funds filed the class action against the banks over BBSW in 2016. Westpac, CBA and ANZ had already settled. NAB said it was dismissed from the class action on jurisdictional grounds but there was room for appeal, and it has now decided to settle. ""The settlement is without admission of liability,"" it added, noting also that the details were confidential but the amount was not material to its financial results. The Friday gain is setting the benchmark on track to recover from its losses on Thursday, after it followed Wall Street into the red. Conversely, the Reserve Bank of Australia is largely sticking to its forecast of 2024 to lift historically low rates. The Australian dollar was down at 75.36 US cents by 4:26pm AEST, which is close to a year-to-date low, NAB analysts said. That was after the US dollar doubled its post-Federal Reserve announcement gain, while US government bond yields (interest) rose at their highest rate in three months. ""The big dollar has added the same again (0.9 per cent) to Wednesday’s post-Fed gains, in doing so pulling AUD/USD to within a whisker of its 2021 year-to-date lows,"" NAB said. ""The growing divergence between the RBA’s dovish stance and most other central banks we monitor is a headwind to AUD,"" ANZ analysts noted this morning. ""If the RBA maintains its dovish outlook in July, the risk is AUD will take longer to lift and may not reach our forecast peak of 0.83 (end Q3 21)."" Meanwhile, there were mixed results on US markets. The Dow Jones closed 0.6 per cent down, S&P 500 was flat, and the tech-laden Nasdaq was up 0.9 per cent. Commodity prices are also continuing to track down. Copper, aluminium and crude oil were already tracking down this week before the Federal Reserve announcement, however NAB noted that this had exacerbated price softening. ""The post-Fed market positioning shake-out has been most evident in the commodities market,"" they said. ""Iron ore futures are up though, albeit by just 1.2 per cent."" Some of the main movers on the ASX 200 this week have been commodity companies. Meanwhile, some of the high experienced by this week's positive jobs data could be deflated by a new note by CommSec. ABS figures are hiding 300,000 job losses that helped to push down Australia's unemployment rate after the borders were closed. ABS data out this week showed Australia's population only increased by 6,900 people or by 0.03 per cent in the December quarter. That's after COVID slammed Australia's borders shut to new arrivals. Migrants often compensate for the country's birthrate. Overall 2020 saw the lowest calendar year population growth since WWI, in 1916. ""The slowest population growth in a century and an extended period of international border closures is likely to eventually constrain the economy, particularly the labour and housing markets, given Australia’s aging population,"" Commsec senior economist Ryan Felsman said. ""Of course, countries with higher COVID-19 vaccination rates could re-open their borders more quickly, attracting international tourists, students and highly skilled workers."" Just this week, Commonwealth Bank chief economist Gareth Aird also pointed out that Australia's lowering unemployment rate was being buffered by the loss of 300,000 short-term Australian migrant workers. The jobs data out this week showed unemployment back at pre-COVID levels but many employers were grappling with staff shortages as borders stayed closed.

171,US Federal Bank's 'surprise hawkish' interest rates forecast sends Wall Street and ASX into red,markets,"  US Federal Bank's 'surprise hawkish' interest rates forecast sends Wall Street and ASX into red The Australian share market has followed Wall Street into the red after the US Federal Reserve flagged a sooner-than-expected interest rate hike, but local jobs data surprised to the upside. The ASX 200 closed down by 0.4 per cent at 7,359 points. The benchmark index fell in early trade, due to the US Federal Reserve now being expected to raise its official interest rate by 2023, but it pared its losses after local jobs data showed unemployment rate had fallen back below pre-COVID levels. However, the market lost steam again through the afternoon, with losses for the miners, energy and real estate stocks offsetting big gains by the banks. The financial sector was the best performer, with big rises for Westpac (+1.5pc), CBA (+1pc) and ANZ (+1.1pc). That was despite the three banks being hit by a widespread outage of internet and app banking, with services restored in the late afternoon. Superannuation stock Netwealth was one of the strongest performers of the session, gaining 5.2 per cent. Shipbuilder Austal closed up (+4.6pc), but that was it gaining back some of what it lost on Wednesday, when it hit a 52-week low. Miners took a hit, with heavy falls for Whitehaven (-11.5pc), Northern Star (-7.6pc), Oz Minerals (4.7pc) and Evolution Mining (-4.7pc). Major miners BHP (-1.4pc), Rio Tinto (-1.2pc) and Fortescue (-1.5pc) also weighed on the market. Coles lost 4.5 per cent after the supermarket told investors it was planning to spend more to make more. Wall Street's three main indexes all finished in the red, with the Dow Jones losing 0.8 per cent, S&P 500 off 0.6 per cent, and the tech-laden Nasdaq finishing 0.2 per cent down. That came after the US Federal Reserve said it was likely to raise interest rates by 2023 — a year sooner than widely predicted. The largely unexpected news came after warnings about mounting inflation in the US. Its rate has been set at 0.25 per cent during the COVID pandemic, just shy of a historical low set during the GFC. The potential move higher in interest rates was signalled by 13 out of 18 of its members after a two-day meeting. Speaking after the meeting, Fed chair Jerome Powell told reporters that committee members had also begun a discussion about scaling back the central bank's massive bond-buying program. He said the improved health situation, vaccinations and a better-than-expected economic recovery were affecting the outlook for monetary policy. The US dollar rose, stocks declined, and yields (interest rates) on 10-year treasuries jumped. US stocks did somewhat recover in the last hour of trade, however. Meanwhile, the AUD lost an entire US cent overnight, but its now slightly recovering at 76.30 US cents. Principal Global Investors chief strategist Seema Shah said the Fed's comments came ""just as the market was getting comfortable with a patient Fed and inflation considerably above target"". ""Now it will be up to Powell and other Fed speakers to once again reassure markets that tightening in 2023 doesn't need to be disruptive,"" she said. ""There will still be question marks about the timing of tapering but, overall, the dot plot shouldn't unnerve the market too much, as long as Powell gets his communication on target."" NAB analysts described the meeting as a ""hawkish surprise"". ""The market reaction was all about the 'dots', showing that 13 of the 18-person FOMC see rates rising in 2023 versus only six previously, and with the median forecasting jumping straight to two hikes from none."" They noted that most Fed members eventually see the benchmark interest rate rising back to 2.5 per cent, with a minority seeing rate rises as early as next year. ""For 2022, seven out of 18 now see first rate hike (two of whom forecast two hikes, from one previously). The 'long run' median dot remains at 2.5 per cent."" The US Fed's announcement came just hours before the Reserve Bank of Australia's governor also spoke. Australia's cash rate has also been at historical lows during COVID and our central bank has been pursuing many similar measures to the US, such as government bond purchases. Philip Lowe said while it was clear that the jobs market had rebounded post-COVID, Australia was still in ""the recovery phase"". He said the Reserve Bank had made no new decisions on the cash rate or bond buying, but indicated it was canvassing a range of different scenarios. ""In some of these, the conditions for an increase in the cash rate could be met during 2024, while in others these conditions are not met,"" he said. ""The Board will review these scenarios again at its next meeting."" The Reserve Bank is holding the line on low interest rates for years to come, but some economists warn the risks of an inflation ""rebirth"" are rising, an issue the US central bank will be discussing this week. At its June meeting, the RBA said it expected inflation here to temporarily rise above 3 per cent this year, as price reductions introduced during the pandemic are reversed, before quickly falling back below its target. Official consumer inflation in Australia was running at just 1.1 per cent over the year to March. Comparably, consumer inflation spiked to 5 per cent in May in the United States, with major increases in prices for used cars, air travel and accommodation. ""At the Reserve Bank Board's next meeting we have two important decisions to make,"" Mr Lowe said. ""The first is whether or not to extend the yield target from the April 2024 bond to the next bond, which matures in November 2024. ""And the second is whether, and in what form, to extend the bond purchase program once the current program is completed in September."" He said the RBA had already ruled out entirely stopping bond buying in September. ANZ analysts noted on Thursday that Lowe's wording seemed to be ""shifting"". ""For us, the most notable aspect of RBA Governor Lowe’s speech was the omission of the words,"" they said. ""That is: 'is unlikely to be until 2024 at the earliest' that the conditions for a rate hike will be met. ""Instead Lowe said that meeting the conditions, which centre on wages growth being ""materially higher"", ""still seems some way off"". ""We see this as a further evolution of the RBA's forward guidance.""

172,"ASX up on oil while copper takes a hit, as Wall Street mulls Federal Reserve meeting",markets,"  ASX rises on commodity prices, as Wall Street mulls Federal Reserve meeting The Australian share market closed slightly higher on Wednesday, with oil and copper stocks among the day's biggest movers as commodity prices fluctuate. The ASX 200 ended 0.1 per cent higher at 7,386 points, another record close after yesterday's rally. During the session, the benchmark index broke through 7,400 points for the first time. However, the market pulled back as the major miners fell into the red, including BHP (-1.7pc) and Fortescue (-1.6pc). Strong performers on Wednesday included energy stocks, health care and financials. Among the top performers of the session was Woodside Petroleum (+2.3pc), while Santos, Oil Search, Origin Energy, and Beach Energy also ended higher. That is after the price of crude oil rose 1.9 per cent overnight. Conversely, copper lost almost 4 per cent overnight, while nickel and aluminium were also lower. The biggest loser on the ASX 200 was Oz Minerals (-6.7pc), which is a mining company with a focus in copper. The banks also helped lift the market, led by a 1.3 per cent rise for Commonwealth Bank shares. Overall, the financial index was up 0.8 per cent. Australian insurer Suncorp gained 1.3 per cent, a day after it announced it was likely to take a hit from Victorian storm payouts. It told the ASX yesterday it expected a maximum loss of $50 million after almost 4,000 claims were lodged early this week. Citi has lowered its full-year estimate but is still retaining its buy rating. The Australian dollar was slightly higher, buying around 76.9 US cents at 4.20pm AEST. Overnight, all three majors indices on Wall Street closed down, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq losing the most at 0.7 per cent. The US Federal Reserve's two-day meeting started on Tuesday (US time). It will follow inflation data which showed US consumer prices rising at their fastest rate in more than a decade. At the same time, the most recent US jobs figures showed 559,000 jobs created in May, but that missed forecasts, which eased concerns that it could prompt the Fed to shut off the stimulus taps sooner. Market-watchers will be looking to the Fed's policy update for any signs of when the central bank might begin to pull back its pandemic stimulus or tackle rising inflation. Global ratings agency Fitch believes ""runaway"" inflation is unlikely. Nevertheless, it has brought forward its inflation forecasts. ""We expect US CPI inflation to fall from 4.1 per cent at end-2021 to 2.2 per cent by end-2022, but then to rise again to 2.5 per cent in 2023 as output moves further above potential after the labour market fully recovers in late-2022. ""We now expect the Fed to hike rates in 4Q23, one year earlier than our previous expectation. ""The ECB will not follow suit and will likely continue asset purchases through 2023 as eurozone inflation remains below target."" NAB analysts do not believe there will be any substantial change to policy. ""We think [Fed] Chair [Jerome] Powell will indicate officials discussed talking about tapering, but tapering itself is still some way off,"" they said in a morning note. ""[That is] given the Fed remains well short on making substantial progress on employment, with payrolls still 7.3m below pre-pandemic levels."" The Reserve Bank is holding the line on low interest rates for years to come, but some economists warn the risks of an inflation ""rebirth"" are rising, an issue the US central bank will be discussing this week. ANZ believes the Fed will bring forward its inflation projections. ""However, the Fed is seeking a full recovery in jobs, so we expect Chair Powell will continue to argue that the rise in inflation is transitory and that the Fed is well equipped to respond to higher inflation if necessary."" Meanwhile, the chair of Australia's Reserve Bank is also set to make a speech tomorrow too, which will also be closely watched for any signs that the cash rate could be tweaked. ""In our view, either event could be the catalyst to push the AUD higher and more in line with its strong fundamentals,"" CBA analysts noted.""

173,"Prices jump at fastest pace since 2008 in the US, but Wall Street and the ASX are unmoved",markets,"  Wall Street unmoved as US prices jump at highest rate since 2008; ASX trading down The Australian share market has ended Friday at an all time high, as financial stocks come off a peak and after Wall Street shrugged off inflation data. The ASX 200 ended Friday up 0.1 per cent at 7,312 points. That is its highest-ever close. The benchmark also hit an intraday trading high this week. The benchmark opened in negative territory on Friday after financial stocks came off a high. Financial stocks were the biggest drag of the day. EML Payments ended almost 4 per cent down, while Virgin Money lost 2.6 per cent. ANZ also lost 1.5 per cent. Gold miners performed well after the spot price of the commodity rose 0.4 per cent overnight. Resolute and Perseus both gained more than 5 per cent each. Healthcare stock Mesolblast was also a strong performer with a gain of almost 6 per cent. US markets all closed in positive territory with the Dow up 0.1 per cent and the Nasdaq up more than 0.8 per cent. That comes after long-anticipated inflation data showed soaring prices of consumer goods. The CPI data showed prices jumped 5 per cent in May, which is the fastest rise in prices the superpower has seen since August 2008. The core rise of 3.8 per cent, which excluded food and energy prices, was also the sharpest rise in almost three decades. But the headline data hides the nuance. A large bulk of the rises are being led by the prices of cars, which have been driven up globally by a chip shortage. As seen in Australia, prices are also rising as people rush to build new homes as COVID calms, with prices of raw materials and labour rising. Airfares are also up as people start flying again. US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has been repeatedly asserting that higher inflation will be transitory as the economy re-opens. ""The short squeeze continues in US Treasuries, as even stronger than expected CPI was not enough to slow the recent momentum,"" Westpac analysts noted this morning. ""The data had enough aspects of ""transitory"" influences that there was scepticism around whether it would influence near term Federal policy. ""The question now is just how far US yields will go?"" Westpac analyst Elliot Clarke also noted that inflation in the US appears to be contained to key categories. ""For this to change, the pockets of wage pressures seen in low skilled professions need to broaden across the economy,"" he said. ""(That's) an outcome we perceive to have a low likelihood as long as the overall level of employment remains well below its pre-pandemic peak. ""With the FOMC on the sidelines for the foreseeable future, we expect the US dollar to continue to trend lower, likely till late-2022.""

174,"ANZ predicts RBA rate hikes by 2023, while ACCC approves contentious Woolworths deal",markets,"  ASX closes up, ANZ tips rate hike, ACCC approves Woolworths deal, Greensill appeal fails The Australian share market has closed higher after ANZ predicted the Reserve Bank will hike the nation's official interest rate as early as 2023. The ASX 200 finished the day's trading up 0.4 per cent at 7,302, while the All Ordinaries closed up half a per cent at 7,558. The top mover was Iress with a gain of 16.8 per cent, while miner Whitehaven was up 5.1 per cent and Westfield shopping centre's owner was up 3.8 per cent. In the red were NRW Holdings (-3.3pc), A2 Milk (-3.3pc) and Oil Search (-3.3pc). Worley closed down 3.2 per cent after it reached an out-of-court settlement with Rio Tinto over a fire at an iron ore processing facility in Western Australia. ANZ's forecast is that, as inflation grows, the RBA will tighten the cash rate in two steps over the second half of 2023 to take it to 0.5 per cent by the end of that year. It is currently at the historic low of 0.1 per cent and it has not been as high as 0.5 per cent since the very start of the pandemic in March 2020. The central bank itself continues to forecast that the historic low cash rate will remain in place until ""at least"" 2024. ANZ noted that the benchmarks for rising rates, including inflation above 2 per cent and wages growth above 3 per cent, could be reached by next year as unemployment drops and GDP rises. ""The tighter labour market will drive wages growth and ultimately inflation higher,"" the bank's economics team wrote. ""The bands of uncertainty around our forecasts remain wider than usual. ""It is possible that the conditions for rate hikes arrive even earlier than the second half of 2023 if the recent trend of rapid improvement in the economy continues. ""But there is also the prospect that the recovery is knocked off-track by COVID and rate hikes are delayed."" Woolworths is set to takeover wholefood distributor PFD by June after the ACCC approved the contentious move. The family-owned PFD purchases food from manufacturers and distributes them to businesses like cafes, hotels and fast-food restaurants. Small business groups have been lobbying against Woolworths' $552 million acquisition because they argue it would create an even tighter supply chain in the grocery space. The ACCC says some of PFD's competitors ""expressed very strong concerns"" that the move would allow Woolworths to ""aggressively expand in food distribution and leverage its buyer power in supermarkets into food distribution, including through selling private-label products through PFD"". However, it said this morning that it had approved the takeover. ""Ultimately the evidence before us did not indicate the transaction would be likely to substantially lessen competition,"" ACCC Chair Rod Sims said. ""There are very few suppliers for whom both PFD and Woolworths make up a significant proportion of their channels to market."" Woolworths is up 0.6 per cent on open. In a statement to the ASX, it confirmed it will now proceed with the purchase by June and that PFD will remain under the control of its chief executive and family-owned founder, Kerry Smith. Today marked another loss for the Greensill family, the Bundaberg watermelon farmers who built a controversial finance business that spans the globe. The Australian Taxation Office wanted Peter Greensill to pay for capital gains made on the sale of shares between 2015 and 2017. The Peter Greensill Family Trust paid 100 per cent of the gains — $58 million – to Mr Greensill who was living overseas and classed as a foreign resident. The ATO said the Trust should pay tax on it. Mr Greensill took the ATO to court and lost. He appealed the decision. Today he lost that, too, and now has to pay the ATO's costs. Peter Greensill has a stake in Greensill Capital, the finance company that went into administration in March. In 2018 the AFR put him on its 'Young Rich List', with a fortune estimated at $412 million. Run by his older brother Lex, Greensill Capital's implosion has put businesses around the world in jeopardy. The ATO welcomed the verdict. ""The court's judgment clarifies issues around capital gains assessed to the trustee of a resident trust, where the trustee makes a non-resident beneficiary entitled to these gains,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. ""The ATO cannot comment further on the tax affairs of any individual or entity due to our obligations of confidentiality under the law."" On Wall Street overnight, all the major indices closed 0.1 to 0.4 per cent down. Investors there are awaiting the release of inflation figures. CBA analysts expect the US data to impact currencies when it is released at 10:30pm AEST tonight. The US dollar is down, with US 10-year Treasury yields falling below 1.5 per cent for the first time since March, CBA noted. ""Given high expectations, below consensus CPI figures could drag the USD lower,"" they said. ""In our view, the factors that bumped up inflation are considered short-lived and therefore will not prompt the FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] to tighten policy anytime soon.

175,ASX hits new high but ends in the red as Westpac cautions on property market cooling,markets,"  ASX hits new high but ends in red as Westpac cautions on property market cooling The ASX 200 has ended the day in the red, with consumer confidence data showing the effect of Melbourne's latest lockdown and Australians easing off their property high. The ASX 200 rose a solid 0.6 per cent on open and hit a new intra-day high just before lunchtime at 7,332. That was boosted by gains in mining stocks, with Perenti Global jumping after bagging a large contract from Sandfire Resources. But after lunch the positivism had flatlined and was starting to turn into the red. That was after Westpac released consumer confidence data. ""The Index has now fallen by 9.7 per cent over the last two months,"" its analysts said. ""We think the initial 4.8 per cent fall in May can be mainly attributed to a combination of a statistical correction following a very strong surge in April to an 11-year high, and some disappointment around the budget given high expectations leading into the announcement. ""The latest fall in June is almost certainly due to concerns around the two-week lockdown in Melbourne. The survey was conducted during the first week of the lockdown."" The ASX 200 closed 0.3 per cent down. More than half of the ASX 200's companies ended in the red. The major sector losers included tech stocks and the banks. The biggest hit overall was suffered by Altium (-7.5pc). The software maker soared by 40pc yesterday on a takeover bid but is now paring back on some of that gain. WiseTech also lost 4 per cent and Appen shaved off 3.9 per cent. Meanwhile, the Westpac consumer confidence data also shows Australians are finally coming down off their property high. ""Housing-related sentiment continues to show significant signs of stress,"" Westpac noted. ""The ‘time to buy a dwelling’ index recorded its fifth monthly decline in a row, dropping 7.1 per cent in June to be 27 per cent below its November level. ""At 96.1 the index is now in outright pessimistic territory for the first time since April last year, and prior to that, late 2017."" ""Surging prices and rapidly deteriorating affordability are clearly starting to weigh heavily on buyers, suggesting owner-occupier activity, particularly first home buyers, is likely to fade."" The ABC reported just last week that investors were flooding back into the market, inching out first home buyers who had surged into the market after interest rates dropped. Australia's largest brick manufacturer has been one ASX-listed company that has been helped by the COVID-19 property boom. Brickworks released estimates that its earnings before interest and tax would surpass expectations in both Australia and North America this financial year. Brickworks said the COVID-19 home-building boom in Australia and demand from retailers wanting to build bigger warehouses during the pandemic underscored demand for its product here. Demand for building materials including bricks has been rising during the pandemic. ""The availability of some materials, such as timber for house trusses, is an issue in some areas, with the resultant delays likely to flatten and extend the duration of the existing pipeline of work,"" Brickworks managing director Lindsay Partridge said. The company had also seen growth off its property portfolio, with developments including an Amazon facility and a Coles distribution warehouse. Its share price ended 11.3 per cent up. On Wall Street, the Dow closed marginally down (-0.1pc) while the S&P 500 was flat and the Nasdaq saw a comfortable gain of 0.3 per cent. That gain was led by major tech stocks Amazon and Apple. However, analysts there said the market was subdued and there was not a lot to motivate it to do anything exciting. So-called meme stocks did rally, though. The trend of small, underperforming and frequently shorted stocks being picked up by retail investors was seen during the GameStop phenomenon earlier this year. The latest rally involved a little known healthcare insurer Clover which has soared by more than 100 per cent. Analysts say its stock is at least 43.5 per cent shorted. Other notable rallies include Bed Bath & Beyond, Workhorse Group and the original meme stock, GameStop. Over in Bitcoin, the losses are less severe today with a dip of 1.9 per cent to $US33,535. The cryptocurrency has been suffering after more tweeting by Elon Musk, further regulation by China, and in latest news comments by former US president Donald Trump that the currency is ""a scam"".

176,Bitcoin down as Trump labels it 'scam'; ASX up as business confidence results released,markets,"  Bitcoin down as Trump labels it 'scam'; ASX up as business confidence results released The Australian share market ended in positive territory on Tuesday, as local data on business confidence offered up a mixed bag. The ASX 200 dipped into the red after lunch as ANZ's business confidence data showed a reduction of 0.6 per cent nationally last week during Melbourne's fourth COVID-19 lockdown. As to be expected, the most severe drop in confidence was among business owners in the Victorian capital itself with confidence there down 2.4 per cent, but other cities like Sydney were actually up 4.3 per cent. ""The emergence of a more infectious strain of COVID is raising concerns that the lockdown could be extended again,"" the bank said. ""This could have a more lasting impact on confidence than we have seen with recent snap lockdowns."" But Melbourne is so far reporting only two new cases of the virus today and investors are clearly shrugging off concerns that its lockdown will drag down the economy. But NAB's monthly business confidence data released later in the afternoon showed an overall rosier picture. The May results coincided with the federal budget. NAB's May results found business confidence dipped slightly in May but stayed ""very high"" while respondents' experience of business conditions rose overall to a new high. ""The survey measure of reported capex rose further, suggesting that the strong rise over 2021 is more than just a rebound from disruptions to activity and uncertainty during 2020,"" NAB said. The ASX swung up in the late afternoon and closed up 0.2 per cent. Strong performers included health stock Mesoblast (+8.8pc), aged care provider InvoCare (+3.5pc) and Whitehaven Coal (+3.8pc). Tech stocks and academics tied to COVID swings performed the best. Meanwhile, food stocks Collins and A2 Milk company lost more than 2.2 per cent each, as basic consumer goods overall performed badly. Harvey Norman also lost 1.7 per cent. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is continuing to make headlines thanks to some big names. Elon Musk weighed in about the cryptocurrency again with a series of tweets over the weekend. While stripped of his Twitter rights, former US president Donald Trump has called Bitcoin a ""scam"" in an interview with a US broadcaster. ""Bitcoin just seems like a scam,"" he said in an audio interview. ""I don't like it because it's another currency competing against the [US] dollar. Essentially it's a currency competing against the dollar. I want the dollar to be the currency of the world."" Mr Trump also told broadcaster Fox he was not investing in the traditional sharemarket at this time either. ""I have not invested in the stockmarket at this moment. I think it's high,"" he said. China is also pushing further regulation of non-traditional currency. On the weekend its social media giant, Weibo, cracked down on accounts on the platform related to cyrptocurrency. Chinese regulators last month also banned financial institutions and payment companies from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions, and warned investors against speculative crypto trading. Beijing already had rules around digital currency trading introduced five years ago but this took China's hardline stance further. Bitcoin crashed last month after Mr Musk's interest in the cryptocurrency wavered and his company Tesla did a U-turn on accepting it as a payment due to its energy use. It was trading relatively flat this week. However, it is now down 8 per cent again in the past 24 hours. It is currently buying around $US33,662. Another cyryptocurrency, Ethereum, is also down 6.9 per cent to $US2,593. The ASX 200 also ended up despite mixed results in the US. On Wall Street, shares were mostly lower, but only marginally, with the Dow and S&P 500 losing ground, while biotechs helped lift the Nasdaq. US shares did not move significantly despite an announcement by G7 over the weekend that it had agreed to back a minimum global corporate tax rate of at least 15 per cent. US treasury secretary Janet Yellen even went as far as to call the proposal a ""significant, unprecedented commitment"" to end what she called a race to the bottom on global taxation. Facebook has said it would pay more tax globally under the deal. Many other major techs on Wall Street could face the same outcome. ""Efforts by journalists to hype the significance of the weekend ‘historic’ G7 agreement (have) failed to match the equity price action,"" NAB analysts noted this morning. ""And where the NASDAQ has just finished with a gain of 0.5 per cent against small losses for the S&P and Dow."" The analysts pointed out the tax policy was flagged two weeks ago which may have absorbed the hit. ""It’s hard to avoid the sense the global markets are for the most part now simply lurching from one big event risk to the next with not a lot to see in-between."" The Australian dollar was up slightly against the greenback, to near 77.60 US cents. Credit agency S&P Global Ratings yesterday removed a negative outlook on Australia's AAA sovereign credit rating, due to the economy's much better than expected performance during the COVID pandemic.

177,'Restricting free speech': Super fund advisers fear being silenced on CEO pay and climate change,markets,"  Proxy adviser crackdown could censor activism on issues like executive pay, gender diversity and climate change When Rio Tinto destroyed a culturally significant cave in Western Australia's Juukan Gorge containing 46,000 years of human history, its board initially didn't appear to understand the gravity of the situation. Even after the company held a review into the catastrophe, not one single person was sacked — at that stage — for the failures. The boss of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI), whose members are mostly big superannuation funds in Australia and collectively own about 10 per cent of most of the big, listed companies, was livid. ""It was just a terrible, terrible tragedy for both the local traditional owners but for all Australians,"" says ACSI CEO Louise Davidson, reflecting back on discussions she had with Rio more than a year ago. ""We were really keen to work with Rio Tinto to say, 'well, how are you going to show appropriate contrition, appropriate accountability for what has occurred, and make sure that you can write those wrongs so that you have a social licence to operate in Australia?' ""And, you know, they were difficult conversations. There was a lot of investor pressure on Rio Tinto to go further than their original proposal to just to dock the pay of the executives who had been involved."" Subsequently, in September last year, the company announced its CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques would resign ""by mutual agreement"" and that two other senior executives would also be leaving. In March this year Rio Tinto's then chairman, Simon Thompson, took responsibility for the disaster and also announced he intends to stand down. ACSI is not the only investor that had frank conversations with Rio's board at the time and whose pressure resulted in the departures. But it is a particularly big player given the growing might of Australia's $3 trillion superannuation industry. Australian superannuation funds now own about 20 per cent of the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), shareholdings worth a total of about $440 billion. With such a big stake, they are having a far bigger say on how companies deal with governance issues, from the Rio Tinto Juukan Gorge disaster, to the lack of gender diversity on boards, big CEO pay packets and the failure of many corporates to address climate change. But it's not the super funds that are under pressure over how they publicly agitate and, at times, vote against the re-election of directors at company annual general meetings. It's the advice they get from proxy advisers like ACSI – that helps them make decisions on how to vote — that's now under question. The federal government wants to regulate proxy advisers, saying there's limited transparency in how they formulate their advice and how that advice then gets used by investors to cast votes. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg in April announced consultation that could lead to new regulation on proxy advisers. A Treasury paper suggests proxy advisers should be forced to give the companies they're reviewing five days' notice of how they are recommending shareholders should vote. It also suggests that super funds be required to make their voting records public, including where those votes were consistent with the advice of proxy firms. The Treasurer suggests that ""there is currently very limited regulation on how this proxy advice is formulated, provided, used and disclosed"" and that ""given the influence of proxy advisers on the conduct of businesses listed on the ASX, Treasury will consult on measures to help facilitate greater transparency of proxy advice."" The proposed changes are backed by corporate lobbies such as the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Institute of Company Directors. But they are strongly opposed by Australia's four main proxy advisers: ACSI, Ownership Matters, Institutional Shareholder Services Australia and CGI Glass Lewis. When institutional investors decide to vote against the re-election of a company director, they often rely on the advice of proxy advisers to help them make their decision. Sometimes the votes are simply protest votes: this happened in May in relation to Rio Tinto's remuneration report. Investors were angry about the long-term bonuses awarded to Mr Jacques, former iron ore boss Chris Salisbury and former corporate relations chief Simone Niven, despite their involvement in the destruction at Juukan Gorge and the response afterwards. But their vote was non-binding and Mr Jacques walked away with a 20 per cent pay increase of about $13 million in 2020. Other times, the votes of institutional investors, as well as retail investors, can result in what's known as a ""strike"". A 'two-strikes' law was introduced in 2010, following recommendations made in the Productivity Commission's 2009 Report on Executive Remuneration. Its purpose was to hold directors accountable for what was seen as exorbitant executive salaries and bonuses. Under the law, a 'first strike' occurs when a company's remuneration report receives a 'no' vote of 25 per cent or more by shareholders at the company's annual general meeting. The 'second strike' occurs when a company's subsequent remuneration report also receives a 'no' vote of 25 per cent or more. When a 'second strike' occurs, the shareholders will vote at the same AGM to determine whether all the directors will need to stand for re-election. If this 'spill' resolution passes with 50 per cent or more of eligible votes cast, then a 'spill meeting' will take place within 90 days and directors will be required to stand for re-election. Data from proxy advisory firm Ownership Matters shows that in 2019 and 2020 there were 50 strikes (25 in each year) cast by retail and institutional investors against the re-election of company directors. But it notes that while strikes and spills have taken place, in almost a decade none of the proposals put up at annual general meetings have resulted in directors being turfed out. In its submission to Treasury, Ownership Matters analysed resolutions put to annual general meetings held by ASX 300 companies between July 2011 and December 2020. It showed that 7,426 resolutions to elect board-endorsed directors were passed, with 96.2 per cent in favour. It says only six candidates were defeated (five because of takeover activity) and just 38 candidates withdrew their candidacy before the meeting results were tallied, many for routine causes such as job changes. Ownership Matters director Dean Paatsch says a resolution that frequently comes at company AGMs is whether the executives have actually earned the pay that's been delivered to them in the prior year. ""There are other issues that come up … but the most controversial one, the bit that gets under everyone's skin, is always [executive] pay,"" he says. Some of the outspoken critics against proxy advisers include billionaire retailer Solomon Lew. In December, Mr Lew lashed out at proxy advisors and shareholders after 48.5 per cent of shareholders in his retail company Premier Investments delivered the company a 'first strike' over its decision to issue dividends and executive bonuses while receiving JobKeeper payments. Mr Lew said he believed that the strike had been driven by some proxy advisors and that ""it's completely unclear to me how it can be justified"". Other big names to call for greater regulation on proxy advisers include Wesfarmers chief executive Rob Scott and Harvey Norman chairman Gerry Harvey, whose company remuneration reports have both been at threat of, or faced, strike action. In 2019, Ownership Matters and CGI Glass Lewis recommended Harvey Norman shareholders vote against the re-election onto the board of chief executive Katie Page. Ownership Matters did so in favour of shareholder activist Stephen Mayne. They didn't succeed, and in fact at the time knew there was no chance of succeeding given Mr Harvey had a 31 per cent controlling stake, and the estate of co-founder Ian Norman controlled 16.5 per cent. But the recommendations were made to send a message to the company that proxy advisers were not happy over its governance. Mr Paatsch says, while company directors don't like getting messages like this, it is what Parliament intended when it introduced the two-strikes rule. He thinks Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is being too heavily influenced by business lobbies on this issue. ""Many business groups like the Business Council of Australia, the trade union for Australian CEOs, and the Australian Institute of Company Directors, the trade union for non-executive directors, don't like proxy advisors,"" he says. ""And it seems to be that is a constituency that the Treasurer has decided to manage."" The argument that the regulation is ill-founded is one that a spokesman for Mr Frydenberg rejected, reiterating that its proposed regulation was about boosting accountability and transparency of proxy advisers. But Mr Paatsch argues what is being proposed is an extraordinary type of regulation. ""Five days before we publish a private report to our clients, we would be required to give that to the company so that they can fact check it and sign it off before we're allowed to give it to our clients — that is a dark cloud for free speech,"" he says. ""It's a dark cloud for the freedom to contract. And it's really disrespecting the intellectual property of a private business. ""I mean, what's next? Should we be asking journalists to send their copy to companies five days before they're allowed to publish it? It really makes no sense."" Mr Paatsch says a myth is being perpetuated that proxy advisors are ""cancelling capitalism"", but that the vast majority of resolutions that come before an AGM are passed with flying colours. ""Proxy advisors are very good at identifying issues that need to be resolved, and the data bears that out,"" he says. ""In the years following a first strike on remuneration reports, we've seen that the average vote 'against' [a company director's re-election] falls by over 20 per cent. ""That's [evidence of] identifying an issue early and leaving shareholders who make up their own mind to resolve that issue with the company."" He also notes: ""Dissent in capitalism is a good thing. ""Criticism is a good thing. And we should be promoting people's entitlement to actually give that feedback,"" he says. ""It's weird, frankly, that the government has picked this proposal out of the many things to do on that list and elevated it to be a top priority. ""I would have thought that in a time of COVID, when we have many, many economic challenges, the last thing we should be doing is restricting people's freedom of speech."" One of the Treasury paper's suggestions for regulatory change is to require proxy adviser to be ""meaningfully independent from a superannuation fund they are advising"". This, the paper argues, could ""ensure that proxy advice is provided to and used by superannuation funds on an 'arm's length' basis"". But Ms Davidson says that very proposal would make it impossible for ACSI to continue its work. ""We really think that the whole proposal by the government is a solution in search of a problem,"" she says. ""Personally, I would have thought there might have been other corporate governance priorities to be looking at, such as employment, such as finalising the implementation of the banking royal commission recommendations, many of which still have not been addressed."" From AMP sexual harassment to Rio Tinto destruction of Juukan Gorge, ACSI CEO Louise Davidson tells corporate Australia's main men why their actions aren't in sync with investor expectations. Ms Davidson says while they work closely with their superannuation fund members, the advice that ACSI provides to them is developed independently. ""We do a lot of internal research or research with external parties on various issues … and that research goes to inform the issues that we focus on in our discussions with companies. ""Our discussions with companies then go to inform what would be our voting advice that we would provide to our members: Do we think that they should support the passing of a remuneration vote, for example. ""One of our focuses, of course, is on executive pay and making sure that that stays within the bounds of reasonableness."" Their members then go through their own process to decide whether or not they're going to follow that voting advice. ""Some of them get advice from other proxy advisors, as well as from us,"" she says. ""But we think that it's really clear that there is not a good rationale for what has been proposed. There is no history of problems, in terms of accuracy of proxy advisor advice."" Debby Blakey heads $60 billion health and community services super fund HESTA. It holds big stakes in large publicly listed companies and is one of many large investors holding board directors to account, both at company AGMs as well as outside of them. Ms Blakey points to AMP's initial decision to promote Boe Pahari to the head of AMP Capital as an example of an issue they were angry about and that they worked to reverse, in sync with a number of other investors. Mr Pahari has since left the company. But he had been promoted despite apologising and having part of his pay docked after settling a sexual harassment case brought by his former subordinate Julia Szlakowski. ""Promoting someone to the position of CEO who had been involved in that sexual harassment issue really had concern for us because what was being disclosed publicly differed so greatly from the action that they took,"" Ms Blakey says. ""And I think the responsibility we have as shareholders is to engage and call that out. We talked about it as a credibility gap between what they said and what they did. ""And the result, of course of those engagements, not just by HESTA, but very broadly, was that AMP made some decisions about how they did actually have to make changes to meet community expectations."" AMP's promotion of Boe Pahari raises bigger questions for corporate Australia about how companies treat sexual harassment That included the resignation of AMP's then chairman David Murray. HESTA has also been active in voting against company directors when there's not enough women on their boards, and she says many times boards will act before the meeting to rectify the situation. ""Companies with gender diversity of board level will perform better,"" she says. ""If we are protecting the future value for our members ... we will vote against the appointment of senior directors where there are no women on the board."" ""And actually, it's very often that directors will get the message and will [before the AGM] make a decision about the appropriate composition of their board."" She also notes that, in terms of the advice they get from proxy advisers, it's just one of many sources they use to make a decision about how they vote. ""Rather than having to do deep analysis on every single vote, we choose to get advice from proxy advisors like ACSI, we also have engagement partners that give us input, and we also obviously have asset managers. ""There's often very strong alignment in terms of how the asset manager ACSI, other engagement partners and our own internal team will see situations, but at times, they are not that simple. And at times, they're very diverse views and HESTA will navigate that."" She says the objective is in terms of using ACSI and others for advice is to enhance the future retirement outcomes for all Australians. But AICD managing director Angus Armour says there's little transparency about how investors come to make decisions, and sometimes the math behind the advice on remuneration reports has errors. ""The feedback we've had from listed [company] directors is they have very little time to reflect on the reports that the proxy advisors provide if they're provided at all in advance,"" he says. ""And when they pick up errors of fact, whether it's the math or whether it's content, there's really very little opportunity for them to respond, and very little engagement on the other side to reflect these concerns."" He says while proxy advisers have to have an Australian Financial Services License to give financial advice, that may not apply to the advice they give on governance issues. ""We're looking for a basic set of standards around accuracy, around engagement, around managing conflicts of interest that you would expect from any actor in financial markets,"" he says. ""This is basic regulatory 101. This is saying, 'hold on, if you've got someone in the market, who can influence the price of shares, but they have no regulatory wrapper around them and how they decide to do that is opaque and not transparent to the market, that's a problem'. It's a problem for market integrity."" In 2017, corporate watchdog ASIC undertook a review proxy advisers. It found no regulation was needed and that shareholders should be free to exercise their right to vote. But Mr Armour says proxy advisers would not sign up to a voluntary code of conduct suggested after the ASIC review and that's why the government has had to step in. Jeremy Leibler is a lawyer at Arnold Bloch Leibler who advises company directors, including Premier Investments boss Solomon Lew. ""I'm not suggesting for a moment that every recommendation that a proxy advisor makes is wrong,"" Mr Leibler says. ""That's not the case — many, many times, they get it right. But it's the disproportionate unchecked power that they have in dispensing that advice that is the problem and that what the government is trying to address."" ""This is not about stifling debate. It's not about shutting down criticism. It is simply about creating a healthy, transparent market, so that shareholders can assess all of the different views in the market, and make their decisions accordingly."" Mr Leibler is also concerned that at times the advice given by proxy advisers is not in the interest of the company or its shareholders. He notes he recently acted for an an ASX-listed company that was looking to hire a new chief executive and looked offshore. He would not name the company involved. ""They found a senior executive in the United States who was extremely qualified, and they progressed through negotiations,"" he says. ""The remuneration structure that they needed to offer had to be competitive. But when push came to shove, they [company management] formed the view that the proxy advisors were not going to understand the structure. ""The company lost out, not because their board was not sufficiently equipped to make the right decision and hire top talent … but simply, they were intimidated by the prospect of a first strike, and a second strike on the remuneration report that would be driven by these proxy advisors."" He says it is crucial that institutional investors and superannuation funds can more clearly demonstrate that they are exercising their own independent judgement when it comes to how they how they vote. ""I think for that to really be effective, it necessarily involves a transparent disclosure of how they voted, and the recommendations that they've received,"" he says. ""The disclosure of conflicts of interest by proxy advisors is absolutely critical. And I think generally having proxy advisors, subject to a proper regulatory regime of accountability, would go a long way."" In the United States there's recently been push back against Trump-era regulation that some argue gives companies too much influence over the independent research proxy advisers provide. ""Even the crony capitalists of the Trump era walked back the suggestion that proxy advisors would have to give their reports to companies before they were able to publish it to their clients,"" Ownership Matters' Mr Paatsch says. But a spokesman for Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told ABC News the Treasury consultation follows recent reforms in the United Kingdom and United States that aim to ""strengthen the oversight of proxy advice, with a focus on transparency, accountability and independence."" HESTA's Ms Blakey hopes whatever the Treasurer decides, it doesn't stop investors like super funds being able to freely seek advice. Advice, that she argues, allows them to make informed decisions in the interests of working Australians. ""Whether it's managing environmental, social governance risks in the portfolio, whether it's the appointment of directors, these decisions will have a material impact on the future financial outcomes of members,"" Ms Blakey says.

178,opinion: ASIC crusade against activist short sellers will be bad for regular folk,markets,"  ASIC crusade against activist short sellers will be bad for regular folk The Australian Securities and Investment Commission issued an information sheet this week regarding so-called ""activist short selling"". The document outlines a number of ""better practices"" it wants short-sellers to adhere to, and some ""actions that we may take"" if they don't. Translation: ""Hey hedge-fund folks, do this stuff or we'll make life difficult for you."" The problem is not that the corporate regulator can't do so. It is that these ""better practices"" are likely to lead to less efficient markets. In short (pun absolutely intended), this is bad idea. Short selling involves selling a security (like a share of stock in an exchange-listed company) you don't own. The way this is typically done is to borrow that security from someone who does own it, with a promise to return it at a later date. The idea is that when the security goes down in price, you can buy a replacement security for the person you borrowed from at a cheaper price than what you sold theirs, thus pocketing the difference. Basically, it's a bet that the price of something is going to go down. For an alternative explanation, there is A scene from The Big Short, the 2015 film about the housing bubble and sub-prime mortgage crisis that led to the global financial crisis of 2007-2008. Activist short selling involves taking a short position and then publicising it. This could be through media interviews, social media posts or otherwise providing detailed accounts of concerns with the target entity. Perhaps the best example of this was investor George Soros's 1992 bet against the British pound (and other currencies) he rightly thought were overvalued against Germany's deutschemark and were being propped up by central banks like the Bank of England. ASIC itself says its research indicates ""activist short selling campaigns tend to target entities with complex and opaque corporate structures and accounting practices, or poor disclosure"". So short selling can help discourage such practices. That's a good thing. Yet ASIC wants to discourage shorting. What gives? Why was there a housing bubble in the US in the early 2000s? There were many causes, including absurdly lax lending standards and outright fraud by those issuing loans and the creation of complex financial products such as synthetic collateralised debt obligations (synthetic CDOs). For an explanation of these see this, also from the Big Short, by Nobel prize-winning University of Chicago economist Richard Thaler and the almost-as-famous actor and recording artist Selena Gomez. But there was also little that those who believed the housing market was dangerously overvalued could do to ""bet against"" it. Eventually, as Michael Lewis's book The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine (on which the movie is based) recounts, a handful of unusual characters managed to get Wall Street to create a specialised instrument called a ""credit default swap"" to let them do so. Had there been an easy way to short the housing market earlier, the bubble might never have gotten out of control. The horrific crash of 2008 that caused the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression might have been avoided. Why would short selling have helped? Short selling punishes speculation by putting a check on out-of-control markets. It motivates investors to keep an eye on fundamentals, not just get carried away with what John Maynard Keynes labelled ""animal spirits"" – the impulses that help drive speculative bubbles and busts. There's only so much that can be done with the housing market, which is inherently difficult to bet against. But Australia's corporate regulator wants to restrict short selling in the stock market, in which it's relatively easy to take a short position. ASIC is obviously aware of the argument that short selling improves market efficiency, but has chosen to discount it. It has opted for rules that push Australia closer to European countries rather than the US – the largest, most liquid, and most important capital market in the world. The corporate watchdog has outlined a number of ""actions"" it might take if short sellers don't play ball: Many of these may sound mild but are in fact quite extraordinary. They constitute a (very) thinly veiled message that overseas hedge fund managers should knock it off with activist shorting in Australia. This combines, to a remarkable degree, ugly nativism and regulatory capture — the phenomenon by which a regulator, even without malicious intent, comes to represent the interests of those it regulates, rather than the public good. (The theory of regulatory capture was pioneered by another Chicago economist and Nobel winner, George Stigler.) Who will breathe easier as a result of ASIC's new guidelines? Companies with opaque accounting practices, inadequate corporate disclosures and even those that may be acting unlawfully. The losers are equally easy to identify. Some rich hedge fund folks in Greenwich, Connecticut, sure. But also the Australian public, whose superannuation funds are invested in Australian markets. We all have a big interest in ensuring the informational efficiency and market transparency. Bubbles are bad for regular investors. Regulations and securities laws play a crucial role in achieving those goals. So do activist short sellers. ASIC should reconsider its stance. It will only serve to damage the credibility of Australian securities markets, the Australian public, and their own reputation as a wise regulator.

179,Digital currency saves homeless charity,markets,"  Homeless charity on north coast NSW accepts digital currency as donation A northern NSW charity for homeless people has stepped into the brave new world of cyber currency. The charity for homeless people, Agape Outreach Inc based in the Tweed Shire, has received a digital donation to the equivalent of more than $9,000 in Qoin and has set up the Op shop to accept it as well. Theresa Mitchell, who runs Agape Outreach, said the digital currency has been a lifesaver for the charity as COVID-19 has had such a big impact. ""Our [food] donations over the COVID period went from two tonnes per week down to 800 kilos and requests for food support went from 400 meals a week to 700, so you can see how hard we have been doing it,"" Ms Mitchell said. ""We've really been able to benefit and utilise these coin donations that have been given to us to be able to purchase fruit and vegetables and food to be able to help people."" Ms Mitchell purchases fresh produce from a local food producer on the north coast of NSW using the digital currency. John Bartrim owns Mt Warning Produce and has a stall at the Burleigh Heads Farmers Market. ""Without him and the [digital] donation we would not be able to do what we have been doing for the last two months, we would have probably had to turn at least 100 people a week away,"" she said. Theresa Mitchell started Agape Outreach Inc 12 years ago to feed the homeless from Byron Bay to Hervey Bay and solely relies on fundraising and rescued edible food normally put into landfill. She said it was simple to use the digital currency — just download the app to your phone which becomes your Qoin wallet, you then transfer money into the wallet. ""It's really as easy as scanning a QR code that is on our front desk, they put in the Australian dollar amount that's owed, it does the transaction of how much that is worth in Qoin and transfers it over for us,"" Ms Mitchell said. Economist Dr Brendan Markey-Towler, from the School of Business at the University of Queensland, said there is a dispute between Qoin and the peak industry body Blockchain Australia, over whether it can be called a cryptocurrency. Dr Markey-Towler said the easiest way to look at digital currencies was to see what coins are traded on crypto exchanges, which are platforms online that people can use to buy, sell and exchange cryptocurrency like Coinbase and Binance. Dr Markey-Towler believes crypto will become a mainstream currency, but it will take some time. ""As the world becomes more and more authoritarian with governments and corporations amassing more and more power, which is undeniable, I can only see the value of a counterweight to that with blockchain and cryptocurrencies becoming stronger and stronger over time,"" Dr Markey-Towler said. Farmers market stallholder and banana grower John Bartrim was happy to go about his business accepting digital currencies and traditional money for his Mount Warning produce. ""I have accepted the equivalent of over $20,000 worth of Qoin through Agape Outreach Inc and selling at the farmers markets over two months,"" Mr Bartrim said. ""I have been able to use the digital currency to purchase a forklift and now I'm looking to buy a 4WD."" Mr Bartrim said the only issue he had with the digital currency was he can only use it to purchase large goods like farm equipment or cars, so he was not accepting as much digital currency as before. ""I still gotta pay bills and all that sort of stuff,"" he said. Want more local news? Sign up to ABC North Coast's weekly email newsletter.

180,"Every time a snap lockdown happens, businesses like this have to throw away food — and lose $50,000",markets,"  It may be billed as just one week – but for casual workers and small business owners, the fourth Victorian lockdown that starts today is terrifying. The entire state of Victoria has gone into a snap seven-day lockdown due to rising COVID cases, with non-essential businesses like hairdressing, entertainment and gyms forced to close. Melbourne café worker Bella Drummond is one of the estimated 500,000 Victorians that are employed casually. ""I'm casual so if I don’t work, I don't get paid,"" Ms Drummond said. ""But that doesn't mean my expenses stop. ""I've got rent, bills, internet, utilities, school fees, groceries, car payments, pet bills. You name it."" She worked her last shift at a café in South Yarra yesterday before it closed for dine-in trade for the lockdown. The 22-year-old full-time student has no savings in the bank and she doesn't have a credit card. ""I'm a little worried, actually,"" she said. ""It's just the uncertainty. I don't know when my next shift will be. I don't know where my next pay cheque is coming from. I don't know where I'll pay my rent from. ""I'm a little concerned that this lockdown won't be for one week. It's hard for me to believe that seven days will be actually seven days and not 100 days like last time. ""I'm trying to figure out my contingency plan and what I'll do next and how I'll survive. ""I'm lucky I have a partner who works and family who will support me, but I know lots of others in the same situation and I have no idea what they'll do."" Ms Drummond's boss Melissa Glentis would like to pay her casual staff while they're not working during lockdown. But after 15 months of COVID-19, her business is in the red. ""One week of lockdown costs us roughly $50,000 over two sites and that's because we're losing our biggest trade times on weekends and our functions,"" Ms Glentis said. ""Every time we go into lockdown, we lose stock that's perishable and it's unlikely we'll be able to re-sell it. ""And then there's the loss of income. Our weekend trade. Our lockdowns always happen at the busiest times with weekends and our after-hours functions."" Early estimates from the lobby group Small Business Australia place the cost of this seven-day Victorian lockdown at $1 billion in lost economic activity, while the Grattan Institute puts it at slightly lower at $900 million. The Commonwealth Bank's chief economist Gareth Aird is estimating an even higher cost. ""We think that the direct cost of the seven-day lockdown in Victoria will be around $1.3 billion,"" he said. ""Any lockdown is more costly to businesses and workers from here than it was before the end of JobKeeper."" Of course, there is a cost to not locking down, too. The Grattan Institute's Danielle Wood said the cost of letting the virus run rampant is difficult to put a number on, but it would be far more costly in the long run. ""Once the virus is spreading in the community, there is inevitably an economic hit,"" she said. ""Even though a short lockdown is costly, it is likely to be less costly than the alternative which risks letting the virus run out of control."" Cafe owner Ms Glentis believes this lockdown will be harder than previous ones because the debt crunch is getting more severe. ""It's going to be hard, I can't deny that. There will be a lot of juggling and my team comes first,"" Ms Glentis said. ""My team is mostly on full-time salaries. How do I pay them? ""We're getting further into debt."" This is the first lockdown that Victoria will go through without the federal government's JobKeeper, which gave businesses battling downturn a wage-subsidy for permanent workers. The Australian Council of Trade Unions is calling on the Commonwealth to urgently reinstate it during Victoria's lockdown. Rules that forced commercial real estate owners to negotiate on rents with businesses battling downturn have also expired. ""We're back to full rent,"" Ms Glentis said. The major festival Rising was supposed to take place in Melbourne this weekend but it is now refunding tickets for the entire seven-day lockdown. Bluesfest is set for a bailout, with the NSW government confirming it is working on a support package for its devastated major events industry, but that will not help festival promoters in other states. ""It's a complex event with over 750 artists and 1,000 staff and 120 projects,"" co-artistic director Hannah Fox said. ""It's not just as simple as picking up and moving it. ""We always understood this was a possibility in this environment but like everybody you get into a certain level of feeling confident. So, it's a blow. A huge blow. ""Hearing the news about a person being in ICU [with COVID-19] and thinking more broadly about people around the world puts it into perspective."" Major events have been unable to get insurance for cancellations associated with COVID-19 during the pandemic. Margrite Charlotte is a receptionist at the 32-room Phillip Island Apartments in regional Victoria. She has been fielding calls for cancelled visits. ""People are feeling sad about not being able to come up. Many are rebooking rather than just cancelling,"" she said. ""It's a shame, but my attitude is keep calm and carry on."" Ms Charlotte also works casually and the seven-day lockdown means she will be dipping into her savings. The owner of the regional tourism destination Euroa Butter Factory is also hopeful the snap lockdown will work. ""It's good to do it this way rather than deal with the repercussions of an extended lockdown,"" Richard Hayes said. ""We are doing this [the lockdown] to protect everyone."" The venue's wedding season is over, but a conference booked this weekend has been cancelled. The business was also due to launch a new restaurant this Friday, but had not stocked up the kitchen yet so thankfully won't need to get rid of much produce. Even so, he says his business will lose ""thousands"" because of the lockdown. Acting Victorian Premier James Merlino said at the lockdown announcement on Thursday that full assistance for business would be announced in coming days. A Victorian government spokesperson said: “The Victorian government has invested more than $6 billion in direct economic support to Victorian businesses and workers to help them to get through the pandemic and recover strongly, and we will continue to support them.” After the last lockdown in February, the State announced a $143 million package designed to help businesses, including sole traders, that lost income as a result of the five-day upheaval. That included $2,000 one-off payments for businesses and sole traders. It is expected that a similar package will be revealed again. However, Ms Glentis is furious that a lockdown was announced yesterday without having that sort of detail already prepared to ensure business confidence. ""The most frustrating part is that after 15 months there is still no contingency plans in place. It's a constant afterthought,"" Ms Glentis said. ""I'm just really frustrated. Furious actually. I can't believe we're here for the fourth time."" ""If there is constant uncertainty in the market, then how are we going to get out of that debt?"" Melbourne’s Lord Mayor, Sally Capp, told ABC News Breakfast that more support is needed for business. “We do need confidence and certainty from the state government and federal government about assistance for those who need it,” she said. “We have to really be worried about how people can keep bouncing back from these lockdowns. “It is so difficult, it takes an enormous amount of effort and, of course, in this environment there is no JobKeeper, rental assistance programs have finished.” The Federal Government has indicated that it will not reinstate JobKeeper, despite Victoria's latest crisis. The Victorian Government already has a range of support schemes in place for people doing it financially tough during COVID-19 lockdowns, including emergency food packages, support for international students, and a rolling business support package worth $3 billion. In a statement, a Victorian Government said the state has so far provided $6 billion in support measures for workers and business ""and it will continue to support them"". Back in Melbourne, Ms Drummond is just hoping the lockdown will end within seven days. If it goes on any longer, she will consider going to Centrelink to apply for JobSeeker. ""They need to think of doing a one-off payment [for casuals] if it's going to be just a week,"" she said. ""I'll be sitting at home watching the news, just waiting and worrying. ""Not much else I can do.""

181,Bitcoin back above $40k as US regulates; ASX ends the week higher as US stocks end losing streak,markets,"  Bitcoin back above $40k as US regulates; ASX closes flat as US stocks end losing streak The Australian share market recovered from its earlier losses to end the week trading higher, after stocks on Wall Street snapped a three-day losing streak with help from technology companies. After a choppy day, the benchmark the ASX 200 closed 0.15 per cent up at 7,030, while the broader All Ordinaries rose 0.18 per cent to 7,265. Education, energy, basic materials, real estate and energy stocks weighed on the market. EML payments was the top performer (+15.9pc) on the ASX 200, after its share price halved yesterday, following Irish regulators raising concerns about anti-money laundering compliance in its subsidiary there. Webjet and A2 Milk Company gained 5.3 per cent, followed by Xero (+4.1pc) and Corporate Travel Management (+3.9pc). Afterpay closed down 0.9 per cent after rising 6.9 per cent in early trading. Retailer Kogan's shares had tumbled 13.9 per cent after the company announced its earnings would be well below market expectations. Next in line for losses were Nufarm (-6.9pc), Appen (-5.2pc) and Redbubble (-5.2pc). The Australian dollar was down a quarter of a per cent and worth 77.55 US cents at 4:20pm AEST. ""We still expect AUD can lift towards 0.80 by quarter end,"" ANZ analysts said in a briefing this morning. ""We judge it is undervalued against its fundamentals."" Spot gold was flat and selling for $US1,875 an ounce. Retail trade rose 1.1 per cent in April and was up 25.1 per cent since the same time last year, according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. ""This mainly reflects base effects with very low turnover in April 2020 as the pandemic first came into play and lockdown and restrictions were in place across Australia,"" CBA senior economist Kristina Clifton said. ""The high annual growth rate also reflects the fact that retail trade is trending higher and running well above pre pandemic levels."" New South Wales and Victoria recorded the strongest rises in retail trade in the month, up 2 per cent. The lockdown in Western Australia saw a 1.5 per cent fall in retail trade in April. All the major US markets rose, with the tech-laden Nasdaq holding up the market with a 1.7 per cent gain. Over in Europe, all three majors were up, too. ""Equity markets in the London, Europe and the US were back in the black today,"" NAB analysts said. ""That was helped by the combination of some further easing in oil prices, general market stability including bitcoin and especially in the US session, a marked reduction in US Treasury yields, mainly from a pull-back in market-implied inflation rates."" The spot price of Brent crude oil was up by 0.25 per cent to $US65.28 a barrel, while West Texas crude oil was unchanged at $US62.05 a barrel, after rising on sentiment that Iran could soon start boosting supply. The US has a trade sanction on Iran. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a televised speech that sanctions on oil, shipping, petrochemicals, insurance and the central bank had been dealt with in diplomatic talks. Bitcoin has been on a wild ride this week, largely thanks to more tweeting by Elon Musk, along with tougher regulation in China. It was back above $US40,0000, at 4:20pm AEST. That is even despite a new announcement by US regulators that they will require larger cryptocurrency transfers to be reported to its Internal Revenue Service. The Federal Reserve has also flagged a closer look at cryptocurrencies. Fed chair Jerome Powell released a message about how ""technological advances are driving rapid change in the global payments market"". He also flagged that it was looking at issuing its own digital currency. Rabobank's head of financial research for the Asia-Pacific, Michael Every, said regulating cryptocurrency would diminish its ability to act as a true money substitute. ""Imagine if every time you transferred more than $US10,000, as businesses do multiple times every day, you had to: report it; and pay a tax rate, let's assume 15 per cent on the difference in the exchange rate of USD against EUR in a world where EUR/USD moves 30 per cent in a day,"" he said. ""It makes crypto unviable at any scale; and if there is no successful strategy for that scale to emerge, then any recent increase in pricing is just speculation."" Mr Every said that speculation would no doubt continue regardless.

182,"ASX rebounds after steep fall, but miners left behind",markets,"  ASX rebound leaves miners behind, Elon Musk's tweets and regulation move bitcoin prices The Australian sharemarket has almost recovered from yesterday's losses after financials and tech pulled it higher, however travel stocks have been hit by a Qantas announcement and miners also lagged. The benchmark ASX 200 index closed 1.3 per cent higher after losing 1.9 per cent on Wednesday in a broad-based selloff. The market was buoyed by financials and tech stocks, as well as news that the unemployment rate fell despite the end of JobKeeper. The Australian dollar also gained on the jobs data, reaching 77.5 US cents by 4:50pm AEST. EML regained a little ground after it haemorrhaged market value during Wednesday's trade. The payment platform shed more than 40 per cent of its stock yesterday, after confirming Irish regulators were investigating its branch there over possible money laundering violations. The payment platform shed more than 40 per cent of its stock yesterday after confirming Irish regulators were investigating its branch there over possible money laundering violations. It rose 3.9 per cent to $2.91, having given up a stronger rebound earlier in the day. Tech stocks dominated the day's winners, with Afterpay jumping 7.7 per cent, rival Zip up 5 per cent, Altium rising 6.6 per cent and Nearmap climbing 5.1 per cent. Qantas also gained 3.5 per cent to $4.68 after flagging further redundancies for international travel crew and a two-year wage freeze. It also revealed it was on track for a $2 billion loss, while it believed debt had peaked. However, the mining sector prevented a bigger rally, with South32 off 2.7 per cent, BHP down 1.1 per cent and Rio Tinto off half a per cent. Minutes released from the latest Federal Reserve meeting showed some members were considering pulling back on inflationary measures such as buying government bonds. Strong inflation readings and signs of a worker shortage in recent weeks have fuelled fears and roiled stock markets there. NAB analysts also believe that the cryptocurrency ""bloodbath"" is spilling over into US tech stocks. ""Bitcoin was down 30 per cent at one point and is currently trading down 9.1 per cent,"" they noted. ""Reflective of that dynamic the S&P500 at one point was down 1.6 per cent, but has pared losses to be down per cent 0.3 per cent on the day with crypto moves not being seen as systemic."" Bitcoin took a hit on Wednesday (local time) as China flagged a further crackdown on cryptocurrencies. Chinese regulators have banned financial institutions and payment companies from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions, and warned investors against speculative crypto trading. It already had rules around digital currency trading introduced five years ago but this takes China's hard-line stance further. They greatly expand what is banned and even judged that ""virtual currencies are not supported by any real value"". For example, it made clear that institutions must not accept virtual currencies, or use them as a means of payment and settlement. Institutions can no longer even provide exchange services between cryptocurrencies and the yuan or foreign currencies. But after a Chinese-led hit, bitcoin started rising again. Which brings us to the latest from Elon Musk. Crypto enthusiasts have been taken on another wild ride by the Tesla founder. He has now tweeted an indication that his electric car company will hold onto its bitcoin stock. The phrase ""diamond hands"" refers to stubbornly holding onto a stock. Musk also credited Tesla's ""Master of Coin,"" referring to the title he has given his chief financial officer Zachary Kirkhorn. This is all after Tesla helped drive interest in the unregulated currency by purchasing $US1.15 billion of it earlier this year and saying it would accept it as payment. The price of the digital currency surged immediately — and gave a paper profit of well over $US1 billion for Tesla. Then, after pressure over the coin's environmental footprint, Tesla did an about-turn this month and said it would not accept it for payments. That saw the coin tumble from its peak. Musk's tweet indicates Tesla is still holding onto its Bitcoin, although after it initially surged, its market value has now dropped to $US1.26 billion. That is still more than what Tesla paid for it. Since Musk's latest ""diamond hands"" tweet, his ability to influence the market has started to show once again. While some crypto enthusiasts are fuming about Musk's ability to manipulate their currency, those who bought Bitcoin before him are still in the black. At a current value of $US38,442, it is still worth almost four times more than what it was just a year ago. Meanwhile, Tesla's stock has also been trading down this month, although analysts believe this is more to do with inflation concerns in the US than anything crypto related.

183,"ASX drops sharply as EML Payments tanks, while consumer confidence slips",markets,"  ASX slides as EML Payments tanks, while consumer confidence drops despite budget spending The Australian share market has fallen sharply on a broad-based sell-off, with payment provider EML taking a huge hit after an overseas regulator raised concerns about suspicious transactions. The ASX 200 ended Wednesday down 1.9 per cent. That was down from 1.5 per cent earlier in trade but better than when it hit 2.1 per cent down in the mid-afternoon. The market had closed up 0.6 per cent yesterday. The mining and energy sectors led the declines, but the sell-off was broad-based, with 161 of the top 200 companies ending the day in the red. Mega miners BHP (-3.4 per cent), Rio Tinto (-3.75 per cent) and Fortescue (-3.1 per cent) all had big falls. Smaller gold miners took a heavy hit, with St Barbara down 7 per cent and Resolute down 5.6 per cent. Origin Energy ended the day down 4.8 per cent and AGL lost 3.9 per cent. The major banks were offering no support to the market, with CBA leading the loss with 2.5 per cent off. The rare strong performers included artificial intelligence and robotics company Appen, which ended the day up 17.4 per cent after announcing a restructure. Troubled company Nuix also rallied 4.6 per cent. EML Payments took a huge hit immediately after the market opened. That is after revelations this week that a regulator overseas has concerns about the payment platform being used for suspicious transactions. The Central Bank of Ireland is raising concerns about its Irish subsidiary. CBI's concerns relate to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing, according to an announcement EML Payments made to the ASX today. ""EML estimates that approximately 27 per cent of EML's global consolidated revenue (unaudited) derived from programs operating under (its) Irish authorisation,"" it said. EML went into a trading halt on Monday pending the regulator's announcement. It is now trading again and ended the day more than 45 per cent down on open. That takes its stock to $2.80. Meanwhile, Westpac's latest consumer sentiment poll shows confidence has dipped 4.8 per cent to 113.1 basis points in May. But the bank's analysts were cautious that this should be put into perspective. ""It is still the second highest point for the index since April 2010 and does follow an 11% rise in the Index over the previous three months,"" chief economist Bill Evans said. The budget was announced halfway through May. Westpac said a fall in sentiment during a big spending COVID budget that outlaid 4.1 per cent of GDP was perhaps suprising. ""The fall may also represent some disappointment in the federal budget as a very generous budget was still unable to exceed the exuberant expectations of the community,"" Mr Evans said. That was despite strong earnings reports by a string of big names including Home Depot and Walmart. Most of the big losses on Wall Street were by telcos and media. AT&T ended the day 5.8 per cent down, after announcing it wanted to spin off its WarnerMedia division to merge with TV network Discovery. It is hoping to rival Netflix with the new spin-off. Data in the US showed the rate of homes being built has been falling as prices for building materials rises. That has been a concern here, too. The global construction boom has pushed the price of building-related commodities through the roof. Timber and iron ore — which is used for making steel — hit record prices last week. The greenback hit its lowest level against a raft of currencies. That was after investors calmed their fears that the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates. There have been inflation spikes in the US which could be adjusted by raising rates. US Treasury yields stalled as investors bet that its Fed would hold off for now. ""A slightly weaker USD helped push gold higher, while silver and palladium managed a small gain,"" ANZ analysts noted. ""Crude oil fell following reports that significant progress had been made on the Iran nuclear deal. ""Industrial metals gained, with copper rising to a record high on supply side issues."" Despite the US dollar sliding, the Australian dollar is unmoved against it and buying 77.90 US cents. Several US policymakers are expected to speak this week and its central bank is due to release the minutes from its April policy meeting on Wednesday local time. ""USD could fall further if the minutes reiterate the messages from Fed’s officials that the pick-up in inflation is considered transitory,"" Commonwealth Bank analysts said today. Japan is grappling with rising infections of COVID-19 again. ""The economic toll of a state of emergency was evident in yesterday’s GDP release,"" CBA analysts said. ""The Japanese economy contracted more than expected by 1.3 per cent in Q1 2021. ""Whether Japan’s economic recovery resumes in Q2 hinges on how quickly Japanese authorities can bring the virus under control. The Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be like no other, with athletes required to wear a mask at all times unless they are eating or sleeping and organisers wanting people to show their support by only clapping, not by chanting or singing. ""Nonetheless, daily infections in Japan remain close to their peak levels, and the pace of Japan’s vaccinations has been sluggish. ""As a result, there is a risk that the latest state of emergency will be extended once again, raising the odds of another contraction in GDP in Q2, 21."" Its benchmark, the Nikkei, has been trading down the last month but it is now on an upswing. Yesterday it closed up 2.1 per cent.

184,ASX rises as Rex fined by ASIC; 'Elon effect' drops Bitcoin; Netflix challenger to launch,markets,"  'Elon effect' drops Bitcoin; Warner and Discovery to merge; ASX closes higher despite US lull The Australian share market ended the day on Tuesday in positive territory, with energy and mining stocks buoying stocks. The ASX 200 was up 0.6 per cent. That was after it closed slightly up on Monday, too. Strong performers included Evolution Mining (+4.9pc), Fortescue Metals (+2pc) and BlueScope Steel (+1.6pc). That comes as the price of iron ore rebounds. Minutes from the last Reserve Bank board meeting, released today, noted the strength of Australia's most lucrative commodity. ""A key development in the global economy in recent months had been the rebound in commodity and producer prices,"" minutes noted. ""Strong demand for steel in China and international supply disruptions had also pushed iron ore prices to their highest levels in a decade and boosted Australia's terms of trade. ""The increase in commodity and other input prices was expected to contribute to higher inflation globally in subsequent months. ""Members noted that inflation expectations in advanced economies had also increased to be closer to central banks' targets."" Beach Energy also ended the day up 2.7 per cent as it continued to see the positive impacts of the federal government's $2 billion package for two local oil refineries. Globally, the price of oil is up. It is up 1.1 per cent to $US69.46 on rising demand from the US and hopes that it will rise further as Europe re-opens from the pandemic. Tuesday's biggest loser on the ASX 200 was A2 Milk, with a loss of 4.3 per cent. Regional airline Rex has been fined $66,000 by ASIC. The corporate watchdog said the fine was in relation to a media interview that the airline did with the Australian Financial Review in May, 2020 about the potential to expand its domestic operations. ASIC found it did this before disclosing its potential expansion to the ASX. Rex went into a trading halt after the AFR story was published and then told shareholders it was considering a domestic expansion. ASIC found there were reasonable grounds to believe that Rex was in breach of its continuous disclosure obligations. Rex has issued a statement this morning disputing that it did not fulfil its disclosure requirements. However, it said it will pay the fine. There are concerns that rising inflation in the US will see monetary policy soon tightened. Vice-chair of the Federal Reserve, Richard Clarida, said the US economy has not met the ""substantial further progress"" threshold for tapering asset purchases. He also said ""we will certainly give advance warning before we anticipate scaling back the pace of those purchases"". But ANZ analysts noted that Mr Clarida did not sound an alarm from last week’s big inflation surprise. ""We expect the minutes from the FOMC's April 28 meeting released on Thursday morning to be consistent with Clarida's views,"" a company spokesperson said. As those fears grow, all US markets ended lower, with the tech-laden Nasdaq taking the biggest hit, albeit with a loss of just 0.4 per cent. Major retailers including Walmart, Ralph Lauren, Macy's and Target (American) are all set to report in the US this week. The US dollar is also down against the major currencies. The Australian dollar is buying 77.69 US cents. The cryptocurrency has dropped to a three-month low after Tesla boss Elon Musk took it on a wild ride. Bitcoin is down to US$42,185 - which is still high compared to last year but its lowest value since February. Mr Musk had been a big proponent of the currency but in the last week has been tweeting concerns about its environmental impact and how he won't let people use it to buy Tesla cars. That had followed pressure from activists about his use of Bitcoin, which has a large carbon footprint due to the process known as ""mining"". Mr Musk suggested earlier this week that he may have sold off some of his coin. But in a tweet he now said Tesla has not sold off any of the cryptocurrency. Mega entertainment production house WarnerMedia and TV network Discovery are set to merge. The merger will put another streaming giant into the increasingly competitive space. WarnerMedia is owned by conglomerate AT&T. WarnerMedia includes the eponymous film studio that produces blockbusters such as Harry Potter and Batman, and HBO, the producer of shows such as Game of Thrones and Sex & The City. Meanwhile, separate company Discovery has TV channels such as Animal Planet and Food Network. In a note to investors, AT&T said it would spin off WarnerMedia to merge with Discovery, subject to regulatory approvals. ""The companies expect the transaction will create substantial value for AT&T and Discovery shareholders by ... accelerating both companies’ plans for leading direct-to-consumer streaming services for global consumers,"" the note said. ""The new company will compete globally in the fast-growing direct-to-consumer business."" The deal comes as streaming platforms such as Netflix performed strongly during the pandemic and increasingly challenged traditional production houses. The enterprise value of the new combined company will be more than $US120 billion, carrying $US58 billion in debt. AT&T only spent $US85 billion to acquire the WarnerMedia assets less than three years ago. The name of the new company will be disclosed by next week.

185,analysis: The share market is at a record high — will it collapse?,markets,"  ASX reaches record closing high … but can it stay there? On February 20 last year, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index closed at a record high of 7,162 points. Within about a month it had, of course, lost 2,616 points, or more than a third of its peak value as the COVID-19 pandemic gripped the world. Yesterday, it created a fresh record closing high, recouping all the losses from that almighty crash, and a tiny bit more. Professional investor Danielle Ecuyer describes it as ""an incredible recovery"". So how did we get here, and what's likely to happen next? Share market rises and falls are largely driven by company valuations — what businesses are fundamentally worth. That is, a company's stock value or share price often reflects what analysts believe it's worth, after crunching its profit numbers and evaluating its outlook. Government coronavirus economic support measures kept many businesses afloat during the height of the pandemic, but once that passed, it became clear that firms were finding ways to adapt and carry on. Despite a record-breaking reporting season, the losses felt from widespread shutdowns early in 2020 are fresh in the minds of businesses. Here is a look at what might be ahead. Indeed, many companies saw large growth spurts as the changed macroeconomic environment began to shift in their favour. Zoom, the video communications company, certainly gained from the large shift to working from home and social distancing measures. Other stocks, like buy-now, pay later companies, also stumbled upon huge growth in earnings as people who couldn't spend money on overseas holidays or cut back on going out shopped online instead. Technology companies more broadly did well, while the big banks and miners found their footing and began rebuilding too. The big miners, especially, gained from China's push to supercharge its economy with a big infrastructure drive (requiring of course vast quantities of Australian iron ore to make steel). The price of iron ore, critical to the earnings of market heavyweights Rio Tinto, BHP Group and Fortescue Metals, pushed past $US200 per tonne last week – itself a record high. The major banks benefited from seeing only a small fraction of the mortgage defaults that were originally feared – largely because many Australians returned to work throughout 2020 — plus a booming real estate market funded by abundant cheap money from the Reserve Bank. Arguably, though, it was the monetary policies in response to the global financial crisis of 2008 that provided the framework for one of the strongest run-ups in stock prices we've ever seen. Indeed, Danielle Ecuyer says we're currently witnessing the ""biggest central bank global liquidity push we've ever seen"". Australia's Reserve Bank finally joined the global money-printing club, after years of holding out after the global financial crisis. It set a target of buying $200 billion in government bonds as part of a quantitative easing program to drive down both short, medium, and long-term interest rates. Central banks around the world have been trying to keep interest rates down at record lows, but some traders have had other ideas. And that's key to understanding this week's all-time high: record low interest rates. As one fund manager recently put it to me: ""Where else are you going to invest?"" Interest rates are used by analysts to value stocks. They use them to discount the future cashflows of a company to determine the business's ""present value"". So, the lower the interest rate, the higher the valuation. But, of course, when you have the option of investing in fixed interest or putting your money in the bank, and investing in the share market, it's not rocket science understanding where your money is going to earn a higher return – notwithstanding a market correction of course. Generally speaking though, record low interest rates have created a once-in-generation run-up in stock prices across the globe, following a once-in-a-generation collapse in share prices. Just on that, when the market gets this high, nervousness abounds as to when it might fall. AMP Capital's head of investment, Shane Oliver, simply says, ""Shares remain at risk of further volatility."" He notes ""possible triggers"", including ""a resumption of rising bond yields [rising interest rates], coronavirus-related setbacks, US tax hikes and geopolitical risks"". Most analysts and economists agree, the key threat to the market is if inflation (or general price rises) suddenly spikes higher. That would force central banks to raise interest rates and that, they say, would send the share market into a tailspin. Interest rates are rising on bond markets as investors fear inflation will take off as the post-COVID recovery gathers steam, and it is hitting tech shares particularly hard. To date, sluggish wage growth has all but put a lid on inflation. However, if the Treasurer has his way and the Reserve Bank's forecast proves correct, an unemployment rate going well below 5 per cent could begin to stoke inflation as wages gradually rise. It's actually a bit puzzling at the moment. You have hundreds of billions of dollars of stimulus, record low interest rates, and yet inflation is still basically non-existent. Economists argue fundamental flaws in Australia's industrial relations framework contribute to sluggish wage growth, but elevated levels of household saving may also be a factor, as the Reserve Bank pointed out last week. Dr Oliver expects ""the ASX 200 to end 2021 at a record high of around 7,200, although the risk is on the upside"". That means it could well go higher than that. With the ongoing threat of coronavirus in Australia, for now, being effectively managed, hundreds of billions of dollars in stimulus and record low interest rates, the framework is there for this bull run to continue. But there are also obvious signs of market euphoria, which are often followed by market corrections. A clear warning signal is the record amount of initial public offerings on the exchange. Elon Musk talking cryptocurrencies on Saturday Night Live in the United States is also a sign of market exuberance more broadly. How much is a meme worth to you? For the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, named in honour of the dog that swept the internet in 2013, the answer could be more than $100 billion. From a mathematical point of view, the market's price/earnings multiple (as a measure of how stock prices compare to the profits companies are actually making) is currently sitting at roughly 19 times. That's historically high. The reality is the market could go anywhere from here. For what it's worth, those with skin in the game are cautiously optimistic it will push higher from here in the short term. Given the enormous recent run-up in share prices, however, and the unprecedented amount of stimulus behind it, when stock markets do fall, which they eventually will, it's likely to be quite dramatic.

187,John started grocery shopping at a different time of day during COVID. He's not alone,markets,"  Are you grocery shopping on Sunday again? You're not alone as the COVID effect wears off At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, panic buying was an insight into our fear. One year on, we can tell the country's mood once again through our shopping baskets, and it seems old habits die hard. It is difficult to forget the scenes of empty supermarket shelves at the start of the pandemic in March 2020. Deakin University consumer behaviour expert Virginia Weber remembers the panic buying as a classic case of ""herd mentality"" as everybody rushed to buy toilet paper in case others bought it first. ""It became a bit of a vicious cycle, because it became a rational choice at a certain point to stock up on toilet paper, because we didn't know if you'd be able to get more and the stock issues led to more and more purchasing,"" she said. ""It was a little bit funny, if tragic, to watch. ""A big part of it was about this social proof or social consensus that we look for. We tend to trust the wisdom of the crowd, even when we necessarily shouldn't. ""It was big time about fear of the unknown."" COVID also brought on a boom for grocery giants like Woolworths and Coles. As well as the panic buying, the fact Australians were all stuck at home led to a growth in sales, as people without Friday night knock-offs turned to making homemade bread instead. That's not to say that a lack of open bars saw Australians lose their love of a tipple. The majors also saw a rise in alcohol sales from their liquor stores during lockdown, too. Online shopping also soared as people in lockdown switched to e-commerce out of necessity, boredom or both. Specific category retailers like Kogan, Harvey Norman, and Temple and Webster also saw sales growth, as people decked out their home entertainment areas and spruced up the furniture. Melbourne man John is one person that started shopping at a different time of day during the Victorian capital city's extended second lockdown in mid-2020. John said he switched to shopping first thing in the morning at 6:30am because he found he'd miss out on stock if he went later in the day. ""The aisles would be empty by the end of the day,"" he said. ""I was shopping a lot more at supermarkets because the food markets weren't open. And clearly because we couldn't go out, I was cooking at home more. ""I did do a little bit of panic buying. Mostly with medicine. I didn't panic buy toilet paper though. ""And my online shopping was really high and I was buying things I probably didn't need because I was bored."" Deakin University's Virginia Weber believes people also switched to ""comfort"" buying during the more intense months of COVID. As a Canadian migrant, Ms Weber and her husband personally switched to buying food that reminded them of home when they were locked down in Melbourne. ""It was even seen in the TV that we were watching with re-runs of things that we'd watched before,"" she said. ""It made us feel secure and happy. ""In this massive uncertainty, with the fear and being locked down and isolated, we wanted things that brought us comfort, simple pleasures, and a connection to people in our lives."" Coles noted in its quarterly results this week that COVID saw people switch to shopping in more suburban locations and at different times. With fewer people working in city offices or going out there, it makes sense that stores closer to suburban regions would get more customers. The major ASX-listed retailer also noted that people stopped shopping less on Sundays during COVID. That's traditionally the day before office workers and families with kids in school are stocking up on their groceries for the week ahead. ""With people working from home and having children at home, you didn't necessarily [need Sunday shopping],"" Ms Weber said. During the extended second lockdown in Melbourne, there was a curfew and grocery shopping was one of the only things people could legally leave the house to do. Ms Weber believed this spurred people to go to the supermarket more often but for smaller shops to break the boredom. ""Many people would disperse their shopping trips over the week, because they were allowed to leave for shopping,"" she said. In their latest quarterly results this week, both Coles and Woolworths noted that consumer behaviours are now reverting back to pre-COVID patterns. Coles supermarket sales are down 6.1 per cent on the January to March 2020 panic buying period. ""At the end of the third quarter and in the first few weeks of the fourth quarter, consumer behaviour has started to normalise,"" Coles said in its results. ""Customers are returning to shopping centres and CBD stores, workers are returning to offices, and there are positive indicators that 'local shopping' is beginning to unwind. ""Sunday returning to the busiest trading day of the week supported by normalised routines of going to the office and children going back to school."" Meanwhile, Woolworths noted that people were starting to shop less. ""While food customers are shopping less frequently, the growth in the number of items customers put in their baskets is slowing."" Woolworths' grocery turnover was only down 0.7 per cent as it propped up in-store sales with a surge in online sales. Interestingly, it has seen no change in alcohol shopping on the peak of COVID, although it is selling less wine now than when Australians were in lockdown. Kogan also saw a large downturn in its last results, as people relied less on home entertainment purchases. Home furnishings retailer Temple and Webster was also down. Internationally, Netflix subscription sales are also down as people globally rely less on sitting at home with a film. Our supermarket shopper John has also gone back to his old habits. After becoming a morning shopper during COVID, he spoke to ABC News just after he had been for a late afternoon shop at his local Woolworths. ""I've still got all that medication I panic bought stashed away in the cupboard somewhere,"" he said. Ms Weber said the dramatic social experiment of COVID had not actually created any new shopping behaviours. ""COVID has just accelerated a lot of things that were already in motion,"" she said. ""Online shopping, cashless transactions, working from home and blended working. ""We were heading in that direction over time anyway, it just forced us to actually make that change much faster than we were necessarily ready to. ""A lot of the time when consumers form new habits, as they were forced to by COVID-19 and the disruptions to daily life, the ones that stick around are the ones that are more helpful or more convenient. From segmented booths and '70s minimalism to outdoor marquees and part-time work spaces, architects say COVID-19 is rapidly changing how buildings are designed as function influences form. ""It's very seldom the case that a habit completely dies, until a technical technological revolution comes along and makes it completely obsolete."" She believes that COVID quickly accelerated the e-commerce boom but shopping in store is likely to go through a honeymoon period post COVID. ""We're getting that pent up desire to shop out. But another part of it is this sense of soothing that we get from shopping, feeling that life is returning to normal,"" she said. ""It's entirely possible that the concept of a family grocery shop might disappear. ""In many ways, I think we've entrenched what we knew before. ""We've learned that people value their own time and their own pleasure.""

188,"Value-adding is the way to get local products overseas, experts say ",markets,"  Bundaberg producers urged to take advantage of export opportunities Wide Bay producers are being urged to capitalise on new export opportunities but a looming labour shortage may slow them down. Trade and Investment Queensland's Bundaberg trade and investment officer Diane Anstee says the market gaps that farmers could harness were in the South-East Asia region. ""There's a lot of opportunities there,"" she said. ""Specifically around the need for food security in countries like Indonesia."" Ms Anstee said local farmers could offer more than just food products. ""There's opportunities there for Australian exporters to assist with expertise, know-how as well as providing food,"" she said. The COVID-19 pandemic overhauled how Australian farmers could send their products overseas. With airports across the country, and the world, operating at a very limited capacity producers were forced to look for markets elsewhere. Ms Anstee said value-adding to products was an option going forward and that there were a number of examples locally, including dried fruit, herb and vegetable pastes and macadamia products. ""It's been very difficult in terms of air freight ... it's still doable, we just have to do things differently. ""Look at what we're exporting and how we might be able to add to it here so it doesn't rely on air transport. ""The other opportunity is to work in conjunction with partners in overseas markets so we're still earning export dollars without actually sending food offshore."" Not only are there options to value-add locally, but Ms Anstee says there is demand for it in key overseas markets. ""Particularly since COVID-19, people are looking for value-added food products that they can take home rather than going out to a restaurant,"" she said. ""There's many markets they still can't do that so I think there's an opportunity there."" With about 1,000 workers leaving Australia every week, the labour crisis in the agriculture industry is expected to worsen. Download the ABC News app for all the latest. Bundaberg Fruit and Vegetable Growers (BFVG) managing director Bree Grima says it is time for a shakeup. ""Now is the time for us to think differently about how we do everything,"" she said. BFVG is one of 5 organisations nationally taking part in the Harvest Trail Industry Collaboration trial. Ms Grima said its focus has been getting more Australians onto farms in the long term. ""Whilst we might need pickers and packers now — the opportunities are there for those people to stay on board and to really become part of that business,"" she said. ""We need everyone from mathematicians, scientists, food technologists as well as engineers."" Even if the agricultural sector increases the number of local workers, Ms Grima said the local industry would still be reliant on Pacific Islanders and backpackers to work. ""Unfortunately, we are still going to be reliant on those workers because of the seasonal nature of our crops,"" she said. ""So it needs to be a real mix of different workers that we access, but it has really shown us how vulnerable we can be.""

189,AMP board narrowly escapes spill; ASX drops as Beach Energy dives,markets,"  AMP board narrowly escapes spill; ASX slips as Beach Energy dives; Asahi buys Allpress coffee The Australian share market closed moderately lower, as AMP's board narrowly escaped facing a spill motion and Beach Energy stocks took a massive hit. Angry shareholders came close to rejecting AMP's remuneration report for a second time, which would have sparked a motion to spill the board. The troubled company's remuneration report received a 23.8 per cent vote against, just below the 25 per cent threshold to trigger a second strike and a spill motion. Investors also peppered AMP's board with questions about the slumping share price, chaotic leadership changes and massive payouts to departing executives. AMP is a giant in the history of Australian finance. But it is in dire straits: with a record low share price, management turmoil and money walking out the door.Khadem pic teaser box AMP sexual harassment Chair Debra Hazelton defended the company's performance and acknowledged the collapsing value of shares: from over $5 in the period before the 2018 banking royal commission to trading at a record low of $1.08 this week. ""We can not manage the share price,"" she said. ""We can oversee the management of the company … to build on the value of AMP going forward and we expect that will result in an improved share price."" The chair did not confirm or deny reports that outgoing AMP Capital chief executive Boe Pahari could receive between $50 million and $70 million as he exits the company. ""I've seen the speculation as well, I'm not familiar with the figure. We fully disclose remuneration as required,"" Ms Hazelton said, explaining how Mr Pahari will receive 'carry', a percentage of a fund that outperforms a particular target. ""And the final value of the carry is not known until the fund matures."" The meeting was held virtually, and the first question asked why, given the headquarters is down the road from where the musical Hamilton is playing to 2,000 people seated indoors. The chair explained the meeting was set up in March and the board was ""very conscious of the risks [and] concerned about snap shutdowns"". Investors appeared unimpressed with the meeting, as AMP shares lost 1.8 per cent during the day to close just off their record low at $1.115. The ASX 200 closed down 0.8 per cent to end the week at 7,026 points. Utilities and consumer stocks had modest gains, but those were wiped out by losses in healthcare, mining and non-cyclical consumer stocks. The energy sector had the biggest slide today, driven in part by a crash in the share price of one major player. Beach Energy was the biggest loser of the day by far, shedding almost a quarter of its market value during the session. That came after the oil and gas company warned that it was downgrading its assets following a review of its reserves across the Western Flank oil and gas fields in Australia. It said it was experiencing a substantial decline in a number of fields in the Cooper Basin region. The basin is located mainly in the south-west part of Queensland. Beach Energy put the loss of oil at about 5 per cent of its total output. The stock's loss is its biggest one-day drop since March 2020, when the market dived as COVID took hold. Beach Energy closed down 24.1 per cent at $1.275, and is off by more than 29 per cent this year. Globally the price of oil has been rising. Crude was up 1.9 per cent at $US68.53 a barrel. The price has been rising on hopes that demand will increase as lockdowns ease in Europe and more people globally are vaccinated for COVID. US bank Goldman Sachs this week forecast “the biggest jump in oil demand ever” at 5.2 million barrels per day in the next six months. However, there has also been speculation that the growing COVID crisis in India could affect demand negatively as well, if the world's third-largest economy goes into widespread lockdown. In big news in the food space, global drinks corporation Asahi Beverages is buying Australasian coffee company Allpress. Allpress started out in Auckland as a single coffee cart run by Michael Allpress in the 1980s. It expanded into Australia with the help of his friend Tony Papas in 2000 and now has 240 employees, a wholesale coffee bean business, and a dozen cafes across Australia. Asahi has not disclosed how much it is paying for Allpress. The coffee industry is now worth $1 billion in Australia. The Japanese-owned Asahi Beverages operates across Australia and New Zealand and is best known for selling alcohol. It also bought Carlton & United Breweries in 2019. Asahi Beverages chief executive Robert Iervasi said the acquisition would extend the conglomerate's reach into the popular coffee market. ""We're thrilled to extend our portfolio of brands into the large and complimentary coffee category,"" he said. All three major US markets closed trade higher, with the biggest listed names continuing to release their latest quarterly results this week. The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Thursday, fueled by gains in Facebook following its strong earnings report. Meanwhile, Amazon posted a record profit as it continued to benefit from shoppers heading online during the pandemic. Net sales rose to $US109 billion ($140 billion) in the last quarter, giving it a rise of $US75 million ($97 million). Since the pandemic started, Amazon has employed half a million extra people to keep up with rising demand. Its shares rose 4 per cent on its latest results. Meanwhile, Twitter's shares have dipped 9 per cent. The social media platform warned in its results that user growth could slow after the boost it got from the pandemic. ""The explosive growth that Twitter experienced during the pandemic is slowing rather rapidly in the aftermath of an eventful 2020 in which the microblogging site benefited immensely from the US elections and a pandemic-driven surge,"" US analyst Haris Anwar said.

190,Woolies sales beat Coles; CBA hits 14 month high; ASX ends day up,markets,"  ASX rising as Woolworths sales beat Coles; CBA shares hit highest price in 14 months The Australian sharemarket has finished Thursday in positive territory, with miners doing well off gold prices and some banks trading at year-long highs. The ASX 200 finished the day up 0.3 per cent to 7,082. The best performing stocks of the day was mining companies with interests in gold, as the spot price rises globally. Nickel Mines is the top performer with a 7.4 per cent gain. Meanwhile, Commonwealth Bank shares hit their highest price since February 2020 at $90.81 during the day's trade. But the major bank's shares dipped below that finish 0.2 per cent down on open at $89.99. Meanwhile, ASIC's new chairman has been revealed. Financial services lawyer and former top regulator Joe Longo will replace outgoing chair James Shipton. A day after Coles released its quarterly results, competitor Woolworths has done the same, and beat it in some areas. Both supermarkets have seen a decline in grocery sales this quarter compared with the panic buying fuelled months last year at the start of the COVID pandemic. However, while Coles' sales were down 6.1 per cent, Woolworths' grocery turnover was only down 0.7 per cent as it propped up in-store sales with a surge in online sales. It has also seen no change in alcohol shopping as COVID panic buying eased, although it is selling less wine now than when Australians were in lockdown. ""In general, customer shopping behaviours continue to normalise,"" it said. ""While food customers are shopping less frequently, the growth in the number of items customers put in their baskets is slowing."" Woolworths' grocery victory over Coles made no difference to their share prices. Woolworths ended the day down 3.9 per cent while Coles was up 3.5 per cent. Woolworths also used its reporting season to announce it had backed down from putting a Dan Murphys store next to an Indigenous community in Darwin. The saga to open the alcohol store had dragged on for years and Woolworths finally conceded it did not consult enough with local Indigenous groups about the possible impacts. Woolworths has also announced it has been given a year longer by the ACCC for approval for its controversial purchase of food producer PFD. The US central bank has kept its interest rate at zero, as expected. In a statement, the US Federal Reserve said it is sticking to its plan to target 2 per cent inflation for a longer period, and that it would stick to an ""accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved"". ""Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. ""The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement. ""Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. ""In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $US80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $US40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals."" The US dollar weakened after the statement. Treasury yields dropped. All of the main US markets closed lower on Wednesday (local time) between 0.1 and 0.4 per cent. The Australian dollar has risen against the greenback overnight to 77.90 US cents. It briefly touched 78 US cents during an address by the US Federal Reserve. NAB analysts described the Federal Reserve meeting as ""having come and gone with no big fireworks"". The US central bank's statement comes as President Joe Biden seeks to tax its most wealthy. According to global wires, Mr Biden plans to unveil a $US1.8 trillion package for families and education in his first speech to Congress on Wednesday. The event will be scaled back this year because of the pandemic. The new package, which together with an earlier infrastructure and jobs plan, totals around $US4 trillion. It includes $US1 trillion in spending on education and child care over 10 years and $US800 billion in tax credits aimed at middle- and low-income families, according to a White House fact sheet. The spending plans ""reinvest in the future of the American economy and American workers, and will help us out-compete China and other countries around the world,"" it said. To pay for the plans, Mr Biden has previously flagged an overhaul of the US tax system. Wednesday's ""American Families Plan"" is funded by raising the top marginal tax rate for the wealthiest Americans from 37 per cent to 39.6 per cent. It nearly doubles the tax on investment income – known as capital gains – for Americans who earn more than $US1 million. The proposed infrastructure plan is funded by an increase in corporate taxes. News of the capital gains tax proposal briefly sank stock markets last week.

191,Young cattle price makes history by surpassing 900 cents but there is a downside,markets," ABC Rural Record cattle prices may slow national herd recovery as farmers struggle to restock Record cattle prices are making it hard for producers trying to restock and may put the brakes on the national herd's drought recovery. Download the ABC News app for all the latest. The Eastern Young Cattle Indicator (EYCI) has passed the 900 cents a kilogram mark for the first time in history. ""People need to rebuild the herd and they're scrambling to,"" NAB agribusiness economist Phin Ziebell said. ""For producers who are looking to rebuild, you've sold low, you're buying high and if you ask somebody what cattle prices will be in a few years, no-one really knows."" The EYCI closed yesterday at 901.75 cents, almost 200 cents up on the same time last year. Rain in drought-affected parts of Queensland and NSW are the main driver, according to Mr Ziebell. ""This is clearly a response to better seasonal conditions in Queensland in particular, which has really boosted restocker demand,"" Mr Ziebell said. Ray Cranney is a grazier near Goondiwindi in southern Queensland and recent rains have changed the outlook on his farm, which has struggled through years of drought. Dusty and dry paddocks are now flush with green grass, and Mr Cranney only has half of the cattle his property could sustain through winter. Mr Cranney, like many other graziers, was looking to rebuild, but very high prices were slowing him down. ""It is hard, and in the local area, you really can't pick up too much,"" Mr Cranney said. ""You have to look further north and south, and we're willing to do that. ""There are always things that will slow you down, but that's fine, that's all part of life."" According to ABARES, the National herd was sitting at below 23 million head, and forecasts for the speed of the rebuild differed. ""Meat and Livestock Australia's [MLA] estimates point to a more rapid rebuild in the herd, whereas ABARES thinks it won't do much,"" Mr Ziebell said. He said a rapid rebuild scenario would require far fewer animals being slaughtered for processing and a lot fewer live exported overseas. ""Can we rebuild the herd above 26 million by 2022–23, which is sort of where MLA is looking?"" Mr Ziebell asked. ""We can but it's a big task ahead, and we'll be needing good seasonal conditions for the next few years to allow that to happen."" MLA said 2021 was already on track to see a historically low slaughter record. The National Livestock Reporting Service has reported the lowest March quarter slaughter in more than 20 years, at 1,206,404 head. With prices so high, beef processors were facing record losses of more than $300 per head of cattle processed for the past three months, according to market research from Thomas Elder Markets. It was also making margins tight for feedlotters. Smithfield Cattle Company has just finished an 18-month, multi-million-dollar expansion of the Sapphire Feedlot near Goondiwindi. The feedlot now holds 20,000 head of cattle being fed for direct sale to meat processors. Smithfield Cattle Company chief operating officer Jason Shearer-Smith said the company tried to keep its feedlots at capacity for operational efficiency, which has been difficult in the current market. ""At the end of the day, cattle are very expensive, but meat values are also going up quite considerably,"" he said. ""Our margins are pretty tight at the moment, but we're going OK."" The good news, if you buy cattle at least, is that prices are expected to fall in the second half of this year as supply areas dry out and restockers lose their appetite for growth. ""My sense is we are going to see a fall in ECYI, particularly in the second half of 2021–22,"" Mr Ziebell said. ""The question I have around price and herd rebuild is: if the grass isn't there and the feed isn't there in nine months, how can you support prices at this level? ""The answer is that you can't."" Mr Ziebell speculated that the ECYI may fall to as low as 850 cents a kilo later this year and 600 cents in early 2022.

192,"It’s been sold here for decades, but now Coca-Cola is losing its local flavour",markets,"  Coca-Cola's Australian rightsholder being sold off to Europe for $9.8 billion It has been sold in Australia for decades with help from local celebrities and even become part of Sydney's cityscape. But now Coca-Cola is set to lose its local flavour. Shareholders have overwhelmingly voted to sell Australian bottler Coca-Cola Amatil (CCA) to Coke's European offshoot for $9.8 billion. Investment analyst Paul Rickard, who owns shares in CCA, was one of those who voted in favour of the deal on Friday morning. ""Of course I'd prefer the company to stay in Australian hands but I'm sure we'll have some opportunities in the European market,"" he said. ""Like anything, seeing an Australian company go offshore, we can feel a bit sad about it."" While its namesake has Coca-Cola in it, the Australian company that is being sold off actually started out more than a century ago by selling cigarettes. It started buying up local franchise rights to the iconic American brand Coca-Cola in the 1960s and now controls the brand’s production and distribution for all of Australia. It makes the brown fizzy drink at factories across the country and bottles it for sale for outlets from supermarkets through to cinemas. It also has the rights to Coca-Cola in several nearby markets, including Indonesia, Fiji, PNG and New Zealand. As well as its namesake brand, CCA has the rights to a horde of other drinks from Fanta and spring water through to hard liquor like Jim Beam. Over the years, as it has battled to diversify from its sugar-laden roots, CCA has also has bought stakes in other local companies such as Made Group, which makes coconut water and yogurt. One of its more unpopular decisions was buying up Australian canned fruit company SPC in 2005. It pumped $250 million into it over 14 years and then sold if off for just $15 million profit. CCA floated on the ASX in the 1970s and was once a top 10 company. But its share price has suffered over the years as it battled the rise of small challenger brands, the anti-sugar movement and subdued sales of the core fizzy drink. It is a symbol of American-style capitalism. But in Australia, the soft-drink Coca-Cola has lost its fizz, and a corporate takeover is tipped by some at its best chance of continuing growth. Almost a third of CCA is owned by the US Coca-Cola parent company, giving it a controlling stake. The rest is owned by a range of shareholders on the ASX. Two years ago, another global franchisee of Coca-Cola started circling: Coca-Cola European Partners (CCEP). After its low-ball offers were initially knocked back, in late 2020 the European company made a $9.3 billion offer to investors that worked out to $12.75 a share. In a sign that investors supported the sale, its share price has been surging since the takeover offer and is now at $13.46. CCEP upped its offer in February to $13.50 a share, increasing the total bid to $9.8 billion. This is the offer that has now been accepted by shareholders at the Friday vote. ""I bought my shares in Coca-Cola a long time ago for $8. They haven't done much in a long time,"" retail investor Paul Rickard said. ""This takeover in many ways is a relief for existing shareholders. ""I welcome the sale because it finally allows shareholders to realise some value in the company. ""It's been a tough time for Coca-Cola because the fizzy drinks market hasn't been as buoyant."" The deal was recommended by the CCA board. It was also crucially supported by Coca-Cola's head company in the US, which had a large hand in brokering the deal. At the vote, one investor accused CCA's board of ""acting for overseas interests, not Australian shareholders"" in supporting the deal, while another said the offer fell short of the company's true value. The sell-off has also been approved by the Foreign Investment Review Board. That approval was needed because the sale would put a significant Australian company into the hands of an overseas company. Investment banker and grocery brand specialist David Williams said the looming sell-off to Europe was part of a broader trend towards the re-globalisation of major brands. “These things go in cycles,” he said. “What you've seen the last 10 years is foreign corporations based in Australia are starting investing in business development and specifically in Australian brands that aren’t international brands. “What you’re starting to see everywhere in the world is internationalisation of the businesses. “The large multinationals are having a shift in sentiment where they’re looking at the brands with a large international footprint."" Given that CCA controls some Australian-only brands such as Made Group's portfolio, it will be interesting to see what CCEP could do with those assets after a takeover. Mr Rickard said he did not expect CCEP to start selling off chunks of the business immediately, but that it may look to what other Australian brands it can buy. He also thinks CCEP will review the company's operations in Indonesia, where Coca-Cola is still battling to catch up to its historical rival Pepsi. For the many Coca-Cola fanatics in Australia, it will likely not mean any change in the availability of the core brand, but may reduce local marketing. Shane Waycott from the Coca-Cola Memorabilia Collectors Club of Australia hopes that they can still have a good local relationship with the European company to organise locally approved events. In his years building up a 5,000-piece memorabilia collection, Mr Waycott has been involved in making local spin-offs like a Coca-Cola themed yo-yo. ""From a collector's point of view, when we design and do anything as a club we get support from the company,"" he said. ""If we want to design something, we send it over to Sydney, and get their tick off to say they're happy with that. ""If we don’t have that local contact anymore it could make it harder in the future."" Former Coca-Cola Amatil worker Robert Price and current shareholder said the sale was just part of ""evolution"" and the ongoing consolidation of product control.""When I started in 1962, there was 26 bottling plants for Coca Cola across Australia,"" he said. ""There was three in Tasmania. But in the early 1980s, they were combined into one company. And then those were closed and Tasmania gets all its supplies out of Melbourne. ""It's just part of evolution and consolidation."" He has fond memories of working for CCA. ""If it wasn't a good company, I wouldn't have spent 50-odd years there. It was a good company,"" he said. The deal now just needs to be approved by the Supreme Court of New South Wales, which will make its decision next week, and the corporate regulator ASIC. Assuming that goes through, the company is expected to cease trading on the ASX later this month and the shareholders are expected to get their sweet payday then.

193,"ASX 200 hits 7,000 points for the first time in almost 14 months",markets,"  ASX 200 hits 7,000 points for the first time in almost 14 months The Australian benchmark ASX 200 has hit above 7,000 points for the first time since February 2020, wiping out all of its losses from the COVID crunch. The ASX 200 hit a high of 7,012 points during Thursday trade. That follows days of successive gains. The benchmark eventually closed slightly lower at 6,999. Even without closing at 7,000 points, the ASX 200 saw a 1 per cent gain over the day's trade. The All Ords also closed 1 per cent higher, at 7,250. Robust iron ore prices boosted heavyweight mining stocks. Prices of Australia's biggest export have grown 2 per cent off the back of record prices in China. Fortescue Metals finished the day up 2.5 per cent, while BHP was up 2.6 per cent. Other strong performers on Thursday included EML Payments (+5.7pc), which gained yesterday after announcing it was buying a European subsidiary. The owner of Westfield shopping centres was also up 4.5 per cent, despite media reports that it was taking a hit in its dealing with retail tenants. But other miners that made gains yesterday were losing some of their edge, including Resolute, Perseus and Ramelius. Meanwhile, the financial regulator ASIC is taking Westpac to court over its sale of consumer credit insurance to almost 400 customers. The insurance provided cover for consumers if they are unable to meet their minimum loan repayments due to unemployment, sickness or injury. Westpac's share price ended the day up 1.3 per cent despite the news. The Australian dollar was slightly lower (-0.1pc) against the greenback along with most other major currencies in early morning trade. That is as the US dollar gained slightly and its markets edged very slightly higher. CBA analysts said they had updated the bank's view of where the Australian dollar would go on the basis of commodity prices and the two-year interest rate differential. ""We find that the fair value range for AUD/USD remains broadly unchanged at 0.78 to 0.89 in March (centred on 0.83), supported by firm commodity prices,"" they said. ""AUD/USD is currently trading below the level implied by its fundamentals. ""We expect AUD/USD undervaluation to persist in the near term amid broad USD strength.

194,Tasmania's iconic Salamanca Market kept afloat by volunteers,markets,"  Tasmania's most visited tourist destination, Salamanca Market, is able to keep operating and COVID compliant thanks to the work of volunteers. ""There is simply no way the city could have resourced this any other way,"" said Iris Goetzki, manager of Activation Programs and Tourism at the Hobart City Council. ""The volunteers have been amazing in that they are just so willing to help,"" she said. Meng Lu Cai is one of approximately 60 volunteers who the market deploys every Saturday out of a pool of 170 enthusiastic workers. ""During the COVID-19 period I really wanted to do something for the community,"" she said. ""I think this is a great opportunity for me to be part of the volunteers for Salamanca Market and to do something for our community."" Before coronavirus, the market bustled with about 25,000 visitors every Saturday, and is now able to have only 4,000 people on site, including stallholders, council workers and patrons. ""We were nudging the 1 million mark over a 12-month period before COVID,"" Ms Goetzki said. The market closed for a period of time last year for public health reasons and reopened in August. It grew in size from last September, but is still operating at a reduced capacity. While the market has always had a role for volunteers to provide information, it now requires many more workers to ensure that COVID restrictions are adhered to. ""The volunteers were central to our public education when we resumed the market,"" Ms Goetzki said. ""They are the front line in terms of public safety in many ways. ""We now have 170 volunteers registered in order to assist us manage two shifts a week, each of 40 to 60 [people],"" Ms Goetzki said. ""We've been using volunteers to assist us with on-site sanitation, and with patron counting. ""The requirements for contact tracing really brought us to a new level; it was a massive step up for us,"" she said. Chin Fang Chen, who has been volunteering at the market with her husband Zico Chong since they moved to Tasmania from Taiwan two years ago, said she appreciated the friendliness of people who passed through the entrance. ""They are friendly and kind, and the gate we work on is a little bit special because we can talk with people as they enter,"" she said. Wen Xuan Wang, an international student at the University of Tasmania, also volunteers at the market. ""I basically want to meet more people, and help people control COVID-19. ""My favourite thing about volunteering is to get yourself out and meet people. ""Especially for international students, we don't have many opportunities to interact with Australian people,"" he said. While some of the volunteers have long worked with the Hobart City Council, many are new and have come through a partnership with the University of Tasmania. Luke Cazaly began his role as a program officer with the council only six weeks ago, but when he inducts groups of volunteers twice a day at each Saturday market, it's apparent he has already established rapport with them. ""The volunteers have this energy and they really like to be there,"" he said. ""They really love being part of that community spirit that large markets have, and making friendships."" COVID-19 has caused the only extended break in the market's history. ""Salamanca"" as the market is known to locals, has changed over the years, from a flea market that also sold local produce and art, to primarily tourist-oriented stalls, which still hold appeal to locals. The first market was run with six stalls in November 1971, after the National Council of Women, Tasmania put a proposal to the Hobart City Council to run it. While the market initially operated only in summer, it has been a weekly event since 1977.

195,Australian market boosted by miners and AMP CEO quits ,markets,"  ASX driven by US President Joe Biden's infrastructure plans, AMP CEO goes and ASIC sues CBA The Australian share market has ended higher, helped by US President Joe Biden's more than $2 trillion infrastructure package, and after AMP surged following the resignation of its chief executive. Miners, technology, industrials and financial stocks drove the gains ahead of the Easter holidays. Education firms, real estate and consumer discretionary stocks lost ground. The All Ordinaries increased 0.7 per cent to 7,064. The ASX 200 index put on nearly 0.6 per cent to 6,829, with slightly more sectors rising than falling. US President Joe Biden outlined a more than $2 trillion American Jobs Plan but the infrastructure construction program is based on increasing company taxes, which is opposed by Republicans. The news boosted the greenback and saw the Australian dollar fall nearly 0.8 per cent to 75.37 US cents at 5:00pm AEDT. Going up on the ASX 200 were construction supplies firm Boral (+6.7pc) on a share buyback plan, data centre operator Megaport (5.7pc) and investment firm Perenti Global (+4.9pc). Going down were travel firm Webjet (-5.4pc) after a $250 million corporate note offering, coal miner Whitehaven Coal (-2.8pc) and property developer Mirvac Group (-2.4pc). Sanitiser maker Zoono Group jumped by more than half after its surface sanitiser was successfully tested in the US against the coronavirus and it partnered with aircraft maker Boeing to distribute its microbe shield. Spot gold increased 0.4 per cent to $US1714.60 an ounce and Brent crude oil rose 0.8 per cent to $US63.20 a barrel at 5:00pm AEDT. Shares in investment firm AMP jumped 4.7 per cent to nearly $1.33 after chief executive Francesco De Ferrari stepped down following a week of leadership speculation. He will be replaced by deputy ANZ chief executive Alexis George in the third quarter of this year. AMP says Mr De Ferrari will stay on during the interim period to ensure a smooth transition to Ms George. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission took the Commonwealth Bank to court alleging that it incorrectly charged monthly account keeping fees to customers and misled them. ASIC has accused the bank of incorrectly charging monthly fees to customers, who were entitled to fee waivers, including pensioners and students. It said almost $55 million in fees were incorrectly charged to nearly one million customers between June 2010 and September 2019. Between April 2015 and September 2019, ASIC alleges CBA incorrectly charged customers monthly access fees of $11.5 million. ""ASIC alleges that CBA incorrectly charged monthly access fees to customers entitled to fee waivers due to systems and processes that were inadequate or improperly configured in 30 different ways, as well as due to manual errors made by CBA staff,"" the regulator said in a statement. The CBS said it had apologised to customers and would defend the case as it disagreed with the way the alleged errors had been formulated in the proceedings. It said it had compensated customers to the tune of $64.2 million and provided multiple breach reports to ASIC. Commonwealth Bank shares recovered lost ground and ended 0.1 per cent higher at $86.12. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has ordered Macquarie Bank to hold an extra $500 million in capital because of multiple material breaches of APRA's prudential and reporting standards between 2018 and 2020. It also raised Macquarie's liquidity requirements by 15 per cent. ""The breaches are historical and do not impact on the current overall soundness of Macquarie Group's capital or liquidity positions."" ""However, they raise serious questions about the bank's risk management practices and ability to calculate and report key prudential ratios,"" APRA said in a statement. Macquarie shares came off their lows and finished down 0.5 per cent to $152.12. The Australian Bureau of Statistics said retail trade fell 0.8 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis from January. However, turnover was up by just over 9 per cent from February last year. Spending dropped on food but rose on household goods, especially electrical goods and furniture. People spent more at cafes and restaurants, but less on takeaway food. Spending fell in Western Australia, Victoria and the Northern Territory, but rose in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, ACT and Tasmania. The ABS said home loans fell 0.4 per cent in February on a seasonally adjusted basis, the first fall since May 2020. The latest home price figures from Core Logic showed the fastest rise in home prices in more than thirty years. ABS head of finance and wealth, Katherine Keenan, said mortgage commitments remained near record high levels. ""The value of new loan commitments for owner occupier housing fell 1.8 per cent in February 2021, although it remained 55.2 per cent higher than in February 2020,"" she said. ""The fall in February was driven by reduced loan commitments for existing dwellings, although the value of these loan commitments remained 39.7 per cent higher than in February 2020."" The trade surplus narrowed from $9.6 billion in January to $7.5 billion in February, seasonally adjusted, as exports fell and imports rose. Other ABS data showed that job vacancies rose nearly 14 per cent from the November to February quarters. Technology stocks on Wall Street surged as investors awaited details of US President Joe Biden's $2.6 infrastructure plan. The S&P 500 index reached a record high, with the US benchmark index closing in on 4,000 for the first time as investors bet on a strong economic rebound. ""The trend we're seeing today is investors rotating back into growth-oriented names that have gotten a little bit beaten up over the past few weeks or so due to underlying rotation toward the economic reopening stocks,"" said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at RDM Financial Group. Apple increased 1.9 per cent after a stockbroker upgrade, and Walgreens Boots Alliance rose after raising its 2021 profit forecast on higher sales at its US retail pharmacy stores. The Dow Jones Industrial Average turned lower in late trade.  It lost nearly 0.3 per cent to 32,982. The S&P 500 index rose nearly 0.4 per cent to 3,973 while the Nasdaq rose 1.5 per cent to 13,247. The three major indexes marked their fourth quarterly rise in a row. Last week, the Dow hit a record closing high, thanks to the recent $US1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus and vaccine rollouts. Investors once again sold off government bonds, with 10-year Treasury yields rising as high as 1.753 per cent, after initially being pushed down on demand from traders rebalancing their portfolios for the end of the March quarter. Meanwhile, US private employers boosted hiring in March as more Americans got vaccinated against COVID-19. The ADP National Employment Report was slightly below economists' expectations, but the jump in hiring aligned with a recent improvement in employment market conditions. In Europe, shares closed slightly lower. Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 index fell 6,714 as online food delivery firm Deliveroo fell by one third on its first day of trading. Deliveroo's performance was dubbed ""the worst IPO in London's history"" by one of its bankers. The DAX in Germany was little changed at 15,008 and the CAC 40 in Paris fell 0.3 per cent to 6,067.

196,Australian shares rise as Chinese factories expand,markets,"  Australian shares end March quarter with a robust day of trade Australian shares have surged on the last trading day of the month helped by solid Chinese economic data and as investors adjusted their shareholdings at the end of the March quarter. Chinese factories expanded faster than expected in March with the official Purchasing Manager's Index reaching 51.9. The Australian market rose nearly 2 per cent during the day but came off those highs in late trade. All sectors rose aside from oil stocks with industrials, real estate, consumer stocks and miners among the gainers. Local banks also drove the gains as US 10-year Treasury bonds surged to their highest level in 14 months ahead of an infrastructure speech tonight by US president Joe Biden. The All Ordinaries index put on 0.7 per cent to 7,017. The ASX 200 index closed up 0.8 per cent to 6,791. Among the biggest risers were shopping centre owner Unibail Rodamco  (+6.4pc), iron ore miner Champion Iron (+6.2pc) and global toll road firm Atlas Arteria (+5.7pc). Going down were Harvey Norman (-3.7pc) as it traded ex-dividend, gold miner Ramelius Resources (-3.6pc), and technology firm Appen (-3.1pc). For the quarter, the benchmark index added 3.1 per cent. It rose 1.8 per cent over March, its best month since November. Insurer Suncorp said it had received 7,600 claims for damages from the floods and storms across three states. The insurer said it estimated that net claims from the natural disaster are estimated to be between $230 million to $250 million. Suncorp said three-quarters of the claims are from New South Wales and around one-fifth are from south-east Queensland, with the rest from Victoria and ACT. It expects the number of insurance claims to increase. Suncorp shares put on 1.5 per cent to $9.90. On Friday, Insurance Australia Group said it had it received 8,000 claims so far worth, around $135 million. Buy now, pay later firm Zip will soon be available in JB Hi-Fi stores and Good Guy stores. The Zip service is expected to be launched next month at the electronics and homewares chains. Its shares gained 0.4 per cent to $7.38. JB Hi-Fi ran out of steam and ended slightly higher at $51.78. The Australian dollar rose above 76 US cents but ended the day at 75.95 US cents. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand said it was easing dividend restrictions place on lenders during the coronavirus pandemic. New Zealand banks will now be able to pay up to half their earnings in dividends. The limit will remain in place until mid next year. The NZ50 index added nearly 1 per cent, but the Nikkei fell in Japan, as did the Shanghai Composite index and Hang Seng index in Hong Kong. Spot gold fell 0.3 per cent to $US1679 an ounce at 4:20pm AEDT. Brent crude oil rose 0.5 per cent in Asian trade to $US64.46 a barrel. Record low interest rates and government subsidies for home building saw a strong rise in dwelling approvals in February, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The number of dwellings approved increased by nearly 22 per cent last month, mostly recouping January's 19.4 per cent fall. ABS construction statistics director Bill Becker said approvals for houses had hit a record high. ""Approvals for private houses increased 15.1 per cent in February, exceeding the previous record-high set in December last year."" ""Since the introduction of the HomeBuilder grant in June 2020, private house approvals have risen by almost 70 per cent,"" he said. Permits to build apartments and townhouses jumped by nearly half on a seasonally adjusted basis, coming off a nine-year low in January. Queensland led the way, with approvals rising strongly in all states and territories except South Australia. The Reserve Bank said demand for credit rose 0.2 per cent last month and 1.6 per cent over the year, the weakest annual credit growth in 11 years. Housing loans increased 0.4 per cent over the month but demand for personal loans fell and business credit was flat. US stocks slipped, with investors selling tech-related growth shares as US Treasury yields hit a 14-month high. Shares of Apple,  Microsoft and Amazon fell and most sectors dropped on the S&P 500 index. But financials, industrials and consumer discretionary firms rose, extending the recent rotation out of growth and into so-called value names as the March quarter ended. Bank stocks rebounded as investors took heart from signs that the impact from the fall of a US hedge fund did not ripple out to broader markets. Wells Fargo jumped after the lender said it had a prime brokerage relationship with Archegos Capital and that it no longer had any exposure and did not experience any losses. However the losses from the default of the hedge fund could be between $US5 to $US10 billion globally for lenders according to JP Morgan. Tech stocks have been among the hardest hit by the rise in bond yields because they have expanded rapidly based on a low interest rate environment. ""Investor preferences are flipping around here almost on a daily basis, primarily between tech plus and cyclicals,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""Cyclicals have certainly had the upper hand here for a while, trading off the reopening of the economy."" The benchmark US 10-year Treasury yield hit a 14-month high as big banks shed debt holdings ahead of a regulatory change. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 104 points, or 0.3 per cent to 33,067, the S&P 500 lost 12 points, or 0.3 per cent to 3,959 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 14 points, or 0.1 per cent to 13,045. Bets on a swift economic rebound backed by vaccine rollouts and unprecedented stimulus helped the S&P 500 and the Dow notch record closing highs last week, while the Nasdaq is still below its record closing high from February. Tonight US President Joe Biden will unveil more details about the first stage of his infrastructure plan, which could be worth as much as $US4 trillion. US consumer confidence rose in March to its highest level since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting views that economic growth will accelerate in the coming months, driven by more economic stimulus and an improving public health situation. The survey from the Conference Board also showed that consumers were fairly upbeat about the employment market, with a measure of household employment rebounding after three straight monthly decreases. Restrictions on non-essential businesses are being rolled back as more Americans get vaccinated against COVID-19. In Europe, stocks rose. The FTSE 100 index rose 0.5 per cent to 6,772, the DAX in Germany increased 1.3 per cent to 15,009, and the CAC 40 in Paris gained 1.2 per cent to 6,088.

197,ASX in the red as AGL gas import plan rejected,markets,"  Australian shares fall for the second day in a row as miners and oil stocks weigh on market and AGL gas import plan rejected The Australian share market has lost ground as a fall in commodity prices weighed on miners and oil stocks, and the Victorian Government rejected power firm AGL Energy's plans for a LNG import jetty. The Dow Jones was up 0.3 per cent to 33,171, S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent to 3,971 and the Nasdaq dropped 0.6 per cent to 13,060 AGL helped drive the Australian market's early gains after it announced it would split up its business. However, its shares tumbled after the Victorian government said AGL's plan for a 300-metre-long floating gas terminal off the Mornington Peninsula at Crib Point would have unacceptable environmental effects and harm internationally recognised wetlands. AGL shares ended down 3.5 per cent to $9.81. Pipeline firm APA, which was to build the jetty, dropped 0.8 per cent to $9.98. AGL said it was reviewing the Victorian government's decision. It has spent $130 million so far on the gas import terminal project. Chief executive Brett Redman said that the company was willing to buy gas from other firms looking to import LNG. ""Nothing has changed in that we are a big and great gas trader,"" he said. The All Ordinaries index fell nearly 1 per cent, or 67 points, to 6,970. The ASX 200 had put on 0.5 per cent, or 35 points, to 6,834 at 10:20am AEDT. In the end, it fell 0.9 per cent, or 61 points, to 6,738. Only technology shares ended higher, with the sector losses led by education firms, miners, utilities and energy stocks. Oil firms, gold and copper miners lost ground on lower prices and iron ore futures dropped, with gold miners Resolute Mining (-7.7pc) and Silver Lake Resources (-5.6pc) among the biggest fallers in the ASX 200. In futures trade, Brent crude was down 0.2 per cent to $US64.85 a barrel, while spot gold was down 0.3 per cent to $US1704.89 an ounce at 4:30pm AEDT. Online bookmaker Pointsbet fell 9.3pc on media reports that legislation in New York state in the US to approve mobile sports betting may be delayed. Among the gainers were telecommunications firm Spark New Zealand (+3.2pc), data centre operator Megaport (+2.9pc) and Auckland International Airport (+2.8pc). Banking regulator Wayne Byres told a financial conference that it was too early to introduce controls to cool the booming property market but he said that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority was prepared to use regulatory tools to slow the growth of household debt or to tighten lending standards if necessary. The big banks were mixed, with Westpac (+0.1pc) and ANZ (+0.4pc) ending higher but the CBA (-0.2pc) and National Australia Bank (-0.8pc) lower. The consumer regulator approved NAB's plan to take over digital bank 86 400. There are fears that global banks could lose as much as $US6 billion in the fallout from US hedge fund Archegos Capital defaulting on its margin loans. In Japan, investment bank Nomura fell a further 1 per cent today because of its exposure to Archegos after yesterday's 16 per cent fall. The Australian dollar was buying around 76.5 US cents, up 0.3 per cent at 4:30pm AEDT. AGL said it would split into two separate firms, a retailer and an electricity generator, following a review of its business model. The move comes after AGL's share price fell by more than one-third over the past year. The company has faced growing challenges as expanding wind and solar power hits its electricity market earnings faster than expected, which has lowered wholesale power prices. The firm said one business would be called, New AGL, and it would be Australia's largest multi-product energy retailer, selling electricity, gas, internet and mobile services. The new company would also have a carbon-neutral focus. The other spin-off, PrimeCo, would be an electricity generator, supplying the National Electricity Market, New AGL, other retailers, aluminium smelters, and wholesale and industrial power users. This would include the company's three coal fired power stations, Liddell and Bayswater power stations in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales and Loy Yang in Victoria's Latrobe Valley. AGL also plans to sell off $400 million worth of assets with its Newcastle gas storage facility and Silver Springs gas project in Queensland, first on the chopping block. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, an investor advisory firm, criticised the restructure plans Its director of climate and environment Dan Gocher accused AGL of walking away from responsibility for the shutdown of its ageing coal-fired power stations by spinning them off into PrimeCo. ""AGL has chosen the easy way out, leaving the hard decisions around coal closure to whoever is chosen to run PrimeCo,"" he said. ""AGL is Australia's largest emitter, responsible for approximately 8 per cent of annual emissions. Its actions have a real impact on Australia's emissions trajectory."" Greenpeace campaigner Jonathan Moylan also slammed AGL's plans. ""When the going gets tough, the tough get going. What an abdication of responsibility: you need to replace coal with renewables by 2030. Offsets are a joke!"" Meanwhile, oil and gas producer Santos (-1.1pc) decided to go ahead with the $4.7 billion Barossa gas project off the Northern Territory. Mining company TerraCom told the stock market it was raided by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission yesterday over allegations of fake coal sampling by laboratory firm ALS. ALS said last year that an internal investigation found about half the certificates it provided for coal export samples over the past decade had been manually altered to improve the quality of the coal. TerraCom said neither it nor its Blair Athol coal mine in Queensland were at the centre of the investigation concerning the quality of coal exports. The firm bought the Blair Athol mine from Rio Tinto in 2017, and it said it did not ship export coal until April 2018, 11 years into the ALS internal investigation. The coal miner said it would continue to cooperate with ASIC and had provided investigators with information to assist their inquiries. ALS shares lost 2.8 per cent to $9.58. TerraCom shares fell 4.6 per cent to $0.08. Big banks have weighed on Wall Street after warnings of potential losses from a hedge fund's default on margin calls, although optimism about the US economy limited the falls. Japan's largest investment bank Nomura and Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse are facing billions of dollars in losses after US hedge fund Archegos Capital defaulted on margin calls, share market bets made with borrowed money, putting investors on edge about who else might have been caught out. Archegos is run by former Tiger Asia boss, Bill Hwang. Tiger Asia was a Hong Kong-based fund trading in Asian shares. In 2012, Mr Hwang and his firm paid $US44 million ($57 million) to settle US insider trading charges. Nomura shares fell 16.3 per cent, a record one day drop. On the Swiss Stock Exchange, Credit Suisse shares plunged nearly 14 per cent after it said the defaults by Archegos could be ""highly significant and material"" to its first-quarter results. Switzerland's financial regulator said it was in touch with Credit Suisse regarding the incident. JP Morgan shares fell 1.6 per cent. Shares of Morgan Stanley dropped 2.6 per cent after the Financial Times reported it had also sold billions of shares. ""There's still chatter as to whether or not, and which, American banks may be affected. That is a question that's lurking,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. ""But so far the market has taken [the news] in stride essentially."" Media stocks Discovery and Viacom, US-listed shares of Baidu and VIPShop, all linked to Archegos, were lower, extending recent losses. Shares of aircraft maker Boeing up 2.4 per cent after the company reached a deal with US budget carrier Southwest Airlines for a variant of the 737 MAX aircraft, the 737 MAX-7. Optimism about speedy vaccinations and record stimulus, which drove the Dow and the S&P 500 to record closing highs on Friday, helped keep a floor in the market, Dr Krosby said. The Dow Jones index rose 0.3 per cent or 99 points to 33,179, while the S&P 500 ended flat, down 3 points to 3,971 and the Nasdaq Composite lost dropped 79 points, or 0.6 per cent to 13,060. In London, the FTSE 100 fell nearly 0.1 per cent to 6,736, the CAC 40 rose 0.5 per cent to 6,016, and the Dax in Germany put on 0.5 per cent to 14,818. Oil prices rose as traders expect major oil producers to maintain output cuts. The stricken container ship, the Ever Given, which had blocked Egypt's Suez Canal, was refloated, allowing shipping traffic in one of the world's busiest waterways to resume. More than 400 vessels were waiting to transit after the ship became wedged in the narrow canal last week.

198,AMP stops trading on speculation of CEO quitting; ASX closes higher,markets,"  AMP stops trading on speculation of CEO quitting; Australians shares rise Embattled wealth manager AMP has attempted to calm investors down after its shares tumbled on doubts about its chief executive's future. On Thursday afternoon, Nine's newspapers reported that AMP boss Francesco De Ferrari would ""resign from the company today"", after two years in the top job, and that his departure was negotiated with the board of directors. The company's stock had plunged (-3.6pc) to $1.34 (near its record lows) by 3:35pm AEDT. By that time, AMP released a brief statement to the Australian stock exchange, simply stating that its shares would be ""temporarily paused pending a further announcement"". This was followed by another one-line statement in the evening, which just said: ""AMP Limited notes the media reports today and confirms that Francesco De Ferrari remains as chief executive officer of the group."" It did not provide any details about the AMP chief's plans beyond today. AMP has lost two-thirds in value and struggled to repair its reputation since the 2018 banking royal commission found the company had lied to regulators and engaged in serious misconduct (in particular, the ""fee for no service"" scandal). The financial services firm has also been rocked by controversy over its handling of sexual harassment complaints internally. It led to the resignation of its then-chairman David Murray, board director John Fraser, and the demotion of Boe Pahari from his role as head of AMP Capital, its most lucrative division. After drifting in and out of negative territory throughout a listless Thursday session, the local share market ended its day marginally higher. The ASX 200 closed 12 points (+0.2pc) higher at 6,791 points. The broader All Ordinaries index went up by a similar level to 7,023 points. After rising for two straight days, the Australian market has recovered to where it was last Thursday. The market was boosted by gains in the healthcare, energy and discretionary sectors. Some of the best-performing stocks were Premier Investments (+4.6pc), Adbri (+5.3pc), Polynovo (+4.9pc) and Fletcher Building (+3.8pc). On the flip side, gold miner Resolute Mining (-26.2pc), Zip Co (-5.3pc), Appen (-3.5pc), AMP (-3.6pc) and Pilbara Minerals (-3.1pc) dropped sharply. Resolute Mining shares tanked after the miner revealed that its mining lease for its Bibiani gold mine had been terminated by the Ghanaian government. Its mine in Ghana was in the process of getting sold to a Chinese company, Chifeng Jilong Gold Mining, for $US105 million. The termination of that lease is a threat to that deal. The Australian dollar slipped (-0.5pc) to a three-month low of 75.8 US cents, after the greenback strengthened overnight. By 4:50pm AEDT, the local currency had recovered slightly to 75.94 US cents. One of the world's largest exchange operators Cboe Global Markets has revealed it will acquire Chi-X Asia Pacific Holdings, which operates share trading exchanges in Australia and Japan, as it looks to gain access to the two key capital markets. The deal is expected to provide an expanded distribution network that will allow Cboe to offer its own products to clients in both the countries, it said in a statement. Chi-X Australia (CXA) is the country's second largest securities exchange with a 18.4 per cent market share, and the only competitor to ASX. Last year, the ASX had a major outage that underscored the need for more competition in the market and triggered a review from the regulators. Cboe, in its Thursday announcement, did not disclose the financial terms of its takeover of Chi-X from investment firm JC Flowers & Co. It said it expects to close the transaction in the second or third quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approval. Global stock markets dipped overnight as concerns about extended economic lockdowns in Europe and the potential for higher taxes in the United States weighed on investor sentiment. Oil prices surged (recovering from steep losses the previous day) after one of the world's largest container ships ran aground in the Suez Canal. Authorities were still trying to clear the ship from the vital shipping lane on Wednesday afternoon (local time). Brent crude futures jumped (+5.3pc) to $US64.02 a barrel. ""About 1 million barrels per day of oil is moved through the shipping channel,"" ANZ economist Brian Martin wrote in a note. ""Authorities are desperately trying to free the stricken container ship, however, they have refused to provide an estimate of when the channel with reopen. ""This all helped market shrug off concerns about weaker demand in Europe, following reports that several countries were looking to strengthen lockdown measures amid surging virus cases."" Shares in the struggling brick-and-mortar video game retailer GameStop plunged (-34pc) overnight after it reported disappointing quarterly results, earlier this week. The company also said it would raise more capital (by issuing new shares) to fund its expansion into the e-commerce industry. Wondering why a struggling video game chain is grabbing global financial headlines, and what Reddit and Robinhood have to do with it? It has something to do with shorts, as Paul Donoughue and David Chau explain. That tends to bring down the value of existing shares. The Reddit-favourite retailer has seen its share price jump more than 500 per cent since the year began, as retail investors have acted in concert on Reddit forums to bid up prices of heavily shorted stocks. GameStop is looking to take advantage of that sudden price rise to boost its account balance. It comes after the company revealed its sales had dropped for their ninth quarter in a row, and said it would close more retail stores. GameStop's quarterly revenue ($US2.12 billion) was below what the market had expected ($US2.21B). Its earnings per share also underperformed, coming in at $US1.27 (instead of the $US1.35 that analysts had forecast). The company also skipped a question-and-answer session after announcing its results. On Tuesday, the company that it had been considering, since January, whether to increase the size of a $US100 million share sale (that it originally announced in December). GameStop had previously decided against the move as it was restricted under US financial regulations from selling shares because it had not yet updated investors on its earnings. Reddit's WallStreetBets forum was buzzing about another potential short squeeze, which had sent GameStop's shares as high as 2,300 per cent in January to a record high of $US483. A short squeeze occurs when investors who have bet against a stock need to buy it at much higher levels to cover losing positions. Short interest in GameStop has since fallen to about 15 per cent of the stock's float as of Wednesday from a peak of 141 per cent in the first week of 2021, according to data from financial analytics firm S3 Partners. Since then, its shares have plummeted almost as quickly as it had risen. GameStop shares closed at $US120.34, after a 34 per cent slump on Wednesday (local time).. Wedbush analysts downgraded the stock to ""underperform"" from ""neutral"" saying the short squeeze had boosted the share price to levels that were completely disconnected from the fundamentals of business. Billionaire investor and Chewy.com co-founder Ryan Cohen, who is on GameStop's board, expects to transform the retailer into an e-commerce firm that can take on big-box players Target and Walmart, along with technology firms such as Microsoft and Sony. ""We continue to be very sceptical on GME's [GameStop's] efforts to address ... the fact that its core market in new and pre-owned physical console gaming is shrinking at a rapid pace,"" Curtis Nagle, an analyst at Bank of America’s research arm, said in a client note. Nagle has a $US10 price target and an ""underperform"" rating on GameStop's stock. ""The mood is fairly fragile as all the optimism that characterised the push higher over the past two or three weeks in shares is starting to bleed away on talk of a European third wave and extensions of pandemic lockdowns in Germany and France,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. In New York, the industrial-skewed Dow Jones reversed its earlier gains to close 3 points lower (practically flat) at 32,420 points. Is all that Reddit lingo about GameStop making your head spin? Here's your shortcut guide. The S&P 500 was in positive territory for most of the day, but erased its gains in the final hour, finishing with a 0.6 per cent loss (at 3,998 points). The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell sharply (-2pc) at 12,962 overnight. Apple, Facebook and Netflix all slid more than 2 per cent each, while Tesla fell 4.8 per cent. GameStop plunged (-33.8pc) after the struggling video game retailer said it may sell new shares as it looks to take advantage of a more-than-800 per cent surge in its share price since January. In European markets, Germany's DAX fell (-0.4pc), while Britain's FTSE rose slightly (+0.2pc). Meanwhile, the US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told the Senate's banking committee that the American economy remains in crisis from the pandemic as she defended developing plans for future tax increases to pay for new public investments. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also testified before US politicians. He said that a coming round of post-pandemic price increases will not fuel a destructive breakout of persistent inflation. ""If you were to pick a top concern, then it would be the COVID situation, with new cases in emerging markets back to record highs and what's happening in Europe,"" said Derek Halpenny, head of research for global markets at MUFG. ""It does not tally with global optimism for synchronised global growth."" Bitcoin fell (-1.2pc) to $US54,446 as Tesla chief Elon Musk said the company's electric vehicles can now be bought using the volatile cryptocurrency. Spot gold went up (+0.4pc) to $US1,733.81 an ounce.

199,ASX closes higher as Australian dollar drops; Westpac ponders NZ exit,markets,"  ASX closes higher as Australian dollar drops; Westpac ponders NZ exit The Australian share market closed higher on Wednesday, despite energy stocks taking a hit as oil prices tanked globally. The benchmark ASX 200 was up 0.5 per cent to 6,779 points by the close. It had closed 0.1 per cent down on Tuesday. Australian retailer Premier Investments was up 2.7 per cent to $23.84 after posting a large rise in net profits. The owner of Smiggle, Just Jeans and Portmans reported its first-half net profit had jumped 89 per cent to $188 million, compared to the same period last year. Its sleepwear chain Peter Alexander performed particularly well, with record sales of $208 million for that half, as Australians retreated to comfort wear during the pandemic. E-commerce sales also grew (+61pc) as locked down shoppers bought clothing online. The rise in profits was despite Premier's Victorian stores being closed for months of that half-year during the state's second lockdown. However, the profits were boosted by a range of concessions. The retailer said it had been accepting JobKeeper payments and made no mention of handing those concessions back, despite its profits. The latest corporate profit reporting season has highlighted how some companies have boosted earnings while collecting JobKeeper subsidies, and not all are volunteering to pay it back. ""Premier is committed to the $15.6 million net benefit of JobKeeper recognised in 1H21 being used to continue to pay its full-time and part-time workforce their contracted hours,"" it said. ""Should they potentially be stood down and unable to work due to any further state government mandated snap COVID-19 lockdowns."" It also paid 12.7 per cent less rent in the half, after negotiations with landlords over tenancies during the downturn. Premier's owner Solomon Lew notably refused to pay rent on stores in shopping centres early on in the pandemic. The retailer closed 51 stores in the last year and a total of 162 in the past seven years. Westpac issued a surprise market update this afternoon revealing that it is reviewing the future of its New Zealand banking business, raising the possibility of a demerger from the company. ""Given the changing capital requirements in New Zealand and the RBNZ requirement to structurally separate Westpac's NZ business operations from its operations in Australia, it is now appropriate to assess the best structure for these businesses going forward,"" the Australian-headquartered bank said. The announcement came just hours after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) raised concerns about Westpac New Zealand's risk governance processes. It has told the bank to commission two independent reports to address the issues. The reprimand in New Zealand, where Westpac holds close to a 20 per cent share of the commercial banking market, echoes criticism levelled at the bank by the Australian regulator in December about ""long-standing weaknesses"" in its risk controls. Westpac failed to submit millions of reports detailing international funds transfers, many of which appear to be for illegal purposes. The concerns underscore Westpac's dated systems and convoluted procedures, which have led to record fines due to breaches of anti-money laundering laws and market share losses in mortgages. ""We have experienced ongoing compliance issues with Westpac NZ over recent years, most recently involving material failures to report liquidity correctly, in line with the Reserve Bank's liquidity requirements,"" RBNZ deputy governor Geoff Bascand said. ""Furthermore, the bank has continued to operate outside of its own risk settings for technology for a number of years."" ""Westpac NZ needs to take a close look at its risk governance practices."" The bank said the breaches were disclosed to the regulator in September 2020 and it was working to improve risk governance. Westpac closed down 1 per cent at $24.19. ABS data shows imports rose by $577 million or 2 per cent in February, with a chunk of this increase coming from a rise in demand for imported cars. ""Most notable were electric and hybrid vehicles,"" head of International Statistics at the ABS, Andrew Tomadini, said. ""Electric vehicle imports grew $104 million to the largest value on record, while hybrid vehicle imports grew $95 million."" Exports also grew by 2 per cent in that month, with metals, meat, oil and textiles seeing the biggest increase in demand by overseas markets. However, exports to Australia's biggest trading partner, China, declined by 8 per cent, the ABS data showed. ""The decline in metalliferous ores to China was driven by iron ore, down $1,122 million (-12pc) to $8,531 million,"" the ABS data said. ""But [iron ore] still accounted for 75 per cent of all Australian iron ore exports in February. The decline in iron ore was primarily driven by quantity, down 5.2m tonnes (-10pc). ""The decline in cereals to China was driven by wheat and meslin in bulk, down $41m (-100pc)."" A range of products have been hit by ongoing trade tensions with China. Just today, ABC News reported Australian hay growers were now fearful of losing their market to China. Oil prices have tanked on concerns about Europe's third wave of COVID infections, new lockdowns and slow vaccine rollout. Germany extended its lockdown until April 18, and Chancellor Angela Merkel urged citizens to stay at home for five days over the Easter holidays. That lockdown will have a major impact on fuel demand, with fewer people flying and driving. In oil markets, Brent crude futures plunged (-6.5pc) to $US60.55, the lowest value since February 9. ""Global travel is still looking like it could be a while away,"" said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Star Fuels in Dubai. He added that a second-half recovery in oil demand looked doubtful as lockdowns remain the order of the day. That is impacting energy stocks on the ASX on Wednesday, with Oil Search down 3.9 per cent. As investors' appetite for risk faltered, ""commodity currencies"" like the Australian dollar fell sharply by around a cent to 75.99 US cents. US markets experienced steep losses overnight, with the worst performers including travel and retail stocks (which have the most to lose if the economy reopening gets delayed). The industrial-skewed Dow Jones index closed 308 points lower (-0.9pc) at 32,423. The S&P 500 dropped (-0.7pc) to 3,911 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell (-1.1pc) to 13,228. It has also been one year since Wall Street hit the lowest point of its COVID crash, as the pandemic sent the S&P into its fastest bear market sell-off ever — plummeting 30 per cent in just 22 days. Since then, the Dow and S&P have rallied about 79 per cent from their pandemic lows hit exactly a year ago, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has doubled in value. Spot gold dropped (-0.6c) to $US1,727.56 an ounce, while silver fell (-2.8pc) to $US25.04 an ounce.

200,Airtasker shares jump after IPO delayed by 'human error'; ASX slips as Wall St tech rebounds,markets,"  Airtasker shares jump after IPO delayed by 'human error'; ASX slips as Wall Street tech rebounds Australian shares got off to a decent start on Tuesday morning, but turned negative towards the end of the day as heavyweight financial stocks dragged the market lower. The ASX 200 index finished trading 7 points lower (-0.1pc) at 6,745 points. The Australian dollar was sharply lower (-0.7pc) at 76.87 US cents. Export-reliant healthcare stocks were among the best performers, like Sonic Healthcare (+3.5pc), Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals (+2.5pc), Resmed (+3.3pc) and Healius (+1.7pc). Shares in AGL Energy jumped (+5.1pc) after the company said it lodged a planning application for a 200 megawatt grid-scale battery at Loy Yang power station in Victoria's Latrobe Valley. AGL said the project was part of its target for developing 850 megawatts of grid-scale batteries in Australia by 2024. On the flip side, energy, shopping centres and travel stocks suffered heavy losses, including Unibail Rodamco Westfield (-4.3pc), Flight Centre (-4.2pc), Webjet (-3.4pc) and Corporate Travel Management (-3.9pc), Qantas (-2.3pc) and Santos (-2pc). Technology and financial stocks were also a drag, including Afterpay (-2.2pc), Bendigo and Adelaide Bank (-1.4pc), AMP (-1.4pc), ANZ (-1.3pc) and Westpac (-0.9pc). Shares in Airtasker surged 78.5 cent in morning trade, as the company made its debut on the Australian stock market one day later than it had hoped for. Airtasker, which connects customers to workers for a range of common tasks from cleaning to gardening, was slated to go public on Monday. Crown Casino is facing political inquiries, share price falls and probes, Nassim Khadem explains. However, the listing was delayed due to ""human error"" on the part of the ASX. This was because market participants had not been informed about the stock admission and trading debut date by the normal cut-off time (which should have been Friday), the exchange operator said on Monday. ""ASX has apologised to Airtasker, regrets the disruption and has taken steps to address this as quickly as possible,"" the spokesman said, adding that the ASX's chief executive spoke to his counterpart at Airtasker and the company was informed throughout. The delay put ASX in hot water again after an outage in November wiped nearly an entire trading session, raised questions over its technology and prompted the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) to launch an independent probe. Airtasker shares were issued at 65 cents each, in an initial public offering (IPO) that raised $83.7 million. It climbed as high as $1.16 within the first few minutes, giving it a market value of $455.8 million. By the end, Airtasker's stock closed at $1.05, which was still a 61.5 per cent gain. Exactly one year ago, the Australian market had reached the lowest point of its coronavirus panic sell-off (at 4,546 points). By then, the ASX 200 had plunged 37 per cent from its record high (which it reached a month earlier). It turned out to be the shortest bear market in history, as the ASX has since surged (+49pc) to its highest level in around 12 months. The ASX tech sector was the biggest winner (+130pc), while banks (+7pc), energy (+70pc) and materials (+60pc) have also recovered sharply from their lows. In contrast, US, Indian and German markets have skyrocketed to their highest levels ever, in spite of the economic turmoil caused by the pandemic. A third wave of COVID-19 across Europe due to highly contagious coronavirus variants is boosting concerns about another round of economic restrictions, with Paris going into a four-week lockdown late last week. ""The number of new COVID-19 cases is rising rapidly, and an extension of the lockdown [is] inevitable for many European countries,"" said Milan Cutkovic, market analyst at Axi. ""No-one will be surprised by such a decision. The question is whether investors will remain calm amid the increasing uncertainty. ""If the vaccination campaign would be running successfully, it would be much easier for market participants to ignore the sharp uptick in new cases."" In Europe, Britain's FTSE and Germany's DAX both gained 0.3 per cent overnight. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones index closed 103 points higher (+0.3pc) at 32,731. The benchmark S&P 500 rose (+0.7pc) to 3,941. The tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped (+1.2pc) to 13,378 points. The record-breaking market frenzy will come to an ""abrupt halt"", with some experts saying a correction may be around the corner. This was after the return on America's 10-year government bonds dipped to 1.688 per cent (from a near 14-month high). Tesla shares jumped after a fund run by an influential investor in the electric-car maker said its shares could approach $US3,000 by 2025. Its shares climbed (+2.3pc) to $US670, making it the fourth-largest boost to the S&P 500 after Ark Invest, founded by star stock-picker Cathie Wood, raised the company's price target on Friday. Heavyweight tech companies were sold off last week. That was after a surge in bond yields, in recent weeks, caused investors to flee from stocks that might appear overvalued if central banks were to lift interest rates sooner than expected. ""The market is trying to digest what's going on in the bond market,"" said Jake Wujastyk, chief market analyst and founding member of TrendSpider. ""The technology stocks are pretty beaten down and it's not shocking to see those rebounding a little bit from their lows."" A host of US Federal Reserve officials speak this week, including three appearances by chair Jerome Powell, providing plenty of opportunity for more volatility in markets. Oil prices steadied after a broad sell-off last week as market players remained confident demand would rebound later in the year, despite European coronavirus lockdowns dimming hopes for a quick economic recovery. West Texas crude had risen slightly (+0.1pc) to $US61.47 a barrel, while Brent crude was down (-0.3pc) to $US64.31 a barrel. Spot gold had slipped (-0.3pc) to $US1,739 an ounce.

201,"ASX falls as snap lockdowns hurt retail, oil prices slip and Afterpay drops",markets,"  ASX slips as Afterpay drops again, retail figures disappoint Snap lockdowns in various states hurt retailers in February, with data showing people shopped less that month than in January. The ABS data showed retail spending fell 1.1 per cent in February compared with the month before. That is despite forecasts that spending would rise. The falls were led by Victoria (-4pc) and Western Australia (-6pc). Both states saw COVID-19 lockdown restrictions during February. Australians notably spent less at food retailers that month, which corresponds with pandemic restrictions on hospitality. However, overall retail spending last month was 8.7 per cent higher than it was in February 2020. The data came after a mixed week for the Australian share market. Unemployment data on Thursday showed a surprising large decrease in unemployment, taking Australia within reach of pre-COVID levels. By the close of trade, the ASX 200 was down 0.6 per cent on the day to 6,708. It was also slightly down over the week, starting Monday at 6,767. Despite the subdued retail figures, one of the best performers on the ASX 200 on Friday afternoon was retailer Harvey Norman with a gain of 3.6 per cent. Rival JB Hi-Fi was up 1.8 per cent and even struggling department store Myer jumped 6.4 per cent, on hopes that retail outside of the food sector had continued its buoyant run. Car seller Eagers Automotive also had a strong day, up 3.4 per cent. Gold miners and energy stocks dominated the list of worst performers. Silver Lake Resources dropped 4.4 per cent, Perseus Mining 4 per cent and Newcrest 3.4 per cent, with gold trading at $US1,733 an ounce by 4:45pm AEDT. The price of Brent crude has been dropping all week on a lower US dollar and fears renewed COVID-19 outbreaks will derail the global economic recovery. New York analyst John Kilduff said oil prices have partially been responding to the worsening COVID outbreaks in Europe. ""Everyone was celebrating the vaccine rollout and reduced restrictions,"" he said. ""Now in Europe, it's gone off the rails almost completely. Lockdowns in Poland and Italy strike at the heart of this whole demand recovery narrative and thesis that pumped up prices."" Australia's biggest energy producer, Woodside, led the slump with a 3.25 per cent slide. Buy now, pay later platform Afterpay lost 2.7 per cent today to $108.30, following a 1.7 per cent on Thursday, after news that the Commonwealth Bank is going to challenge it with another BNPL product. CBA became the nation's first major lender to announce its own BNPL service on Wednesday. Its version will do credit checks, unlike Afterpay. Analysts at UBS, which already had a low price target on Afterpay, reaffirmed their forecast that it could lose around two-thirds of its market value over the next year, with a price target of just $36. Its rival Zip was also down 2.1 per cent at $8.29. The US dollar's rise is also contributing to the oil sell-off. A stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for holders of other currencies to buy. The Australian dollar traded down (-0.5pc) against the greenback overnight, after the US currency rose on higher Treasury yields. The Australian dollar was worth 77.46 US cents by 4:50pm AEDT. The yield, or interest rate, on the US 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.75 per cent for the first time in 14 months, even after the nation's central bank pledged to look past inflation and keep interest rates near zero until at least 2023. The jump in yields accelerated a move out of growth stocks with the tech-heavy Nasdaq falling 3 per cent. It was the Nasdaq's steepest one-day drop since late February. After reaching record highs during the week, the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 also ended down. The energy heavy S&P 500 was also hit by falling oil prices. Despite the COVID woes in some European countries, all major markets there ended Thursday higher. The German share market's DAX index actually hit a record high. It was buoyed by car manufacturer Volkswagen, which rose 6 per cent to become the most valuable company on the DAX. Its shares have gained a staggering 41 per cent this week, and are on course to record the biggest weekly gain ever after it stepped up its switch to fully electric vehicles. Taking on Tesla, the German brand wants to deliver more than 450,000 electric cars this year. Volkswagen is targeting 1 million electric vehicle deliveries for the wider group.

The ASX 200 closed 0.7 per cent down. The benchmark also closed down (-0.5pc) on Wednesday. The latest ABS jobs figures showed Australia's unemployment rate fell to 5.8 per cent in February, down from 6.3 per cent. That was far beyond CBA analyst predictions this morning that the unemployment rate would just fall marginally to 6.2 per cent. An extra 88,000 people found employment last month, pushing the number of Australians with jobs above 13 million. The underemployment rate — referring to people with jobs who would like more hours — rose from 8.1 per cent to 8.5 per cent. Good performers on the ASX included gold stocks, following a rise in the spot price globally. Silver Lake was the day's best performer with a gain of 8 per cent, followed by Ramelius (+7.9pc), Gold Road Resources (+7.3pc) and Westgold (+4.4pc). Tech and communications stocks took a hit, including Nine Entertainment (-3.4pc), News Corp (-3pc) and Next DC (-3.4pc). Afterpay's stock is down 1.7 per cent, following news that Commonwealth Bank is going to challenge it with another buy-now, pay-later product. CBA became the nation's first major lender to offer its own BNPL service on Wednesday. The biggest drag on the ASX 200 on Thursday was a New Zealand company listed on the Australian share market that supplies digital and telecommunications there. Spark ended the day down 3.5 per cent. That comes as data shows New Zealand's economy isn't faring as well as expected. GDP fell 1 per cent in the three months to December, coming in short of economists' forecasts. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected production-based GDP growth of 0.1 per cent. It was also below the forecast of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which had pencilled in flat growth for the period. Capital Economics economist Ben Udy said a New Zealand recession was imminent, with the country's economy unlikely to rebound in the next quarter. ""GDP is set to decline again in the first quarter of this year. Electronic card transactions fell in January and February,"" he said. ""And the week-long lockdown in Auckland in March means a decline in consumption is all but confirmed. Similarly, the New Zealand activity index eased in both January and February. ""We now think the border may remain closed until the end of the year, which will ensure that trade remains a drag on GDP growth."" The NZ dollar is lower against the data, pushing the Australian dollar slightly higher (+0.1pc) higher against it. Overall, the NZ 50 is down 0.4 per cent in afternoon trade (local time). US stocks again reached another high after its Federal Reserve released a less downcast statement about the nation's economy than expected. ""The committee did note that indicators of activity and employment had turned higher recently,"" CBA analysts said this morning in a briefing. ""Nevertheless, the statement retained that the ongoing health crisis continues to pose 'considerable risks to the economic outlook' and that current levels of policy accommodation remain appropriate."" The regulator has left the target interest rate at 0.00 to 0.25 per cent. The Dow Jones rose 0.6 per cent to end at 33,015 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.3 per cent to 3,974. Both of these are all time highs. The Nasdaq reached climbed 0.4 per cent to 13,525 points, which is still down from it February high. Following the Fed's statement, the yield on 10-year Treasuries ticked lower to 1.6374 per cent. The US dollar also fell.

203,Boss of currency trader with 'Wolf of Wall Street' culture banned for a decade,markets,"  ASIC bans Forex Capital Trading director Shlomo Yoshai for 10 years after reports of 'Wolf of Wall Street' culture The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has handed lengthy bans to the director and former employees of an online foreign currency trader, whose culture insiders likened to something out of The Wolf of Wall Street. The activities of the foreign exchange broker, Forex Capital Trading (ForexCT), were first revealed by the ABC in 2019. Former clients said they had been harassed and pressured into losing hundreds of thousands of dollars by employees of the broker. On Wednesday afternoon, ASIC announced ForexCT director and chief executive Shlomo Yoshai had been banned for 10 years from offering financial services. ""ASIC found Mr Yoshai's lack of understanding or regard for compliance was so serious it justified the making of the banning period for such a significant period, particularly given he was someone who oversaw the operations of ForexCT,"" the regulator said in a statement. In its statement, ASIC said Mr Yoshai was ""involved"" in ForexCT's trading floor culture, which former account managers likened to The Wolf of Wall Street. ""A bell or a gong was rung when clients deposited funds of certain amounts into their trading accounts and account managers could participate in incentive 'games' such as 'wheel of fortune', roulette tables and dice games to win cash if certain client deposit targets were met,"" ASIC said. ASIC said Mr Yoshai put pressure on ForexCT account managers to use high-pressure sales tactics on clients, offer incentives to clients to deposit money, recommend trading strategies that would increase clients' exposure and pressure clients to delay or cancel withdrawal of funds. The ABC's attempts to contact Mr Yoshai and his lawyer were unsuccessful. Five former employees of the broker were banned for between three and six years. Among the allegations, ASIC alleged employees told clients that they did not benefit from the client depositing money, when, in fact, they were paid a commission based on client deposits. No system is 100 per cent secure, but Signal can be used to protect your identity by using end-to-end encryption. Please read the terms and conditions to work out the best method of communication for you. In May last year, ASIC cancelled ForexCT's financial services licence after finding it had engaged in ""unconscionable conduct, misleading and deceptive conduct and a failure to manage conflicts of interest"". ""ASIC's investigation also found that ForexCT lacked sound ethical values and judgement in dealing with clients, failed to ensure its representatives were adequately trained and complied with financial services laws and failed to ensure that financial services covered by its licence were provided efficiently, honestly and fairly,"" ASIC said. ASIC has also commenced civil litigation against the company and Mr Yoshai. A series of ABC stories revealed significant concerns about the lack of regulation and oversight of the massive foreign exchange brokerage industry. Forex trading is a highly complex and risky form of investment, which experts say is actually more akin to gambling. It involves pitting one currency against the other in a series of micro-trades. If the exchange rate goes up in favour of the currency you have backed, you make a profit. The constantly fluctuating nature of foreign exchange rates makes it a highly volatile form of trading. Many companies hold licences granted by ASIC but are headquartered in offshore jurisdictions. Forex's booming popularity has led to governments around the world cracking down and, in some cases, banning forex trading altogether. While allowed in Australia, ASIC warns forex trading ""requires a huge amount of knowledge, research and monitoring"", because currency markets are highly unpredictable and can be affected by so many factors.

204,"UBS tips 68pc Afterpay slump as CBA launches buy now, pay later product; ASX falls",markets,"  Afterpay rallies and Zip shares slide on CBA buy now, pay later threat; ASX falls Afterpay shares have rallied, even though some leading analysts have warned the company is 68 per cent overvalued and is now facing a buy now, pay later threat from Australia's biggest bank. The Commonwealth Bank has announced its own in-house buy now, pay later (BNPL) product for its account holders. Already partnered with, and a part owner of, Swedish BNPL firm Klarna, this is a separate offering for CBA account holders with a regular salary that is deposited into their account at the bank and who meet the eligibility criteria. Customers will be able to pay off transactions between $100 and $1,000 in four fortnightly instalments. In a direct challenge to Afterpay, CBA said it would not charge businesses additional costs beyond its standard merchant service fees, and the service would be available anywhere Mastercard was accepted. CBA said there would be no ongoing fees, although there would be a $10 charge per missed instalment repayment, and other account fees may apply. The bank said the service would not be available for cash advances or gambling, and would start in the middle of the year. The announcement initially dented the share prices of Australia's current leading BNPL providers, Afterpay and Zip, as analysts warned of the competitive and regulatory risks CBA's move would pose. UBS analyst Tom Beadle warned that Afterpay's high merchant fees — its main source of income — would be challenged by CBA's much cheaper offering to retailers. ""The lucrative economics of BNPL (particularly in APT's case), given its enormous success to date, will attract competition,"" he noted. ""With credit interchange [costs] being sub-1 per cent, the merchant fees and overall systemic cost of CBA's offering are a fraction of APT's (APT's merchant fees range from around 3-7 per cent)."" Buy now pay later companies promise low-risk convenience for customers and high returns for shareholders. But can everyone really be a winner? UBS cautioned that the rules preventing merchants from passing on BNPL surcharges may soon be changed, to the detriment of Afterpay and, to a lesser extent, Zip. The threat of competition and regulatory changes are key factors in UBS's $36 price target on Afterpay, around 68 per cent below its closing share price yesterday. Not that the dire forecast worried investors. After an initial dip, Afterpay shares ended today's trading 1.2 per cent higher at $112. Zip, however, swung from one of the day's best performers before CBA's press release, to close 1.8 per cent down at $8.59 afterwards. Elsewhere on the market, the benchmark ASX 200 index closed down 0.5 per cent at 6,795, having been off by around 1 per cent earlier in the session, while the broader All Ordinaries index ended 0.4 per cent lower at 7,048. Mining and energy stocks led the decline. The basic materials sector, which covers miners, was off 1.4 per cent overall, with big players BHP (-1.6pc) and Rio Tinto (-1pc) falling, and others such as South32 (-2.9pc) being hit harder. Energy stocks were off 1 per cent on the third straight day of falling oil prices. Australia's biggest player, Woodside, was down 0.9 per cent, while Papua New Guinea-focused Oil Search was off 2.5 per cent as was Origin Energy. PNG is in the midst of a worsening COVID-19 outbreak that has prompted urgent assistance from the Australian government and a ban on workers flying between there and Australia. The ABC understands that Oil Search has less than a hundred fly-in, fly-out workers travelling between Australia and PNG on an eight-week rotation, with quarantine periods at both ends, so its operations have not yet been affected but its rostering will be reviewed in light of the worsening situation. Gold miner Newcrest also has large operations in PNG and told the ABC it is ""working closely"" with the Australian government to understand the details of the travel ban. ""At this stage, gold production at Newcrest's Lihir operations remains unaffected,"" it said in an emailed statement. The company's shares were down 1 per cent, although that was less than many other gold miners. The biggest losers among the top 200 companies were Corporate Travel Management (-5.6pc), chicken producer Inghams Group (-3.9pc) and litigation funder Omni Bridgeway (-3.7pc). The biggest gains were had by Collins Foods (+5.3pc), Uniball-Rodamco-Westfield, which owns overseas shopping centres rather than Westfield's Australian ones, (+4.4pc) and Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals (+3.1pc). Telstra also made a rare appearance in the top 10 gains, rising 2.2 per cent to $3.19. News Corp enjoyed a positive day after striking a news payment deal with Facebook yesterday. Its shares were up 1.5 per cent. The S&P 500 ended lower as investors awaited the result of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting. Interest rates are rising on bond markets as investors fear inflation will take off as the post-COVID recovery gathers steam, and it is hitting tech shares particularly hard. The US stock market lacked direction for much of the day after the S&P and Dow Jones closed at record highs in the prior session, as optimism about a $US1.9 trillion stimulus package and ongoing vaccination drives bolstered views that the economy was on a path to recovery. At the same time, fears about an overheating economy and a recent increase in interest rates have increased scrutiny on the Federal Reserves meeting, where policymakers are likely to raise economic forecasts but repeat their pledge to keep interest rates around record lows for the foreseeable future. Fed policymakers are expected to forecast the US economy will grow in 2021 by the fastest rate in decades as it recovers from a coronavirus-stricken 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down by 0.4 per cent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.2 per cent and the Nasdaq gained 0.1 per cent. The US dollar edged up against Australian and New Zealand dollars, as the wait for the outcome of the two-day US central bank meeting kept trading from being volatile. The Australian dollar was buying around 77.4 US cents. Gold edged lower, pressured by a stronger dollar, while Brent crude dropped 0.8 per cent to $US68.30 a barrel. It was the third day of falls for oil prices after Germany, France and other European countries suspended use of AstraZeneca's vaccine, affecting confidence in the vaccine roll-outs as a pillar for a global economic recovery. However, European stocks rose after an upbeat forecast from German carmaker Volkswagen prompted a rally in the automobile sector. On bond markets, eurozone government bonds held ground as caution set in before the Fed meeting and longer-term US Treasury yields initially dipped before edging higher. Mizuho Securities US chief economist Steven Ricchiuto told Reuters the Fed will do whatever it can to get higher inflation. ""This is what is motivating the sell-off in the 10-year note, and there are a lot of people who are just basically coming around to recognising that,"" Mr Ricchiuto said. The Bank of England also meets this week, on Thursday, and the Bank of Japan wraps up a two-day meeting on Friday.

205,ASX increases after new highs on Wall Street,markets,"  ASX lifts after Wall Street reaches record highs amid upbeat economic outlook from US central bank The Australian share market has made strong gains, after Wall Street hit new highs on hopes of a strong economic recovery despite rising borrowing costs. The All Ordinaries index rose more than 1 per cent at its peak. It finished up 0.9 per cent or 60 points to 7,079. The ASX 200 also rose 0.8 per cent, or 54 points, to 6,827. Most sectors were higher, with education stocks, healthcare, real estate, consumer staples and technology firms leading the way. Medical firm Polynovo (-6.6pc) was the best performer in the benchmark index, followed by real estate investor Charter Hall (+5.5pc) and aerial mapping firm Nearmap (+5.1pc). Online bookmaker Pointsbet (+3.9pc) gained after it bought betting platform provider Banach Technologies through its Irish subsidiary for $US43 million. Miners and energy stocks were the laggards after the price of iron ore and oil fell. Leading the falls on the benchmark index was grocery distributor Metcash (-4pc), as it held its investor day. Metcash said supermarket sales had increased 14.4 per cent, hardware sales rose by nearly one third, and alcohol sales jumped by more than one fifth over the first four months of 2021. BHP (-2.2pc) weighed on the market because of lower iron ore prices and copper miner Sandfire Resources (-1.9pc) also dropped. Disgraced casino operator Crown Resorts said it would cease all political donations. The company admitted during a New South Wales judicial inquiry that it facilitated money laundering at its casinos, and it was deemed unsuitable to hold a casino licence in Sydney. Crown shares rose 0.7 per cent to $10.08. Santos said it would let shareholders case a non binding advisory bote on its climate change report at its annual general meeting next year. Its shares fell 0.8 per cent to $7.29. In the minutes from its policy meeting earlier this month, the Reserve Bank said the termination of the JobKeeper wage subsidy was a source of uncertainty and could see a ""temporary pause in the pace of improvement in the labour market"" as many firms laid off staff ahead of the finish of the coronavirus relief measure at the end of March. ""The end of the JobKeeper program was seen as unlikely to result in a sustained increase in the unemployment rate,"" the minutes said. The central bank also said it would continue to buy Australian government bonds to keep the three-year bond yield low at 0.1 per cent. It said yields on longer term government bonds had ""increased significantly"", which saw the bank step up its purchase of the securities last week to keep borrowing costs low. ""The bank was prepared to make further adjustment to its purchases in response to market conditions,"" the minutes said. It reiterated that the official cash rate would stay at a record low of 0.1 per cent for as long as needed. Commonwealth Bank economist Belinda Allen said the RBA board minutes echoed the sentiments in RBA governor Philip Lowe's ""dovish"" speech last week. ""There is a high hurdle on tightening monetary policy and the RBA will err on the side of letting the Australian economy run before allowing financial conditions to tighten,"" Ms Allen said. The RBA also said that recent increases in commodity prices were unlikely to lead to a sustained rise in inflation unless the employment market tightened significantly. On the back of the dovish tone in the minutes, the big banks rose between 0.4 per cent to 0.9 per cent. The Australian dollar was steady at 77.51 at 4:45pm AEDT. Asian markets also gained ground, with the Nikkei 225 in Japan up 0.5 per cent. News Corporation said it had reached a three-year deal with Facebook in Australia to provide news on the social media platform. A law passed last month in Australia requires Google and Facebook to pay for news content. But Facebook forced changes to the law after it blocked all Australian news content on the platform. The agreement involves The Australian newspaper and metropolitan papers including Sydney's Daily Telegraph, Melbourne's Herald Sun, and Brisbane's Courier Mail. News Corp also said Sky News Australia had reached a deal with Facebook. The agreement follows a deal reached in late 2019 where Facebook pays News Corp publications in the US for the use of additional stories for Facebook News. News Corp has now signed agreements with Facebook, Google and Apple to provide access to journalism and related content. In a statement, the company blew its own trumpet, saying executive chairman Rupert Murdoch, co-chairman Lachlan Murdoch and chief executive Robert Thompson ""have championed the cause of the tech platforms compensating news publications for content for many years"". ""The agreement with Facebook is a landmark in transforming the terms of trade for journalism, and will have a material and meaningful impact on our Australian news businesses,"" Mr Thomson said. ""Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch led a global debate while others in our industry were silent or supine as digital dysfunctionality threatened to turn journalism into a mendicant order."" News Corp shares rose 0.7 per cent on the ASX to $31.81. Iron ore futures extended their recent falls as traders remained concerned that China will continue to crack down on steel mills violating pollution curbs, according to Commonwealth Bank commodities analyst Vivek Dhar. ""Authorities in Tangshan said they will launch widespread checks of steel mills to improve compliance with recent measures to curb steel output,"" Mr Dhar said. ""This took on extra meaning after Beijing was hit by a sandstorm which saw air quality drop dramatically."" Benchmark iron ore prices were steady at $US159.95 a tonne. West Texas crude oil dropped 0.7 per cent to $US64.95 a barrel, while Brent crude lost 0.8 per cent, to $US68.36 a barrel at 4:45pm AEDT. Spot gold rose 0.2 per cent to $US1735.69 an ounce at 1:20pm AEDT. Bitcoin fell from its record high of more than $US60,000 to $US53,896 as India considered a ban. US stocks reached record highs after a slow start with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 hitting all-time highs as investors await the latest meeting of the US Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 was bolstered by IT giant Apple. Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways said leisure bookings had increased and offered some of the first concrete signs that the worst may be over for the airline industry. The S&P 1500 airlines index jumped more than 3 per cent to a one-year high, while other travel-related stocks, including Carnival Corp, Wynn Resorts and MGM Resorts gained between 2 per cent and 5 per cent. The major stock indexes on Friday logged their best week in six weeks after approval of a $US1.9 trillion aid bill and mass vaccinations accelerated demand for stocks expected to outperform as the economy reopens, such as banks, energy, materials companies. ""With the vaccine positive news and the stimulus, we think there will continue to be a fair amount of rotation out of the stay-at-home stocks,"" said Greg Bassuk, chief executive of AXS Investments. ""We are bullish on financial services and energy coming out of the pandemic."" The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasuries ticked lower to 1.60 per cent, below its 13-month peak of 1.64 per cent on Friday. Wall Street has been roiled in recent weeks by a spike in US bond yields because of fears of an increase in inflation. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.5 per cent to 32,953, the S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 3,969, and the Nasdaq Composite put on 1 per cent to 13,460 Tesla rose 2 per cent after the company added ""Technoking of Tesla"" to chief executive Elon Musk's list of official titles in a formal regulatory filing. Eli Lilly and Co shares slumped 9.1 per cent after a mid-stage trial testing its experimental Alzheimer's drug led to ""mixed"" results, reducing the chances for the drug's accelerated approval, according to analysts. Major European stock markets ended in the red. The FTSE 100 index in London fell 0.2 per cent to 6,750, the DAX in Germany fell 0.3 per cent to 14,461, and the CAC 40 in Paris fell 0.2 per cent to 6,036. Federal Reserve policymakers are expected this week to forecast that the US economy will grow in 2021 at the fastest rate in decades, with unemployment falling and inflation rising, as the COVID-19 vaccination campaign gathers pace and a $US1.9 trillion ($2.5 trillion) relief package washes through to households. But investors who expect rosier projections to translate to any change in monetary policy when the US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee ends its two-day meeting later this week will likely be disappointed.

206,Amateur investors like Sue have made huge returns in a 'bizarre' market that's left the professionals perplexed,markets,"  Exactly one year ago, Sue Park decided it was a great time to buy shares for the first time ever. That was despite the world facing its worst health crisis in more than 100 years. It was also when the Australian market had suffered its worst trading day since the 1987 crash. Basically, a flood of panicked investors hit the ""sell"" button at the same time on March 16, 2020. They finally decided that COVID-19 was a serious problem that wouldn't ""disappear"" any time soon (despite US president Donald Trump's insistence at the time). That caused the market to wipe out all its gains from the past four years (in a single day). The ASX 200 plunged 9.7 per cent, which worked out to be $160 billion. Newspapers were using terms like ""bloodbath"", ""mayhem"" and ""carnage"" to describe the extent of fear being felt across every share market in the world. Luckily for Ms Park, who manages a cafe in Sydney's inner west (among four other part-time jobs), the market didn't have much further to drop, in hindsight. ""My housemate works in finance, and he said it was a great idea to start investing now,"" she said. ""I heard that even if you lose everything in the share market, that's not the worst thing to worry about given the world is collapsing."" She wanted to invest as ethically as possible but didn't want to be ""bogged down by research"". So Ms Park decided to buy shares in banks, the hard-hit travel sector, telcos and buy-now, pay-later (BNPL) companies. But she refused to buy oil and alcohol stocks as she considers them to be ""very obviously evil"". It's fair to say the fledgling investor has made a killing on the market. Ms Park said her investments had skyrocketed (by more than 50 per cent) since then — far better than how most professional investors did. Many economists have called the global coronavirus recession the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression (in the 1930s). But nobody could have predicted what happened next — particularly given the extreme uncertainty, rapidly escalating death toll, and unprecedented mass lockdowns (domestically and across international borders). Just a month earlier, massive bouts of investor exuberance had pushed the Australian market to a record high of 7,197 points (on February 20). The next few weeks turned out to be a see-saw of erratic trading behaviour: It may not generally involve a printing press, but the RBA has been busy creating billions of dollars out of thin air. David Taylor explains how it does it. After all, governments across the world had pumped stimulus worth trillions of dollars into the economy (in the form of employment subsidies like JobKeeper and JobSeeker, along with infrastructure spending). Central banks also took drastic measures by slashing interest rates to zero (or even further into negative territory). Australia's Reserve Bank went into uncharted territory when it decided to buy $200 billion worth of government bonds. It's also known as quantitative easing, or digital ""money printing"". Analysts say the market enthusiasm can be summed up by optimism that COVID vaccines will save the day — as well as two acronyms. One of them is FOMO (fear of missing out), since a lot of people had noticed their friends making easy a lot of easy money from the flood of cheap money in the market. The other is TINA (there is no alternative). With interest rates at record lows, many investors feel there is no point holding their cash in savings accounts — so they may as well punt on the share market for any chance of earning a return. Since its pandemic-trough on March 23, the Australian market has rebounded sharply by 49 per cent (from its low point of 4,546 points). It has done better than other markets (particularly the UK, which is up by a third). But the ASX pales in comparison to the Dow Jones, which has surged by 76 per cent (to its highest level ever). The US market has been driven, in particular, by a record $5.1 trillion worth of stimulus, which amounts to 23 per cent of America's GDP over two years, according to data from AMP Capital. No market index has performed better than the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which has practically doubled since late March. That was primarily due to insatiable demand for ""stay at home winners"" like Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, Microsoft and Zoom as locked-down consumers were increasingly forced to shop and communicate with each other online. Even veteran fund managers like Geoff Wilson (who has been in the game for more than 40 years) were perplexed by the huge disconnect between the market optimism and economic turmoil. ""We were of the view that the bear market would last longer than it actually did,"" Mr Wilson told the ABC. Interest rates are rising on bond markets as investors fear inflation will take off as the post-COVID recovery gathers steam, and it is hitting tech shares particularly hard. ""After the longest bull market ever in the US, you'd assume the bear market would have lasted longer. But to have the shortest bear market ever was quite bizarre."" In January last year, Mr Wilson felt the market was getting incredibly ""frothy"", so he sold a large chunk of his shares — which lifted his cash holdings to around 25 per cent (when the RBA's overnight interest rate was around 0.75 per cent). It turned out to be a wise choice as he got out of some investments before their market value tanked in the COVID sell-off. He said that at the height of the pandemic one of his funds (WAM Capital) moved to ""43 per cent cash very quickly"". But given the stronger than expected rebound (in the economy and share market), his fund went on a shopping spree to buy shares at distressed prices. Now his Capital fund is holding just 2 to 3 per cent of its assets in cash. ""What worries me is that a lot of retail investors have been investing in this market ... and whether they'll be nimble to get out before there's a significant adjustment,"" he said. ""It's very hard to pick when the top is, and there's no doubt there are excessive signs."" Another star investor, Hamish Douglass, is also worried things might end badly for some investors caught up in the ""speculative frenzy"". ""These things tend to come to an abrupt halt, but they can go on for very long periods of time,"" said Mr Douglass, the chairman and founder of Magellan Financial. ""There will be major corrections in some of the most speculative ends of the market."" He also explained the risks of not ""cashing out"" soon enough (for certain assets) by paraphrasing some useful advice from America's legendary stock picker Warren Buffett — which was delivered back in 2000, when the dot-com bubble burst. ""Like Cinderella at the ball, everyone knows they got to leave the party at one minute before midnight — or they'll turn into pumpkin and mice,"" he said. ""The only problem with some of these assets at the moment is there are no clocks on the walls."" As that old saying goes, ""hindsight is 20/20"". Here are the stocks that would've helped you get rich quickly (in the rear-view mirror) — if you bought them at the COVID low point and sold them earlier this week: Source: Bloomberg Some of them, especially the technology and BNPL stocks like Afterpay and Zip, have ""sky high"" valuations (another way of saying ""expensive"" or borderline ""overvalued""). That's despite the fact they don't earn a profit or pay dividends, but investors are betting on their future profitability. One way to measure the attractiveness of a stock is to calculate its price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. So generally, the higher the number, the more ""expensive"" the stock is — and if company's share price is low (compared to how much money it earns), then it's better value. ""The interesting thing now is you have so many unprofitable tech companies that you can't even look at them on a PE basis because there are no earnings,"" said Kate Howitt, portfolio manager at Fidelity. Ms Howitt said record low interest rates had contributed to the BNPL ""stretched"" valuations, and they were now largely being assessed by a less onerous measure, ""price to sales"". This metric, she said, had worked well for Google and Amazon — which initially burned enormous amounts of cash to grow their businesses (and didn't earn profits for a long time). That was until their biggest competitors threw in the towel, leaving them to become the giants of their respective industries. ""The fact that you have so many BNPL companies start from nothing in the last couple of years tells you that the barriers to entry are low. ""So it's not clear that these can be a 'winner takes all' segment if they're always contestable. Because if they prove that the [BNPL] category is so large, then there may always be someone who's prepared to burn some cash to usurp them."" One of the biggest threats to the tech rally is the risk of inflation lifting sharply (and quickly), which would force central banks like the RBA to hike interest rates sooner than expected. That is why the markets have been volatile recently, as nervous investors keep a close eye on rising 10-year government bond yields (which are an indicator of where inflation and short-term rates might head). On the flip side, here are the stocks which have performed worst since the March lows: Source: Bloomberg However, some of hardest-hit sectors (oil and travel) have a long way to go before they can recoup all their pandemic losses. Many of them were began to tank in January and February, before the rest of the market got caught in the sell-off. This includes companies like Flight Centre (-54pc), Oil Search (-43pc), Webjet (-41pc), Woodside Petroleum (-29pc), Qantas (-23pc), Santos (-17pc) — which remain far below their peaks in early-2020. Despite the recent volatility, there are some decent opportunities for investors, according to the fund managers that the ABC spoke to. ""Look for companies that aren't the flavour of the month as they'll benefit from pick up in economic activity,"" Mr Wilson said. Central banks around the world have been trying to keep interest rates down at record lows, but some traders have had other ideas. ""Banks have done well more recently. Things have been difficult for retail, but there are positive signs there."" Ms Howitt said her team likes Macquarie Group (for its ""very long-dated role it will play in financing de-carbonisation""), Santos (for its future opportunities in ""developing de-carbonisation technology""), and WiseTech Global (for its ""very strong position in cross-border logistics software""). Meanwhile, Mr Douglass said, utilities had underperformed the market by around 30 per cent, and consumer staples were ""good value"" (not just in Australia, but worldwide). ""Consumer staples are the cheapest pricing they've been in a decade. So there are things going on with quality stocks, though they aren't participating in this frenzy at the moment,"" he said. ""It's often very interesting to go to places where other people aren't."" However, he believes there are two main risks that the market has either ""discounted"" or is ""paying no attention to"". The first is the risk of the coronavirus mutating, which could make existing vaccines not as effective. The Magellan chairman believes there's a chance that economies might ""overheat"", triggering faster rate hikes and a stock market correction. And he used another fairy tale analogy: ""Markets look fantastic, but there's not a lot of margin for error. If things get 'too good' in the economy, that's bad for markets. ""You almost need the Goldilocks situation to continue — not too cold not too hot. A little bit of caution is warranted.""

207,Australian shares reverse course bolstered by Chinese economic data,markets,"  ASX ends higher as China data boosts sentiment, Tilt Renewables get $3 billion takeover bid Australian shares have reversed course and closed higher as China's manufacturing industry rebounded back to health, a year after its coronavirus lockdown. The market got off to a slow start as bond yields rose in the US and in Australia on signs of economic improvement. But by lunchtime, the major indexes had regained lost ground, although trade was volatile. China's industrial output expanded by 35.1 per cent over the first two months of 2021 from the same time a year ago, according to official data. Retail sales rose by 34 per cent from January and February 2020. Fixed asset investment also jumped by 35 per cent over the first two months of this year. The All Ordinaries finished off its highs, but still managed to close above the 7000-point mark. It rose a paltry 0.06 per cent or 5 points to 7,019. The ASX 200 index added 0.1 per cent or 6 points to 6,773, as banks offset falls by miners and technology firms. The day saw 117 stocks rise, 73 stocks fall and 10 unchanged. Just over half of the sectors on the benchmark index increased, with the gains led by education, health care, energy and real estate firms. The top performers in the ASX 200 were investment firm Magellan Financial (+4.9pc), Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals (+4.4pc) and Omni Bridgeway (+4.3pc). Gold stocks were the top gainers. Among the decliners were bathroom and kitchen firm GWA Group (-7.6pc), buy now, pay later darling Afterpay (-4.5pc), and car parts and accessories retailer Eagers Automotive (-4.4pc). GWA will be removed from the ASX 200 next week because of a fall in its value, water, gas and electricity networks company, Service Stream and salmon farmer Tassal Group will also be removed from the benchmark index on March 22. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 put on 0.2 per cent to 29,761. Tilt Renewables surged to a record high after it received a nearly $2.74 billion takeover bid by the renewable energy investment group Powering Australian Renewables (PowAR), which includes including power company AGL Energy, and the Australian and Queensland government investment arms. It added 15 per cent to $7.04. AGL shares came off their highs and closed up 0.1 per cent to $9.84. Tilt investors have accepted the takeover bid with the wind power company's largest shareholders, energy, transport and social infrastructure investor Infratil and electricity firm Mercury, agreeing to the bid. The deal means that PowAR consortium will buy Tilt Renewables' Australian business and Mercury will acquire Tilt Renewables' New Zealand business by a scheme of arrangement. Tilt Renewables shareholders will receive NZ$7.80 per share in cash, almost double its last closing price of $3.92. Tilt said it received multiple takeover offers for the company. ""This compelling acquisition proposal is a result of Tilt Renewables' constant focus on delivering long‐term value for shareholders and the board is pleased that, with these new owners, the transition to renewables in Australia and New Zealand will continue to accelerate,"" Bruce Harker, Tilt Renewables chairman said. Tilt owns windfarms in Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and New Zealand. The PowAR consortium includes AGL, Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC), QGIF, and Australia's sovereign wealth fund, the Future Fund. The group owns the Silverton Wind Farm, the Nyngan Solar Plant and the Broken Hill Solar plant in New South Wales and the Coopers Gap Wind Farm in Queensland. Tilt is listed on both the Australian and New Zealand stock exchanges. Shareholders will get to vote on the takeover offer later this year. Iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group said it will aim to become carbon neutral by 2030 as BHP and Rio Tinto step up their use of renewable energy. The announcement is 10 years ahead of its earlier target. Fortescue said it would focus more on green energy and its Fortescue Future Industries business will develop green electricity, green hydrogen and green ammonia projects in Australia. Green hydrogen is a zero-carbon fuel made by electrolysis, using renewable power from wind and solar to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. ""While our green energy and industry initiatives may one day significantly out scale our iron ore business due to the global demand for renewable energy, our commitment to iron ore and resources globally remains indefeasible,"" FMG chairman Andrew Forrest said. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) welcomed the announcement. ACCR head of climate Dan Gocher praised FMG's target as ""decades ahead"" of the rest of the ASX. ""Fortescue is now firmly leading corporate Australia with this commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2030, without reliance on offsets,"" Mr Gocher said. ""Fortescue's commitment to developing hydrogen for use in shipping, rail and drill rigs, and batteries in haul trucks is a huge step forward."" He urged BHP and Rio Tinto to do the same. But Mr Gocher said Fortescue should also set a target for customers emissions, known as Scope 3 emissions from steel production, ""which is easily the largest part of its carbon footprint."" However, he said Mr Forrest's plans to develop a fossil gas import terminal in NSW, and Squadron Energy's fracking plans were a contradiction. ""If Twiggy wants to be taken seriously on climate, he must abandon any expansion of the fossil gas industry."" FMG shares lost 4.1 per cent to $20.38 on lower iron ore prices in China. BHP (-0.2pc) and Rio (-2.2pc) also declined. BHP inked a deal with HBIS, one of China's largest steelmakers, to invest up to $US15 million in greenhouse gas emission reduction technologies. Woodside Petroleum sold its first carbon offset condensate cargo from Australia. The energy company has targeted net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The oil and gas producer's shares increased 1 per cent to $25.34 on higher oil prices. The Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe said the central bank would continue to keep interest rates low for as long as needed to help the economy recover from the pandemic. The RBA boss told a business function in Melbourne that Australia was doing much better than most other advanced economies, despite a jobless rate of 6.4 per cent. ""This, however, does not hide the fact that we still have a long way to go,"" he said. ""The challenges facing us all are large."" The yield on the Australian 10-year government bond rose 9 points to 1.79 per cent as bonds were sold off amid the governor's speech. By 5.15pm AEDT, the Australian dollar fell 0.5 per cent to around 77.27 US cents. US interest rates rose on Friday as inflation fears returned. Bitcoin rose to a new record high of $US60,000 per digital coin. At 5.15 pm AEDT, it was at $US58,871.58. Spot gold fell 0.2 per cent to $US1,722.71 an ounce. Brent crude oil rose 0.5 per cent to $US69.55 a barrel. There have been a raft of resignations from the equities team at Swiss investment bank UBS. Among the high-profile departures include head of resources research Glynn Lawcock, resources analyst Dan Morgan and small capital stock analyst Josh Kannourakis. They have departed UBS to join Barrenjoey Capital, which was set by former UBS analysts. The Dow Jones index powered to its fifth record closing high in a row, rising by 295 points, or 0.9 per cent, to end at 32,779. The S&P 500 ended slightly higher at 3,943, up 0.1 per cent. But the tech dominated Nasdaq slipped, after rebounding more than 6 per cent over the past three sessions, as rising bond yields reignited inflation fears. It lost 0.6 per cent, or 79 points, to 13,320. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posted their biggest weekly percentage gain since early last month after US President Joe Biden signed into law the massive coronavirus stimulus bill, one of the largest in US history. US government bond yields rose on Friday on forecasts that the US central bank will lift its economic forecasts when it meets later this week.

208,analysis: Why the RBA and the government don't see eye to eye,markets,"  Why the Reserve Bank and the federal government don't see eye to eye on Australia's coronavirus recovery These are unusual times. Despite an economy still in recovery from one of the worst recessions on record with elevated levels of Australians out of work, real estate is booming across the land, and all in the total absence of any immigration. There's just as much confusion in the finance world. Stock markets that for months have been pricing in blue skies and sunny weather forevermore suddenly have been jolted by the concerns of money markets that inflation, which has been dormant for the best part of a decade, could again strangle the economy. Far from jumping in to stop an emerging housing bubble, policymakers are keen to let it run in the vain hope it may kick-start the economy, writes Ian Verrender. The conflicts are playing out at a leadership level too. As the federal government is adamant that stimulus needs to be wound back, to allow the private sector to take over in the recovery, the Reserve Bank (RBA) is doubling down, arguing that it will be years before Australia can wean itself off the emergency interest rates that have sunk to zero. That tussle dramatically ramped up last week with one of the most significant addresses ever delivered by a Reserve Bank governor; a speech that highlighted just how far short we are in our goal to get the economy back on track. As ever, though, most of it was lost in the noise on housing and the lurking danger that banks again will begin to shovel as much cash as possible into a roaring real estate market. Central banks love gradually rising asset markets. Slow and steady lifts in real estate and shares add to confidence in the economy and help boost spending as people feel richer. Sudden and sustained bursts, on the other hand, are cause for serious concern. With more people continuing work-from-home arrangements in the wake of COVID-19, demand for regional property is soaring. There was no let-up on the weekend. Real estate auction clearance rates surged to 83 per cent nationally with extraordinary activity in the two biggest markets with Sydney at 87 per cent and Melbourne at 80 per cent. It's a boom fuelled by ultra-low interest rates, a surge in demand from first home buyers and banks actively competing for new business. Almost as soon as new properties are listed, they are snapped up, leaving the market short of stock. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, first home buyer commitments in January surged to their highest level in 12 years and the pace appears to be accelerating. That prompted the RBA boss Philip Lowe to last week fire a warning shot. Interest rates, he said, would remain low for at least three years. That's how long it will take to get back to square one. But there were other measures regulators could embark upon to take the heat out of the housing market. ""There are various tools, other than higher interest rates, to address these concerns, leaving monetary policy to maintain its strong focus on the recovery in the economy, jobs and wages,"" he said. Essentially, the RBA and the banking regulator APRA would simply make it harder for borrowers to obtain a loan, thereby putting a handbrake on prices. Then he brought down the hammer. The Council of Financial Regulators, which he chairs, would act swiftly to rein in the banks if lending standards ever deteriorated and put the financial system at risk. ""We are not at this point, but we are watching carefully,"" he said. That puts the RBA governor on a potential collision course with the federal government. Ever since Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg last year announced the winding back of responsible lending laws, consumer groups have been up in arms, warning that Australia quickly would see a resumption of the type of predatory lending that precipitated a royal commission. The Federal Government's proposal to remove responsible lending rules from most types of loan is not only negative for consumers, but also potentially for the economy, writes Michael Janda. The federal government, on the other hand, has insisted that the banking regulator's existing lending standards and the Banking Code of Practice provided sufficient protection for borrowers. Privately, many senior bankers expressed surprise at the changes, particularly as they were mooted so soon after the royal commission and its damning findings. But all welcomed them, especially given the fears that permeated the housing market as the global economy plunged into recession. Many had expected a property price plunge of 20 per cent or more last year as the pandemic induced recession gripped the nation. To make matters worse, credit growth already had slowed as the banks all paid extra attention to the responsible lending laws which had not been properly enforced for years. Part of the rationale for winding back the laws — introduced by Labor in 2010 in the wake of the global financial crisis — was that economic conditions had changed and the laws were hindering the supply of credit. Clearly, with new lending for housing up 44 per cent in January from that of a year ago, that's no longer the case. And that puts the onus onto the RBA to try and rein in that extra cash. For the past three weeks, central banks globally have been on the back foot. Money market traders have adopted a vigilante-type assault on their policies, forcing interest rates higher. While central banks have been wading into bond markets and buying up government debt in an effort to keep interest rates — short, medium and long-term — on the floor, bond market investors have been doing the opposite. They've been dumping government bonds across the globe, forcing rates higher, causing one of the greatest upheavals in bond market trading in decades. It may not generally involve a printing press, but the RBA has been busy creating billions of dollars out of thin air. David Taylor explains how it does it. The RBA is only a recent convert to the practice of money printing. Having taken the plunge last year, it's now committing to what appears to an indefinite program. It's about to embark on its second round and a third clearly is on the cards. Why? Because it believes our jobless rate is way too high. And, more significantly, it has abandoned the long-held belief that an unemployment rate of 5 per cent is the sweet spot; that anything below that causes inflation as firms are forced to compete for workers by raising wages. The RBA now believes that rate is around 4 per cent and possibly even lower, explaining why wages have been flatlining for years. Right now, the jobless rate is sitting at 6.4 per cent. To muscle the unemployment rate down that far will require a huge effort. That's why it is adamant that it will not raise interest rates for years. There's nothing Phil Lowe would love more than a wages breakout to light a fire under inflation, an idea that doesn't quite resonate with the government. Even before the coronavirus swept through the global economy last year, the RBA had been forced to cut interest rates on several occasions. Economic growth was sluggish, inflation had failed to reach the 2.5 per cent target for four years and wages growth was at record lows. It repeatedly had called on federal and state governments to start doing their bit; that the job of firing up the economy couldn't be left solely to the Reserve Bank and they needed to spend up on big-ticket infrastructure programs. We may be bouncing out of recession. But those old problems are about to resurface. The centrepiece of the federal government's economic rescue package winds up in a fortnight. At around $60 billion, JobKeeper wasn't cheap. But it worked and it kept millions of Australians tied to their employer during the darkest days of the recession. After last week's targeted help to tourism, or Qantas more particularly, it is clear the federal government is determined to end the assistance. Corporate Australia, it says, now must take the running. But will it? Business investment has been weak for years and the most recent national accounts show it was a drag on growth. That's despite a far better than expected half-year earnings season which delivered record profits and windfall dividends to shareholders. Once again, employees are missing out on the earnings action, part of a decades-long trend across the developed world. The problem is that, as central bankers now are only too aware, the less workers are paid, the less they spend. And the less they spend, the slower the economy grows. With the federal government now withdrawing so it can focus on slashing its debt and deficit, that puts all the onus on the RBA. And with interest rates at 0.1 per cent, it will need to become a lot more creative if it wants to engineer a sustained recovery. Negative interest rates anyone?

209,ASX and Australian dollar up; Southern Cross loses 10.4pc after being dumped by Nine,markets,"  AUD rises against the greenback; ASX gains and Nine dumps Southern Cross for WIN The Australian share market has ended the week higher, with the local currency also continuing to rise against the greenback. By the close, the ASX 200 was up 0.8 per cent to 6,767. After a mixed week, that is higher than what the benchmark opened on Monday. The local market's positive mood follows another record-breaking day on Wall Street. The S&P 500 and the Dow hit all-time highs on Thursday (local time). Some of the winners this afternoon included Oz Minerals (+6pc), Kogan (+5.6pc), Mineral Resources (+5.4pc) and Lynas (5.3pc). Afterpay continued its rocky ride. It has been up and down all week, and was rocked by news that US fintech PayPal is going to challenge it in Australia with another buy-now-pay-later option. After losing 3.7 per cent on Thursday, Afterpay was up again with a gain of 2.2 per cent. After gaining 8.7 per cent yesterday on news the federal government is subsidising cheap plane tickets, Flight Centre has lost some of its gain today, with a loss of 4.1 per cent after its chief executive warned that it did not expect to gain significantly from the discounted flights. Nine Entertainment has announced it is dumping broadcaster Southern Cross Austereo in favour of its old affiliate WIN. Nine, which also now owns the former Fairfax newspaper stable, used to be in a broadcasting affiliation with the regional television network, WIN, but dumped it in 2016 after disagreements about live streaming. After five years with SCA, Nine told the ASX it would go back to WIN from July, and that this would boost Nine's presence in regional television markets across Australia. ""This is the right time for us to return to WIN,"" Nine's chief executive Hugh Marks said. In a note to staff, he also said some roles would be affected. Nine already shed some regional broadcaster jobs during COVID. Nine's stock eased 1 per cent to $3, while Southern Cross slumped 10.4 per cent on the news. WIN is not listed. Meanwhile, Australian bottler Coca-Cola Amatil told the ASX it had received court approval to set a date for shareholders to vote on it being sold to its European counterpart. The date for the sell-off vote is April 16. CCA's shareprice was up 0.1 per cent. As US investors feel less concerned about rising inflation, its dollar continued to drop for the third day in a row. Figures show lower-than-expected inflation in the US helped stabilise Treasury yields and lift world equities markets to their highest in more than a week. Early on Friday morning, the Australian dollar was up 0.7 per cent against the greenback, pushing it within reach of 78 US cents. ANZ analysts said the local currency was trading higher against the US dollar because the greenback was simply weaker. ""Higher iron ore prices after a period of weakness likely added to AUD support,"" they said. ""Iron ore prices fell recently after the steel‑producing hub of Tangshan in China announced they 'will initiate Level II emergency response to heavy pollution weather'. ""In our view, commodity prices [including iron ore] will remain elevated this year and can support a move in AUD above 0.80. ""However, carbon border adjustment fees are a growing downside risk to AUD over the medium term."" Apart from the inflation data, there were several other positive notes for investors this week in the US, including lower than expected claims for unemployment welfare and the signing of US President Joe Biden's stimulus bill. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 both hit new highs several times this week. Some analysts cannot pin these latest records on anything in particular. ""There is no blindingly obvious catalyst for this latest run-up,"" NAB analysts said. ""Approval of the Biden administration's $US1.9 trillion COVID relief plan (about to be signed into laws) was surely a long way to being discounted after the Senate approved a version of it last weekend. ""But it does leave us pondering whether earlier equity wobbles were more a function of the speed of the run-up in US Treasury yields than the fact they have risen to above 1.5 per cent at 10 years."" Big names like Apple, Tesla and Facebook all made gains of up to 4 per cent, after the tech-heavy Nasdaq recouped losses too. On the US markets, the dating app Bumble jumped 20 per cent. The app said it was forecasting a rise in user demand as people who had missed social interaction during the pandemic sought out romance and even friendship via its digital dating platform. The company said it would build its friendship product Bumble BFF beyond its minimum viable offering, as it expected friendships and platonic relationships at large to be a massive opportunity going forward. Bumble has more than 12 per cent of the dating market in the US and a chunk of the Australian market too. It differentiates itself from competitors such as Tinder and Hinge by requiring women to make the first move.

210,Flight Centre shares soar 10pc on cheap tickets — but that's still half its pre-pandemic value,markets,"  Australian investors seek out travel stocks; Dow Jones hits new record Pandemic-hit travel agencies soared on the Australian share market on Thursday as investors backed the federal government's half-price plane tickets package. The ASX 200 closed Thursday flat Early on Thursday, the government announced a $1.2 billion support package for the travel sector, which is still yet to recover as borders stay closed to international travellers. The stimulus measures include subsidised plane tickets to encourage domestic travel. The ASX 200's best performing stock of the day was travel agency Flight Centre. At one point during trade, it soared more than 10 per cent on the news. It eventually closed 8.7 per cent higher at $19.35. That is double what the stock was at during the depths of COVID in 2020 when Flight Centre plunged to less than $10. However, the stock is still half the price it was before the pandemic. Flight Centre's rival Webjet was another top performer with a gain of 3.1 per cent. A company that organises business travel, Corporate Travel Management, gained 4.3 per cent. Despite being a main beneficiary of the travel subsidies, Qantas performed less jubilantly with a gain of 2.3 per cent to $5.29. That is still less than its momentary rebound in late 2020 as border restrictions nationally eased. Qantas boss Alan Joyce welcomed the support package. ""With the vaccine rollout now giving more certainty that state borders will stay open, this is the perfect time to provide stimulus and get people travelling domestically again,"" he said. ""Particularly given there won't be any international tourists for another seven months. ""We have around 7,500 people in our international business who have already been out of work for a year and will unfortunately stay grounded until at least the end of October. ""To be clear, this targeted support will go directly to employees to help them meet their cost of living while they wait for international flying to return. It's not a subsidy for Qantas."" However, the Australian Services Union has slammed the package and said support money is not tied directly to jobs, unlike JobKeeper. Despite his company's stock soaring, Flight Centre's boss Graham Turner also cast doubt on the package on commercial television this morning, saying he did not think it would help most small travel businesses survive. Overall, the ASX 200 closed flat on Thursday. The market closed down on Wednesday after commodities stocks were hit by dwindling global prices. Some commodity stocks still took a loss on Thursday, such as Ramelius Resources (-2.6pc). Afterpay continued its rocky ride. After being on a downward slide for weeks, the buy-now-pay-later app closed 7.5 per cent up on Wednesday, following a surge in tech stocks in the US. But on Thursday it bled some of that gain all over again, with a loss of 3.7 per cent. That came after online financial services provider PayPal announced it is also launching a buy-now-pay-later option in Australia. So far, PayPal's new option has been rolled out in the US and Britain where by the end of the December quarter it said it had handled more than $US750 million of transactions. It now wants to target 9 million customers in Australia. The Dow Jones hit a new record during its Wednesday (local time) trade. That came as inflation figures there showed prices on core consumer products did not go up as much as expected in February, which had been worrying some investors. ""A lower than expected US CPI point provided markets with a cool breeze, allaying fears of an overheating US economy,"" NAB analysts said in a briefing note. ""Thus for now there is nothing for the inflationistas to ring the alarm while at the same time it provides the Fed plenty of breathing space ahead its meeting next week."" The data showed households are paying more for petrol, but underlying inflation remained tepid amid weak demand for services like airline travel and hotel accommodation. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden scored a major political victory after his mammoth stimulus bill passed its final legislative hurdle in the House of Representatives. That will mean direct stimulus payments for many Americans, as well as money for schools and businesses. The Dow Jones hit an intraday record high of 32,381 points in afternoon (local time) trade and finished just under that (+1.5pc) to reach a new closing record. The S&P 500 also rose 0.6 per cent but the tech-heavy Nasdaq was muted. Investors are shifting from buying tech stocks towards energy and financials, as they turn their thoughts towards what will be needed in a post-pandemic world, US analyst Peter Tuz said. ""That is essentially the overwhelming theme in the market right now and it probably will continue until these things run their course,"" he said. Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Tesla and Microsoft all ended down, but none lost more than 1 per cent. That was after Tesla soared again the last few days. The greenback eased overnight. The Australian dollar rose against it to buy 77.34 US cents. ""The Australian dollar has lifted over 7 US cents since late October, largely driven by higher commodity prices,"" CBA analysts said in a briefing note this morning. ""Yesterday, (in a speech) RBA Governor Philip Lowe reiterated that the AUD was not overvalued relative to its fundamentals. We agree. ""We estimate fair value for AUD/USD is now in a range of 0.77 to 0.89, centred on 0.83. ""Our mining commodities analyst recently upgraded our near term forecasts for commodity prices. ""As a result, we expect AUD/USD to appreciate and trade consistently above 0.8000 for the next few quarters, before easing below 0.8000 in 2022.""

211,Gold stocks lead the pack as ASX slides in afternoon trade,markets,"  Afterpay and gold stocks lead the pack as ASX slides in afternoon trade After a promising start, the Australian share market has finished in the red, with  commodity stocks bearing the brunt as the price of iron ore drops. The ASX 200 opened Wednesday in positive territory, with optimism from the Nasdaq's surge in the US helping local tech stocks such as Afterpay. Yet the benchmark slid throughout the day and eventually closed 0.8 per cent down to 6,714 points. That ends its two-day winning streak. Energy stocks were some of Wednesday's worst performers. Fortescue was the ASX 200's biggest loser with a slump of 7.9 per cent. Other resources companies that lost out included Rio Tinto (-5.3pc), Whitehaven Coal (-4.3pc) and Santos (-3.5pc). ANZ analysts noted that commodities were broadly taking a hit on global markets, including Australia's key export, iron ore. ""Selling re-emerged across commodity markets, as technical indicators suggesting several commodities were in overbought territory have seen investors liquidate positions,"" they said. ""This saw the ANZ China Commodity Index end the session down 1.4 per cent, with most sectors coming under pressure. ""Bulk commodities led the gains, with iron ore falling sharply. Industrial metals were also weaker, led by sharp falls in copper and nickel. ""Precious metals was the only sector to end the session higher, with gold rising sharply as the USD weakened."" Gold rose almost 2 per cent to $US1,714/ounce in overnight trade in the US. This flowed through into the Australian sharemarket. Some of Wednesday's best performers were gold stocks, including Ramelius (+10.1pc), Silver Lake (+7pc), Gold Road (+8pc) and Westgold (+4pc). The greenback's fortunes also impacted the Australian dollar overnight. It was up 0.9 per cent up to 77.21 US cents earlier this morning. By the afternoon it dropped 0.3 per cent to 76.90 US cents. Commonwealth Bank analysts said they are still forecasting a strong Australian dollar in coming months. ""Outside of short-term downside risks, we remain bullish on AUD/USD and forecast it will reach 83 US cents in Q3 [the third quarter of] 2021,"" they said. They said this is because Australia's recovery from the pandemic is accelerating, which poses a risk that monetary policy may be tightened earlier than expected. ""Which poses upside risks to our AUD/USD forecast profile,"" they said. Yesterday, NAB announced that its monthly survey of business owners in February had polled its highest level of confidence since early 2010. IAG still has some way to go to recover from its turbulent day on Tuesday. Australia's biggest insurance company was rattled by speculation that it was exposed to the collapse of the finance firm headed up by Australian billionaire Lex Greensill. IAG's stock dived more than 10 per cent on Tuesday on that speculation, before it went into a trading halt and told the market it was not exposed to Greensill's woes. It started trading again in the afternoon and started to recover, but still closed Tuesday down almost 4 per cent. It ended Wednesday down 1.3 per cent at $4.56. It was above $5.00 just over a week ago. After taking a hit the last month, Afterpay was one of Wednesday's best ASX 200 performers with an 8.4 per cent gain. That is after the buy-now, pay-later tech stock lost 4 per cent on Tuesday and the same amount on Monday. Afterpay's gain follows the lead of the US, where tech stocks surged in the Nasdaq's last session. The tech-heavy Nasdaq surged 3.7 per cent on Tuesday (local time) trade. Technology shares gained as bond yields stabilised. Longer-dated yields have jumped over the last month as investors price in a faster-than-expected economic rebound from the pandemic in the US and higher inflation. ""Let's not forget that less than a year ago traders interpreted one of the biggest negative macro events in market history as a buying opportunity,"" financial analyst Chris Larkin told Bloomberg. ""So there's little reason to think otherwise given all the positive signals around us today. ""Corrections create natural inflection points for traders. It's no surprise to see the Nasdaq rise today, and the fundamentals support continued bullishness."" Some of the Nasdaq gain was led by Tesla, which gained 19 per cent. That gain was its biggest in eight years but was partially a buy back after a sell-off, and still does not take it nearly back to its peak in early 2021. Other tech stocks that did well include Apple (+4.1pc), Amazon (3.8pc), and Microsoft (2.8pc) which have gained several percentage points each. New York analyst Kristina Hooper also said that the market is adjusting to lower interest rates. Rising interest rates disproportionately hurt high-growth tech companies because they are valued on earnings expected years into the future rather than profits earned in the short term. Companies whose products are in demand when the economy is doing well, known as cyclicals, and small-cap stocks will outperform this year, she said. Tech will end the year higher but not be the leader as it was in the past year's rally. ""Today the 10-year is down a bit, and that takes pressure off valuations, so tech is performing well,"" Hooper said. ""The market is just about getting comfortable at this level of rates."" The Dow and S&P 500 also traded up, along with the major European markets.

212,Want to know which super funds perform best? Check if there are women at the top,markets,"  Super funds run by women outperform male-dominated investment teams With small gains in annual returns making a big dollar difference in retirement, new research suggests you should look for super funds with female leaders if you want a bigger nest egg. The Superannuation Benchmarking Report from financial sector research group Rainmaker examined how fund performance related to the gender split of their leadership teams. A survey of 50 superannuation funds found women made up only about one-third of leadership positions, such as chief executives, board chairs and senior managers. However, Rainmaker found those super funds with a higher proportion of women in top jobs were outperforming other funds. The 12 funds in the study with female CEOs and deputy CEOs outperformed the industry average by 0.3 per cent per annum in the three years to June 2020. The best performing fund in that group outperformed the industry average by 2 per cent per annum over the same period. ""While 0.3 per cent per annum may not seem by much, if you're a member of a women-led fund, you have a three-in-four chance of outperforming,"" Rainmaker's Alex Dunnin said. Some of the top-performing super funds with more women in leadership were Aware Super, Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation, HESTA, Media Super and TASPLAN. Mr Dunnin said it could reflect the fact that corporate Australia was, unfairly, far less tolerant of underperforming women. ""If there is a woman in that job, chances are she has had withstand massive obstacles. ""Survivorship bias, you could call it,"" he hypothesised. Aware Super CEO Deanne Stewart has a slightly different take on things, arguing research shows diverse groups of leaders lift company performance. ""Diversity really matters — it's not just a policy, something nice you should do or a moral imperative, it creates diverse thinking,"" she said. Ms Stewart said that while the superannuation industry was ahead of other financial services in appointing women to top jobs, it still has a long way to go. She said inherent biases that resulted in male leaders hiring men to leadership positions and a lack of female graduates seeing the sector as an attractive option were ongoing issues. ""Young people want to be part of something that is ambitious, really caring, and purpose driven,"" she said. ""I often find women leaders balancing out male leaders, and attracting both of those aspects. ""If I think about our amazing women, the ability to attract and retain them is paramount to our really top performance."" The report also details the superannuation inequality still affecting Australian women. In total, Australian women own $1.2 trillion of superannuation funds under management (FUM). However, while women account for 53 per cent of retiree members, Rainmaker found they own just 44 per cent of retiree superannuation FUM. Super payments are legislated to rise to 12 per cent by 2025 but is it a trade-off to wages? The gap also does not appear to be shrinking across the generations. Younger women are also worse off, making up half of all superannuation accounts but only owning 43 per cent of funds in the millennial age groups' accounts. ""Women own four in every $10 of Australia's superannuation wealth,"" Rainmaker executive director Alex Dunnin said. The amount of super owned by women is up from $800 billion in 2015. But the amount of super owned by men has also increased to $1.7 trillion in 2020 compared to $1.2 trillion in 2015. Superannuation inequality is inextricably linked to the gender pay gap, and while that gap recently narrowed, Australian women continue to earn less. Alison Pennington, senior economist at the Australian Institute's Centre for Future Work, warned that the economic shadow of COVID-19 meant the inequality was set to get worse. ""Women lost jobs at a greater rate than men when the pandemic hit, and as the economy has recovered, are returning to fewer jobs offered on a more casualised basis,"" Ms Pennington said. ""The gendered employment recovery is disproportionately leaving women with less hours, security and pay than men."" A report by the Grattan Institute on the gendered impact of the COVID-19 crisis found women who lost their job or left work in the recession faced a huge financial penalty. ""The COVID hit compounds the effects of other career breaks,"" the report found. ""Six months out of work can add another $100,000 to the average $2 million lifetime earnings gap between men and women with children in Australia."" Both the Grattan Institute and Australia Institute are calling for state and federal governments to focus investment in creating jobs for women, free childcare and further stimulus for female-dominated industries. Rainmaker's report found women's super fund memberships reflect their over-representation in the retail, health, education and hospitality industries, as well as the public sector.

213,ASX trades up again as Australian business confidence rises to decade-high,markets,"  ASX trades up again as business confidence rises in February The Australian share market continued its upwards trajectory on Tuesday as a prominent business survey showed confidence was rebounding. The ASX 200 started the day on a high, with an early gain of 0.8 per cent. It retracted some of that gain over the day, but still closed 0.5 per cent higher at 6,771 points. That is after the benchmark index closed 0.4 per cent higher on Monday. Stocks were boosted by the local currency trading down at 76.60 US cents. CBA analysts are predicting the Australian dollar will fall further. ""The risk in the near term is that AUD moves nearer our end-March forecast of 0.76,"" they said. ""While the bond rout is pulling AUD lower, the medium term fundamentals of high commodity prices will eventually push it higher in our view."" Some of Tuesday's strong performers included Vocus Group (+8.6pc), shopping centre owner Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (+5.9pc) and Corporate Travel Management (+7pc). Its share price dived 10.19 per cent this morning to $4.32. The last time it was that low was back in 2012. But after going into a short trading halt and telling the market it wasn't exposed to Greensill, IAG regained most of its losses in afternoon trade. It closed Tuesday down almost 4 per cent at $4.62. That takes it back to its price in late 2020 when the insurance sector was being rattled by legal cases that could see insurers make extensive COVID payouts to small businesses. The day's other big losers included buy-now-pay-later darling Afterpay, which was down 4 per cent, Megaport (-4.3pc) and Pro Medicus (-5.8pc). NAB's monthly survey of business owners for February polled its highest level of confidence since early 2010. Business confidence took a severe hit as the pandemic took hold but it has been in more positive territory since the end of last year. The latest gain of four index points to +16 points in February was seen across the country, with most sectors reporting gains, except the pandemic-struck retail sector. After a drop over January, when festive season pandemic shutdowns were still lingering, businesses also reported a rise in trade and profitability for February too. The bank's chief economist Alan Oster described the results as ""very positive"". ""Business conditions and confidence are both at multi-year highs and, importantly, we're starting to see an uptrend in business hiring and investment activity,"" he said. ""Firms are reporting running above average capacity levels and this tells us the economy is likely to have already recovered pre-virus GDP levels in Q1 2021."" This follows data from the ABS last week that showed Australia's economy is rebounding strongly from its steepest quarterly GDP fall in history during COVID. However, despite the optimism, business confidence data also out today from a rival bank may be a party pooper. ANZ said while it also found business confidence rose in February, its preliminary data showed it was dropping again this month. Its early business outlook for March showed a fall in business confidence, but the details were mixed. Wall Street had mixed results on its first day of trade for the week. The Dow climbed, led by stocks poised to benefit the most from an economic rebound as the US Senate passed a US$1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief aid. President Joe Biden said he hoped for a quick passage of the revised coronavirus relief package by the House of Representatives so he could sign it and send $US1,400 direct payments to Americans. But prospects of more government spending and faster economic growth have stoked fears of a spike in inflation, sending the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to near one-year highs. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she did not expect the economy to run too hot because of the increased spending. The Dow was less than 100 points below its record closing high. The S&P 500 had been in the green most of Monday but then slumped in late trading. Tech stocks were also taking a hit with the Nasdaq trading down in late trade. Most tech-related stocks, including Apple, Microsoft, Tesla and Amazon, resumed a slide from the past three weeks on fears of higher interest rates. Tech stocks are particularly sensitive to rising yields because their value rests heavily on earnings in the future, which are discounted more deeply when bond returns go up. Shares in the US gaming company surged more than 50 per cent along with other so-called meme stocks. GameStop surged in January thanks to enthusiastic Reddit users taking on shortsellers and then slumped again. On US Monday trade, they again climbed to $US210.87. That was still far beyond its climax in late January at $US347.51. Other stocks favoured by retail investors on forums such as Reddit's now famous WallStreetBets also rallied. This included AMC Entertainment, headphone maker Koss Corp, and Rocket Companies. Meanwhile, European markets ended largely in the green on their first day of trade for the week. One of the headline-making events of the day was when the food delivery app Deliveroo announced it will list on the London share market. Like most parts of the world hit by COVID-19, food delivery businesses have surged in the UK during the pandemic. Deliveroo is a global app and has a presence in Australia that rivals Uber Eats. Its initial IPO is expected to value its worth at $US7 billion. That is based on a $US180 million private funding round completed in January with backers including minority shareholder Amazon, the world's most valuable company. That would make it the biggest London IPO by market cap since Royal Mail in 2013. The app is pinning its hopes on the continuing demand for food delivery apps. However, the Deliveroo IPO revealed it is still operating at an underlying loss of $US308.93 million in 2020.

214,Australian shares off highs after surge on US stimulus,markets,"  The Australian share market has closed higher, despite pulling back through the afternoon. Australian stocks had opened strongly after Wall Street made a comeback on Friday and the $2.5 trillion US stimulus bill moved closer to becoming law. The ASX 200 closed 0.4 per cent higher at 6,739 points, after being up by as much as 1.8 per cent earlier in the session. At 4:40pm AEDT, the Australian dollar was slightly higher, buying around 77 US cents. Around the region, markets in Asia were in the red, with Tokyo's Nikkei down 0.5 per cent after giving up an early rally. The initial optimism during the session had followed the US Senate passing President Joe Biden's $US1.9 trillion stimulus bill over the weekend, bringing it a step closer to becoming law. ""Views on what it all means for the economy, inflation and with that markets, should dominate proceedings this week,"" NAB strategist Ray Attrill said. However, US stock market futures dipped into the red during Asian trade, which saw the rally fade. Bonds continued to sell off as investors increased bets of a faster economic rebound this year — US 10-year Treasury yields hovered near one-year highs. Most sectors of the local market rose, led by education services and mining stocks, but industrial, real estate and health care stocks slipped into the red. The best performing stocks of the session were Treasury Wine Estates (+6.4pc), Silver Lake Resources (+6pc) and Janus Henderson (+5.2pc). On the flipside, the worst performers were Zip Co (-6.7pc), Kogan (-5pc) and Smartgroup (-4.6pc). Santos shares fell 2.7 per cent, after the company's largest shareholder sold about a third of its stake in the oil and gas company. Chinese energy firm ENN sold off around 107 million shares in Santos, a 5.1 per cent holding, but remains its largest single shareholder with a near 10 per cent stake. Other energy stocks rose strongly, including Oil Search (+3.4pc) and Beach Enegy (+4.1pc), after a rally in oil prices, with Brent crude futures jumping above $US70 a barrel for the first time since the pandemic began. Major miners, including Fortescue (+0.5pc), BHP (+2.4pc) and Rio Tinto (+2.9pc), ended in positive territory but off their highs of the session. After last week's figures showed the Australian economy recovering faster than expected in the final quarter of last year, Westpac economists upgraded their forecasts for the current quarter. Westpac chief economist Bill Evans has now forecast the economy to expand by 1.6 per cent over the first three months of the year. ""The level of [gross domestic product] GDP in the March quarter is expected to exceed that in the December quarter of 2019 by 0.4 per cent, returning activity to pre-pandemic levels one quarter earlier than we had previously expected,"" he said. Westpac economists now expect GDP growth of 4.5 per cent over 2021, compared to their previous forecast of 4 per cent, followed by 3 per cent expansion in 2022. Meantime, RBC Capital Markets has increased its annual GDP growth forecast to 4.7 per cent, given that the economy ended last year stronger than it had forecast. ""While the consumption recovery has been underway largely since mid-2020, we expect business investment and [residential] investment to contribute more to activity this year compared to 2020,"" RBC chief economist Su-Lin Ong said. On Friday, the major US indices staged an afternoon comeback, with the S&P 500 ending 2 per cent higher. The US non-farm payrolls report revealed a stronger-than-expected picture of the country's jobs market, with 379,000 jobs added in February and January's figures revised upwards. Meanwhile, the US unemployment rate edged lower, to 6.2 per cent. ""The data imply that the labour market is responding to the December fiscal stimulus and that the lull in hiring over the turn of the year is over,"" ANZ economists wrote in a note. However, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen tempered the optimism, pointing out that the true unemployment rate was around 10 per cent, as four million Americans have dropped out of the labour force during the pandemic.

215,"ASX, US stocks tumble after US central bank declines to intervene to stem rising bond yields",markets,"  ASX loses nearly $20 billion, Nasdaq wipes out gains for 2021 as US Federal Reserve chief fails to calm markets over inflation fears The Australian share market has lost nearly $20 billion in one day after after the tech-heavy Nasdaq index wiped out its gains for this year as the US central bank chairman took no steps to calm the market volatility which has pushed up bond yields. The All Ordinaries index fell more than 1 per cent at one point but came off those lows to finish down 0.8 per cent, or 58 points to 6,943. It was the second day of falls for the Australian market which had been trading around one year highs. Big miners Rio Tinto (-3.3pc) and BHP (-2.2pc) helped to drag the market down. The ASX 200 index closed down 0.75 per cent or 50 points to 6,711 with most sectors losing ground led by miners, health and technology firms. Oil stocks and utilities were among the few bright spots on the market, the big four banks ending higher helped to limit the losses. The biggest losers on the benchmark index were rare earths miner Lynas (-6.4pc), Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals (-5.9pc), and buy now, pay firm later Zip (-5.3pc). Going up were Westfield shopping centre owner Unibail Rodamco (+6.5pc), and oil and gas firms Santos (+4.7c) and Oil Search (+5pc). Gaming firm Crown Resorts gained 0.1 per cent despite the Western Australian government announcing a royal commission into allegations of money laundering and criminal activity at its casinos. The benchmark index still ended the week slightly higher despite this week's big sell off. The increase in US bond yields saw the greenback surge, which has driven down the Australian dollar. It has lost more than one US cent to around 76.98 US cents. By 4:50pm AEDT, the local currency came off its lows to 77.20 US cents. The market turmoil also roiled Asian markets, with the Nikkei 225 in Japan losing 1.9 per cent to 28,386, the Shanghai Composite losing 1.3 per cent to 3,458. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong was down 2.3 per cent to 28,608 at 12:50pm AEDT. But the Nikkei 225 also ended off its lows and lost 1 percent. By 4:50pm AEDT, the Shanghai Composite was down 0.25 per cent, and the Hang Seng had dropped by 0.4 per cent as investors digested China's modest annual growth target. Chinese premier Li Keqiang announced that the world's second biggest economy would target growth of more than 6 per cent for 2021 at China's annual parliamentary meeting, the National People's Congress. Mr Li said China was aiming for an urban unemployment rate of around 5.5 per cent and aimed to create more than 11 million new jobs in urban areas. The Chinese economy has rebounded strongly from last year's coronavirus lockdown. It saw growth of 2.3 per cent last year as the only major economy to expand during the coronavirus pandemic. Oil prices surged more than 5 per cent after OPEC extended production cuts into April. West Texas crude rose to $US64.42 a barrel, while Brent crude oil jumped to $US67.39 a barrel. Spot gold has continued to tumble and fell below $US1,700 an ounce, down 0.1 per cent to $1695.36 an ounce. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, speaking at the Wall Street Journal Jobs Summit, stopped short of offering specific measures to curb the sell-off in bonds and a corresponding rise in the returns on the bonds, known as yields, because of fears of rising inflation. His comments set aside concern that a recent move up in US Treasury yields might spell trouble for the Fed, as investors push up borrowing costs the central bank wants to keep low. While Mr Powell said the increase was ""notable and caught my attention"", he did not consider it a ""disorderly"" move, or one that pushed long-term rates so high the Fed might have to intervene in markets more forcefully to bring them down, such as by increasing its $US120 billion ($155 billion) in monthly bond purchases or raising official interest rates. ""Our current policy stance is appropriate,"" Mr Powell said. And the Federal Reserve chairman reiterated his promise to keep US interest rates near zero and monthly bond-buying intact. ""Even when conditions do improve, I expect that we will be patient,"" Mr Powell said. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield spiked to 1.533 per cent because Mr Powell did not comment on any changes in the Fed's bond-buying program to tackle the surge in interest rates. The yield still held below last week's one-year high of 1.614 per cent. National Australia Bank head of foreign exchange strategy, Ray Attrill, had his tongue firmly in his cheek in his morning economic note with regards to Mr Powell's comments. ""It was quite a night for market volatility with the bond market the centre of attention with the Fed chair Powell's speech doing nothing to calm market nerves, at least not today and now with Fed speakers going into purdah into the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) on March 17."" Mr Attrill said that investors were expecting that the Fed may step up purchases of longer-term bonds known as Operation Twist. ""Instead, while the Fed chair gave a nod to bond market ructions by noting they had 'caught my attention', the Fed was in essence holding back and prepared to use their tools only 'if conditions change materially',"" he said. Julia Lee, chief investment officer at Burman Invest, said increasing borrowing costs have once again sent jitters through the market and ""Jerome Powell is not doing anything to ease rising bond yields."" Wall Street's fear gauge, the VIX, reached a high of 31.90 points, the higher the index, the higher the volatility. The Nasdaq wiped out all of its gains for this year and was down nearly 10 per cent from its record closing high on February 12, almost a technical correction. The tech-dominated index fell around 2.5 per cent to 12,554 at its lowest during the trading session. It came off its lows by the end of trade and closed down 2.1 per cent or 274 points to 12,723. High-end carpet and floor coverings manufacturer, Dixie Group, was the biggest loser, down nearly 41 per cent after it made a small loss for the fourth quarter of $US318,000. It reported revenue of $US89 million for the quarter. Biotechnology firm Five Prime Therapeutics jumped nearly 79 per cent after Amgen announced it would buy Five in a deal valued at $US1.9 billion. Amgen shares fell 0.9 per cent to $US221.91. The Dow fell more than 500 points during the trading session. It closed down 346 points to or 1.1 per cent to 30,924. The Dow has fallen more than 3 per cent from its record closing high on February 24, while the S&P 500 has dropped 5 per cent from its record close on February 12. The S&P 500 index briefly erased its gains for 2021. It ended down 1.3 per cent or 51 points to 3,768. The energy sector touched a one-year high on the back of higher oil prices. IT giant Apple (-1.6pc), electric car maker Tesla (-4.9pc) and payments firm PayPal (-6.3pc) were among the biggest drags on the S&P 500. New data showed the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits rose last week, likely boosted by brutal winter storms in the densely populated south including Texas, though the labour market outlook is improving amid declining new COVID-19 cases. Other figures showed an improving labour market with job cuts by US-based companies falling by 57 per cent last month. The latest official US unemployment figures come out tonight. In Europe, markets were mainly in the red. The FTSE 100 in London fell 0.4 per cent or 25 points to 6,651, the DAX in Germany lost 0.2 per cent to 14,056, and the CAC 40 in Paris was steady at 5,831.

216,ASX gains as GDP figures show promising recovery from COVID shock,markets,"  ASX gains as GDP rebounds, despite tech-led Wall St sell-off The Australian share market ended Wednesday on an upbeat note as GDP figures show that Australia's economy is recovering from the shock hit of COVID-19. The ASX 200 started the day on a high and rose to finish 0.8 per cent higher at 6,818, recovering losses from Tuesday's trade. That cam as data from the ABS showed Australia's GDP figures smashed expectations to rise by more than three per cent in the last financial quarter. The rise follows a boost of 3.4 per cent in the previous quarter, the first time there's been consecutive growth of this rate in 60 years. But despite the rise, that's off a very low base and the economy is still battling to recover from its record decline of 7 per cent in the June quarter. Overall, the data shows Australia's economy shrank in 2020 after suffering its first recession in nearly 30 years. That comes after a week of positive news for the Australian economy, such as ABS data on Monday that showed a resurgence in investment in the property market and residential construction. Company reporting season on the ASX has also been delivering strong results. The Australian dollar also rose overnight, despite the Reserve Bank again committing to low-interest rates for an extended period and saying it is open to increasing its bond purchases if needed to keep market interest rates lower. The ASX-listed media company Nine Entertainment has internally promoted Mike Sneesby as its CEO. The owner of newspapers The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald, the television network Nine, and the streaming service Stan has been looking for a new top boss after Hugh Marks announced in November that he is stepping down. Mr Marks was Nine's CEO for five years and saw it through the purchase of its Fairfax newspaper portfolios. He will now formally finish in the role at the end of March. His replacement Mr Sneesby has been heading up the company's Stan division, meaning he has experience in the newer broadcast world of streaming and digital media platforms. Before that, he headed up Nine's e-commerce joint venture with Microsoft, Cudo, which emerged last decade as part of the daily online deals boom. Nine's stock dropped 0.5 per cent on Wednesday to $3.06. Grocery packaging supply company Orora was the day's biggest loser with a loss of 3.3 per cent. TPG Telecom, Ampol, and Resmed also posted losses above 1 per cent. Good performers on Wednesday include gold miner Westgold (+6.2pc), resources companies Viva (+3.1pc) and Whitehaven Coal (+4pc) and buy-now-pay-later Zip (1.8pc). Westgold's rise came as the spot price on gold rose on global markets. The big miner has announced its chairman Simon Thompson and non-executive director Michael L'Estrange, a former top public servant, will step down ahead of next year's annual shareholder meeting. Last year, Rio destroyed two 46,000-year-old caves in the Pilbara region against the wishes of the traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP). Why did the company commit this egregious act of cultural vandalism? There are several layers to the answer. Former chief executive Jean-Sebastian Jacques and two top executives were forced to resign last year over the scandal. Mr Thompson said that as chairman, he was ultimately accountable for the destruction of the sacred Aboriginal site. Mr L'Estrange led a widely discredited internal review of the Juukan incident. The rises on the ASX also come despite a lull in the US overnight. US markets were dragged lower by a renewed tech sell-off, while mining was the only sector to rise, pointing to positive trade on the resources-heavy Australian share market. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index led US market declines, sliding by 1.7 per cent, as fears about rising interest rates continued to rattle the shares of highly valued but relatively unprofitable tech stocks. The S&P 500 (-0.8 per cent) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (-0.5 per cent) posted much smaller falls. However, new research shows that, even as tech stocks fell heavily last week, there were buyers out there trying to capitalise on falling prices. As the S&P 500 slumped 2.4 per cent last week, Bank of America clients were net buyers of $US2.8 billion of US equities with weekly investment inflows ranking in the top 5 per cent, according to the bank's Global Research Equity & Quant Strategy report. Interest rates are rising on bond markets as investors fear inflation will take off as the post-COVID recovery gathers steam, and it is hitting tech shares particularly hard. Specifically, clients bought the tech dip, strategist Jill Carey Hall said in the note, with net buys of tech stocks the largest in any week since November 2019 and inflows across all three client groups: institutional, hedge funds and private clients/retail. However, private clients led last week's buying, where inflows were the sixth-largest in BofA's data history going back to 2008, Ms Hall said, and the largest since the mid-January buying ""frenzy"" (concentrated in consumer and tech stocks). Ms Hall pointed out that clients shed cyclical sectors — most reliant on general economic growth — such as industrials, energy, financials and communication services. However, other analysts argue that financial companies, such as banks, remain ""a high conviction"" buy. Lori Calvasina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said current economic and market conditions favoured banks. ""The financials sector has historically shown a strong tendency to outperform when a number of macro trends that are currently unfolding are in place — improving ISM new orders, rising interest rates, a steepening yield curve, and rising inflation expectations,"" she wrote. ""To some extent, financials appear to be in the midst of a catchup trade in the improving economic narrative."" Combined with the overnight rise in mining stocks, that is relatively good news for an Australian share market dominated by resources and big banks. Central banks around the world have been trying to keep interest rates down at record lows, but some traders have had other ideas.

217,ASX loses gains after Reserve Bank stays put,markets,"  Australian shares erase gains after the Reserve Bank keeps rates on hold The Australian share market has reversed course and ended lower as the Reserve Bank offered no new stimulus for the improving Australian economy, despite turmoil in the bond markets that has pushed up interest rates. Wall Street rebounds as Johnson & Johnson rolls out its vaccine By the close, the All Ordinaries index shed half a per cent, or 33 points to 7,010, with more sectors ending in the red than rising, with the falls led by education and energy stocks. The index had put on 1 per cent in value in early trade on hopes of another sugar hit from the RBA and after strong gains on Wall Street due to optimism about the latest coronavirus vaccine. The ASX 200 index also lost its gains and lost 0.4 per cent, or 27 points to 6,762. Education firms and oil stocks were the biggest losers as most sectors lost their gains, including miners, industrials and technology firms. The only sectors to rise were consumer stocks and banks. A2 Milk (+7.6pc) was top performer in the ASX200, followed by metal recycler Sims Metal Management (+5.2pc) and car parts firm Eagers Automotive (+4.50pc). Leading the falls on the ASX 200 were gold miners Gold Road Resources (-8.1pc) as the price of the precious metal weakened followed by litigation funder Omni Bridgeway (-7pc) and engineering construction firm CIMIC (-6.9pc). Biotech firm Mesoblast fell 4.9pc to $2.34 after it raised $US110 million by issuing new shares to US investors at a discount. Investors also received warrants to buy a further $43 million in shares. Energy firms were pulled down by lower oil prices as investors unwound trading positions ahead of a meeting of the oil producing group OPEC later this week, which may decide to increase supply. Brent crude oil dropped 1.4 per cent to $US62.79 a barrel and spot gold slipped 0.6 per cent to $US1,712.91 an ounce. In economic news, the Reserve Bank met today and kept the nation's official interest rates near zero, at 0.1 per cent. Interest rates are rising on bond markets as investors fear inflation will take off as the post-COVID recovery gathers steam, and it is hitting tech shares particularly hard. That was in line with the predictions of all but one of the 15 economists surveyed by Refinitiv. In his post-meeting statement, RBA governor Dr Philip Lowe said Australia's economic recovery was ""well underway"" and stronger than earlier expected. Dr Lowe noted that rising bond yields globally had lifted the Australian dollar but reiterated that the central bank would not raise official interest rates until inflation has increased above 2 per cent. ""The positive news on vaccines together with the prospect of further significant fiscal stimulus in the United States has seen longer-term bond yields increase considerably over the past month."" ""Reflecting these global developments, there have been similar movements in Australian bond markets."" ""The Australian dollar remains in the upper end of the range of recent years."" Analysts from investment bank UBS had predicted that the RBA would take more radical step and ramp up its quantitative easing (QE) program — colloquially known as digital ""money printing"" — and even start buying 20-year government bonds. ""We think the bank may add to their existing $200 billion QE envelope (effectively, stepping up their weekly pace of buybacks from the current $5 billion per week),"" UBS strategist Giulia Specchia wrote in a note before today's RBA announcement. The Australian dollar fell to a daily low of 77.37 US cents immediately after the RBA's announcement, then quickly regained its lost ground to nearly 77.70 US cents. At 4:50pm AEDT, it was trading around 77.54 US cents, down 0.2 per cent. In the US, Rio Tinto and BHP's controversial Resolution Copper project in Arizona is facing another hurdle, with the US Department of Agriculture ordering the US Forest Service to withdraw the final environmental impact statement, which paved the way for a land transfer to the big miners in the dying days of the Trump administration. Rio Tinto and BHP are facing a fresh battle over Indigenous land rights, this time over their planned copper mine on Apache land in the US. The mine development on sacred Apache land is opposed by traditional owners including the San Carlos Apache, who lodged an emergency appeal. US lawyer Luke Goodrich from Becket Fund, who are representing Apache Stronghold, a grassroots group which is fighting against the mine, said the move was only a temporary reprieve for the Oak Flat site. ""The government knows the destruction of Oak Flat violates federal law, including the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, so it's retreating temporarily,"" he said. ""But a temporary retreat doesn't solve the problem."" Traditional owner Dr Wendsler Nosie from the San Carlos Apache tribe was also sceptical about the US government's move. ""They are just attempting a temporary strategic retreat,"" he said. ""They still intend to try and give away our sacred land."" Rio Tinto shares ended the day down 0.4 per cent to $127.18, while BHP slipped nearly 2 per cent to $49.13 a share. The Bureau of Statistics said that approvals to build new homes fell sharply in January. Dwelling approvals dropped 19.4 per cent from December to January, seasonally adjusted. Queensland led the slump, with permits to build new homes down by one third. The value of new approvals for dwellings declined by nearly 17 per cent, seasonally adjusted. EY's chief economist Jo Masters said the figures reflected the scaling back of the Federal Government's HomeBuilder construction subsidy. ""This is perhaps the first sign of the temporary nature of the recent surge in building approvals as the first, higher-paying stage of the Federal Government's HomeBuilder scheme came to an end."" ""In the near term, the surge in HomeBuilder applications at the end of 2020, as well as the extension of the program to March, will provide support for house approvals."" ""However, at the completion of the scheme we should expect to see a sizable pull back in approvals as weak population growth and high residential vacancy rates in Australia's largest cities weigh on demand for new housing,"" Ms Masters said. The latest economic growth figures for the December quarter are out tomorrow. Chief economist at BIS Oxford Economics Sarah Hunter said ABS balance of payments data showed that net exports could put a 0.1 per cent drag on GDP growth for the December quarter. The current account surplus rose to $14.5 billion thanks to booming commodity prices and a rebound in farm exports thanks to a break in the drought. ""The surplus would have hit record highs were it not for a strong rebound in goods imports,"" she said. ""Restocking by retailers following the strength in goods retail turnover through 2020 led to a 10.1 per cent increase in the volume of consumer goods imports."" Capital Economics said it had raised its estimate for the quarter from 2.3 per cent to 2.7 per cent growth ""in light of the solid data on public investment and net trade."" On Wall Street, the S&P 500 posted its biggest one-day gain since June as bond markets calmed after a month-long selloff. The benchmark S&P index closed sharply higher (+2.4pc) at 3,902 points. It may not generally involve a printing press, but the RBA has been busy creating billions of dollars out of thin air. David Taylor explains how it does it. The industrial-skewed Dow Jones gained 603 points (+2pc) to 31,536, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged (+3pc) to 13,589. ""We got a pretty good bounce-back from the selling at the end of last week,"" Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Jersey, said. ""Investors have started to refocus on the idea that the pandemic could be drawing to a close."" Also boosting the market was a highly-anticipated $US1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which was approved by the US House of Representatives on Saturday, and now moves to the Senate. It was also a strong day for European markets, with Britain's FTSE, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 all closing 1.6 per cent higher. Major sovereign bonds rallied on Monday as markets showed further signs of stabilisation after their worst monthly performance in years. Central banks around the world have been trying to keep interest rates down at record lows, but some traders have had other ideas. Expectations of economic recovery and rising inflation boosted global benchmark bond yields in February to their biggest monthly rises in years. The yield on America's benchmark bond, the 10-year Treasury note, traded at 1.4376 per cent, down from 1.456 per cent on Monday. Sebastien Galy, senior macro-strategist at Nordea Asset Management, noted that the US Treasury yield has settled below the one-year highs over 1.60 per cent touched last week, even as the US Federal Reserve and others like the European Central Bank refused to intervene and cap rising yields. ""This is most likely the end of this temper tantrum and presents opportunities for investors faced with dislocated markets,"" he said.

219,CommSec admits to overcharging customers $4.3m; ASX rises,markets,"  Online stockbroker CommSec admits to overcharging customers $4.3 million; ASX rises Online stockbroker CommSec has admitted to overcharging customers and other breaches, and it could face a penalty on top of $6.5 million it has refunded. The corporate regulator said CommSec overcharged customers on 120,933 occasions, more than $4.35 million in brokerage fees between August 2010 and February last year. ASIC has commenced court proceedings against CommSec and Australian Investment Exchange Limited (AUSIEX), the broker's wholesale arm, which the Commonwealth Bank agreed to sell last year. CommSec and AUSIEX have also admitted to a slew of ""systemic compliance failures"", including not providing accurate confirmation to customers for certain transactions and failing to comply with best execution policies. Share trading platforms including CommSec have seen an influx of new customers over the past year, as record low returns on savings accounts and the booming stock market have spurred retail investors to enter the market. Last month, CBA said more than 230,000 new CommSec accounts were opened between June and the end of December last year, with the value of trades through the platform doubling from a year earlier. In a statement on Monday, CBA apologised to customers and described the failures as mistakes caused by coding and system errors, human error and data entry errors. It said CommSec had repaid a total of $6.5 million to customers, including refunds, compensation and interest payments. ""We acknowledge the importance of meeting our compliance obligations and we are committed to continuing to invest in strengthening our systems and procedures,"" CommSec managing director Richard Burns said. The Australian share market has risen and the Reserve Bank is buying $4 billion of longer-dated government bonds as it battles to keep interest rates near its record-low target. The ASX 200 gained 1.7 per cent to 6,789 points, while the All Ordinaries index rose 1.5 per cent, recovering some of the sharp losses posted at the end of last week. The top-performing stocks on the benchmark index were Austal (+8.4pc), Reece (+7pc) and Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals (+6.5pc). Real estate companies rose following news house prices continued to climb last month, with shares in Charter Hall (+5.6pc) and Stockland (+5.5pc) up strongly. Gold mining stocks were among the worst performers on the market, with falls for Ramelius Resources (-3.5pc) and Silver Lake Resources (-3.5pc). Shares in Fortescue fell 5.9 per cent as it traded ""ex-dividend"", meaning shares bought from Monday are not entitled to the miner's next dividend payment. The Australian dollar was up by about half a per cent against the greenback, buying 77.48 US cents at 4:20pm AEDT. Ahead of its board meeting tomorrow, the Reserve Bank said it would purchase $4 billion worth of Australian government bonds, due to mature between November 2024 and May 2028. That is double the typical size of the RBA's purchases under its quantitative easing program, which was extended to $200 billion last month. The offer for the longer-dated bonds followed an unscheduled purchase of $3 billion of three-year bonds by the RBA on Friday, as the rout on global bond markets sent yields further above its 0.1 per cent target. It may not generally involve a printing press, but the RBA has been busy creating billions of dollars out of thin air. David Taylor explains how it does it. Bond yields have soared in recent weeks with investors betting inflation will rise as global economies recover from the pandemic and force central banks to raise interest rates sooner than expected. However, some calm has returned, with the yields on US 10-year treasury notes coming off their peak at the end of last week. The Australian 10-year yield, meanwhile, slid on Monday. ""The bond moves on Friday still feel like a pause for air, rather than the catalyst for a move towards calmer waters,"" NAB strategist Rodrigo Catril said. ""Market participants remain nervous over the prospect of higher inflation as economies look to reopen aided by vaccine roll outs, high levels of savings along with solid fiscal and monetary support."" Betashares chief economist David Bassanese said there was a risk of a correction on equity markets if the bond sell-off did continue. ""The big near-term risk, at least, is a short-run spike in inflation which could lead to a further capitulation among bond investors and pull back in equity markets,"" he said. Shares in Crown Resorts rose 1.5 per cent despite news the casino operator was facing another investigation, this time by the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO). The FWO said Crown had reported itself to the workplace regulator for underpaying staff and that it was now conducting an investigation. ""We expect any employers that identify non-compliance to report to the FWO and fully cooperate with our investigation to ensure that employees are quickly repaid any outstanding entitlements,"" an FWO spokesperson said. ""Any workers with concerns about their pay should contact us directly for assistance."" In a statement, Crown said it discovered the underpayments in an assessment of its workforce, following media reporting of widespread underpayment issues, particularly in hospitality. ""Our expectation is that only a small proportion of our employees are potentially impacted and that the majority of employees impacted are not covered by an enterprise agreement,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Crown self-reported this review and continues to cooperate with the Fair Work Ombudsman."" Crown has also announced another resignation, with WA-based director John Poynton stepping down as part of the fallout from the scathing report of the inquiry commissioned by the NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA). Mr Poynton has also left his role as chairman and director of Crown Perth. Helen Coonan, who is currently acting as Crown's executive chairman following the resignation of chief executive Ken Barton, said the ILGA considered it appropriate for Mr Poynton to step down ""due to a perceived lack of independence arising out of his past relationship"" with James Packer and the Packer family company Consolidated Press Holdings. ""As a result, John has agreed to resign in the best interests of Crown and our shareholders, despite no adverse findings by the commissioner in the ILGA inquiry in relation to his suitability, integrity or performance,"" Ms Coonan said. ANZ expects to take a $212 million hit in its first-half results due to its investment in Malaysia's AMMB Holdings Berhad. AmBank will pay the Malaysian government $US700 million to settle claims in relation to its role in a massive financial scandal, in which $US4.5 billion was allegedly stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a state fund set up by former prime minister Najib Razak. Najib was found guilty of corruption and money laundering last year over the transfer of millions of dollars linked to a 1MDB unit into his AmBank accounts between 2014 and 2015. He has denied any wrongdoing and has filed an appeal. ANZ owns a 24 per cent stake in AmBank and it said the impact would reduce the carrying value of its interest in the Malaysian company from $1.05 billion to $850 million.

220,John Poynton resigns as director of Crown and chair of Perth's Burswood casino,markets,"  Crown Resorts director John Poynton resigns from board and as Burswood casino chair Crown Resorts has announced another key director — WA-based John Poynton — has resigned from the board and as chairman of the company's Burswood casino in Perth, with immediate effect. In a statement, Crown chair Helen Coonan said the decision was ""appropriate"" after concerns by the New South Wales gaming regulator about Mr Poynton's perceived lack of independence from a past relationship with majority shareholder James Packer. ""John has agreed to resign in the best interests of Crown and our shareholders, despite no adverse findings by the Commissioner in the ILGA Inquiry in relation to his suitability, integrity or performance,"" Ms Coonan said. ""On behalf of the Board, I thank John for his contribution to Crown over many years."" Mr Poynton is the fifth Crown director to resign from the company's board in the wake of the release of the Bergin report last month. The New South Wales inquiry found Crown Resorts was unsuitable to hold a casino licence due to poor governance. The report made 19 recommendations, including proposing several legislative changes aimed specifically at addressing money laundering activities uncovered at Crown Casino Perth and the company's Melbourne operation during the inquiry. Two weeks ago WA's gaming regulator recommended the McGowan government establish an independent inquiry into Crown's suitability to hold the state's only casino licence. Racing and Gaming Minister Paul Papalia said he would move quickly to establish the inquiry, which would be given four months to investigate. Mr Poynton said he decided to resign in the best interests of Crown and its shareholders, despite the Bergin Inquiry making no findings against his integrity or performance on the Crown board. ""Given the advice from the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority about perceptions about my independence arising out of my past relationship with James Packer and CPH, I believe resigning is the right thing to do,"" he said. He also said the inquiry noted his commitment and contribution would be integral to Crown's future success. WA Premier Mark McGowan said no matter how the Crown saga played out, he hoped the organisation would be able to continue to operate in WA. ""The most important thing for me is that Crown has the highest standards and that they continue to employ West Australians,"" he said. ""Whatever needs to be done, we will do to ensure that the highest standards are in place, but that doesn't mean someone working as a croupier, a cleaner or a security guards needs to lose their job. ""We'll have an inquiry, we'll work out if there needs to be changes to legislation, changes to ownership structures, whatever it might be, over the course of that inquiry. ""But at the end of it, I want to make sure that 5,500 people who work there, and frankly the millions of West Australians who like to go there for a meal or to stay overnight, continue to have a great venue."" Mr McGowan also defended the time it was taking the government to launch its own inquiry into Crown, after Victoria established a royal commission into the gambling giant early last week. Mr McGowan said those details were still being finalised. ""It's a fairly complex task to work out the terms of reference and get the inquirers in place,"" he said. He said he hoped the inquiry would be fully established before the upcoming state election.

221,analysis: Money market madness: How the RBA and every central bank have been left humiliated,markets,"  Why interest rates are soaring and what it means for you As if there wasn't enough uncertainty and chaos in the world. The past 18 months have seen a global pandemic that has taken the lives of millions and created hardship and misery for many more. Add to that the rising tensions among the world's superpowers and political instability across the developed world, capped off by ugly scenes at the centre of the world's biggest democracy as hordes of angry protesters stormed the Capitol. At all levels of society, it seems revolution is in the air and traditional power bases are under threat. And now this. In the past fortnight, and especially last week, global money markets have cratered and interest rates have soared. For many, it's a shrug-your-shoulders incident, an obscure and esoteric event that has little bearing on everyday life. The health crisis caused by COVID-19 was a once-in-a-century event. The financial cost of 2020 has been millions of jobs, countless businesses, and soaring debt and deficits. Except it isn't. What has just occurred could have a profound impact on our future. It has the potential to delay and possibly derail the economic recovery now underway across the developed world. And, if it continues, it will wreak havoc with global stock markets during the next few months. It also is a direct assault on the power and authority of central banks, including our own Reserve Bank. For the past year, across the globe, they've acted in unison, throwing everything at their disposal at an unseen enemy in a desperate effort to stave off the most serious economic collapse in more than a century. Suddenly, they've been left bruised and bloodied, run down by a growing mob that has flagrantly ignored their predictions and overturned their view of the world and our future. Hands up all those who thought the Reserve Bank of Australia set interest rates. If that's you, you're in good company. It's a common misconception and one our monetary mandarins have been keen to perpetuate. Every month, we read the breathless reports of the ruminating inside the boardroom at Martin Place and how the decision, even if there wasn't one, was arrived at. A mere hint that a change may be in the wind usually sends markets into a tizz. When our banks raise rates on their own or refuse to pass on an official cut, there are cries of foul play from the media, along with business and consumer groups. Central banks, however, don't have absolute control. An interest rate is merely the price of money. It's determined by supply and demand for cash on global money markets and occasionally other unexpected factors override central-bank controls. It may not generally involve a printing press, but the RBA has been busy creating billions of dollars out of thin air. David Taylor explains how it does it. Central banks are the feudal lords of money markets. They're big players and they almost always get what they want. And they employ a range of powerful weapons to ensure they do. They not only set an official cash rate — the rate they charge commercial banks for loans — but in more recent times have waded directly into bond markets to buy up huge amounts of government debt and even mortgage and corporate debt to muscle rates down. They've conjured up that cash and poured it into the system, lifting supply and depressing the price. America's central bank, the US Federal Reserve, has bought around $US7.5 trillion ($9.73 trillion) worth of debt in recent years, in a wild and unorthodox attempt to depress interest rates. With such enormous reserves, for the past 20 years most investors have adopted the age-old adage, don't fight the Fed. They've now taken the fight to the Fed. Central bankers like America's Jerome Powell, our very own Philip Lowe and their counterparts from Japan, Europe, Canada and the UK have for the past month been on message. Interest rates would not rise for years, they've decreed in unison. The economy is in the early stage of recovery but we have a long way to go. But money market traders, who buy and sell the $US90 trillion odd worth of government debt swirling around on global markets, decided they were wrong. All of them. As new US President Joe Biden finalised his plan to splash around $US1.9 trillion on a stimulus package — the biggest on record — the market decided that all this stimulus, both monetary and fiscal, could only lead to one thing; inflation. And that meant central banks would have to abandon their ultra-loose interest rate policies earlier than expected. The trickle of selling on bond markets suddenly swelled. By late last week, it was a tsunami. Bond prices collapsed forcing the yields — market interest rates — to soar. The battle was on. Last November, if you bought an Australian government 10-year bond (essentially a government IOU) on the open market, you'd have been lucky to get an interest rate of 0.8 per cent. A fortnight ago, you could get a touch above 1.2 per cent. By Friday, it was just shy of 2 per cent. To put that into perspective, that's the equivalent of almost five official RBA interest rate hikes in four months, with two and a bit just last week. You'd expect rates to move higher as the economy recovered. But it was the speed and the severity of the movements, the likes of which haven't occurred for decades, that stunned onlookers. If sustained, it will lead to higher borrowing costs because banks will have no option but to pass those rate hikes on. And should Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg need to raise more debt, to extend JobKeeper for instance, he'll suddenly be confronted with a much higher bill. Then there are the follow-on effects. Stock markets hate higher interest rates. Suddenly, the boom that has been underway ever since central banks cut rates to zero last year has been knocked sideways. Interest rates are rising on bond markets as investors fear inflation will take off as the post-COVID recovery gathers steam, and it is hitting tech shares particularly hard. Our market hit the skids on Friday as Wall Street tumbled Thursday and took another hit Friday night. Companies such as Tesla which produce little profit now but promise big returns down the track are the ones most at risk from a rise in longer-term interest rates. Tesla has lost a quarter of its value in the past month. The other big tech stocks also are reeling, although there was some respite Friday. On our market, any company that has not lived up to earnings expectations has been smashed. A2 Milk last Thursday dropped 16 per cent following a disappointing half-year result. Buckle up for that turmoil is about to get a whole lot worse if money markets continue their rampage. Not yet. And maybe it won't be. That's the crux of the fight between central banks and financial markets. It's true that prices are rising now, particularly commodities such as oil, copper and iron ore. But we are coming out of a terrible recession. And what financial traders are ignoring, or forgetting, is that prior to the pandemic, it was a lack of inflation that was the major economic scourge of the developed world. Australia has just recorded its worst economic contraction on record, so why are we still talking about a recession not a depression? Michael Janda explains. Our own RBA failed to fire up inflation for four years and it cut rates three times in the months before the COVID crisis. True, asset prices such as real estate have been soaring. But they are funded by debt and, with rates at zero, buyers have flocked back into the market because they can afford the repayments. It's consumer prices that are the problem. They are funded by wages. And wages are growing at around the slowest pace in history. Casualisation of the workforce and the shift of entire industries from the developed world to countries like China have left millions either unemployed or underemployed. That won't change any time soon, regardless of Biden's stimulus package. But can central banks convince money market traders of this? So far, they've opted to pull back and let the looters run wild rather than risk the potential humiliation of a head-on confrontation and coming off second best. This week, however, will be crucial. America's February job numbers are out this Friday night. They were horrible in January, with more than 10 million out of work, which cemented Powell's resolve to maintain rock-bottom interest rates. Traders, however, remain determined to push them even higher if there is any sign of an improved labour market, much to the horror of stockbrokers. Absent any sense of irony, or humanity, came this line from one Wall Street commentator on Friday night. ""Without an ugly set of numbers, growth stocks are in trouble.""

222,ASX suffers worst day in almost six months; Dow falls 560 points as GameStop rebounds again,markets,"  ASX suffers worst day in almost six months; Dow Jones falls 560 points as GameStop rebounds again Australian shares have wiped out nearly all of this month's gains, following a tech sell-off on Wall Street — though ""meme stocks"" like GameStop defied the trend with another massive surge overnight. The benchmark ASX 200 index lost 160 points (or 2.4 per cent) to close at 6,673. Earlier in the day, it fell by as much as 175 points, before recovering slightly. The last time the share market tanked this badly was September 4, when the ASX shed 187 points (or 3.1 per cent). The broader All Ordinaries index dropped 165 points (-2.3pc) to 6,941. All sectors were in the red, with industrials, consumer discretionary and healthcare being the worst performers. Almost every stock on the ASX 200 traded lower. By 4:40pm (AEDT), markets across the Asia-Pacific also tumbled, like Hong Kong (-2.8pc), Shanghai (-2.1pc), Japan's Nikkei (-3.3pc), South Korea's KOSPI (-3.4pc). However, New Zealand's NZX 50 was the only one to overcome its early losses and close 0.7 per cent higher. Commodity prices slid even further today. Spot gold dipped (-0.6pc) to $US1,759.31 an ounce, while Brent crude oil futures sank (-1.3pc) to $US66 a barrel. That was on top of their heavy losses overnight. Kogan shares dropped (-10.4pc) despite the online retailer announcing its half-year profit surging (+164pc) to $23.6 million. It was driven by the company's revenue jumping (+89pc) to $414 million. It also declared a record interim dividend of 16 cents per share (up from last year's 7.5 cents). Shares in Afterpay fell (-11pc) on Friday, its first day back on the market after a one-day trading halt. Yesterday, the buy now, pay later company reported its half-year sales more than doubled, but its loss widened to $76.5 million. It also announced a $1.5 billion capital raising and said it was exploring a possible overseas stock market listing. What are hedge funds, and how did they (accidentally) send GameStop's stock flying 'to the moon'? Some of that cash (about $373 million) will be used to buy an extra 35 per cent stake in its US business. That stake is currently owned by venture capital firm Matrix Partner Some the worst performers on the ASX 200 were Orica (-18.1pc), Service Stream (-14.2pc), Afterpay (-11pc), PointsBet (-10.6pc), Kogan (-10.4pc) and Flight Centre (-6.6pc). Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, NAB and ANZ dropped between 2 and 2.6 per cent. Mining giants also experienced big losses, like BHP (-2.6pc), Rio Tinto (-1.3pc) and Fortescue Metals (-4.5p), along with utilities companies AGL Energy (-3.2pc) and Origin Energy (-3.6pc). Other big-name companies like Coles (-4.3pc), BlueScope Steel (-4.3pc), Woodside Petroleum (-3.4pc), REA Group (-3.9pc) were also caught in the slump. On the flip side, AMP (+7.5c) posted solid gains, along with gold stocks like Silver Lake Resources (+7pc), Perseus Mining (+4.5pc) and Gold Road Resources (+3pc). That was despite a massive fall in spot gold prices overnight. AMP shares jumped after the company signed a non-binding joint venture (JV) agreement with US-based Ares Management, valued at $1.35 billion. At this stage, Ares is planning to buy a major stake (60 per cent) in the private markets business of AMP Capital (the asset management division of the AMP Group). The financial services royal commission has severely damaged the reputations of the big four banks and many of their executives. Here's how the hearings unfolded. Both parties have a 30-day exclusivity period, during which AMP is hoping will lead to an actual binding contract. This comes weeks after Ares decided to abandon its plans to takeover the entire AMP company for $6.36 billion, which caused the Australian company's share price to tank. Under this new deal, AMP will retain 40 per cent of AMP Capital's private markets business, worth $900 million, which deals in infrastructure and real estate investments. The entire joint venture deal is worth $2.25 billion. The embattled wealth manager has lost two-thirds in value and struggled to repair its reputation since the 2018 banking royal commission found AMP lied to regulators and engaged in serious misconduct (in particular, the ""fee for no service"" scandal). Orica's shares plunged after it said the recent Australia-China trade dispute would hurt its thermal coal sales, while flagging pandemic-related disruptions to mining activity in several regions. As trade and political tensions simmer, speculation swirls about what's really going on between the two nations — and what's next on a Chinese sanctions ""hit list"". China has unofficially banned Australian coal imports since October amid souring relations between the two countries after Canberra called for an international inquiry into the source of COVID-19. ""Trade tension between Australia and China is ongoing and is impacting demand in Orica's higher margin Australian thermal coal market,"" the company said. Orica, the world's top supplier of commercial explosives, forecast demand for its products and services to be about 60,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate lower in the first half of fiscal 2021 compared to a year earlier. The Melbourne-based firm said the coronavirus pandemic was continuing to impact its activity in Colombia due to temporary and permanent mine closures for its major customers. It added that disruptions in parts of Europe, Africa and Mexico were more prolonged than expected. The company also revealed that its chief executive Alberto Calderon is stepping down after six years in the top job. He will be replaced by Sanjeev Gandhi, who only joined the company in July (as head of Orica's ""Australia Pacific Asia"" division). Orica also said that Mr Gandhi had previoulsy worked 26 years with German chemical company BASF SE across India, Germany Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong. The Australian dollar was quite volatile as it spiked to 80.07 US cents (its three-year high) overnight, before dropping as low as 78.24 US on Friday morning. It last traded at 78.32 US cents on Friday afternoon, around 4.40pm. ""Falling US equity prices and lower oil prices weighed on the Australian dollar,"" said Commonwealth Bank currency strategist Kim Mundy wrote in a note. ""A fall in Australian‑US 10‑year government bond yield differentials because of higher US yields likely also contributed to the weaker Australian dollar."" ""Nevertheless, our AUD/USD fair value equation suggests a test of 82 US cents is possible."" Australian shares followed a weak lead from US markets, after its high-flying technology-related stocks were heavily sold off. The Nasdaq ended its day much lower (-3.5pc) at 13,119, posting its worst day in four months. The benchmark S&P 500 index fell (-2.5pc) to 3,829, while the Dow Jones lost 560 points (-1.8pc) to 31,402. Investors were spooked after the yield on America's benchmark bonds (the 10-year Treasury) jumped to a one-year high of 1.53 per cent. The return on US bonds (which are regarded as safe investments) is now higher than the dividend yield of Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500 (estimated to be 1.48 per cent). It means shares (which are considered risky assets) have lost their advantage over the bond market. This led to investors cashing out of their high-flying ""growth"" stocks due to concerns they are now starting to look quite overvalued. ""The concern is that we haven't been in an environment of persistently rising inflation expectations so it creates this new dynamic for investors,"" said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors in Newport Beach, California. ""The market is stretched, a lot of forward growth expectations have been baked in and that's creating some of the excuse to blow up steam for some investors who were a little too bullish."" Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google's parent company), Facebook and Netflix were down between 1.2 and 3.6 per cent. It may not generally involve a printing press, but the RBA has been busy creating billions of dollars out of thin air. David Taylor explains how it does it. Tesla plunged (-8.1pc) after a media report that the electric-car maker told workers it would temporarily halt some production at its car assembly plant in California. Optimism about more US stimulus (expected to be about $US1.9 trillion) and a quicker pace of vaccinations at the beginning of the month had positioned the the Dow Jones for its biggest monthly gain since November. However, the lack of significant new developments around the stimulus package and the winding down of the earnings season have caused uncertainty in the market. ""In the beginning of February, the stimulus news was the driving force but now that it has been priced in, there is nothing on the distant horizon for equity investors to be excited about and there is a concern that upside is limited,"" said Mike Zigmont, head of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management. GameStop shares, meanwhile, finished trading well below its intraday high, but still managed to jump (+18.6pc) to $US108.73. The struggling video game retailer's stock doubled in value yesterday, and its volatility triggered a series of trading halts on the New York Stock Exchange. Wondering why a struggling video game chain is grabbing global financial headlines, and what Reddit and Robinhood have to do with it? It has something to do with shorts, as Paul Donoughue and David Chau explain. Its shares hit $US160 at the open before being halted after several minutes of trading and fell to about $US129 before the second halt. The rally lifted other ""stonks"" popular on sites such as Reddit's WallStreetBets, including headphone company Koss Corp (+16.8pc). Analysts were puzzled by the new rally. Some ruled out an epic ""short squeeze"" like the one in January. Last month, some hedge funds which bet against GameStop lost billions of dollars — as they were forced to cover their short positions when individual investors using Robinhood and other trading apps pushed the video game retailer's shares to a record high ($US483). ""The power of the 'three R's' [Robinhood, Retail, Reddit] are back in play,"" said Neil Campling, head of technology research at Mirabaud Securities. Ankit Gheedia, head of equity and derivative strategy, Europe for BNP Paribas, said: ""Short interest, though still significant, is now starting out from a different base than last time when it was more than 100 per cent."" Some said the rally may be partly fuelled by a fear of betting against GameStop. The latest surge comes days after Reddit trader Keith Gill, who runs the YouTube channel Roaring Kitty, doubled down on GameStop and bought additional shares last week. Mr Gill testified to Congress last week that he remains bullish on GameStop, with his words ""I like the stock"" gaining popularity, being quoted by hundreds of his online followers and featuring on financial-themed meme pages online. Reddit discussion threads were buzzing again about GameStop on Thursday (local time), with members exhorting others to pile in as the rally gathers steam. Is all that Reddit lingo about GameStop making your head spin? Here's your shortcut guide. ""Bought lots more #GME today, let's keep fighting !!,"" wrote Reddit user Fundssqueezzer. GameStop shares skyrocketed by more than 1,600 per cent in January as retail investors, urged on by WallStreetBets, bought the stock as a way to punish hedge funds that had taken an outsized short bet against it. The squeeze hurt Melvin Capital's Gabriel Plotkin, whose firm was left needing a $US2.75 billion lifeline supplied by hedge fund Citadel LLC's Kenneth Griffin and Point72 Asset Management's Steven Cohen. The risky trading strategies employed by some traders on Reddit have drawn the ire of investing legends such as Charlie Munger, long time business partner of Warren Buffett. ""It's really stupid to have a culture which encourages as much gambling in stocks by people who have the mindset of racetrack bettors,"" said Mr Munger, Berkshire Hathaway's vice chairman. Online brokerage Robinhood said in a tweet that the NYSE action would impact all brokerages, but that it had not paused trading on the shares.

223,"GameStop's volatile shares rebound surprisingly, Afterpay reports $76.5m loss as ASX recovers",markets,"  GameStop's volatile shares rebound surprisingly, Afterpay reports $76.5m loss as ASX recovers GameStop's share price has made a stunning comeback, more than doubling in the final trading hour in the US, as investors piled into the struggling brick-and-mortar video game retailer. Its shares skyrocketed (+104pc) to $US91.71 in the final trading hour on Wall Street. This led to several trading halts in the afternoon session, as there was no obvious reason for the surge. Shortly before the price surge, GameStop announced on Wednesday local time that its chief financial officer (CFO) Jim Bell would resign on March 26. ""Mr Bell's resignation was not because of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices, including accounting principles and practices,"" GameStop said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a research note, Jefferies Research analyst Stephanie Wissink wrote: ""We expect GameStop to pursue a CFO with a more extensive tech (versus retail) background, which will be a signal of the direction the company is due to take in coming years."" The spark in the company's share price seemed to take posters on Reddit's popular WallStreetBets forum by surprise. ""Why is GME [GameStop] going back up. is it Melvin covering?!"" one user wrote. Meanwhile, Reddit's website was down shortly after 8:00am AEDT, leaving thousands of users unable to get onto its platform. Instead, they were greeted with an ""Error 503"" message, which said the site is ""currently unable to handle this request"". The social media website has since been restored, and it is not yet clear what caused the outage. In after-hours trade, GameStop's share price went up even further (+85pc), suggesting there would be another big jump for the video game retailer's stock when the New York Stock exchange reopens later tonight (Australian time). Other so-called ""stonks"" - an intentional misspelling of 'stocks' - favoured by retail traders, also shot higher in Wednesday afternoon trading. Wondering why a struggling video game chain is grabbing global financial headlines, and what Reddit and Robinhood have to do with it? It has something to do with shorts, as Paul Donoughue and David Chau explain. Cinema chain AMC Entertainment gained 18 per cent, while BlackBerry rose nearly 9 per cent. Shares of Canadian cannabis company Tilray gained nearly 13 per cent. The retail trading frenzy was the subject of hearings in Washington last week, where Keith Gill, a Reddit user and YouTube streamer known as Roaring Kitty who had boosted the stock with his videos, reiterated that he was a fan of the stock. GameStop was the subject of an epic ""short squeeze"" last month, as amateur traders on Reddit forums helped send its share to the moon — up by as much as 2,400 per cent in less than four weeks. The retail investors sought to punish hedge funds such as Melvin Capital that had taken outsized bets against the company. Some of America's big hedge funds lost billions of dollars as they wrongly bet on GameStop's share price tanking in January. Melvin said it lost 53 per cent before closing its position in GameStop. The retailer's share price hit a record high of $US483 at the end of last month, before crashing to $US53.50 in early February (a week later). GameStop devotees on Reddit's popular WallStreetBets forum were surprised by the sudden jump in GameStop shares today. ""Why is GME going up?"" another retail trader asked on WallStreetBets. ""Because we like the stock,"" another replied, borrowing a line from Mr Gill (who also goes by the user name ""DeepF***ingValue""). Another user posted, ""I missed out on GME [GameStop] the first time, I'm not making that mistake again. TO THE MOON."" Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at analytics firm S3 Partners, believes short covering was ""not the predominant reason for this price move."" ""It's mostly long buying with short covering sprinkled in to help grease the skids up,"" Mr Dusaniwsky said. Fewer than 18 million GameStop shares were shorted as of Tuesday, down from over 70 million in early January, according to S3. Basically, when you buy shares in a company, you're usually betting that it will become more profitable over time. So you're going ""long"" on the stock. On the other hand, if you believe a company's shares will tank, you can place a bet on its declining fortunes (""shorting"" the stock, in other words). It means you're borrowing the shares at their current price and selling them to others (even though you don't own them). If your hunch is correct, and the share price falls, you can purchase them back from the market at a lower price. You would have made a profit in this situation. Then you can return the shares to the original lender, and pocket the windfall. Conversely, if the company's shares rise unexpectedly, you would have to buy them back at a higher price, return them to the lender and suffer a loss. In case you made the wrong bet, there are ways to minimise your losses — by ""short covering"". This involves buying the shares back at a slightly higher price (before they jump even further), to avoid a situation where you lose even more cash. The Australian share market has recovered from yesterday's heavy losses, after Wall Street's industrial index, the Dow Jones, scaled its latest record high and a sell-off in tech-related stocks eased. What are hedge funds, and how did they (accidentally) send GameStop's stock flying 'to the moon'? The benchmark ASX 200 index closed 56 points (+0.8pc) higher at 6,834. The broader All Ordinaries was up by a similar level to 7,106 points. Some of the best performers healthcare stocks Ramsay Health Care (+7.7pc) and Nanosonics (+9.5pc), miner Sandfire Resources (+11.1pc) and Platinum Asset Management (+6.7pc). On the flipside, some of the heaviest losses were felt by gold miners Regis Resources (-7.8pc), Ramelius Resources (-6.8pc) and Northern Star (-3.9pc), along with essential network services company Service Stream (-21.4pc), JB Hi-Fi (-3.8pc) and Super Retail Group (-3.5pc). The catalyst for Service Stream's plunge was its disappointing results, released after the ASX had closed yesterday. Its half-year profit slumped (-40.5pc) to $16.2 million, in what it described as ""subdued"" results arising out of COVID-19. The company said the last year's state border closures and snap lockdowns ""inhibited the Group's ability to effectively plan and move resources to support program delivery"". In other news, shares in buy now, pay later company Zip Co dropped (-7.7pc) to $10.95. Zip reported its half-year net loss had ballooned to $453.8 million. It was much higher than its $30.3 million loss in the same prior corresponding period. Its massive loss includes accounting adjustments which relate to its US division (Quadpay) totalling $306.2 million, and acquisition costs of $7.8 million. However, the company said its number of active consumer accounts increased to over 5.7 million (a big improvement from the 1.8 million it reported a year ago). It also saw a huge boost in transaction volumes to $2.3 billion (compared to $964.7 million, a year ago). Meanwhile, the Australian dollar had swung back and forth — anywhere between 79.2 and 79.78 US cents (its three-year high) on Thursday. By 4:25pm AEDT, it had edged back towards 79.74 US cents. The volatile cryptocurrency bitcoin slipped (-0.6pc) to $US49,937. The corporate regulator has filed a lawsuit against the NAB, alleging that it charged customers fees for periodic payments for which it was not contractually entitled to do so. Basically, periodic payments are automatic ""set and forget"" fixed-amount payments put in place by the customer. The financial services royal commission has severely damaged the reputations of the big four banks and many of their executives. Here's how the hearings unfolded. They are an alternative to direct debit arrangements, and allow customers to establish a regular payment to another account, for things like fortnightly rental payments. Banks may charge a fee for this service, depending on the terms and conditions for the account. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) alleged that between February 2015 and February 2019, the bank charged fees for periodic payments more than 195,000 times, totalling $365,454. It also alleged that NAB had identified the error in charging both personal and business banking customers by October 2016, but did not notify customers and lodge a report with ASIC until almost two years later. ""By charging the fees, or by notifying customers of the charging of each fee via a bank statement, NAB made false or misleading representations that it was contractually entitled to charge the fees when it was not,"" ASIC wrote in a statement. The nation's third largest lender has faced multiple lawsuits since it was heavily criticised during the 2018 banking royal commission for charging customers ""fees for no service"". Shares in NAB, Westpac and Commonwealth Bank lifted sharply (up 1 to 1.3 per cent), while ANZ has risen by a more tepid amount (+0.5pc). Afterpay reported its half-year loss widened to $76.5 million, despite some analysts forecasting the company would report a profit for the first time. In comparison, its loss (in the six months to December 2019) was $28.8 million, meaning it has worsened by 165 per cent since then. Its sales, however, also more than doubled, spurred on by strong holiday shopping particularly in the United States. The buy now, pay later company and its global competitors such as Sweden's Klarna, Affirm and Zip Co have witnessed explosive growth since the pandemic locked down much of the world and turned more people toward online shopping. Download the ABC News app for all the latest. The value of transactions done through Afterpay rose to $9.8 billion in the six months to December 31 (twice that of the $4.8 billion processed a year ago). Afterpay processed $4.2 billion in transactions in North America, largely in the US, the industry's biggest prize, and saw active customers rise 1.6 million to 8.1 million in the December quarter. Active customers using the payment platform shot up 1.9 million to 13.1 million in the three months to December. The company said on Thursday it was exploring the potential for its shares to also be listed overseas amid increased US investor interest. Shares in Afterpay last traded at $134.36, and were placed in a trading halt ahead of its results announcement, as it tried to make an extra $1.25 billion through capital raising by issuing convertible notes. Afterpay's share price has surged by more than 1,500 per cent, since its low point in late-March when it briefly crashed to $8.01. It is now Australia's 12th biggest company, according to its value on the share market. However, the market remains divided on Afterpay's prospects, with UBS especially feeling bearish with its ""sell"" rating on the payments company's stock. ""Cumulatively, Afterpay has now raised more than $2 billion in capital since last July,"" UBS analysts led by Tom Beadle wrote in a note. ""We believe this vindicates our view that the market continues to misprice or ignore how much capital is required to fund Afterpay's growth."" Far from jumping in to stop an emerging housing bubble, policymakers are keen to let it run in the vain hope it may kick-start the economy, writes Ian Verrender. Mr Beadle noted that Afterpay's equity free cash flow in negative territory, at -$587 million in the six months to December 31. On the other hand, analysts RBC Capital Markets have put an ""outperform"" rating on Afterpay. ""Today’s result saw all key metrics heading north,""  RBC analyst Tim Piper wrote in a note. ""Data points which stood out were earlier customer cohorts transacting 29 times per year (versus 25 times previously) and average 12-month frequency across all customers at more than 15 times (up 30 per cent on the prior corresponding period) in Australia and New Zealand. ""Customer acquisition in the US was strong with around 600,000 customers acquired in December alone. ""Repeat rates are now at 91 per cent with good traction in all regions, including the UK."" Qantas has announced a $1.1 billion half-year loss, which was blamed on state and international borders being closed, and Victoria's extended lockdown last year. The company will be able to offset part of its loss against future tax bills. It also revealed its revenue, for the six-month period to December, plunged by three-quarters to $6.9 billion. Sydney Airport is usually Australia's busiest international gateway, but during the coronavirus pandemic it stands empty and desolate. Take a rare look behind the scenes. The airline confirmed it still has about $4 billion in available cash to keep afloat until Australia's international border reopens and domestic travel ramps up to more normal levels. In a statement, Qantas said it now expected international travel to restart at the end of October, as recent state border closures have ""delayed the Group's recovery by an estimated three months"". The exception is trans-Tasman flying, which it expects to resume in July. Unsurprisingly, Qantas won't pay an interim dividend this year, though its share price lifted (+1.8pc) to $5.10. Meanwhile, Flight Centre has swung to a massive $233.2 million half-year loss, a steep downgrade compared to its $22 million profit in the prior corresponding period. Its revenue was almost obliterated by border closures, plunging (-87.6pc) to $159.8 million. In comparison, its revenue in the six months leading up to December 2019 was $1.5 billion. ""The conditions we have encountered since March last year have undoubtedly posed the greatest challenge that our industry and many others have faced,"" said Flight Centre managing director Graham Turner. ""Rather than enter a holding pattern ahead of future domestic and international border reopenings, we are taking steps to ensure we are well placed for the eventual recovery. ""We have become a leaner and more efficient business with a long liquidity runway, which has been crucial during this challenging and uncertain period."" Flight Centre will not pay its shareholders an interim dividend, but its shares leapt (+8.9pc) to $17.79. Shares in A2 Milk plunged 16.2 per cent, near its lowest level in around two years ($8.76). That was after the New Zealand company said it expected full-year revenue to be at the lower end of its guidance range (NZ$1.4 billion to NZ$1.55 billion), as the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted sales in its key Chinese market. As trade and political tensions simmer, speculation swirls about what's really going on between the two nations — and what's next on a Chinese sanctions ""hit list"". The dairy producer also posted a 35 per cent slump in first-half profit (to $NZ120 million), and said it expects a lower EBITDA (earnings before interest and tax) margin range of 24 to 26 per cent for the full year as a result of lower revenue. The company's woes are mainly due to disruptions in its ""daigou"" channel, where people outside China buy products for Chinese consumers and import them informally. The channel accounts for a significant portion of A2's revenue. ""While there was some improvement in the channel towards the end of the period, the recovery was not as strong as had previously been expected,"" A2 said in a statement. The company's heavy dependence on the Chinese daigous has come under scrutiny in the wake of the pandemic, as it was forced to issue a series of earnings downgrades in 2020, admitting that the hit to the channel was worse than initially expected. ""The weaker than expected outlook is likely to disappoint and the lack of capital management may increase investor doubts around whether A2 will have to downgrade its guidance again,"" Citi Research said in a note. The current outlook assumes that the daigou channel will improve significantly in the later half of this year, which may be challenging without the return of students and tourists and the ongoing resurgence in Chinese domestic brands, Citi says. Australian business investment experienced a bigger-than-expected 3 per cent bounce in the December quarter, a promising sign for the economic recovery. The level of investment rose (+3pc) to $29.4 billion in the last three months of 2020, the latest figures from the Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed. Travelling overseas? Unless you booked your travel insurance before late January, it's unlikely you'll be covered for anything related to the coronavirus. It was the first increase since end-2018 and the biggest since September 2013, with a surprise pick-up in spending for new buildings and equipment. This increase was all due to non-mining activity, mostly construction, accommodation, food services and transport postal and warehousing led by demand for online shopping. In a welcome sign, Australian firms seemed a little more confident about the future, with the latest estimate for spending plans for 2020/21 revised up to $121.4 billion. ""We had expected a fall ... Instead, the result indicates that with the business mood upbeat, firms have opted to increase spending in response to the rapid rebound in activity conditions as COVID restrictions are rolled back,"" said Westpac economist Andrew Hanlan. ""The backdrop is the economy is recovering and conditions have surprised to the upside. ""That suggests an upturn in business investment is likely to emerge – the issue is the timing."" Business investment is a critical driver of productivity growth in the economy and the Reserve Bank (RBA) has often referred to the need for the return of ""animal spirits"" to support a recovery. Data next week is expected to show Australia's $2 trillion economy grew at a rapid clip in the December quarter as it emerges from its first recession in three decades led by massive fiscal and monetary stimulus. The RBA slashed interest rates three times last year to an all-time low of 0.1 per cent, and launched a massive quantitative easing programme (colloquially referred to as ""money printing"") while the government boosted spending as well. ""What's driving the stock market is the fiscal stimulus, the dovish Fed, the real strong, strong earnings that we're seeing, as well as the fact that we're going to have a third vaccine,"" said Richard Saperstein, chief investment officer at Treasury Partners. Is all that Reddit lingo about GameStop making your head spin? Here's your shortcut guide. The US Food and Drug Administration said Johnson & Johnson's one-dose COVID-19 vaccine appeared safe and effective in trials, paving the way for its approval for emergency use as soon as this week. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones index had jumped 425 points (or 1.4 per cent) to close at 31,962, its highest level ever. The broader S&P 500 rose (+1.1pc) to 3,925 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite went up (+1pc) to 13,598, after managing to recover from a steep fall earlier in the session. The S&P 500 financial sector hit a fresh record high, while other cyclical stocks including industrials, energy and materials also rose. Microsoft, Amazon and Apple were down roughly between 0.4 and 1.1 per cent, while Facebook, Netflix and Alphabet (Google's parent company) reversed earlier declines. In the past few days, there was a big rotation out of growth stocks in tech-related sectors as more investors put their money into cyclical sectors like banking, oil and travel on bets the global economy would recover relatively soon from the COVID-19 pandemic. Investors were also worried that an economic recovery meant inflation would rise, as signalled by rising bond yields, which might lead to central banks and governments rolling back their stimulus measures — namely trillions of dollars worth of of ""cheap money"" and record low interest rates. It may not generally involve a printing press, but the RBA has been busy creating billions of dollars out of thin air. David Taylor explains how it does it. This change in policy would make some of their investments — particularly in tech stocks which pay no dividends, are not earning profits (or earning very modest profits), but are trading at record highs — look particularly overvalued. However, global markets rose overnight as Jerome Powell, chairman of the world's biggest central bank the, US Federal Reserve Chair, reassured markets that they didn't need to concern themselves with that. Mr Powell told US lawmakers on Wednesday it could take more than three years to reach the Fed's inflation goals, a sign it plans to look beyond any post-pandemic spike in prices and leave interest rates unchanged for a long time to come. Crude oil rose to fresh 13-month highs while gold prices fell, as surging US Treasury yields and a firmer US greenback weakened demand for the safe-haven metal. Brent crude futures jumped (+2.5pc) to $US66.98 a barrel. Since the year began, they have surged by around 28 per cent. Spot gold fell (-0.3pc) to $US1798.13 an ounce. The rapid rollout of vaccines, as well as news that Johnson & Johnson's one-shot vaccine appeared safe and effective, was boosting economic optimism but also inflation concerns, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital in Minneapolis, Patrick Leary, said. ""If you look at commodity prices, you look at real estate prices and you look at energy prices, they're up significantly higher than even pre-pandemic levels."" While rising rates give stock investors pause, the Fed is ""pretty comfortable"" with rising yields as they take some of the froth out of the financial system, he added.

224,"Elon Musk loses $19 billion after bitcoin and Tesla shares plunge, ASX finishes lower",markets,"  Elon Musk loses $19 billion after bitcoin and Tesla shares plunge, ASX finishes lower Global investors, fearing an overvalued market, have dumped high-flying tech stocks and bitcoin once again. The slump in bitcoin's value (from record high levels), along with Tesla's falling share price, have shaved $US15.2 billion ($19.2 billion) off Elon Musk's net worth, causing him to lose his title as the ""world’s richest person"". Once again, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has reclaimed his crown as the wealthiest man. The two billionaires have swapped between first and second place since January. Mr Musk's downgrade on the rich list was, in part, due to his tweets over the weekend that the price of cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ethereum ""do seem high lol"". He is now ranked second on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, with a net worth of $US183.4 billion, down from a peak of $US210 billion in January. Mr Bezos is worth slightly more at $US186 billion, even though the Amazon boss's fortune dropped $US3.7 billion. Forbes also has its own rich list with slightly different numbers. Mr Bezos is at the top of that list ($US186.9b), with Mr Musk a distant second ($US166.1b). The Tesla CEO's comments about the ""high"" price of bitcoin came two weeks after his electric car company said it had invested $US1.5 billion in the volatile digital currency, and would accept it as a payment method in the ""near future"". Bitcoin hit a record high of $US58,354 on Monday, having surged more than 400 per cent in the past year. But overnight, the cryptocurrency suffered its biggest daily drop in a month, falling to as low as $US45,000 on scepticism about its ""sky high"" valuations. Mr Musk's net worth is heavily tied to his electric vehicle company's share price. Tesla shares plummeted by as much as 13 per cent overnight, but trimmed their losses to just 2.2 per cent by the time Wall Street finished trading. This was on top of Tesla's 9 per cent slump yesterday. Bitcoin is both a ""friend and foe"" for the Tesla boss, Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said. ""While Tesla on paper made roughly $US1 billion on bitcoin in a month that exceeded all its EV [electric vehicle] profits from 2020, the recent 48 hour sell off in bitcoin and added volatility has driven some investors to the exits on this name in the near-term,"" he said. ""We continue to believe the bitcoin move was a strategic one for the long-term and will have a ripple impact as Square, Mastercard, Microstrategy and now Tesla embrace bitcoin."" Overnight, the payment platform company Square said it bought an extra $US170 million worth of bitcoin. That was on top of its $US150 million purchase in October last year. The local share market's losses accelerated on Wednesday afternoon, after a volatile night on Wall Street. By 4:20pm AEDT, the benchmark ASX 200 index closed 61 points lower (-0.9pc) at 6,778 — back to where it was a couple of days ago. The broader All Ordinaries index had fallen by a similar level, to 7,049 points. Download the ABC News app for all the latest. Some of the best performers were Nine Entertainment (+9.7pc), Blackmores (+6.3pc), Bega Cheese (+6.2pc), Viva Energy (+6pc) and Worley (+4.5pc). Shares in the mining giants suffered heavy falls, including BHP (-3.1pc), Rio Tinto (-2.7pc) and Fortescue Metals (-1.4pc). In banking, NAB was the only member of the big four to rise (+0.4pc), while Commonwealth Bank, Westpac and ANZ fell between 0.4 and 0.7 per cent each. Meanwhile, the steepest falls were felt by infection prevention company Nanosonics (-8.1pc), Seek (-7.8pc), Downer EDI (-6pc), AGL Energy (-4.5pc) and REA Group (-4.4pc). Nanosonics' shares tanked after the company reported that its first-half profit fell (-74pc) to $1.46 million. Shortly after midday, the Australian dollar jumped to a three-year high of 79.44 US cents. But the local currency has given back those gains, and last traded at 79.1 US cents. It received a short-lived boost after the Bureau of Statistics (ABS) revealed that Australian pay packets went up (+0.6pc) in the December quarter, which was a better-than-expected result. However, wage growth over the year remained at a record low of 1.4 per cent. The price of Australia's key export, iron ore, fell (-1.7pc) to $US173.05 a tonne. Nine Entertainment shares jumped (+9.7pc), after the network reported a half-year profit of $181.8 million, helped by advertisers spending more as Australia better controlled the coronavirus. Shareholders will receive an interim dividend of 5 cents per share, fully franked. This was the same as the previous interim payout. Is all that Reddit lingo about GameStop making your head spin? Here's your shortcut guide. Shares in logistics software company WiseTech Global lifted (+1pc) after the company reported its first-half profit fell (-26pc) to $44.4 million. However, WiseTech's revenue rose (+16pc) to $238.7 million. The company also expects its full-year EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) to be between $165 million and $190 million (or growth of 30 to 50 per cent). WiseTech will pay an interim dividend of 2.7 cents per share. Meanwhile, the artificial intelligence company Appen saw its share price slump (-12.1pc) after reporting its annual profit rose (+21.4pc) to $50.5 million. It declared a final dividend of 5.5 cents per share (10 per cent higher than last year's payout). But Appen forecast that its full-year underlying EBITDA would be in the range of $120 million to $130 million, which was lower than the market had expected. SeaLink Travel Group was one of the biggest movers on the market. Its share price surged 13.7 per cent to $8.03. The company provides transport, including bus and light rail services, in Australia, London and Singapore. Its purchase last year of Transit Systems Group helped first-half net profit jump to $32 million (up from $8.7 million in the prior corresponding period). Supermarket giant Woolworths posted a 28 per cent jump in first-half net profits to $1.135 billion (on a 10.6 per cent rise in sales to nearly $36 billion). Chief executive Brad Banducci said strong growth in food, BIG W and liquor offset a hit to earnings from COVID restrictions in the group's hotels, and a rise in costs. ""The first half of financial year 2021 continued to be impacted by COVID, with elevated sales and higher costs as we worked to maintain a COVID-safe environment for our customers and team,"" he said. Mr Banducci pointed to previously struggling discount department store BIG W as a ""particular highlight"", with its earnings up 166 per cent on the prior year. Woolworths said eCommerce sales increased by 92 per cent to $1.8 billion in the half. The company will pay a dividend of 53 cents per share, up 15.2 per cent on last year's interim payout. The result was moderately pleasing to the market, with Woolies shares up (+1.1pc) to $39.50. On the other end of the retail spectrum, shopping centre operator Scentre Group, which runs Australian Westfield malls, reported a $3.73 billion full-year net loss for 2020. The massive loss was driven by a $4.25 billion write-down of its property valuations over the past year, as foot traffic dried up due to the pandemic and shoppers shifted more of their spending online. However, Westfield said demand for space remained strong, with 98.5 per cent of its portfolio leased as at December 31, 2020. Despite the accounting losses, Scentre is paying a 7-cent dividend out of its $763 million annual operating profit. Scentre shares fell (-1pc) to $2.84. Another company hit hard by the pandemic — arguably one of the hardest — is Sydney Airport. It reported a full-year net loss of $107.5 million, with passenger traffic down by around three-quarters on the previous year. Sydney Airport is usually Australia's busiest international gateway, but during the coronavirus pandemic it stands empty and desolate. Take a rare look behind the scenes. The result would have been even worse were it not for the first couple of months in 2020 where international and domestic travel was operating as normal – over the last three quarters of 2020 the airport's passenger traffic was down 93.4 per cent. ""The COVID-19 pandemic has delivered a crisis of unprecedented magnitude to the global aviation industry, and Sydney Airport has been right on the frontline, both operationally and financially,"" chief executive Geoff Culbert said. The airport raised $2 billion from shareholders last year and will not pay a dividend, and has also secured nearly $1.5 billion in debt funding and facilities. Sydney Airport has also appointed David Gonski as its next chairman. He will succeed Trevor Greber, who will step down at the company's annual general meeting on May 21. Mr Gonski was formerly the chairman of ANZ, Coca-Cola Amatil and sat on the boards of many other companies. He was also the chairman of the former Gillard government's review into school funding (the Gonski Report), which was scrapped by the subsequent Abbott government in 2013. Sydney Airport's share price jumped (+2.5pc) to $6.08. Private health insurer Medibank has profited during the pandemic, citing it as a key reason why an increasing number of Australians took out policies last year. Medibank said it had a 49,000-strong net increase in resident policyholders, underpinning a 27 per cent increase in net profit to $226 million. ""While it is far too early to say the decline in industry participation has definitively bottomed, the private health insurance market has proved increasingly resilient,"" Medibank chief executive Craig Drummond said. Mr Drummond highlighted growth in its premium Medibank brand, which picked up an extra 17,600 members over the half-year. ""This is the first time we have grown the Medibank brand in any six-month period since 2013 and this trend has continued into February,"" he added. The company will pay an interim dividend of 5.8 cents per share. Mr Drummond also announced he plans to leave Medibank, and the company has begun a search for his replacement. Medibank's share price fell (-3.5pc) to $2.79. The volatile digital currency bitcoin plummeted as much as 17 per cent overnight as investors grew nervous at sky-high valuations, sparking a sell-off across cryptocurrency markets. After dropping to as low as $US45,000, it managed to recover some of those losses. Bitcoin is still down at $US46,492 on Wednesday morning, a 15.2 per cent slump in the past 24 hours. ""The kinds of rallies we've been seeing aren't sustainable and just invite pullbacks like this,"" senior market analyst at OANDA, Craig Erlam, said. ""It was an extremely overbought market."" The drop took its losses to over a fifth from a record high of $US58,354 hit on Monday, and underscored the volatility of the emerging asset. However, it was still up around 60 per cent since the start of the year. Ether, the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market value, dropped (-143pc) to $US1,545. Its price often moves in tandem with bitcoin, and has shed more than 30 per cent of its value since last week's record peak. Crypto markets have been running hot this year as big money managers and companies begin to take the emerging asset class seriously, piling money into the sector and driving confidence among small-time speculators. The cryptocurrency's rapid gains in recent months have led to calls from governments and financial regulators for tighter regulation. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said earlier this week that bitcoin was extremely inefficient at conducting transactions and was a highly speculative asset. Bitcoin's high volatility, critics say, is among reasons that it has so far failed to gain widespread traction as a means of payment - an expectation that has in part fuelled its rally. The mobile payments firm Square has bought an extra $US170 million worth of bitcoin, and its chief executive Jack Dorsey has promised to ""double down"" on its commitment to the world's biggest cryptocurrency. ""The Internet needs a native currency, and we believe bitcoin is it,"" said Mr Dorsey, the longtime bitcoin enthusiast who is also the CEO of Twitter. Square bought 3,318 bitcoins in the December quarter, adding to the mainstream acceptance of the digital currency that has been winning support from several big investors. ""By us owning bitcoin, our incentives are aligned with skin in the game,"" Dorsey said on a post-earnings conference call with analysts. Square has been involved with the currency for years and its Cash App, a payments service, has allowed users to trade it since 2018. The app had three million active bitcoin customers in 2020, with a million new users buying the cryptocurrency for the first time in January, the company said. In October last year, Square bought about 4,709 bitcoins at around $US50 million. In its latest purchase, Square paid more than $US51,200 per bitcoin, according to Reuters' calculations, which is far higher than they were currently worth. Square's revenue in the quarter more than doubled to $US3.16 billion, which the company said was helped by bitcoin purchases on Cash App. Square's gross profit on bitcoin trading rose 13 times in the December quarter, but it was still just a minor part (2pc) of its revenue from the cryptocurrency. Its bitcoin holdings are now worth about 5 per cent of its $US4.4 billion cash pile. The company posted adjusted earnings of 32 US cents per share, beating market expectation of 24 US cents. Its share price on the New York Stock Exchange fell (-4.3pc) to $US256.59 per share. US markets experienced another volatile day, with the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq all in negative territory, earlier on Tuesday local time. However, market sentiment recovered sharply in the final hour of trade. Far from jumping in to stop an emerging housing bubble, policymakers are keen to let it run in the vain hope it may kick-start the economy, writes Ian Verrender. The Nasdaq Composite closed (-0.5pc) lower at 13,485 points. At its worst, the tech-heavy index had plunged 4 per cent before its eleventh-hour turnaround. The Dow Jones index went up 14 points (flat) to 31,631 (after recovering from a 360-point drop overnight). The benchmark S&P 500 reversed a 1.8 per cent loss, ending marginally higher (+0.1pc) to 3,890 points. Apple's share price was slightly weaker (-0.1pc), after falling 6 per cent earlier in its up-and-down session. The S&P energy sector was the best performer, gaining 1.6 per cent thanks to soaring oil prices. America's oil and gas stocks have jumped almost 27 per cent since the year began. ""People are buying the dip, a move that's been rewarded for months in a one-sided market,"" said Dennis Dick, head of market structure and a proprietary trader at Bright Trading. ""It's tough to be a bear, it's really tough. The only fear out there is the fear of missing out."" It may not generally involve a printing press, but the RBA has been busy creating billions of dollars out of thin air. David Taylor explains how it does it. The decline in tech stocks and rise in value stocks, along with copper and crude oil, show investors are rotating into assets that are expected to do well in an improving economy, Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at ThinkMarkets in London, said. But the equity decline is a warning sign that risks must be heeded and investors should not be so reckless or deceived by markets at extremely high levels, he added. ""It's more of a rotation story than of stocks topping out. So the dips will be bought,"" Mr Razaqzada said. ""The market is up almost in a straight line. You've got to have the market correct."" Oil prices jumped overnight, underpinned by optimism over COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and lower output as US supplies were slow to return after a deep freeze in Texas shut crude production last week. Brent crude futures lifted (+0.9pc) to $US65.84 per barrel. Gold slid as the dollar rebounded from six-week lows, with spot prices falling (-0.2pc) to $US1,805.05 an ounce. Wall Street's late-stage recovery was helped by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, who gave some reassuring remarks when he testified before the US Senate Banking Committee overnight. Mr Powell said the US economic recovery remained ""uneven and far from complete"", and that it would be ""some time"" before the Fed considered changing policies aimed at helping regain full employment. He also pushed back on suggestions the Fed's zero interest rate and quantitative easing policies — colloquially referred to as ""money printing"" — risked unleashing inflation and financial risks in what may be an emerging economic boom. ""Monetary policy is accommodative and it continues to need to be accommodative,"" Mr Powell said. While Australia is in its first recession in almost three decades, not all businesses are struggling. Some have boosted profits during the pandemic. ""Expect us to move carefully, patiently, and with a lot of advance warning,"" before any changes, he added. This was in response to questions from Republican lawmakers about whether a faster-than-expected recovery still required crisis-level stimulus measures. When asked what his message was to financial markets, Powell did not talk about the risks of rising bond yields or a possible spike in inflation, but of the roughly 10 million jobs still missing compared to a year ago, and the need for the US central bank's policy to stay wide open until that is fixed. Interest rates will remain low and the Fed's $US120 billion in monthly bond purchases will continue ""at least at the current pace until we make substantial further progress towards our goals ... which we have not really been making,"" Mr Powell said in the hearing. In summary, the Fed chair believes monetary policy needs to be supportive and that there is a long way to go to repair the jobs market and before inflation becomes a concern, Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston, says. ""I'm not anticipating any changes to monetary policy any time soon,"" Mr Arone said, a view that should ease market concerns that the Fed could boost interest rates to tap down inflation. ""US 10-year Treasury rates have climbed very quickly in a short amount of time. And that has spooked investors.""

225,analysis: Recent moves in this market could spark the 'long overdue correction' in share prices,markets,"  Interest rates are rising and tech stocks are likely to head in the other direction We live in strange and ridiculous times. Nowhere is this more evident than on financial markets. After blithely trading on to record highs while the seeds of a pandemic germinated in China in January and February last year, supposedly forward-looking share markets cratered when the obvious became apparent in late February and March. Then, with almost as much panic as the sell-off, shares came roaring back in a speculative frenzy, leaving many markets (notably the US) hitting fresh records, even as the nations they were based in suffered their sharpest recessions since at least the Great Depression. As is often the case, once the buying started, it seemed the less connected a stock or other asset was to an identifiable income stream the faster and higher it rose. Bitcoin anyone. As bitcoin continues to power to fresh record highs investors are jumping onboard in FOMO. Why? In part, it was the forward-looking nature of markets, with early bets on the vaccines, which are only now just being rolled out, ending the pandemic. But the biggest driving force was the unprecedented flood of money and record-low interest rates from central banks that has left the world awash with ultra-cheap cash with few financially rational places left to invest it. When the real rate of return on 'safe' assets, like AAA-rated government bonds, is deeply negative — you are losing money holding them — the cost of parking money in assets that offer no income but the potential for speculative gains falls and the temptation rises dramatically. Along with growing disquiet and distrust around the central bank actions that have pushed interest rates so low, these negative rates are a major reason why professional investors have been right in there with amateurs throwing money at bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as well as tech companies that either make no profits or generate earnings that are a fraction of their soaring share market valuations. For more conservative investors, the perceived safety of bricks and mortar has been the investment of choice. So, now that these benchmark bond rates have begun rising, sharply, it's no wonder many investors are starting to sweat. Far from jumping in to stop an emerging housing bubble, policymakers are keen to let it run in the vain hope it may kick-start the economy, writes Ian Verrender. For some, the heat is getting too much and they're fleeing the kitchen, causing sell-offs in the most vulnerable markets, such as tech stocks and cryptocurrencies. AMP Capital's head of investment strategy Shane Oliver says we could see further sell-downs but not, he thinks, a crash. ""Bond yields [interest rates] could still go a lot higher in the short term before they settle down again and this could cause the long overdue correction in equities,"" he says. As we've seen in the sell-offs so far, companies that don't make profits and speculative assets with no income streams are the most vulnerable, but others are also at risk. ""Particularly at risk are tech and healthcare stocks that will see less of a cyclical uplift in earnings and trade on higher PEs [price-to-earnings ratios],"" Mr Oliver explains. ""Because these stocks rely on more earnings in the future, they are seen as 'long duration' stocks and so they are more vulnerable to an increase in the bond yield used to discount those earnings. ""Also at risk, but less so, are yield plays [higher dividend stocks] that benefited from the 'search for yield' flowing from falling interest rates and bond yields — e.g. telcos and utility stocks. ""Cyclical stocks like materials [miners/energy producers], retailers, industrials and even financials are less at risk as their earnings will rise more with economic recovery and so are more likely to see earnings upgrades."" And this is exactly what we've seen on share markets over the past 24 hours, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq down but Australia's commodity and banking dominated ASX 200 index rising solidly. This may prove to be a short-term hiccup, with central banks once again moving in to soothe the jitters. The Reserve Bank tried to do this on Monday after the three-year bond yield rose above its 0.1 per cent target, but the market practically laughed off its billion-dollar intervention. It may not generally involve a printing press, but the RBA has been busy creating billions of dollars out of thin air. David Taylor explains how it does it. Most RBA watchers expect it to follow singer Janis Joplin's advice to ""try just a little bit harder"". ""The most likely response from the RBA is a show of resolve, with significantly increased YCC [yield curve control] buying in coming days and weeks,"" say CBA's rate watchers. The US Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, has had his turn, with the opportunity to offer soothing words talking down the risk of rising interest rates during two days of public congressional testimony. And the market verdict is that the Fed chair managed to walk a narrow tightrope; after an initial heavy sell-off, tech stocks pared their losses. Mr Powell did this by tacitly endorsing the rise in bond yields: ""In a way, it's a statement on confidence on the part of markets that we will have a robust and ultimately complete recovery."" At the same time he committed to holding interest rates around zero and keeping money pumping into the US economy. ""The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved,"" he said. Effectively, Mr Powell delivered on the Goldilocks story that has got US markets trading at record highs — you can have your economic recovery and your super low interest rates too. That's exactly what Rabobank's head of financial markets research in the Asia-Pacific, Michael Every, expected would happen. ""If central banks were to act otherwise right now, they really would be sawing market prices in half — at least,"" he warns. ""Indeed, if those magicians have to face a choice between rising real rates and levitating markets, which one do you think they will make disappear? Obviously rising yields, through outright yield curve control. ""At which point, almost all price discovery will follow through the hidden trap door."" In other words, if money is free for big investors and they think central banks will keep the party going indefinitely the sky is no limit for asset prices. The irony is that the rising bond yields are a sign that economies are recovering from COVID-19, that firms will be able to increase both sales and prices, and that profits should rise. Australia has just recorded its worst economic contraction on record, so why are we still talking about a recession not a depression? Michael Janda explains. They should be welcome good news after the worst year for most economies since the 1930s. But investors are simply petrified that any recovery in economic growth and profits won't keep up with the rise of interest rates from rock bottom levels. Remember, at current levels with US 10-year bond yields still below 1.5 per cent, a return to something even approaching a more normal rate of 3 per cent would see interest rates more than double. That's one of the traps of ultra-low rates — a small percentage point increase is a massive percentage rise in interest costs. But, while central banks may move to keep a lid on rising rates in the short term to buy markets a bit more time, it's unlikely they can keep doing that indefinitely. ""It is again magical thinking to believe this trick can be pulled off without literally bringing down the house,"" argues Michael Every. ""Decades of inequality-driving neoliberalism followed by unlimited free money only for the people who drove that same policy to prevent a Minsky moment [financial crash] comes at a political price."" Shane Oliver is less dramatic in his forecast, but still sees a return to the gravity of higher interest rates as inevitable. ""There is a strong case to be made that the disinflation seen since the 1970s is coming to an end and that the long-term trend in inflation is at or close to bottoming,"" he observes. ""Central banks are now throwing the kitchen sink at beating deflation and disinflation just as they threw it at high inflation in the 1980s and early 1990s. ""There is a good chance — that helped along by massive government spending, governments becoming more interventionist in economies, a reversal in globalisation and a decline in workers relative to consumers — they will win this time, ultimately resulting in a sustained rise in inflation, but that’s probably still a few years away."" Hopefully, enough time for policymakers, investors and consumers to figure out how they are going to survive financially in a world of higher interest rates.

226,"Aussie dollar climbs to three-year high, with ASX rising as Nasdaq sinks on tech sell-off",markets,"  Australian dollar climbs to three-year high, with ASX rising as Nasdaq sinks on tech sell-off Despite a shaky start, the Australian share market has finished the day higher, following a big sell-off across Wall Street's major tech stocks, while commodity prices continued to surge. The benchmark ASX 200 closed 58 points higher (+0.9pc) at 6,839, but that was after swinging between positive and negative territory a few times. The broader All Ordinaries index had also struggled for direction, but gained 49 points (+0.7pc) to end at 7,111 points. Meanwhile, bitcoin has dropped from its record high levels, insurance giant Allianz is being prosecuted for allegedly lying about the extent of its travel insurance coverage, and Freedom Foods has been sued in a second class action by angry shareholders. By 4:15pm AEDT, the Australian dollar went up (+0.6pc) to 79.18 US cents as the greenback slipped to an almost six-week low. It climbed as high as 79.29 US cents overnight, the local currency's strongest level since early February 2018. ""Widespread gains in commodity prices and an increase in Australian interest rates compared to US interest rates were behind the lift in the Australian dollar,"" said Commonwealth Bank currency strategist Joseph Capurso. ""Our fair value equation for the Australian dollar — based on commodity prices and interest rate differentials — suggests 82 US cents is within reach."" Rising oil and metal prices have been a boon for commodity-linked currencies, which has boosted the Australian and New Zealand dollars in particular. The price of Australia's key export, iron ore, rose (+1.4pc) to $US175.96 a tonne. Benchmark copper prices shot above $US9,000 for the first time since 2011. Overnight, it jumped (+1.9pc) to $US9,075.50 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange. Local tech-related stocks like Afterpay (-7.2pc), Zip Co (-3.4pc), Nearmap (-6.1pc) and Xero (-2.7pc) suffered heavy falls. However, they were among the stocks that performed best during the pandemic as investors drove up ""growth stocks"". Markets are beginning to worry that a global economic recovery will bring about higher inflation, which could lead to governments winding back trillions of dollars worth of stimulus and central banks hiking interest rates again. Download the ABC News app for all the latest. ""A higher interest rate environment forces investors to consider the opportunity costs of investments,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney. ""Stocks that have significant borrowing, or produce no income for investors, may be particularly vulnerable."" Shares of Seek (-7.1pc), Domino's Pizza (-8.9pc), Lynas Rare Earths (-5.8pc) and G8 Education (-7.3pc) also dropped sharply. Seek has revealed that it appointed Ian Narev (its operations head and former boss of Commonwealth Bank) as its new chief executive, the online jobs portal said on Tuesday. Mr Narev left Australia's biggest bank three years ago after a money laundering scandal rocked CBA. The job-hunting website also said it was in talks with a consortium to sell down its Chinese subsidiary, Zhaopin, for around $2.2 billion. The talks are at an advanced stage, Seek said, adding that its stake would be reduced to around 23.5 per cent (down from 61 per cent) if the deal went ahead. Brokerage firm Jefferies said it was ""disappointed"" with the $2.2 billion tag as it was 45 per cent lower than its market value. Shipbuilder Austal was one of the worst performers, after its share price plunged (-10.9pc) to $2.20. This was after the company said the president of its US division, Craig Perciavalle, had resigned. Austal also said it was being investigated by three regulators in regards to ""historical matters"" linked with its Littoral Combat Ship Program. Those regulators include the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), the US Department of Justice and the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). In May, the company received a $350 million lifeline from the Australian government to build six new patrol boats, with the aim to keep hundreds of local jobs afloat during the pandemic. Bank of Queensland surged (+12.7pc) to $9.21, after confirming, on Tuesday, that it will take over ME Bank for $1.3 billion. It was also BoQ's first day back on the market after its shares were placed in a three-day trading halt, ahead of its deal announcement. Energy and travel stocks were the best performers, including Oil Search (+6.4pc), Beach Energy (+7pc), Qantas (+4.4pc), Flight Centre (+6.2pc) and Sydney Airport (+6.5pc). Oil Search reported that its full-year underlying profit tanked (-93pc), hurt by a slump in realised oil prices as demand took a dive due to the coronavirus outbreak. The Papua New Guinea-focused explorer said its core profit after tax fell to $22 million (down from $320.9 million a year ago). It beat market expectations, as analysts were expecting the company to post a core loss of $24.7 million, according to Refinitiv IBES. The company declared a final dividend of 50 US cents per share (a big drop from last year's $US4.50 per share). Insurance underwriter Allianz Australia and its distributor AWP Australia have been hit with criminal charges for making false or misleading statements about the sale of domestic and international travel insurance. Travelling overseas? Unless you booked your travel insurance before late January, it's unlikely you'll be covered for anything related to the coronavirus. The corporate regulator ASIC alleges that Allianz and AWP misled consumers about the level of coverage they would receive under those policies between 2016 and 2018. ASIC claims that Allianz advertised, on its website, the maximum travel insurance benefits payable to customers, but failed to disclose terms, conditions or exclusions that would limit those benefits. Allianz was indicted with seven counts of making false or misleading statements, while AWP was hit with one charge. Representatives of both companies appeared today at the Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney, and the matter is listed for further mention on April 20. The matter is being prosecuted by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, on behalf of ASIC. Under the Corporations Act (section 1041E), a company that makes false or misleading statements could face these penalties: The embattled cereal maker Freedom Foods is being sued in a second class action, for alleged breaches of the ASIC Act, along with company and consumer legislation. Freedom Foods said this lawsuit was filed in the Victorian Supreme Court against itself, and its auditors Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. The aggrieved shareholders will be represented by law firm Phi Finny McDonald, and the case is being backed by litigation funder Omni Bridgeway. The first class action was filed in December by Slater & Gordon Lawyers, also in Victoria's highest court. The company's shares have been suspended from trading since June last year due to its accounting scandal. It is also being investigated by the corporate regulator, after revealing that its previous financial results were inaccurate. In particular, its full-year profit of $11.6 million (in the 2018-19) was suddenly ""restated"" as a massive $145.8 million loss. It has also experienced rapid turnover among its senior leadership, with its former chief executive Rory Macleod and chief financial officer (CFO) Campbell Nicholas forced to quit in mid-2020. Earlier this month chairman Perry Gunner, part-owner Ron Perich and non-executive director Trevor Allen stepped down from Freedom's board of directors. Its acting CFO Stephanie Graham submitted her resignation on Friday. The volatile cryptocurrency bitcoin crashed below $US48,000 overnight, a big fall compared to Monday's record high of $US58,354. It has since recovered much of those losses, but is still down (-11.5pc) to $US49,314 over the past 24 hours. Is all that Reddit lingo about GameStop making your head spin? Here's your shortcut guide. The value of cryptocurrencies lost a bit of their shine on Monday local time, when US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen issued a warning about its limitations. ""I don't think that bitcoin ... is widely used as a transaction mechanism,"" she said at a New York Times Dealbook online event. ""To the extent it is used I fear it's often for illicit finance. ""It's an extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions, and the amount of energy that's consumed in processing those transactions is staggering."" Bitcoin was still up more than 80 per cent since the year started, and its total market value has surpassed $US1 trillion. It has also skyrocketed by nearly 1,200 per cent since its lows from March 2020. Tesla boss Elon Musk, whose tweets on bitcoin have added fuel to the digital currency's rally, said on the weekend that the price of bitcoin and rival cryptocurrency ethereum seemed high. Last week, Mr Musk remarked that he found the prospect of holding bitcoin ""adventurous"" for an S&P 500 company. But on Saturday, he tweeted: ""Money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of barter ..."" ""That said, BTC [bitcoin] & ETH [ethereum] do seem high lol."" Ethereum (or ether) is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation and daily volume. Its value dropped (-14.9pc) to $US1,580 on Tuesday afternoon, after hitting a record high of $US2,037 on the weekend. Earlier this month, Mr Musk's electric car company Tesla said it had invested $US1.5 billion in bitcoin, and will accept the cryptocurrency as a payment method in the ""near future"". Tesla is estimated to have made around $US1 billion from its bitcoin investment, according to research note from Los Angeles-based Wedbush Securities — more than it made from selling cars last year. Spot gold rose (+2pc) to $US1,811.46 an ounce, its highest level in nearly a week — but that was after some heavy losses recently. ""Gold prices fell to an eight-month low late last week, following the surge in bond yields, but is now trending up again,"" ANZ's head of global economics, Brian Martin, said. The Australian Government has purchased $94m of oil at rock bottom prices, but where will it be stored and how will it contribute to fuel security? ""It was well-supported throughout the pandemic as investors sought a haven for funds. ""But the tide is turning, as interest rates start to rise and investors rekindle their love of bonds."" Oil prices jumped to their highest level in more than a year, with the international benchmark (Brent) gaining 22 per cent since the year began. Brent crude futures surged (+1.8pc) to $US66.44. That was on top of its 4.5 per cent surge overnight. ""Investors are increasingly confident that economic conditions will improve as vaccines halt the COVID-19 spread and allow movement restrictions to be eased,"" Mr Martin added. ""Supply is still constrained, leading to the prospect of further tightness in the global crude oil market."" In contrast, global markets fell overnight on Monday local time on bets of a faster economic recovery, and rising fixed-income, or bond, yields making share prices, which are near record highs, look over-valued in comparison. On Wall Street, high-growth stocks — including Facebook (-0.5pc), Amazon (-2.1pc), Apple (-3pc), Netflix (-1.2pc), Google's parent company Alphabet (-1.7pc), Tesla (-8.6pc) and Microsoft (2.7pc) — pulled the Nasdaq down and weighed on the S&P. While Australia is in its first recession in almost three decades, not all businesses are struggling. Some have boosted profits during the pandemic. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed sharply lower (-2.5pc) at 13,533 points overnight, while the benchmark S&P 500 index dropped (-0.8pc) to 3,876. The Dow Jones index crept marginally higher (+0.1pc) to 31,522. In Europe, Germany's DAX fell (-0.3pc), while Britain's FTSE 100 index retreated (-0.2pc). Bond yields have risen sharply this month as prospects for more US fiscal stimulus have boosted hopes for a faster economic recovery globally, which would also lift inflation. The returns for America's 10-year Treasury bonds rose to 1.369 per cent (up 2 basis points). In comparison, the Australian equivalent lifted to 1.65 per cent (up 5 basis points), and its yields are back to pre-COVID levels. Investors have also been buying economically sensitive cyclical stocks, such as the energy sector, and selling growth stocks like technology companies to prepare for a potential spike in inflation with the US Congress poised to pass a $US1.9 trillion stimulus bill. ""If interest rates are expected to rise, then that would reduce the intrinsic value of growth stocks,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. US economic growth, as measured by GDP, is expected to run hotter than at any time in the past 35 years, and business investment is expected to run twice as fast as the broad economy, according to Credit Suisse.

227,"Avocados and berries boost Costa Group profits, ASX closes Monday flat",markets,"  ASX closes flat as avocados and blueberries boost Costa Group profits The Australian share market has ended Monday slightly down after enduring a dip in last week's trade. The ASX 200 opened the day 0.2 per cent down and, despite some rises throughout the day, dipped again in the afternoon. It ended the day 0.2 per cent down to 6,781 points. The All Ords closed flat at 7,062. On Friday the ASX 200 suffered its second-worst day of 2021, with a loss of 1.3 per cent. Energy stocks performed well. BHP was Monday's top performer with a gain of 3.5 per cent, while Beach Energy was up 1.6 per cent. Travel stocks also saw some positive movement. That came as borders reopen again after Victoria's snap COVID-19 lockdown and the travel bubble with New Zealand resumes. Webjet gained 9 per cent, although it still has a while to recover from its last high in December, when the nation was feeling even more optimistic about travelling. Qantas is up 4.3 per cent just a few days before the Australian icon is set to report its profits amid the ongoing pandemic. The airline still has a long way to go before returning to its pre-pandemic share price. It has already been flagging that it does not expect international travel to return until later in 2020 at least. Technology and healthcare stocks took a hit on Monday. The worst performers were ARB Corp (-4.9pc), Appen (-4.6pc) and the pharmaceuticals provider Ansell (-4.4pc) Costa Group's share price rose 11.7 per cent in one day after positive results. The fruit and vegetables grower and packer took a hit to its profit in 2019 amid drought conditions, debt, oversupply and issues with supplying to China. Its share price tumbled sharply after that announcement. But its 2020 full-year results, announced on Monday, showed it had turned around its fortunes to boast a full-year statutory net profit of more than $60 million. As it recovered from drought-growing conditions, the average Australian's enduring love of the humble avocado helped boost sales for the conglomerate farming company. ""Higher avocado pricing contributed to positive performance versus budget,"" the company announced. It was a similar story for blueberries, which saw a price increase during COVID-19. Costa Group said it grew double the amount of blueberries in 2020 than the year before, with 1,700 tonnes of the sweet little berry grown and sold. It also had success with its citrus production, such as lemons and oranges. ""It should be noted that China trade tensions are having a minimal impact on our citrus exports, with less than 5 per cent of our total citrus exports going to China."" NIB recorded a 16 per cent increase in net profit, but is warning that there may be a catch-up in people seeking treatment once the threat of COVID-19 abates further. The company posted a net profit after tax of $66.2 million, even though total group revenue fell 1.1 per cent to $1.3 billion, as its travel, international student and worker insurance businesses were hit hard by the pandemic. Claims expenses rose a mere 0.9 per cent. The insurer attributes part of the smaller-than-usual increase to people delaying non-essential surgeries due to COVID-19. ""Profitability has been slightly distorted by COVID-19 and consequential delays in treatment and claims, which is still playing out,"" NIB chief executive Mark Fitzgibbon said. ""There may be, for many, a natural aversion to going to hospital and other forms of treatment involving close contact as a result of COVID-19."" On the other hand, NIB reported a 2.7 per cent increase in member numbers, growing premium income by 2.2 per cent despite a six-month postponement of the 2020 premium increase. Mr Fitzgibbon said a pleasing detail of the membership increase was the age of those joining, with more than half under 40 years old. ""Our experience helps counter all the negative talk about the value of private health insurance, and COVID-19 has clearly raised people’s awareness about the risk of disease and the need for protection,"" he added. NIB announced an unchanged interim dividend of 10 cents per share. Its share price jumped 6.4 per cent to $5.74. BlueScope Steel reported a 78 per cent increase in its half-year profit. The steelmaker said its net profit rose 78 per cent to $330 million in the six months to December 31, propelled by booming Australian demand for steel products as residential construction accelerated and the big shift to regional centres brought extra demand. Its share price ended the day 2.3 per cent higher. This came as the resources company also announced a chief executive for climate change within the group. The Bank of Queensland has confirmed it will buy ME Bank for $1.3 billion. (More on that story here.) BoQ has been in a trading halt since last week when it started revenue raising for the speculated deal. The bank said would fund the deal via a $1.35 billion equity raising. The deal is expected to be finalised by August. Meanwhile, shares in Macquarie Group hit near a one-year high after announcing that its FY2021 profit should be as much as 10 per cent higher than the previous year. The asset management and investment banking giant said there had been a rise in demand for gas and power in North America as a result of extreme winter conditions. Unusually cold weather in several US states has led to days of electricity outages, with Texas particularly hard hit. ""Extreme winter weather conditions in North America have significantly increased short-term client demand for Macquarie's capabilities in maintaining critical physical supply across the commodity complex,"" the company said in a statement.

228,"ASX endures second-worst day of 2021; Facebook has been 'dead money for months', analysts say",markets,"  ASX endures second-worst day of 2021, Facebook could face 'tightened' EU regulation Australian shares have suffered their second-worst day since the year began, as Wall Street eased off its record highs and Facebook shares were sold off more heavily than other tech stocks. The ASX 200 index closed 92 points (or 1.3 per cent) lower at 6,794. The broader All Ordinaries index also fell by a similar level to 7,064 points, wiping out all its gains from the past two weeks. In fact, the last time the market experienced such heavy falls (in a single day) was January 28 — when it shed 1.9 per cent. The Australian dollar rose was steady at 77.72 US cents. Bitcoin has pulled back slightly from the record high ($US52,622) it reached on Thursday. The volatile cryptocurrency last traded at $US51,357 on Friday afternoon. Spot gold was down (-0.4pc) to $US1,769.31 an ounce. Brent crude oil futures dropped (-2.4pc) to $US62.46, down from its 13-month high. Friday's worst performers were Treasury Wine Estates (-6.9pc), IPH (-6.4c), along with oil and gas companies Oil Search (-4.5pc) and Woodside Petroleum (-5.3pc), BlueScope Steel (-5pc) and Iluka Resources (-4.6pc). Woodside said it had signed a contract to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) to wholesale energy trader RWE Supply & Trading for a term of seven years, starting in 2025. Download the ABC News app for all the latest. The agreement, signed through its subsidiary, Woodside Energy Trading Singapore Pte, is for supply of 0.84 million tonnes of LNG per year from the company's global portfolio. Australia's biggest independent gas producer says the agreement underscores expectations of strong market demand for LNG in the second half of the decade. However, the broader market was weighed down by ASX heavyweights BHP (-2.5pc), Rio Tinto (-3.3pc), Fortescue Metals (-3.7pc), Commonwealth Bank (-1.3pc), CSL (-5pc), Macquarie Group (-2.3pc), Westpac (-1.1pc) and NAB (-1.6pc). On the flip side, Crown Resorts (+5.3pc), Zip Co (+5.6pc), Inghams (+3.6pc) and Orora (+2.4pc) enjoyed solid gains. Cochlear shares soared (+8.4pc) after the company said it would resume paying dividends with an interim payout of $1.15 per share. As social distancing rules and fear kept people away from the shops, online sales have taken off and many analysts say a lot of consumers will not return in-store. The hearing implant maker reported an underlying first-half profit of $125.3 million (down 6 per cent on the prior year). The company also said its results were helped by improved surgery rates across most markets following the disruption caused by COVID-19. Shares in QBE Insurance initially fell sharply but ended sharply higher (+3.1pc). That was despite the fact it will not pay a final dividend. However, it expects to resume paying dividends of ""up to 65 per cent of adjusted cash profits"" during its next set of results. The insurer also posted a wider annual loss than it forecast two months ago due to surging COVID-related provisions and catastrophe claims. It swung to a $1.5 billion full-year loss, which was a steep downgrade from last year's $550 million profit. Shares in Facebook fell (-1.5pc) as investors assessed the wider ramifications of its move to block all news content in Australia. Australians were blocked from accessing news in their Facebook feeds on Thursday, in a dramatic escalation of the social media giant's stand-off with the federal government over its proposed media bargaining laws. ""The market was reacting to information which may support the argument that Facebook is now too big, and needs more anti-monopolistic regulation put in place to maintain a level playing field for competition,"" said Chris Pedersen, the chief executive of Pedersen Asset Management. ""It is really about Facebook wanting to be one-stop shopping for all your information sources. ""This is a monopolistic business plan — it's the end result of a tremendously successful business model. Free market economics and capitalism at work."" The social media giant was sold off more heavily than its tech-related peers, including Apple (-0.9pc), Netflix (-0.6pc), Google's parent company Alphabet (-0.6pc), Tesla (-1.4pc) and Microsoft (-0.2pc). This was part of a broader tech and communications sector pullback, given those two sectors (alone) have driven a 76 per cent surge in the benchmark index (the S&P 500) since its March 2020 lows. Facebook was the clear underperformer, but any impact on its share price as a result of the Australian ""news ban"" appears to be relatively minor (at best) in the eyes of Wall Street investors. Facebook's sudden move to ban Australians from accessing news could backfire if users and advertisers walk away, writes Nassim Khadem. ""Facebook has been dead money for months and lack of near-term catalysts remain a reality,"" said Joel Kulina, head of technology and media trading at Wedbush Securities. He said Pinterest, Twitter, Snap and Google were better investments, for those betting on a ""huge recovery in digital ad spending"". ""Facebook’s sequential advertising growth of 28 per cent appeared impressive until you see that industry data (provided by Kenshoo) shows social media ad spend jumped 61 per cent (over the past quarter), and 39 per cent (in the past year)."" InvestSMART's chief market strategist Evan Lucas believes there could be longer-term ramifications for the company as ""people might see this as Facebook abusing its market power to curb 'free media' to some extent"". ""The world paid close attention to what Facebook did in Australia, and it could potentially strengthen the case for US anti-trust laws being tightened,"" he said. ""That wouldn't be good for Facebook's business, especially if it is forced to sell WhatsApp or Instagram down the line. ""But the EU [European Union] is a bigger concern for Facebook, as they're thinking of passing similar legislation to Australia. ""Europe is a bigger fish to fry than Australia. So if the EU started charging Facebook for their media content, that could have a material impact on its bottom line."" Australia's retail industry saw weaker-than-expected sales in January as a coronavirus lockdown in Brisbane kept shoppers at home. The tech giant says news makes up less than 4 per cent of people's feeds, but you may notice a difference. Let's unpack what the changes mean for you. Sales rose slightly (+0.6pc) in January, compared to the previous month, according to the Bureau of Statistics' preliminary estimates. This result was below expectations as the market had expected a 2 per cent bounce in retail trade. However, last month's sales of $30.54 billion were significantly higher (+10.7pc) than where they were in January 2020, before the pandemic hit. Queensland sales dropped (-1.5pc) as as COVID-19 restrictions in Brisbane hit household goods retailing, clothing, footwear and department stores. Retail activity has been wildly volatile in recent months amid lockdowns and massively popular online sale events, with spending surging (+7.1pc) in November only to dive (-4.1pc) in December. ""There is clear momentum in the consumer sector thanks to supportive government policies, low interest rates and a recovering labour market,"" said AMP Capital senior economist Diana Mousina. ""This momentum is evident in other parts of the economy, especially in the housing market, with national capital city home prices nearing their record highs again."" The ABS will release its final retail sales figures on March 4. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones index finished trading 120 points (or 0.4 per cent) lower at 31,493. Tech giants may have to make it clearer to consumers how their private information is used, get proper consent and face significant penalties for breaching privacy laws. The S&P 500 dropped (-0.4pc) to 3,914, its third straight day of losses. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped (-0.7pc) to 13,865. Earlier this week, a stronger-than-expected earnings season, progress in vaccination efforts across the United States, and hopes of a $US1.9 trillion stimulus package helped US markets hit hit fresh records. However, concerns over a potential rise in inflation have pushed investors to cash out on stocks with high valuation in the S&P 500 — the tech giants in particular. ""There was a lot of irrational exuberance built into things heading into the year ... then we started to enter an environment where risk actually became a factor once again, and notably inflationary risk,"" said Peter Essele, head of portfolio management at Commonwealth Financial Network in Boston. ""Now it's a question of whether the fundamentals are going to match the level of prices that currently exist in the market."" Market sentiment was weighed weighed down by disappointing job figures which pointed to a fragile economic recovery from the pandemic. The US Labor Department's latest report showed that initial claims for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly to 861,000 last week (compared with 848,000 in the prior week).

229,"Crown suffers big loss, Fortescue and CSL profits jump, while ASX ends flat and bitcoin hits new record",markets,"  Crown suffers massive loss, Fortescue and CSL profits jump, while ASX ends flat and bitcoin hits new record The Australian market struggled for direction for much of its day after a volatile session on Wall Street, while bitcoin surged above $US52,000 — a new record high. The benchmark ASX 200 index finished trading flat at 6,885 points, after dipping in and out of negative territory several times. The broader All Ordinaries index was largely unchanged, falling 3 points to close at 7,152. The Australian dollar was steady at 77.55 US cents. Overall, the market was unfazed by the latest job figures, which showed Australia's official unemployment rate fell to 6.4 per cent in January. It was a slight decrease compared to December's unemployment figure of 6.6 per cent. The ABS also said 29,000 people started a new job that month, which was the ""peak holiday period"". Download the ABC News app for all the latest. Several major companies have reported their earnings today, including ANZ, CSL, Fortescue Metals and Wesfarmers, which saw their profits surge. Meanwhile, Crown Resorts and Woodside Petroleum announced huge losses, while Origin Energy, South32 reported much weaker profits. Some of today's best performers were IPH (+9.8pc), Tabcorp (+5.7pc), Domino's Pizza (+5.6pc) and Orora (+5.5pc). However, Treasury Wine Estates experienced the biggest gains. Its shares jumped (+17.5pc) despite yesterday's 43 per cent slump in half-year profit. The company, which makes Penfold's and Wolf Blass wine, said it would restructure into three internal divisions and likely sell its low-priority brands. Investment bank Morgan Stanley said the winemaker's earnings (outside of Asia) were 20 per cent higher than its low expectations. UBS also said Treasury's earnings were better than expected. On the flip side, mining services contractor NRW Holdings reported its profit dropped (-13pc) to $29 million. That led to its shares plunging (-17.1pc) to $2.32. GPT Group (-3.6pc), Perpetual (-6.2pc) Janus Henderson (-3.5pc), along with gold stocks like Resolute Mining (-3.1pc) and St Barbara (-4.6pc) also fell sharply. They were weighed down gold prices, which fell heavily overnight (down more than 1 per cent). However, the precious metal's spot price has since recovered (+0.3pc) to $US1,782 an ounce. Brent crude oil futures jumped (+1.3pc) to $US65.17 a barrel, its highest level in 13 months. Fortescue Metals will pay its shareholders a higher-than-expected interim dividend of $1.47 per share (up from 76 cents last year) — joining peers BHP and Rio Tinto in feeding gains from strong iron ore prices back to investors. The payout sent a $1.65 billion windfall to the company's largest shareholder, Andrew Forrest, who is Australia's second richest person with a net worth of $23 billion, according to Forbes. Some of Australia's leading labour market analysts warn wages stagnation is undermining financial stability and social cohesion and there is no improvement in sight. The iron ore miner's first-half profit was $US4.1 billion (up from $US2.45 billion a year earlier). China's focus on infrastructure last year has driven iron ore prices to a nine-year high. Spot iron ore (at the 62 per cent iron index) is trading around $US167 a tonne, after nearly doubling in the past year. Fortescue also provided an upbeat forecast, and expects iron ore shipments to be in the range of 178-182 million tonnes for the financial year (up from a prior range of 175-180 million tonnes). The company also said it would allocate 10 per cent of its net profits after tax to fund renewable energy growth through its new unit, Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) and 10 per cent to fund other resource growth opportunities. The miner's share price climbed (+1.9pc) to $24.88. Crown Resorts reported a loss of $120.9 million in the half-year ended December 31, as COVID-19 restrictions kept the beleaguered casino operator's Melbourne site closed for most of the period. It was a big downgrade, compared to its half-year profit of $218.2 million a year ago. Damning evidence was presented at a public inquiry into Crown's operations. Is this a new era of accountability for the gaming sector? The Victorian government had imposed strict capacity rules at the site, and fewer people attended other venues as border restrictions separated Australia's three most populous states NSW, Victoria and Queensland. The James Packer-backed company said it logged costs of about $58.1 million relating to the mandated closures. Crown is also beset by a growing a list of executive departures in the past fortnight. The company said general counsel Mary Manos would step down and the role would be separated from company secretary to double-down focus on legal and governance compliance. The changes represent a further improvement in governance for Crown, in compliance with the recent inquiry's report recommendation of a board upheaval, said Helen Coonan, executive chairwoman. Ms Coonan, who assumed the role earlier this week after the resignation of chief executive Ken Barton, would see her pay surge nearly fourfold to $2.5 million a year, the company revealed. Crown's bleak financial performance comes amid increased scrutiny from the NSW gaming regulator, which deemed the company unfit for a gambling licence at its Sydney resort after a year-long inquiry into allegations of money laundering and governance failures. The company said it would work with the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority to advance reforms necessary to allow for a restricted gaming licence in Sydney. The casino operator's share price lifted (+0.4pc) to $9.73. Wesfarmers has reported that its statutory profit lifted (+14.9pc) to $1.39 billion, driven by a pandemic-driven surge to buy home office equipment and renovation gear. ""Bunnings, Kmart Group and Officeworks delivered strong trading results for the half, reflecting their ability to adapt to changing customer preferences and provide a safe environment for the customers and team members,"" said Wesfarmers managing director Rob Scott. As social distancing rules and fear kept people away from the shops, online sales have taken off and many analysts say a lot of consumers will not return in-store. Mr Scott also said profits at the company's struggling Target stores had ""improved significantly, supported by strong demand and the ongoing simplification of the business"". In the six months to December 31, Wesfarmers converted 19 of its Target retailers into the more lucrative Kmart stores. During that period, combined earnings at Kmart and Target hit record levels, the company said. However, the company expects its retail sales growth to slow down from March as its ""businesses begin to cycle the initial impacts of COVID-19 in the prior year, particularly in Bunnings and Officeworks"". Wesfarmers will pay an interim dividend of 88 cents per share, fully franked. It was a 17 per cent upgrade compared to last year's dividend. Shares in the Perth-based conglomerate rose (+0.6pc) to $54.49. ANZ has reported a stronger first-quarter profit, driven by growth in home lending as the domestic economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. ""All our major businesses performed well through the quarter with market share gains in our key home loan market in Australia as well as record home loan volumes in New Zealand,"" the ANZ chief executive Shayne Elliott said in a statement. The Federal Government's proposal to remove responsible lending rules from most types of loan is not only negative for consumers, but also potentially for the economy, writes Michael Janda. The bank said its cash profit from continuing operations came in at $1.8 billion for the three months ended December 2020. It was significantly higher (+54pc) than the average from the last two quarters. However, ANZ did not provide a comparable figure from the same quarter from the previous year. The Melbourne-based lender also said that about 84 per cent of deferred home loans in Australia have been rolled off — of which 98 per cent returned to repayments. Lenders across the world are still struggling with record low interest rates, aimed at supporting economies during the pandemic. They were also forced to set aside billions of dollars to cover potential loan defaults. Australian banks are now enjoying a relative period of calm as cheaper borrowing costs and massive amounts of government stimulus have led to a surge in demand for homes and driven loan volumes higher. ANZ's common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio, a closely watched measure of its spare cash, rose to 11.7 per cent in the December quarter (compared to 11.3 per cent in the September quarter). The bank's share price jumped (+2.8pc) to $26.55. Biotech firm CSL reported a 45 per cent rise in half-year profit, boosted by higher demand for its vaccines and blood plasma products. That helped to lift its share price (+2.8pc) to $289. While Australia is in its first recession in almost three decades, not all businesses are struggling. Some have boosted profits during the pandemic. Net profit after tax came in at $1.8 billion for the six months ended December, up from $1.3 billion last year. The company, which is also manufacturing the bulk of the local supply of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, which got provisional approval on Tuesday, reiterated the first doses would be released in late March. The key to CSL's business is its ability to collect blood from donors and convert it into medical treatments, which has been hindered by the pandemic. But strong demand for plasma and recombinant therapies, as well as its influenza vaccines, had prompted CSL to raise the lower end of its annual profit forecast last October. It still expects a full-year profit between $2.17 billion to $2.27 billion, implying growth of 3 to 8 per cent. CSL, one of Australia's largest listed companies with operations from Germany to the United States, declared an interim dividend of $1.04 per share, up from last year's 95 cents. Woodside Petroleum has suffered a massive full-year statutory loss of $US4.03 billion ($5.2 billion). The Australian Government has purchased $94m of oil at rock bottom prices, but where will it be stored and how will it contribute to fuel security? This was mainly due to Woodside's huge asset write-downs as a result of lower demand for oil and gas because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But when the company's result is measured in a different way and excludes one-off charges, its underlying net profit is $US447 million. It was still a big fall compared to last year's $US1.06 billion underlying annual profit. Nevertheless, the nation's biggest gas producer declared a final dividend of 12 US cents cents per share, bringing its full-year dividend to 38 US cents. Chief executive Peter Coleman said the potential strength of Woodside's recovery was ""already being signalled by the recent increase in oil price and record spot LNG prices achieved in Asia over the northern hemisphere winter"". Woodside posted a big loss despite the company producing 100.3 million barrels of oil, its best production figure on record. The company's share price fell (-2.4pc) to $25.34. Origin Energy has blamed ""subdued economic conditions"", the ""ongoing impacts"" of COVID-19 and ""lower commodity prices"" for its half-year profit slumping 98 per cent. The energy retailer said it earned $13 million in statutory profit in the six months to December 2020. Many new investors have jumped into the share market recently, and maybe you're one of them. So here's your cheat sheet to reporting season and what it means for your investment. It was a massive drop compared to the $599 million that it earned in the second half of 2019. Nevertheless, the company resolved to pay an unfranked interim dividend of 12.5 cents per share, a 17 per cent downgrade compared to last year's payout. ""The recent rally in oil and gas markets is expected to have a positive impact on Australia Pacific LNG's earnings in the second half, given the lag in contract LNG prices,"" Origin's chief executive Frank Calabria said. ""However, as flagged in our recent earnings update, the near-term outlook for Energy Markets is more challenging. ""A mild summer has compounded already weaker demand and reduced volatility, gas supply costs are expected to increase, and wholesale electricity prices remain depressed, particularly as renewable supply continues to come online."" Origin Energy's share price dropped (-2.2pc) to $4.50. Mining company South32 reported that its half-year net profit fell (-46pc) to $US53 million. Scott Morrison has sent a message to China that Australia will not be America's ""deputy sheriff"" and Canberra won't be making decisions based on a choice between Washington and Beijing, writes Stan Grant. Prices of South32's top three commodities — metallurgical coal, aluminium and manganese — had slumped in 2019 amid a trade war between China and the United States. Their prices remained weak through the first half of 2020 as the pandemic disrupted businesses and hit production. However, South32 said a strong recovery in demand for key commodities outside China early this year, helped to raise its half-year underlying earnings (+4pc) to $US136 million. ""We are off to a strong start in 2021, as we continue to build on our recent operating performance,"" the diversified miner said. The Perth-based firm declared an interim dividend of 1.4 US cents per share (up from 1.1 US cents) a year ago. Its share price edged marginally lower (-0.4pc) to $2.70. Bitcoin soared to yet another record high, a day after vaulting the $US50,000 hurdle, even as analysts warned against the sustainability of such prices amid elevated volatility. The world's biggest digital currency soared to a record $US52,621 on Thursday morning, fuelled by signs that it is winning acceptance among mainstream investors and companies like Tesla, Mastercard and BNY Mellon. Despite the flurry of mainstream acceptance this year, some analysts warn bitcoin is still far from becoming a widely used form of payment. ""Bitcoin presently is not an efficient manner for high-volume transacting, and it is certainly not a store of value as its price volatility at 80 per cent is a dozen times higher than the euro and sevenfold of the Russian rouble,"" said Harley Bassman, managing partner at Simplify Asset Management. ""That said, it is a perfectly legitimate speculative asset, quite similar to Dutch tulips in 1636. ""Will it meet the same fate? That is unclear. As such, size your risk appropriately."" Dutch tulips in the 1600s reached extraordinarily high levels before dramatically collapsing in 1637. Bitcoin has risen eightfold since last March and has added more than $US700 billion in market value since September. JP Morgan questioned the ""magnitude"" of the jump on the back of a total flow of just $US11 billion from institutional investors. Bitcoin's limited supply, based on ""miners"" producing a set number of new coins, has led to holders charging a premium on bitcoin coming to market, JPMorgan analysts said in a note. Retail flows may have also magnified institutional flows, they said. However, the investment bank has previously forecast that the price of bitcoin could hit $US146,000 in the long-term. Interestingly, JP Morgan's chief executive Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin a ""fraud"" that would eventually ""blow up"", and that he would fire his traders ""in a second"" if he discovered they were trading bitcoin. On Wall Street, technology-related companies fell sharply as investors rotated out of growth stocks. Shares in Apple (-1.8pc) and PayPal (-2.5pc) weighed on the tech-heavy Nasdaq , which weighed heavily on the tech-heavy index. The Nasdaq Composite finished moderately lower (-0.6pc) at 13,966 points, while the S&P 500 was flat at 3,931. More millennials are turning to 'buy now, pay later' players like Afterpay and Zip. The industrial-skewed Dow Jones index rose (+0.3pc) to a fresh record high of 31,613 points. The Dow was boosted by shares of Verizon Communications (+4.3pc) and Chevron (+1.8pc) after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed major investments in the companies on Tuesday (local time). ""Investors are just refocusing their attention back on to inflationary worries and perhaps the valuation aspect of the market, especially as it relates to the more technologically-related companies,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management. The US Federal Reserve has pledged to pin interest rates near zero until inflation rises to 2 per cent and looks set to exceed that goal. That stance, coupled with the Biden administration's proposed $US1.9 trillion spending bill for pandemic relief, has some analysts warning of a coming surge in inflation. Meanwhile, data showed US retail sales rebounded sharply in January after households received additional pandemic relief money from the government, suggesting a pick-up in economic activity after being restrained by a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections late last year.

230,Rio Tinto announces record dividend as profit jumps,markets,"  Reporting season continues with record dividend from Rio Tinto, Webjet loss and Treasury Wines profit slide Rio Tinto shareholders were set to receive a record dividend after the miner's profit rose 22 per cent. After the close of trade, Rio announced a full-year profit of $US9.8 billion, up from $US8 billion a year earlier. Shareholders will receive a final dividend of $US3.09 per share and a 93 US cent special dividend. That takes the mining giant's total payout for the year to a record $11.6 billion ($US9 billion). Rio said higher iron ore prices helped lift underlying earnings by 20 per cent. ""This price strength was driven by buoyant demand from China and constraints in global seaborne supply,"" the miner said. ""We increased our iron ore shipments by 1 per cent and production by 2 per cent compared with 2019, whilst implementing strict measures to manage COVID-19."" It is the first result delivered by chief executive Jakob Stausholm, who was announced as the successor to Jean-Sebastien Jacques amid the fallout of the Juukan Gorge blast. Mr Stausholm addressed the destruction during the results announcement, saying he visited Juukan Gorge earlier this week. ""The work we have to do at Juukan is beyond the remediation of the site,"" he said. ""We must earn the right to become a trusted partner once more for traditional owners."" Why did the company commit this egregious act of cultural vandalism? There are several layers to the answer. Rival BHP yesterday announced a record dividend payment to shareholders after higher iron ore prices boosted underlying earnings. Ahead of its result, Rio Tinto shares closed 3.6 per cent higher at $127.47, while shares in BHP (+3.4pc) and Fortescue (+3pc) also made gains. The broader share market lost ground, with the ASX 200 ending half a per cent lower at 6,885 points. Mining and energy stocks rose, while the other sectors finished in the red. Shares in rare earths miner Lynas climbed 13.4 per cent, following reports China was considering limiting exports of rare earth minerals to the US. Lynas is the only major rare earths producer outside of China and last month was awarded a US government contract to build a plant in Texas. The Australian dollar was buying around 77.5 US cents at 4:20pm AEDT. Webjet posted a steep loss as the global travel industry remained largely grounded. Shares in Webjet finished 5 per cent higher, recovering from early falls after the travel group reported a net loss of $132.2 million for the second half of last year. Revenue declined 90 per cent, as did the total value of transactions across the group. Its online travel agency division returned to profitability as domestic borders started to reopen, but its Webbeds accommodation business continued to be hurt by restrictions. The company said it had focused on keeping costs down and reducing the rate at which it was burning through cash, which was $4.8 million a month. Webjet has a cash balance of $283 million, which it says could allow it to withstand a ""protracted market recovery"" if it extended until 2022. Chief executive John Guscic expects the rest of the financial year to play out much like the first half. ""We are hopeful that global vaccine rollouts will enable travel to return to historical levels,"" he said. RBC Capital Markets analyst Tim Piper said the result slightly missed his forecast, but the rate at which the company was burning through cash was expected. Treasury Wine Estate (TWE) shares rose 2.4 per cent, despite the winemaker reporting a plunge in profit. Its half-year profit dropped 43 per cent to $120.9 million, as China imposed tariffs on Australian wine imports. Barley, wine, timber. These are the industries buckling under tariffs and sanctions amid China's escalating trade war. Treasury said earnings in Asia dropped 28 per cent, as it reduced shipments into China following the anti-dumping measures imposed by Beijing. It expects demand for its wine in China to remain ""extremely limited"" while the measures remain in place. ""TWE is becoming increasingly confident around its plans for reallocation of the Penfolds Bins and Icon range from China to other markets,"" it said. Pandemic restrictions and the California wildfires impacted its American business, which saw earnings down 15 per cent. The company will reorganise into three different divisions from mid-year — Penfolds, Treasury Premium Brands and Treasury Americas. UBS analysts said the results were ahead of its estimates, and that Treasury's balance sheet and cash flow were strong. Domino's Pizza announced a 38 per cent increase in net profit to $95.4 million and will pay an interim dividend of 88.4 cents per share. In Australia and New Zealand, sales rose 5.7 per cent and it opened 13 new stores, while Domino's also continued to expand its store network in Japan, France and Germany. Investors cheered the result, with shares rising 7.6 per cent. ""Our view is COVID-19 has brought forward long-term demand for delivered food, ordered online, in all markets,"" Domino's chief executive Don Meij said. However, the company's regular takeaway orders remained ""challenged in most markets"", including lunchtime orders from CBD offices. Many new investors have jumped into the share market recently, and maybe you're one of them. So here's your cheat sheet to reporting season and what it means for your investment. Supermarket sales continued to rise during the pandemic, with Coles reporting a 7.2 per cent increase in comparable sales during the half. Coles' net profit rose by 14.5 per cent to $560 million and it lifted its interim dividend to 33 cents per share, up from 30 cents this time last year. Online supermarket sales grew 48 per cent, as Victorian customers turned to home delivery and 'click & collect' services during the state's second wave of COVID-19. However, Coles warned sales in the supermarket sector may ""moderate significantly or even decline"" in the months ahead, depending on the vaccine rollout and factors including reduced immigration and the winding back of government stimulus. Analysts from IBISWorld said the sales performance was not as good as that of rivals Aldi or Woolworths. ""While Coles' results show an improvement, they represent an underperformance relative to the wider supermarkets industry,"" IBISWorld senior industry analyst Tom Youl said. ""The overall industry grew by 10.3 per cent over the same period, indicating that Coles is lagging behind its major rivals."" Coles shares dropped 5.4 per cent, while shares in Woolworths (-4.6pc) and grocery distributer Metcash (-3.1pc) also closed lower. Westpac said its net profit improved in the December quarter, while mortgage repayment deferrals continued to decline. Around $11 billion worth of Westpac mortgages remained deferred at the end of January, compared to $16.6 billion in late October and the nearly $55 billion in home loans deferred at the peak. Far from jumping in to stop an emerging housing bubble, policymakers are keen to let it run in the vain hope it may kick-start the economy, writes Ian Verrender. ""It has been a good start to the year with higher earnings, a stronger economy, and solid progress on our … strategic priorities,"" Westpac CEO Peter King said. Mr King said the bank's home loan book was ""little changed"" but there was a significant increase in applications. Westpac shares outperformed the rest of the major banks, rising 4.6 per cent. The major US indices have hit fresh all-time highs overnight, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite rising in early trade. Investors piled into equities and sold government bonds in a bet that COVID-19 vaccinations and US stimulus measures would deliver a durable economic recovery after a year of lockdowns. US President Joe Biden is continuing his campaign for a $US1.9 trillion ($2.44 trillion) pandemic relief bill. However, US stocks closed off the session's highs — the Dow Jones ended 0.2 per cent higher at 31,522 points, while the S&P 500 (-0.1pc) and the Nasdaq (-0.3pc) finished in the red. Oil prices hovered near 13-month highs, supported by a cold snap that shut wells in the biggest US oil producing state, Texas. ""Providing some added support to the move higher in oil prices was Russia's lacklustre production — the first time they didn't hit their quota which was allowing them to increase output,"" OANDA senior market analyst Edward Moya said. The price of cryptocurrency bitcoin soared above $US50,000 for the first time.

231,"'I'm concerned I got in a little late': Adam recently bought bitcoin and now it's hit $US50,000",markets,"  Bitcoin climbs to $US50,000 as 'crypto bubble' surges to 'insane' levels For years, Adam Malolepszy had resisted the urge to bet on cryptocurrency, telling his friends it was a ""bubble waiting to burst"". Then in mid-December, the infamously volatile bitcoin surged to a (then) record high of $US20,000. Bitcoin kept hitting fresh records almost every week afterwards. It crossed $US30,000 just after New Year's Day, then $US40,000 in less than a week, before plunging 25 per cent by the end of January (and now it's sharply higher again). The extent of this ""crypto bubble"" made no sense to the 26-year-old computing student, who used to work in the finance industry. But he finally embraced his fear of missing out (""FOMO"") a fortnight ago. That's when he decided it was time to invest in bitcoin, dogecoin (for ""fun""), litecoin, ethereum, XRP, tron and other smaller digital currencies — amongst more conventional investments like shares and exchange traded funds (ETFs). ""The volatility is insane — it's a market that's home to just so many speculators that make it hard to determine what the price should actually be,"" Mr Malolepszy told ABC News. ""I'm sort of concerned I got in a little late … that I got in at the peak. Everyone's overvalued it and there's going to be a correction."" Most punters didn't seem to share his concerns last week, as bitcoin prices shot through the roof after Tesla said that it had bought $US1.5 billion worth of the digital currency and would soon let customers purchase its electric cars with the volatile digital currency. However, Tesla has not disclosed how much bitcoin it purchased, and at what price. On Tuesday, bitcoin climbed to its most expensive level ever ($US50,585) late in the evening. But it has since fallen again, trading around $US49,115 on Wednesday morning AEDT. ""I'm now starting to realise there's some underlying value [in cryptocurrency] by the fact that so many people are supportive of it and believe there's a future for digital currencies,"" Mr Malolepszy said. To an extent, the fear of ""missing out"" drove Tesla's decision to speculate on bitcoin. It followed the footsteps of payments giant PayPal — which said, last October, that it would allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on its ubiquitous payment platform. That month, Square also announced it had bought 4,709 bitcoins, for around $US50 million. It was a huge sum of money at the time, but in hindsight pales in comparison to Tesla's $US1.5 billion bet. However, Tesla's eccentric boss Elon Musk has made it clear that he views cryptocurrency as ""speculation"". On February 7 (the night before Tesla revealed its massive bet on crypto), Mr Musk was on his way to have dinner with his children at an upmarket steakhouse in West Hollywood. Before he reached its front door, he was intercepted by a legion of adoring fans — who demanded autographs, while peppering him with questions about the cryptocurrency market. The world's richest man had been talking up bitcoin, along with a ""joke"" currency called ""dogecoin"", which has surged about 900 per cent since the year began. There were signs that Mr Musk was worried that some of his fans might be taking his recent crypto jokes as genuine investment advice. ""People should not invest their life savings in cryptocurrency, to be clear — that's unwise,"" Mr Musk said, in his clearest warning yet. ""There's a good chance that crypto is the future currency of Earth, and it's like … which one's it going to be? Maybe it'll be multiple. ""It should be considered speculation at this point. So don't go too far with the crypto speculation front."" Mastercard is fully aware of the speculative nature of bitcoin, but sees it as an opportunity to expand. ""Whatever your opinions on cryptocurrencies — from a dyed-in-the-wool fanatic to utter sceptic — the fact remains that these digital assets are becoming a more important part of the payments world,"" the credit card giant wrote on its website on February 10. ""We are preparing right now for the future of crypto and payments, announcing that this year Mastercard will start supporting select cryptocurrencies directly on our network."" Last week, another big announcement on crypto was made by America's oldest bank, BNY Mellon. The company (formerly called the Bank of New York) said it had formed a new division to help to buy, sell and hold crypto — and its services are expected to be offered later this year. Also boosting the value of bitcoin are some optimistic forecasts from investment banks like JP Morgan (which sees it surging as high as $US146,000 in the long term) and Citi (which forecast it could hit $US318,000 by year end). Not a bad comeback for an asset which crashed below $US3,200 (from a peak of around $US19,000), when its first 'buying frenzy' died down about two to three years ago. This flurry of bitcoin endorsements from major US companies in the past four months has pushed the market value of all cryptocurrencies beyond $US1.5 trillion. Bitcoin makes up the bulk of that total, with a market capitalisation of $US916 billion. Despite its name, very few people are actually using bitcoin as a currency to make purchases. Most people are holding onto them, hoping their value will continue to skyrocket. Sydney bar owner Ben Shute believes the high transaction fees are a major factor behind this. ""It costs about $10 to transact on bitcoin right now. So it doesn't make sense to buy a $10 beer when you have to pay $10 to transact."" He said it had been a long time since a customer had spent any bitcoin at his venue, Spawn Point, which may be the last bar in Sydney which takes crypto payments. ""I do remember a bitcoin pub crawl. It was like a social group for a while. ""They only went to bars that accepted bitcoin and they had one round of drinks, paid with bitcoin, and then moved onto the next bar that took bitcoin. ""That was quite cool. I haven't seen that for years, though."" Bitcoin backers call it ""digital gold"", as most of its buyers treat the cryptocurrency as a store of value (despite its extreme price fluctuations every day). Art gallery director Ian Geraghty doubts many people will buy Tesla cars with bitcoin. For the past few years, he has offered bitcoin as a payment method to give his foreign clients (from the United States, Britain, China and Japan) an extra payment option — if they choose to take it up. However, no-one has bought any paintings with bitcoin from his Sydney gallery, Filter Fine Art. ""It's quite a niche method of payment. Not that many people have bitcoin at the moment, and art is quite niche as well. ""I'd be surprised if any artwork in Australia had been paid for in cryptocurrency."" Bitcoin's rising popularity also coincides with governments and central banks across the world making desperate attempts to stimulate their economies out of COVID recessions. They have done so, in the last 12 months, by slashing interest rates to zero (or negative territory), printing trillions of dollars' worth of cash (also known as quantitative easing) and causing government debt to skyrocket. Investors are betting the US government could soon inject up to $US1.9 trillion worth of further stimulus into the pandemic-ridden US economy. Supporters of bitcoin have long trumpeted the idea that cryptocurrencies are ""digital gold"" which serve as a ""hedge against inflation"". ""There are many factors that play into it, particularly if we talk about [bitcoin] as a deflationary asset,"" said Caroline Bowler, the head of BTC Markets in Melbourne. ""There's also the knowledge that there will only be 21 million bitcoin that ever get mined. ""It gives stability, which is a nice counterpoint to the times we're living in, which are notoriously unstable at the moment."" She also said there has been a significant rise in the number of investors and a ""20 per cent increase in average trade size"" at her cryptocurrency exchange. ""We've certainly seen a buoyant market over the last six months and it doesn't look like it's going away any time soon."" Some market analysts warn that investors are seriously underestimating the risk of their cryptocurrency portfolios suffering a massive correction. ""We live in a huge global bubble in all financial assets at the moment, and there's a lot of silly behaviour taking place,"" said Rabobank's global strategist Michael Every, based in Singapore. ""I really don't think people are thinking this through as fully as they need to. ""Too much of it is 'FOMO', or just chasing after a crowd. In the old days, if there was a queue, you tended to join it because you think there might be something good at the end of it."" Mr Every said there was a small risk that bitcoin's value could plunge as a result of government decisions worldwide — but stressed that ""zero"" was not his forecast. ""That risk is baked into the cake when you look at what the political structure is. ""You actually have governors from the US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and several other major central banks either banning it already, or saying, 'We think it's being used for money laundering and criminal activity,' and talking about introducing their own digital coin."" He also said there was a risk that some nations might introduce their own digital currencies in the future, which would lead to an existential crisis for bitcoin and other cryptos. ""What's the point of having a cryptocurrency? I think they would all want to control their own one and have a monopoly over it. ""And then you've got a far bigger downside risk once the price has gone even higher from here first."" You can watch this story tonight on The Business at 8:45pm AEDT on ABC News or iView.

232,"BHP to pay record dividend despite profit slide, FMG executives resign over cost blowout at mine",markets,"  BHP to pay record dividend despite profit slide, FMG executives resign and commodities drive ASX higher to new 11-month high China's strong demand for iron ore has helped BHP increase underlying net profit over the first half of the financial year, while global share markets rallied overnight on hopes that pending US coronavirus relief and the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines could stem the pandemic. BHP's net profit fell by one fifth from $US4.9 billion a year ago to nearly $US3.9 billion ($5.01 billion) for the six months to end of December after one-off write-downs of $US2.2 billion, mainly from its coal mines in New South Wales, its part-owned Cerrejon open cut coal mine in Columbia, and tax losses. However, record production of iron ore in Western Australia and copper extraction from its Escondida mine in Chile, combined with higher prices for both commodities, saw net profit before write-downs rise 16 per cent to $US6.04 billion ($7.76 billion) for the six months to the end of December from $5.19 billion for the same time in 2019. Although that was lower than the $US6.33 billion expected by analysts. Investors will get a record interim dividend of $US1.01 a share, up from $US0.65 for the same period last year that saw BHP's share price jump by 2.7 per cent to $47 a share. China's economy has bounced back from the shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic a year ago and the global mining giant said it expected strong demand from China to continue in 2021 along with a recovery in the rest of the world's global crude steel production. BHP's chief executive Mike Henry said the company had delivered a strong set of results for the first half of the 2021 financial year. ""Our continued delivery of reliable operational performance during the half supported record production at Western Australia Iron Ore and record concentrator throughput at Escondida,"" he said. ""Our outlook for global economic growth and commodity demand remains positive, with policymakers in key economies signalling a durable commitment to growth and signalling ambitions to tackle climate change."" He said while he was ""fundamentally positive"" about the outlook, he was worried about the impact of the trade tensions and COVID-19, but was hopeful about the vaccine rollout. Mr Henry told journalists on a conference call that the diplomatic row between Australia and China affected earnings at its local coal mines. The BHP boss said the miner's business relationship with Chinese customers remained ""very positive"", but the company assumed the ban on Australian coal imports at Chinese ports will continue for some time. The big miner is trying to sell its coal mines in the New South Wales Hunter Valley and Queensland, and its stake in the Cerrejon mine, which has been beset by allegations of pollution and human rights abuses. It estimates the sales process will take another 18 months. UBS mining analysts said that, while BHP's after-tax profit for the half year was less than expected, investors liked the record interim dividend. ""While NPAT was a miss to UBS (estimates) and consensus, the higher dividend is positive and dividend forecasts could be lifted if BHP continues to return 100 per cent of FCF (free cashflow),"" they wrote in a note. Iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group told the Australian Securities Exchange this afternoon that chief operating officer Greg Lilleyman had resigned with immediate effect over big cost blowouts at the iron ore miner's $2.6 billion Iron Bridge project, which is a joint venture with Taiwan's Formosa Steel and Chinese steelmaker, Baosteel. The two top executives in charge of the project, Don Hyma and Manie McDonald, have also resigned. The project in Western Australia's Pilbara region is a magnetite iron ore mine, which is more expensive to produce than hematite iron ore, which can be dug up and directly exported without further production. Chief executive Elizabeth Gaines and chief financial officer Ian Wells will forgo their bonuses for the financial year because of the blowouts, which were discovered during a review of the project. ""What we've learned through our review of the Iron Bridge project to date, is that we have lost sight of that critical focus,"" Ms Gaines said in a statement. ""As CEO I must also take accountability and learn from this. Both Ian Wells, chief financial officer, and I will forego all incentive payments this financial year,"" the FMG boss said. Ms Gaines thanked Mr Lilleyman for his service. ""I would like to thank Greg Lilleyman for his enormous contribution since he joined Fortescue in January 2017,'' she told the ASX. ""The success of our integrated marketing and operations strategy is a lasting legacy of Greg's strategic focus and his commitment to our success over that period."" Ms Gaines said the ""detailed"" review of Iron Bridge was underway and the market would be updated on Thursday when its half-year profit results were out. FMG shares fell 3 per cent to $23.70 on the news. The National Australia Bank said its earnings for the first quarter of the financial year were little changed. Unaudited first quarter cash earnings came  in at $1.65 billion, up 1 per cent from the same time a year ago. Net profit for the quarter was $1.7 billion. However, the profit margin between interest paid by the bank and the income from interest slipped over the quarter due to record low interest rates. NAB said the bulk of customers who deferred their loans because of the coronavirus pandemic have resumed making repayments, with the value of deferred loans at $2 billion down from a peak of $38 billion. The value of business loans being deferred fell from $19 to $1 billion. The bank said that most customers exiting deferrals (around 90 per cent of the value of the loans) have resumed making repayments, ""but a small cohort are requiring further assistance"". NAB shares rose 1.1 per cent at $25.56.  ANZ (+1pc) and Westpac (0.5pc) also rose, outperforming a declining CBA (-0.5pc). The Federal Court has ruled that the Commonwealth Bank mislead business customers more than 12,000 times about interest rates on business overdraft accounts in a case arising out of the banking royal commission. The court found that the CBA charged an interest rate on business overdraft accounts substantially higher than what its customers were advised in a case brought by the corporate watchdog, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The bank was found to have broken the ASIC Act on 12,119 occasions by engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct, which is a criminal offence. The court also ruled that the CBA breached its general obligation as a financial service licensee to comply with financial services laws, in contravention of the Corporations Act. The bank admitted it had told customers they would be charged an interest rate of 16 per cent on their overdraft, when in fact, some were charged 34 per cent, because of a systems error. More than $2.2 million in interest was overcharged by the CBA. ASIC Commissioner Sean Hughes said financial institutions needed to prioritise the upgrading of their information technology systems, ""to ensure they deliver on promises made to their customers"". ""By CBA failing to take adequate steps to rectify this error after it was identified, this resulted in customers continuing to be overcharged,"" Mr Hughes said. The court will decide on criminal penalties in April. Ansell shares jumped to the highest since November 2020 after half-year profit surged thanks to demand for personal protective equipment (PPE), such as rubber gloves, because of the coronavirus pandemic. The company said sales for the last half of 2020 surged by nearly a quarter helped by the increased demand. After-tax profit for the half rose by almost two-thirds to $106.5 million. Ansell expects strong demand for PPE to continue for the next year and it also sees elevated demand for many other products as well. Ansell shares climbed 1.8 per cent to $39.28 a share. Shares in metal and electronics recycler Sims Metals Management jumped 7.4 per cent to $13.75 after half-year profit rose on higher prices and lower costs, which led to better profit margins, despite a fall in revenue. It said net profit for the six months to the end of December swung to $53 million from a loss of $91 million for the same time a year ago. Real estate sales firm Domain said half-year net profit was flat, rising just 1.2 per cent to nearly $20 million. Half-year revenue fell 12 per cent to just over $138 million amid coronavirus shutdowns. Domain shares lost 3 per cent to $5.13 a share. Higher prices for iron ore, oil and copper, good profit results, and a record interim dividend for big miner BHP drove the market. The ASX 200 index rose 0.7 per cent to 6,917, led by oil stocks and miners, while the broader All Ordinaries index rose 40 points to 7,189. Buy now pay later firm, Zip, (+10pc) was the biggest gainer on the benchmark index. Plumbing firm GWA Group (-8.1pc) led the losses on the benchmark index after reporting lower revenue for the half year. After-tax profit dropped fell from $23.6 million to $18.5 million for the six months to the end of December. In the minutes from the RBA's policy earlier this month, the board said that ""very significant"" monetary support was needed for some time and the official cash rate would be kept at a record low of 0.1 per cent for as long as necessary. The central bank said its consultation with businesses suggested it would be some time before wage freezes ended in both the private and public sector. It also reiterated that it believed there were few signs of ""deterioration"" in home lending standards amid booming home prices because of record low rates. The Australian dollar rose by one quarter of a per cent to above 78 US cents. By 4:50pm AEDT, it had slipped back to 77.85 US cents. Oil joined equity markets in pushing higher, reaching its highest level since January 2020 on hopes US stimulus would boost the economy, and after a Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said it intercepted an explosive-laden drone fired by the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels. Crude oil futures rallied as the arctic blast across North America shut oil output. West Texas crude oil broke above $US60 a barrel for the first time since the start of the year, as shale oil producers in Texas were forced to shut due to power outages. Brent crude rose 1.3 per cent to $US63.25 a barrel overnight.  At 16:50pm AEDT,  it had increased slightly to $US63.44 a barrel. With investors turning to riskier assets, safe haven gold fell overnight but has picked up today with the precious metal buying $US1,821.11 an ounce, up 0.1 per cent. Iron ore prices rose 0.4 per cent to $US161.55. Wall Street was closed overnight for the President's Day holiday. Millions of Americans travelled over the weekend despite warnings from health experts to avoid flights. Figures from the Transportation Security Administration showed more than four million people passed through airport security checkpoints between Thursday and Sunday. Global shares rose for the eleventh day in a row on optimism about the rollout of coronavirus vaccines and new US stimulus, while the tensions in the Middle East drove oil to a 13-month high. European shares rallied overnight on higher oil and copper prices to the highest in nearly one year for the pan-European STOXX 600, which gained 1.3 per cent. That is despite economists' estimates that the European economy is in a double-dip recession. Other data showed industrial production in the Eurozone contracted more than expected in December. However, analysts from ING Bank said new orders for manufacturing continued to grow strongly. In London, the FTSE 100 increased 2.5 per cent to 6,756 boosted by big miners like Rio Tinto (+4.2pc), BHP (+5.2pc), and Anglo American (+4.9pc) and oil giant BP, which jumped 6.5 per cent. Pharmaceutical firm, AstraZeneca, whose Covid-19 vaccine is being rolled out globally, fell 0.7 per cent. In Germany, the DAX was up 0.4 to 14,110 and the CA 40 in France rose 1.5 per cent to 5,786. E-mini futures for the S&P 500 were also higher, up 0.5 per cent. Later in the week, all eyes will be on the release of minutes from the US Federal Reserve's January meeting — where policymakers decided to leave rates unchanged — for hints about the likely direction of monetary policy. Investors are also focusing on next week's profit results from hotels, cruise lines and other businesses that have been hard-hit by COVID-19 for indications about which companies could be the first to bounce back when the pandemic recedes. Manufacturing data for this month will be released in the US and other major economies later this week.

233,House prices on 'cusp of a boom' tips CBA; ASX lifts on profit results,markets,"  ASX gains as JB Hi-Fi profits surge; Commonwealth Bank forecasts house price boom Economists at Australia's biggest bank think the housing market is ""on the cusp of a boom"", as record low mortgage rates collide with the recovery in the jobs market. Commonwealth Bank economists are forecasting an 8 per cent rise in national dwelling prices this year, followed by a 6 per cent increase next year. House price growth has been tipped to outstrip growth in apartment prices, at around 16 per cent over the next two years compared to 9 per cent. The most recent figures from CoreLogic showed that prices rose 0.9 per cent in January, taking dwelling values to a record high. ""Near term indicators of momentum suggest conditions will further strengthen,"" CBA's head of Australian economics Gareth Aird wrote. ""Auction clearance rates are sitting at levels consistent with double-digit dwelling price growth."" Preliminary figures from last week's auctions put the clearance rate for the capital cities at 86.1 per cent, according to CoreLogic. Far from jumping in to stop an emerging housing bubble, policymakers are keen to let it run in the vain hope it may kick-start the economy, writes Ian Verrender. However, that rate could be revised lower once all results are collected, as auctions in Melbourne were withdrawn due to the lockdown. CBA economists revised their property price forecasts last year, after previously forecasting an 11 per cent fall in house prices over three years under their 'base case' pandemic scenario. The bank's worst-case scenario of a prolonged downturn had factored in the risk of a 30 per cent-plus fall in prices. ""[We] revised our call in September 2020 to look for a smaller peak-to-trough fall and a decent lift in prices over 2021,"" Mr Aird said. ""But even then, the rapid growth in new lending over the second half of 2020 was stronger than we anticipated. ""The increase in new lending is now feeding into higher prices for bricks and mortar."" While CBA economists expect the effect of low home loan rates on prices to wane slightly next year, they see a boost to demand from population growth as international borders are reopened. Source: CBA The Australian share market steadily rose through the session, as reporting season rolled on, with a profit surge for JB Hi-Fi. The ASX 200 closed 0.9 per cent higher at 6,868 points, while the All Ordinaries index gained 1 per cent to 7,149. The Australian dollar was also stronger, buying around 77.85 US cents at 4:20pm (AEDT). Shares in JB Hi-Fi gained 3.1 per cent to $52.44, after the electronics retailer announced an increased payout to shareholders as its profit climbed. JB Hi-Fi will pay an interim dividend of $1.80 per share, double the 90-cent final dividend declared in August. The sales boom continued past the initial lockdown that began in March last year, when people fitted out of home offices, splashed out on home entertainment and upgraded appliances. Over the six months from July through December, sales across the JB Hi-Fi group, which includes its New Zealand business and The Good Guys, rose nearly 24 per cent to $4.9 billion. Online sales more than doubled, rising almost 162 per cent to $678.8 million. Many new investors have jumped into the share market recently, and maybe you're one of them. So here's your cheat sheet to reporting season and what it means for your investment. That saw the retailer's net profit rise by 86 per cent to $317.7 million. JB Hi-Fi chief executive Richard Murray described it as an ""extraordinary period"" and thanked the company's 13,000 employees for their work during the pandemic. Sales continued to grow in the new year, with turnover at JB Hi-Fi in Australia rising more than 17 per cent, while The Good Guys saw 14 per cent sales growth in January. However, due to the uncertainty of the pandemic, the company did not provide sales and earning guidance for the second half of the financial year. Most sectors of the Australian share market ended higher, led by materials and consumer stocks, with BHP (+2.3pc) and Fortescue (+2.5pc) making gains. Shares in Crown Resorts rose 0.8 per cent to $9.97 after chief executive Ken Barton resigned following the damning NSW inquiry report, which found company unsuitable to hold a licence for its Sydney casino. The best performing stock on the benchmark index was aerial imagery company Nearmap, with its shares rising 19 per cent. The company reported a net loss of $9.4 million, an improvement on the previous period's loss, and will not pay an interim dividend. Got shares but don't know a balance sheet from an income statement? Our profit reporting season guide will help you cut through some common jargon. It followed a sell-off in Nearmap shares last week, after investment fund J Capital said it was short the stock, arguing ""accounting tricks"" had been used to misrepresent the company's growth in the US. On Monday, Nearmap responded, saying the report contained ""many inaccurate statements and makes unsubstantiated allegations of a very serious nature"". ""Nearmap is in compliance with its continuous disclosure obligations and the company remains highly confident and committed to its long-term strategy and outlook,"" it said. Bendigo and Adelaide Bank shares rose strongly, gaining 11.3 per cent. The bank's net profit rose 67 per cent to $243.9 million in the first half.

234,analysis: Why Australia's property prices will continue to soar,markets,"  Why Australia's property prices will continue to soar Across the suburbs, they're lining up for home inspections. With COVID-19 restrictions, only a handful are allowed in at a time. The queues, for units in particular, stretch down the stairwells and spill outside. In some regional areas, particularly coastal locales, the situation has reached fever pitch. Prices in some areas are up by more than a third in the space of a year as cashed-up buyers fleeing the cities head for the country with dreams of permanently working from home. Regional prices rose 1.6 per cent in January, more than double that of the main capital cities. With more people continuing work-from-home arrangements in the wake of COVID-19, demand for regional property is soaring. Auction clearance rates are hurtling towards a perfect score in some cities. Canberra recently clocked up clearances in excess of 90 per cent while Sydney has pushed way above 80 per cent; rates that indicate extremely tight conditions. When Corelogic tallied the final numbers on Friday, the previous weekend's national auction clearance rate hit a six-year high at 79.3 per cent. The preliminary results from Saturday indicate an even stronger performance at more than 86 per cent. A fortnight ago, Australian real estate prices lurched back into record territory — and there is no end in sight. With interest rates locked in at a whisker above zero — and with Reserve Bank assurances they'll stay put for the next four years — it's little wonder buyers are scrambling for a piece of the action. Add in the imminent removal of responsible lending laws and the stage is set for a sustained real estate boom. Even accounting for the hyperbole usually employed by the industry, this note dropped into your diarist's inbox over the weekend from a local agent summed it all up. ""In my 25 years of working in the industry, conditions have never been stronger."" In ordinary circumstances, we'd be at the point where a rational Reserve Bank governor would be expressing concerns, perhaps even warning would-be home buyers that prices don't always rise, and that caution is warranted in such a frenzied environment. Behind the scenes, you'd expect contingency plans being formulated on how to deflate the real estate bubble without hurting the broader economy. Governments need to show some of the ambition of their post-WWII predecessors and start building houses to stimulate our economy — and address the housing crisis, writes Peter Mares. Not this time. Instead, our monetary mandarins are doing the opposite. They're stepping aside, more than happy to let prices rip. ""There's a lot of focus at the moment on the fact that housing prices are rising again, and the stock market has been strong,"" RBA Governor Philip Lowe said recently. ""Well, the national house price index today is where it was four years ago … and the equity market, we're back to where we were at the beginning of last year."" He's absolutely correct, of course. Statistically, you could argue prices have barely moved in years. The only problem with that line of logic is that it ignores what has taken place in the meantime. Like, four years ago when the RBA, in a desperate bid to curb a runaway housing market, urged the banking regulator APRA to clamp down on interest-only loans, the preferred financing for investors. It successfully muscled values lower and maintained the pressure. Clearly, it was worried about a real estate bubble then. Here we are again, and the most extraordinary thing is that we've just emerged from the deepest recession in almost a century with an uncomfortably high unemployment rate, oodles of spare capacity, inflation dragging along in the basement and wages growth at as slow a pace as it's ever been. Once upon a time, it was a central banker's role to rain on the parade. Or as William McChesney Martin, head of the US Federal Reserve in 1955, explained, to ""order the removal of the punchbowl just as the party was really warming up."" The idea was to look ahead, to take preventative action and keep things on an even keel. So what's changed? For a start, there's the fragile state of the global economy. Then there are the concerns the Federal Government is about to rip away the budgetary support for the jobless and those left vulnerable from the impact of the pandemic on vital industries like tourism. The Federal Government's proposal to remove responsible lending rules from most types of loan is not only negative for consumers, but also potentially for the economy, writes Michael Janda. If the Government does reduce support, that will put a greater burden on the Reserve Bank to boost growth. And so, with conventional weaponry almost exhausted and no real appetite to push interest rates into negative territory, our economic masters have latched on to a philosophy that's been floating around for quite a while. It's called the Wealth Effect and it goes like this. If housing prices inflate and the stock market keeps rising, people will feel wealthier and they'll start to spend. That, in turn, will boost earnings, investment, profits and lead to higher inflation and wages. Rate cuts were supposed to do exactly that but didn't. In fact, all they've really done is boost asset prices. And now it's hoped, soaring asset prices will do the job. Of course, the biggest problem with soaring real estate prices and stock markets is that they drive a mighty wedge between rich and poor. Those with assets end up sitting pretty. Those without end up being left further behind. There's an old saying among investors: markets can remain irrational for far longer than you can stay solvent. So, as irrational as the recent booms have been, there's every indication they will go on for far longer than is healthy. Central banks, including our own Reserve Bank, have decided that instead of taking preventative action, from removing the punchbowl, they'll let the party go on. It is a dangerous game, and one that can backfire. For the ""Negative Wealth Effect"" — the impact on spending when financial or property markets tank — can damage growth. Ever since the financial crisis, central banks globally have been captured by their own actions. They'll do almost anything to ensure markets remain buoyant regardless of the longer-term consequences. To be fair, the RBA reckons real estate prices will have to start moderating soon for two key reasons. One is that for the past year, we've had no immigration which should have reduced demand for housing. And the second is that a large number of newly constructed properties have yet to come on the market. But if prices continue their stratospheric rise unchecked, it may be forced to look across The Ditch for inspiration. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has just raised the lending hurdles for investors after real estate surged more than 17 per cent in the past year. So far, there's no indication of anything like that here.

235,Australian shares drop as new US-China tensions emerge,markets,"  Australian shares decline after US president warns China will 'eat our lunch' and on new lockdown in Victoria The Australian share market ended in the red after brewing tensions between the US and China sparked a mixed night on Wall Street and amid a new five day lockdown in Victoria on rising coronavirus cases. Shares fell further after the Victorian premier Dan Andrews announced a surprise coronavirus lockdown in the state from midnight. The All Ordinaries fell 0.6 per cent, or 41 points, to 7,081. The ASX 200 also lost 0.6 per cent to 6,807. Nearly all sectors ended in the red with the falls led by industrials firms, miners and oil stocks as prices dipped. Education stocks were one of the few bright spots. 134 stocks fell, 53 rose and 13 were unchanged. Going down were car parts retailer Eagers Automotive (-6.4pc) and gold miners Westgold Resources (-7.4pc) and Perseus Mining (5.2pc), which dropped on a fall in gold prices. Going up were Cromwell Property Group (+2.5pc), GWA Group (+2.2pc) and real estate investment trust Charter Hall (+1.7pc). The Australian dollar fell from its overnight high and ended the day at 77.48 US Cents. However, the local currency remains 3 per cent higher for the month. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 fell 0.3 per cent to 29,485 from a more-than-30-year high as investors booked profits. Chinese markets are closed for the Chinese New Year week long holiday. Bitcoin reached a new record high of $US49,000 per digital coin after another big firm embraced cryptocurrencies. A third director at gaming company Crown Resorts has resigned after a New South Wales report said the firm was unfit to hold a gambling licence for its new Sydney casino amid allegations of money laundering and links to Asian crime gangs known as triads at its other casinos. Former Australian Football League chief Andrew Demetriou has stepped down after a scathing assessment of his performance by Commissioner Patricia Bergin, a former NSW Supreme Court. Crown Resorts said in a statement that Ken Barton was still chief executive, although pressure was mounting on the Crown boss to step down. ""Crown and Mr Barton are continuing to consider his position having regard to the recommendations and findings of the commissioner's report of the inquiry under section 143 of the Casino Control Act 1992 (NSW),"" Crown told the Australian Securities Exchange The Victorian gaming regulator yesterday added to the pressure on Mr Barton by asking whether he and Mr Demetriou were suitable to be associated with Crown's Melbourne casino. Adding to Crown's woes, the gaming firm said its food, beverage, gaming and conference facilities at its Melbourne casino complex will shut down because of Victoria's five-day coronavirus shutdown. It said hotel accommodation will continue in a 'reduced capacity' and takeaway food or meal delivery services will remain open at the complex. Crown Resort shares dropped 1.6  per cent, or $0.16, to $9.89. The corporate regulator said Australia's six biggest financial institution have paid or offered $1.24 billion in compensation to customers who suffered loss or detriment because of fees for no service misconduct or non-compliant advice. Neary $194 million was paid out or offered from July to the end of December 2020 to victims of financial scandals. AMP, ANZ, CBA, Macquarie, NAB and Westpac undertook the review and remediation programs to compensate affected customers as a result of two major ASIC reviews and pressure from the banking royal commission. ASIC's investigations found systemic failures in the advice divisions of AMP, ANZ, CBA and NAB, as well as some of their product issuers. 'These included the failure to ensure provision of ongoing advice services to customers who paid fees to receive those services (fees for no service), the failure of advisers to provide those services, and the failure of product issuers to switch off advice fees of customers who did not have a financial adviser,' the corporate watchdog said. Meanwhile, New Zealand's financial markets regulator said ANZ's local business had admitted breaking the law by misleading some customers over credit card insurance charges. The regulator is seeking a penalty charge of $NZ280,000 for the case, with the decision of the court still pending. The banking royal commission heard that bank customers had paid hundreds of millions of dollars for junk insurance on credit cards that they were not eligible to claim on. Shares in the big banks were mixed. ANZ slipped nearly 0.1 per cent to 24.87.  Macquarie lost 1 per cent to $144.65. Property firm Mirvac cut its interim payout to investors by  21 per cent after its half year profit fell by just over one third to $396 million. ""The pandemic continued to disrupt our operating markets during the first half and the world remains in crisis,"" Mirvac told the ASX. Mirvac shares fell 1.7 per cent to $2.32. Meanwhile, baby products firm Baby Bunting has seen half year net profit rise by half to $7.5 million after sales surged in the last six months of 2020. Investors get a higher dividend payout of 5.8 cents a share,  fully franked, up from the same time last year. Baby Bunting said it did not get any wage subsidy JobKeeper payments unlike many other firms including retailer Premier Investments and major airline Qantas. Baby Bunting shares slid 6.6 per cent to $5.25 a share. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq gained on hopes of more stimulus, but US stocks eased back from their record highs after President Joe Biden said China was poised to ""eat our lunch"", a warning that raised concerns for a market trading around record highs on hopes of more stimulus, strong earnings and an improving outlook for the pandemic. Mr Biden told a bipartisan group of US senators that North America needed to upgrade its infrastructure in the face of the challenge from China. ""They're investing in a lot of money, they're investing billions of dollars and dealing with a whole range of issues that relate to transportation, the environment and a whole range of other things,"" Mr Biden said. ""They're going to, you know, if we don't get moving, they're going to eat our lunch."" Mr Biden made the comments after a two-hour phone call on Wednesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping. In addition, the Congressional Budget Office said the US Government was looking at a $US2.3 trillion ($3 trillion) deficit this year, down around $US900 billion from last year, because of the record stimulus to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Despite the worries, US stocks finished off their lows. The Dow Jones index ended down 0.02 per cent at 31,431, while the S&P 500 put on 0.2 per cent to 3,916 and the Nasdaq rose 0.4 per cent to 14,026. Worse than expected US jobless data also weighed on confidence. Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York, said the warning about China and Democrat plans to lift the minimum wage to $US15 in a $US1.9 trillion stimulus package showed headwinds could be on the rise. ""Markets are starting to get a little bit nervous over the relations between the West and China,"" Mr Moya said. Mr Moya said Mr Biden's first call since coming to office with Mr Xi ""resurfaced all of the difficulties that we're going to face this year in addition to the pandemic"". He said disputes within the Democratic Party about the minimum wage was also dragging out stimulus talks. Bank of New York Mellon rose after saying it had formed a new unit to help clients hold, transfer and issue digital assets, sending Bitcoin up more than 8 per cent to a record high of $US48,481. A 0.8 per cent rise in PayPal to $US285.37 helped information technology become the only the only sector on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to rise. The technology sector and semiconductors hit record highs, while economy-linked energy and industrials stocks fell back. Mastercard rose 2.6 per cent after the credit-card company said it was planning to offer support for some cryptocurrencies on its network this year, joining a string of big firms. Cannabis companies including Tilray and Aphria reversed gains to drop 47 per cent and 32 per cent after Reddit investors started betting on the sector this week. Global markets are subdued with Asian markets closed for the Chinese New Year holiday. The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits dropped to 793,000 last week, compared to 812,000 in the week before. That is well below the record 6.9 million reported in March last year when the pandemic hit the United States. However the latest weekly numbers were still higher than expected following an upward revision of the previous week's data. Still ANZ economists Brian Martin and Daniel Hynes say a ""downward trend is now evident in the data and this is expected to continue as COVID-19 cases numbers ease"". The European Commission lowered its economic forecasts. Gross Domestic Product forecasts for the European Union were cut to 3.8 per cent over 2021, compared to the previous forecast of 4.2 per cent, and not return to pre-pandemic levels until late 2022. The EU economy is forecast to shrink 0.9 per cent over the first quarter of this year with annual inflation tipped to increase by 1.4 per cent, compared to the 0.3 per cent rise last year. The Commission acknowledged that the spread of new variants of COVID-19 is a risk to its forecasts, but it said its estimates had not factored in new stimulus, Next Generation EU, which was yet to be approved. Major oil producers said demand for fuel would rebound more slowly than previously thought. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries sees demand rising by 5.79 million barrels per day (bpd) this year to 96.05 million bpd. In its monthly report, it lowered its growth forecast by 110,000 bpd from last month. ""While the global economy is showing signs of a healthy recovery in 2021, oil demand is currently lagging, but is forecast to pick up in the second half of 2021,"" OPEC said. The prospect of weaker demand has already prompted OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, to slow their plan to increase output. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said demand for fuel amid the oversupplied oil market remained fragile. Its forecasts were more pessimistic than OPEC's. Restrained growth in travel and economic activity because of COVID-19 saw it cut its forecasts for world oil consumption by 200,000 barrels per day to 96.4 million. However, the IEA expected better prospects for the second half of the year, when it tipped swollen oil inventories would decline sharply as fuel use picks up. Freezing temperatures in the US have increased demand for heating oil, while Indian demand for petrol has surged as the public moves away from public transport to avoid coronavirus. Global oil giant Shell said its oil production would fall 1 to 2 per cent this year and it expected no new ""frontier"" exploration after 2025. The closure of Chinese markets for the Chinese New Year holiday weighed on demand for most commodities. West Texas crude oil dropped 0.6 cent to $US57.87 a barrel, while Brent crude lost 0.6 per cent to $US60.78. Spot gold saw its first fall in five trading sessions, down 0.1 per cent to $US1,823 on a stronger greenback and rising US Treasury yields.

236,COVID recession adds to AMP's woes as profit slumps and takeover falls through,markets,"  AMP's plan to be bought out for $6.36 billion has been thrown into disarray after US-based suitor Ares Management withdrew its takeover bid. Ares's decision to pull out was a major setback for the embattled wealth manager, which also reported its half-year profit fell sharply and said it would not pay shareholders a dividend. This sent its share price tanking (-9.4pc) to $1.39 by 1:00pm AEDT. The non-binding takeover offer was made in October, after AMP's new chairman Debra Hazelton launched a strategic review of the company following the resignation of her predecessor David Murray over the board's handling of sexual harassment complaints. Amid the management upheaval, former Treasury secretary John Fraser resigned from his AMP directorship and Boe Pahari was demoted from his plum role as head of AMP Capital. ""Following detailed discussions, AMP has been advised last night by Ares that it does not intend to proceed with its non-binding indicative proposal for 100 per cent of AMP of $1.85 per share,"" AMP said in a statement to the market. But AMP said it continued to ""engage constructively with Ares in relation to AMP Capital as part of the portfolio review"". That suggests Ares is not interested in taking over the company as a whole, but may still be interested in purchasing AMP Capital, the most lucrative division of the entire company. AMP revealed that its underlying annual profit dropped (-32.8pc) to $295 million. In a statement, AMP said its diminished profit reflected ""impacts of COVID-19 on our clients, our business and the broader economy and financial markets"". AMP's leaders have been dropping like flies after revelations the company repeatedly misled the corporate regulator. AMP says ""underlying"" profit is its preferred metric as it strips out one-off gains and losses (like the sale of a business) and expenses (compensation costs). However, its ""statutory"" full-year profit ($177 million) looks much better, given it rebounded from a very low base — a $2.5 billion loss in the previous year. Last year's massive loss was mostly due to what it called ""legacy issues"", namely the fallout of the 2018 banking royal commission. The high-profile banking inquiry exposed systemic wrongdoing at AMP, ranging from the ""fee for no service"" scandal, charging life insurance premiums to dead clients, and lying to the corporate regulator ASIC about what it had done. Those damaging findings forced almost half of AMP's board to resign, including chief executive Craig Meller and chairman Catherine Brenner, along with in-house legal counsel Brian Salter. AMP said on Thursday that its ""client remediation is now 80 per cent complete and on schedule to fully complete in mid-2021"". AMP's earnings also took a hit because more of its clients have been pulling their money out, as they fled the company in the wake of scandals unearthed at the royal commission. AMP's promotion of Boe Pahari raises bigger questions for corporate Australia about how companies treat sexual harassment Its Australian wealth management division reported an 8 per cent slump in the value of assets under management in the 2019-20 financial year. The company's AMP Capital also experienced a similar drop (-7pc) in the assets it managed. This outflow of cash was due to the ""volatile investment markets and net cash outflows, which included the Australian Government's early release of super program ($1.8 billion)"", the firm said. ""2020 was a tough year across the world,"" said AMP's chief executive Francesco De Ferrari. ""COVID-19 unsettled our clients, our workplaces and the broader community. ""Volatility in markets and the economic downturn impacted the investments and financial security of many Australians and New Zealanders."" The last time AMP paid a regular dividend to its shareholders was two years ago. However, there was an exception in October last year, when AMP returned $344 million to investors by paying them a special dividend of 10 cents per share (fully franked). That money came from AMP selling its life insurance business for $3 billion to London-based Resolute Life in mid-2020.

237,ASX slips as Wall Street and bitcoin hit record highs,markets,"  Australian shares fall as Wall Street and bitcoin hit record highs Australian shares have finished trading sharply lower, weighed down by the heavyweight banking stocks. The ASX 200 index closed 60 points (-0.9pc) lower at 6,821. The broader All Ordinaries fell (-0.8pc) to 7,102 points. Essentially, the market has wiped out all its gains since Friday. But it remains near an 11-month high, given the market has been trading in a relatively narrow range for weeks. Seven out of 10 stocks closed in the red, including financial stocks Commonwealth Bank (-1.4pc), Westpac (-1.2pc), ANZ (-1.9pc), NAB (-1.7pc), Bendigo and Adelaide Bank (-2.8pc), Bank of Queensland (-2.1pc)and AMP (-2.2pc). Some of Tuesday's worst performers were Adbri (-5.9pc), Credit Corp (-5.8pc), Tabcorp (-3.6pc) and Nearmap (-3.4pc). On the flip side were Graincorp (+4.7pc), Perseus Mining (+3.8pc), PolyNovo (-3.6pc) and Star Entertainment (-2.6pc). Crown Resorts has been deemed unsuitable to operate a new Sydney casino at Barangaroo after a months-long public inquiry that exposed allegations of money laundering. A final report from the Crown probe, commissioned by NSW's Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA), was tabled in State Parliament this afternoon. Crown's shares were placed in a two-day trading halt on Tuesday morning. The casino operator's shares will resume trading on Thursday, or when Crown makes an announcement about ILGA's decision to the market. Its shares last traded at $10.15, having fallen sharply (-13pc) in the past year. The Australian market fell despite Wall Street hitting new record highs on increased bets that US politicians would soon pass another COVID-19 stimulus package. The Dow Jones index closed 237 points (+0.8pc) higher at 31,386. The S&P 500 lifted (+0.7pc) to 3,916, and the Nasdaq Composite went up (+1pc) to 13,988. Bitcoin also surged above $US47,000, its highest levels ever, after billionaire Elon Musk's electric vehicle company Tesla revealed it had bought $US1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency and would soon accept it as a form of payment for cars. The Australian dollar rose (+0.6pc) to 77.26 US cents. Commodities also lifted sharply overnight, including gold (+1.1pc), silver (+2.2pc), Brent crude oil (+2.1pc) and iron ore (+2.2pc). Business confidence rose in January to be well above long-term averages, as services firms anticipate a continued recovery from last year's COVID disruptions with the vaccine rollout soon commencing. Confidence was up 5 points to +10 last month, although current business conditions pulled back sharply from +16 to +7, which is just above the long-run average, following two very strong months of gains at the end of last year. After a pre-Christmas splurge, it appears consumers tightened their wallets in January, with trading conditions down 11 points. ""Business started the year on a more optimistic note, even as conditions eased from the strength we saw in December,"" said NAB's chief economist Alan Oster. ""Importantly, employment conditions remain in positive territory — so overall businesses are still expanding their workforce. ""The decline in conditions was broad-based across industries, except for a small improvement in recreation and personal services, which continues to make small gains as restrictions ease. ""Overall, in trend terms conditions remain strongest in retail and weakest in construction followed by personal services."" Reporting season is also ramping up, with several major companies announcing their results today. Many new investors have jumped into the share market recently, and maybe you're one of them. So here's your cheat sheet to reporting season and what it means for your investment. Challenger saw its shares plunge (-14.8pc), after the fund management firm slashed its interim dividend to 9.5 cents per share (compared with 17.5 cents paid last year). It also reported a small rise (+1.1pc) in half-yearly profit. Meanwhile, shares in Macquarie Group jumped (+6.6pc), after the company said its third-quarter profit (from its commodities trading and deal making units) rose sharply, helped by the pandemic-fuelled market volatility. Australia's largest investment bank and asset manager said hedging and trading activity across commodities (from November to January) was strong due to high volatility in oil and gas and precious metals markets. The Sydney-based firm, which derives close to 40 per cent of its earnings from its Commodities and Global Markets unit, said that ""market dislocations"" had boosted trading and hedging activity with its growing client base, which it expected would continue. ""We expect the second half to continue to be more favourable than we previously anticipated, given the increased level of volatility that we experienced in this third quarter,"" Macquarie's chief executive Shemara Wikramanayake told investors at a briefing. That would mean earnings for the full year in the unit were now forecast to be slightly, not significantly, lower, she said. The company also said its Macquarie Capital division completed 100 transactions globally during quarter, valued at $58.4 billion. In other news, shares of James Hardie Industries rose 1 per cent, after it posted a significant jump (+59pc) in third-quarter profit. It also lifted its its fiscal 2021 earnings forecast and declared a special dividend, riding on strong demand for its fibre cement products from a booming US housing market. James Hardie said it was now expecting an adjusted net operating profit of $440 million to $450 million (a significant improvement compared with its prior forecast of $380 million to $420 million). The world's biggest maker of fibre cement products declared a special dividend of 70 cents per share, and said it was planning to resume paying dividends on a regular basis in fiscal 2022 (after suspending them since May). Rival building materials company Boral saw its profit rise 18.2 per cent to $161.4 million for the half-year to December 31, despite a $257 million fall in revenue to $2.7 billion over the period. The company said COVID has had a mixed impact on its business, with strong demand for new detached housing and renovations, both in Australia and North America, but a decline in multi-unit construction locally and delays in the large pipeline of infrastructure work actually commencing construction. Boral shares fell (-7.4pc) to $5.01. Commercial property landlord Dexus reported a 55.5 per cent slump in net profit after tax to $442.9 million for the half-year ended December 31. Analysts are sceptical of Bitcoin's meteoric rise. Here's why some are predicting a crash, and what that would mean. The company said the fall in profit was due mainly to a lower valuation uplift from the 111 of its 122 office and industrial properties that were independently revalued at the end of last year. However, its industrial properties recorded a 4.8 per cent lift in valuations despite the COVID recession. Dexus said it has 96 per cent occupancy in its office buildings, although that was by revenue, not physical occupancy. The AFR reports that the latest Property Council survey of commercial landlords found that more than two-thirds of Melbourne office space was empty, along with more than half of Sydney city office space, as at the end of January. Dexus did report an increase in ""incentives"" to attract and keep tenants in its office buildings, up from 17.1 per cent in June to 22 per cent by the end of December. The company announced a distribution of 28.8 cents per security to shareholders. Its share price fell (-3.6pc) to $8.42. Regional bank and insurer Suncorp reported a 23.7 per cent fall in net profit to $490 million, although its preferred measure of cash earnings was up nearly 40 per cent to $509 million. The company said the difference was mostly due to the $293 million gain on the sale of some businesses that bumped up net profit in the previous corresponding period. Suncorp more than doubled its insurance profit and recorded double-digit percentage gains in banking and wealth, as well as its New Zealand operations. It will pay a dividend of 26 cents per share, the same as last year's interim payout. Shares in Suncorp rose (+2.8pc) to $10.73. The volatile digital currency bitcoin took another large stride toward mainstream acceptance with Tesla's decision overnight. The announcements, buried deep in Tesla's 2020 annual report, drove a 13 per cent surge in the world's most widely-held cryptocurrency, to over $US44,000. At current prices, around 0.88 bitcoins would be enough to buy an entry-level Tesla Model 3. Investors anticipated other companies would soon join a list of firms that invest in or hold bitcoin, including the world's largest asset manager Blackrock, and payments companies Square and PayPal. ""Musk getting involved in bitcoin, to those investing in bitcoin, will be used as a way to tell others that this is a real asset, you can actually do something with it, they will support it as an argument of being the way of the future,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management. The news sparked heavy trading in cryptocurrencies and caused exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, Binance to experience technical issues, according to Coindesk. Some report exchanges including Binance and Kraken were having issues trading, while other also raised the question of whether Mr Musk has been pumping the price of bitcoin while making a major investment in the cryptocurrency. The price of bitcoin has soared by more than 330 per cent in the past year. A well-known supporter of cryptocurrencies, the Tesla CEO has weighed in regularly on the past month's frenzy in retail investment, also driving up prices of the meme-based digital currency dogecoin and shares of US video game chain GameStop. He said a week ago that bitcoin was ""on the verge"" of being more widely accepted among investors, and in December asked if it was possible to do large transactions in the currency. ""If any lesser mortals had made the decision to put part of their balance sheet in bitcoin, I don't think it would have been taken seriously,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital in New York. ""But when the richest man in the world does it, everyone has to take a second look."" Tesla said in a filing the decision to move nearly 8 per cent of its reserves into bitcoin was part of its broad investment policy as a company aimed at diversifying and maximizing its returns on cash, including holding gold. The report said it ended last year with $US19.38 billion in cash and cash equivalents. ""We expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt,"" Telsa said. The company said it had invested an aggregate $US1.5 billion in bitcoin under the changed policy and could ""acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term"". Tesla shares lifted (+1.2pc) to $US862.62. Ethereum, another cryptocurrency, surged to a record high, above $US1,700.

238,ASX rises to 11-month high as reporting season ramps up,markets,"  Australian shares rise to 11-month high as reporting season ramps up The Australian share market has risen for its second day in a row, climbing to its highest level since February 25 last year. Some of the nation's biggest companies will announce their results this week, and investors will get a chance to scrutinise the impact COVID-19 has had on their profits. Commonwealth Bank and Insurance Australia Group are among the big names who will report their earnings (on Wednesday), followed by AMP, Telstra, AGL Energy and Transurban (on Thursday). The ASX 200 closed 40 points (or 0.6 per cent) higher at 6,881. The benchmark index climbed as high as 6,901 points in early afternoon trade, before it pulled back slightly. The broader All Ordinaries index lifted 48 points (0.7 per cent) to finish at 7,161 points. Some of the best performing stocks on Monday were miners like Lynas Rare Earths (+7.1pc), Mineral Resources (+5.6pc) and Iluka Resources (+4.9pc), along with BlueScope Steel (+3.9pc) and Super Retail Group (+4pc). Shares in Zip Co surged (+12.9pc) to $9.80, on reports that management was looking to tap US investors over the next few days. On the flip side, News Corp (-3pc), Unibail Rodamco Westfield (-3.2pc), Origin Energy (-3.5pc), Nearmap (-2.9pc) and litigation funder Omni Bridgeway (-3.2pc) suffered heavy losses. Medical cannabis company Cann Group may have lost $3.6 million as a result of a cyber attack. Many new investors have jumped into the share market recently, and maybe you're one of them. So here's your cheat sheet to reporting season and what it means for your investment. The company said that it recently transferred that amount of money to an overseas contractor, in relation to work performed on its Mildura production site. Instead, it was received by an ""unknown third party"" as a result of a ""complex and sophisticated cyber fraud"". The company said that it discovered the problem on February 4 and it was working with its bank to see if any of that money could be ""halted"" or recovered. It also reported the matter to police in Victoria, the Netherlands and Hong Kong, along with Australia's Office of Drug Control. In a statement, Cann tried to reassure shareholders by saying it was ""in a financial position to continue with its ongoing operations and projects"" even if it was unable to recover the money. At first, investors hit the sell button, driving Cann's shares down as much as 4.8 per cent. But the cannabis stock eventually recovered from its losses, to end its day flat at 66 cents. In other news, shares in Sydney-based telco Vocus Group jumped (+12.8pc) to $4.94 after it received a non-binding takeover offer from Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Asset (MIRA), valued at $3.4 billion. Is all that Reddit lingo about GameStop making your head spin? Here's your shortcut guide. MIRA pitched its offer at $5.50 per share, which was a significant premium (+25.6pc) over Vocus's closing share price on Friday ($4.38). Sydney-based Vocus said it would open its books to MIRA for due diligence and pave the way for a binding proposal. ""The Board has concluded that it is in the best interests of Vocus shareholders to explore the potential for a transaction with MIRA,"" the company said in a statement to the ASX. Vocus owns internet brands like iPrimus and Dodo, fibre networks across Australia and New Zealand, along with a 4,600-kilometre underwater cable which connects Singapore with Perth. In recent years, Vocus has had trouble attracting takeover bids which end with a successful deal. AGL and Swedish private equity firm EQT Infrastructure abandoned their takeover bids in June 2019 after conducting due diligence on the local telco. Private equity firms KKR and Affinity Equity Partners were also interested in buying Vocus back in 2017. They also scrapped their offers after looking into the company's books. ""We believe a situation like that happening again would be perceived very negatively, with investors likely questioning what within the company is driving interest away,"" JPMorgan analysts said. ""While on the one hand, the actions by MIRA may elicit competing bids given the interest shown in Vocus in the past, there is clearly no guarantee that the process will lead to a full transaction."" The Australian dollar was buying 76.76 US cents by 4:25pm AEDT — having jumped by more than 1 per cent over the weekend. The health crisis caused by COVID-19 was a once-in-a-century event. The financial cost of 2020 has been millions of jobs, countless businesses, and soaring debt and deficits. It was mainly due to a weaker greenback, after the United States released some weaker-than-expected job figures on Friday. The number of non-farm payrolls increased by 49,900 last month, according to the US Labor Department's latest data. Not only that, December's job figures were even worse than initially thought. The US previously reported that 140,000 people lost their jobs in December. But now that figure has been revised sharply higher (to 227,000). US President Joe Biden has argued that the bleak job figures highlight the urgent need for Congress to approve his proposed $US1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. The prospect of more stimulus being pumped into the economy boosted Wall Street to record highs. The Dow Jones lifted (+0.3pc) to 31,148, while the S&P 500 went up (+0.4pc) to 3,887. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose (+0.6pc) to 13,856 on Friday. All three US indices posted their best week since November. Last week, the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq jumped by 3.9, 4.7 and 6 per cent respectively.

239,analysis: Profit reporting season will reveal how much companies banked from the COVID lockdowns,markets,"  Profit reporting season will reveal how much companies banked from the COVID lockdowns How much profit did large companies make during the lockdowns? We'll see evidence this week, when some of the biggest companies on Australia's stock exchange release their profit results. Telstra, Commonwealth Bank, AMP, AGL Energy, and Insurance Australia Group, are among the companies reporting their profits. Will their results contribute to the debate about the disconnect between the performance of stock markets and the 'real' economy? What about the JobKeeper program and executive bonuses? LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic In August last year, after US stock markets were already back near record highs — despite the country's deep recession and pandemic — the IMF released a paper on the disconnect between markets and economies in 2020. The paper's researchers said they considered several hypotheses for the disconnect (focusing on the US and Europe). The most compelling hypothesis, they said, was ""that unprecedented monetary policy actions … have driven asset prices up"" by causing a sharp drop in ""risk premiums and risk-free discount rates"". Or, in plain English: With central banks everywhere slashing interest rates to record lows and pumping their financial systems with oceans of cash, it had made it far less costly to make financially risky investments, so investors had been treating stock markets (even more) like casinos, sending asset prices soaring while real economic indicators deteriorated. The IMF researchers said that posed two problems. Firstly, it suggested when central banks eventually unwound their unprecedented policies it ""could trigger a reversal in asset valuations"" — that is, steep falls on stock markets. Secondly, it could undermine the public's faith in monetary policy. ""Perceptions that monetary policy has supported financial markets and investors while being unable to revive real activity and reduce unemployment could reignite the debate on the implications of monetary policy actions for inequality and on central bank accountability and independence,"" the IMF paper warned. Janet Yellen, a former chair of the US Federal Reserve and now Treasury Secretary under US President Joe Biden, made a similar point in an interview with the Washington Post. ""The stock market isn't the economy,"" she warned. ""The economy is production and jobs, and there are shortfalls in virtually every sector of the [US] economy."" Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic However, in Australia, the stock market was more tethered to reality last year. On Friday, the Reserve Bank's latest statement on monetary policy noted the ASX200 (which tracks the 200 largest companies on Australia's stock exchange) was still sitting at about 2 per cent below its February 2020 peak on a total return basis, which takes dividends into account. It said equity prices in the resources sector were almost back to their previous peak in early 2020, having contributed much of the rise in the ASX200 since March, and in recent months major miners had performed strongly on the back of higher iron ore prices. The Reserve Bank has launched a $100 billion bond buying program as it wrestles with the hit from COVID-19 to the economy, so what does it involve and how does it work? It also noted the financial sector remained 12 per cent below its February 2020 peak, in part reflecting the substantial provisions Australia's banks had made for a potentially large rise in bad loans. However, by close of business on Friday, bank stocks did drive the ASX200 index to an 11-month high after the RBA signalled it would extend its ""quantitative easing"" program by another $100 billion this year. The announcement lifted the share price of Commonwealth Bank (+1.8 per cent), Westpac (+2 per cent), ANZ (+2.1 per cent), NAB (+2.1 per cent), AMP (+2.9 per cent), Bank of Queensland (+2.2 per cent), and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank (+1.5 per cent), which boosted the index. RBA governor Philip Lowe, appearing before a parliamentary committee on Friday, said the fact Australia's share market was not hitting record highs suggested the RBA's unprecedented monetary easing had not damaged the integrity of equity prices in Australia. ""Sometimes I look at that analysis and ask, 'Why are people so concerned?' because the current value of, at least, the Australian share market is lower than it was at the beginning of last year,"" Dr Lowe said. ""At the moment, I don't have particular concerns about the valuation of assets. ""Those concerns could emerge over time. It's the same with housing. People often talk about housing and equities together, [but] the national house price index is only where it was four years ago. ""It's possible that these low interest rates will generate unsustainable increases in asset prices, but they haven't yet."" As reporting season heats up, the spotlight could return to executive bonuses. In September, an analysis of the financial reports of 290 of Australia's largest publicly listed companies by the corporate governance advisory Ownership Matters found at least 25 companies had paid bonuses to their executives last year, worth a combined $24.3 million, after claiming JobKeeper subsidies. It came after Jennifer Westacott, the chief executive of the Business Council of Australia, called on companies to refrain from paying executive bonuses if they received JobKeeper payments. JobKeeper and JobSeeker will change at the end of September. Here's what you need to know. ""It wasn't designed for that. It was designed to keep people working,"" Ms Westacott had said. On Monday last week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison was asked about the issue. He was asked what ""concrete action"" he'd be taking to ensure the companies who took millions of dollars from taxpayers under JobKeeper, before funnelling it through to executive bonuses and dividends, would be paying the money back. But he dismissed the question. ""I'm not into the politics of envy,"" Mr Morrison said. ""If there are some companies that feel that they want to hand that [money] back, great. Good for them. ""But let's not lose sight, in some sort of envy narrative, that that program did not change the course of the nation."" However, two days later, on Wednesday, the Auditor-General said he would be investigating the $100 billion JobKeeper scheme after concerns were raised about the scheme, including how companies receiving JobKeeper had paid executive bonuses and dividends. The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) said its audit of the scheme would include an evaluation of whether the Australian Tax Office (ATO) had ""implemented effective measures to protect the integrity of JobKeeper payments"", and if the ATO had ""effectively monitored and reported on the operational performance of the scheme"". It will complete its audit by October. A number of companies have said they will return the money they received under the JobKeeper scheme, including Toyota, Domino's, and Super Retail Group.

240,Bought shares during COVID? Here's why it's worth paying attention for the next few weeks,markets,"  Profit reporting season for ASX-listed companies has begun, so what does it mean for you? Many new investors have jumped into the share market recently, and maybe you're one of them. After plunging to the lows of March last year, the Australian market has been on the rebound, taking first-time investors along for the ride. And in the last few weeks, the GameStop buying frenzy has caught the attention of some who've never watched stocks before. With interest rates at record lows, the returns you get for keeping your money in the bank have plummeted, so more people are looking for alternative ways to boost their finances. If you've only started buying stocks in the past few months, this might be the first time you've heard of reporting season. So here's what it all means and how it's relevant to you. A couple of times a year, the financial press headlines are dominated by profit and loss figures, hits and misses and quotes from the chief executives of Australia's biggest companies. Reporting season is a period of a few weeks when many of Australia's publicly-listed companies disclose the details of their finances. Members of the public can buy shares in companies that are listed on a stock exchange, for example, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). These companies need to comply with disclosure laws — meaning they need to keep the market informed about the state of their finances and other major changes. Part of that disclosure is releasing financial reports twice a year, summarising their position for the past six months — including whether they've made a net profit or loss. Typically, this happens in February, providing a snapshot as at the end of December, and then again in August, following the end of the financial year on June 30. There are some firms that have different end dates for their balance sheets and so don't adhere to these windows, but the majority of results come out within a few weeks of each other, creating a so-called 'reporting season' twice a year. Go back to the basics: what to do when you don't know where to start with shares. When you own shares in a company, you have a stake in how that company performs, because it'll affect the value of your shares. If you've bought the shares as a long-term investment, you'll be hoping the value increases over time, so you can make a profit when you sell them. Paying attention to the company's results come reporting season will provide a window into how its finances stack up, what its strategy is and how management is viewing the outlook. The results reports contain plenty of specifics that can help you form a view about whether the company is going to be a good investment. These include how sales are tracking, what the major sources of revenue are, how high costs are, how much debt it has to repay and how fast it's growing. The other thing that you'll find out by paying attention during reporting season is whether you're going to receive a dividend payment and, if so, how much it'll be. Here's a handy cheat sheet to all the jargon you're likely to encounter in company's results. A dividend is a payment returning some of a company's earnings back to its shareholders. When a company makes a profit, it may decide to use that money to expand the business or invest in new technology, for example. But a company that doesn't have grand expansion plans or has been accumulating profits may decide to distribute some of that profit amongst shareholders through a dividend payment. Is all that Reddit lingo about GameStop making your head spin? Here's your shortcut guide. Some firms have well-established dividend policies and consistently pay out a certain proportion of their earnings as dividends every six months. Dividends are announced as an amount per share, so if a company says it'll pay 30 cents per share, and you own 100 shares in the company, you'll receive $30. These stocks are attractive to investors who are looking to generate passive income from their investment — or money for doing nothing. You can chose to either receive the dividend payment as cash, which gives you the flexibility to invest that money in other stocks if you like, or you can automatically reinvest your dividends in the same stock, growing your shareholding in the company. Sometimes companies will pay a special dividend, which is a one-off payment and is usually the result of one-off income, such as the proceeds of selling part of the business. Younger investors are jumping into exchange traded funds — so what exactly are they? Unsurprisingly, what's revealed in company's reports can have a major effect on what happens to the price of its shares, and therefore the value of your investment. But it's not as simple as profit = share price up, loss = share price down. Share prices tend to more closely reflect how the company performed compared to expectations — did it miss or beat its own forecasts, or those of analysts who closely watch it? Under the same disclosure laws mentioned above, companies need to give the market the head's up if things are tracking much better or worse than expected and not just wait until reporting season rolls around twice a year. However, there is still plenty of scope for bad or good results to shock the market and lead to big share price movements. Other factors that influence share price movements are what the management is projecting about the six months ahead, usually referred to as guidance or an outlook statement, and whether it pays a dividend, and how much that is. And yet another variable is how a company's share price has performed ahead of reporting season. With markets booming into the end of the year, some stock prices have shot up, meaning the market is valuing certain companies at way more than their projected earnings would typically justify. ""The elevated parts of the market may find it hard to live up to expectations,"" the research team at stockbroker Morgans writes. Disappointing results could be punished and share prices could fall sharply. This February reporting season will reveal results for the first half of the 2020-21 financial year, so July through December last year. If you think back to that not-so-long ago time, there was a lot happening: COVID-19 restrictions began to ease, before Melbourne was struck by a second wave of the virus. JobKeeper was extended but at a lower rate, as was the JobSeeker supplement. The trade war with China ratcheted up a notch, with more industries hit with tariffs or import restrictions. US voters went to the polls and elected Joe Biden. Iron ore prices were on a tear and the Aussie dollar steadily rose… to name a few things. The health crisis caused by COVID-19 was a once-in-a-century event. The financial cost of 2020 has been millions of jobs, countless businesses, and soaring debt and deficits. All of this will have affected Australian companies in different ways, depending on what industries they operate in, their exposure to overseas markets and their existing financial position. Tourism-exposed businesses, such as airlines, travel agencies, accommodation and entertainment companies are expected to have remained under pressure over the six-month period. ""We're going to continue to see that those businesses are struggling, although I do think we are reaching the point where investors can begin to look ahead, and especially now we're starting to see these regional travel bubbles open,"" Saxo Capital Markets strategist Eleanor Creagh tells ABC's The Business. Commodities such as iron ore have enjoyed strong prices, which is good news for mining companies — and could mean big dividends for shareholders. Retailers that cater for electronics and home office needs are also likely to have benefitted from the continuation of working from home during the period. ""That'll be retailers with a strong online presence, that'll be technology platforms that go along with it, but also the likes of logistics providers that do the delivery,"" Melior Investment Management investment analyst Nina Wilkinson says. One thing not to expect, though, is concrete guidance for the year ahead — after being burned by a year that defied all forecasts, some analysts think companies are unlikely to make bold projections with any certainty. ""We've noticed a trend for companies to start shying away from giving guidance even before the pandemic, but I think that'll definitely persist in this earnings period,"" Ms Wilkinson says.

241,ASX jumps as Christmas sales lift above pre-COVID levels; GameStop sheds $US30b in a week,markets,"  ASX jumps as Christmas sales lift above pre-COVID levels; GameStop sheds $US30b in a week The Australian share market has risen back to an 11-month high, with bank stocks providing the major boost. The ASX 200 regained all of yesterday's losses, after gaining 75 points (+1.1pc) to 6,841. The broader All Ordinaries index went up by a similar level to 7,107 points. The Australian dollar slipped to 75.98 US cents as the Reserve Bank took governor took questions from Canberra politicians about this latest economic forecasts. Brent crude oil futures lifted (+1.2pc) to $US59.25 a barrel, while spot silver dropped (-1.9pc) to $US26.34 an ounce. Gold prices fell below the key $US1,800 psychological level. The precious metal's spot price was down (-2pc) to $US1,797.26 an ounce as a jump in the US dollar and US Treasury yields eroded bullion's appeal. The price of Australia's key export to China, iron ore, surged (+3.5pc) to $US158.03 a tonne. Some of the best-performing stocks were Zip Co (+8pc), Nearmap (+7pc), Nanonsonics (+6pc) and Challenger (+5.7pc). Shares in News Corp jumped shares jumped (+13.2pc) after the company reported its net income rose (+153pc) in the December quarter. ""The second quarter of fiscal 2021 was the most profitable quarter since the new News Corp was launched more than seven years ago, reflecting the ongoing digital transformation of the business,"" said the company's CEO Robert Thomson. Real estate advertiser REA Group saw its shares rise (+1.6pc) after reporting that its half-year profit rose (+13pc) to $172.1 million. ""Australia's property market appears to be on the march again, showing signs of a strong recovery in November and December,"" REA's chief executive Owen Wilson said. ""This was fuelled by the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, combined with increasing consumer confidence, record low interest rates and healthy bank liquidity."" Financial stocks gave the market its biggest boost, after the RBA signalled it would extend monetary policy support for longer. This lifted the share price of Commonwealth Bank (+1.8pc), Westpac (+2pc), ANZ (+2.1pc), NAB (+2.1pc), AMP (+2.9pc), Bank of Queensland (+2.2[c) and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank (+1.5pc) and Virgin Money UK (+7.1pc). On the flip side, Janus Henderson (-5.6pc), CSR (-2.9pc), OZ Minerals (-2.2pc), and gold miner Northern Star Resources (-2.1pc) were among the weakest performers. The Independent Planning Commission (IPC) has rejected South32's coal mine expansion project beneath Sydney's drinking water catchment. That led to the miner's share price dropping (-2.9pc). The latest figures from the Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed that retail sales dropped (-4.1pc) to $30.4 billion in December 2020, compared to the previous month. More millennials are turning to 'buy now, pay later' players like Afterpay and Zip. It came after a blockbuster November, when retail sales jumped (+7.1pc), as customers snapped up Black Friday sales and ramped up their online shopping. December's result - which covers the Christmas and Boxing Day sales period - was marginally better than the ABS's preliminary estimate (-4.2pc) of retail sales a fortnight ago. However, it was still a lot higher (+9.6pc) than it was a year ago, which means consumers are now spending more than they did compared to pre-COVID levels. ""Victoria (-6.8 per cent) led falls at the state and territory level following stronger trade in November as COVID-19 restrictions eased,"" Ben James, the ABS director of quarterly economy wide surveys, wrote in a statement. ""New South Wales (-4.9 per cent) also fell as the Northern Beaches cluster impacted spending in the lead-up to Christmas."" The only retail sector to enjoy increased sales, over the month, was cafes, restaurants and takeaway food (+3.2pc). The biggest falls were seen in household goods (-8.3pc), clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing (-9.4pc), department stores (-12.5pc) and food retailing (-1.7pc). The ABS pointed out that online sales made up 9.1 per cent of all retail sales in December. That was up from 6.6 per cent a year earlier. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe gave an update on Australia's economic recovery from COVID-19, before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics in Canberra this morning. National house prices continue to withstand the otherwise devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but how long will this last asks Nassim Khadem. Earlier this week, Australia's central bank decided to inject an extra $100 billion worth of cash into the economy by ramping up its bond-buying program. Dr Lowe said the RBA had to do it because many other countries were doing the same thing, and if it didn't follow, the Australian dollar would have risen even further. ""If we were to cease bond purchases in April, it is likely that there would be unwelcome upward pressure on the exchange rate,"" he said. ""This would further delay the already slow progress on jobs and inflation."" Later in the morning, the RBA published its Statement on Monetary Policy, which said GDP was expected to return to its pre-COVID levels by the middle of this year. But it also said pay rises and the cost of living would still be at a very weak level by mid-2023 (even under in its best-case scenario). That is why it expects the cash rate to remain at a record low 0.1 per cent for the next three years. According to its central scenario: The bank has long assumed wage growth would need to run between 3 and 4 per cent in order to get inflation above its target level (at least 2 per cent). The sell-off in GameStop shares and other ""meme stocks"" accelerated overnight on US markets, as retail investors aggressively hit the sell button. GameStop's share price tanked (-42.1pc) to $US53.50 on Thursday (local time), and has lost nine-tenths of its value since last week. Its market value is now around $US3.7 billion. Last week, shares in the video game retailer surged to a record high of $US483 amid the online battle that pitched amateur traders against Wall Street titans. At its peak, the company was briefly worth more than $US33 billion. What are hedge funds, and how did they (accidentally) send GameStop's stock flying 'to the moon'? Cinema chain AMC's value has shed about 80 per cent of its value in the past week, while directors and executives at Koss Corp (another stock caught up in the trading blitz) sold at least $US44 million in stock this week, according to CNBC. The sell-off occurred as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that she and financial market regulators needed to ""understand deeply"" what happened in the recent retail trading frenzy before taking any action. A swarm of buying by amateur traders over the past two weeks sparked big moves in shares of companies that hedge funds had bet against in a confrontation some framed as a fight between Wall Street and Main Street. Retail investors burnt in the wild swings of the past fortnight are now likely to be more cautious in driving up shares of companies with a high short interest, said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh. ""[They] can see that this is a rollercoaster ride and not a one-way trip up, and that's probably given them a little more pause before pushing the buy button,"" she said. On WallStreetBets (WSB), the Reddit forum at the centre of the ""short squeeze"", some members urged each other to hold the line and not sell GameStop, while others expressed frustration at the stock's big drop. ""Don't fight against each other. Stay together!!! #WSB,"" one of its users wrote. ""I don't care about the money anymore, I'm going to hold for the cause,"" said another. Despite losing a lot of money, some members are holding onto the stock for ideological reasons. ""I put my entire portfolio into GME [GameStop] and AMC. I'm down 65 per cent. I will not sell … Holding till we go to the moon or till both hit $0.01,"" another member posted. Others were a little more pessimistic, with some users saying: Global markets rose overnight as signs of a stable US job market and a stronger US greenback turned attention to economies on the mend rather than the recent trading frenzy in ""meme stocks"" sparked by retail investors. The Reserve Bank has launched a $100 billion bond buying program as it wrestles with the hit from COVID-19 to the economy, so what does it involve and how does it work? Expectations of more stimulus, low interest rates and news that British researchers plan to use the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines to find ways to reduce coronavirus variants are pushing equities higher, said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Jersey. ""Extremely low interest rates that continue despite heavy government spending and deficits are leaving investors with a feeling it's slanted toward an upward market,"" he said. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones index closed 332 points (+1.1pc) higher at 31,056 on Thursday afternoon (local time). The S&P 500 lifted (+1.1pc) to 3,871, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced (+1.2pc) to 13,778. Both the S&P and Nasdaq climbed to their highest levels ever. The latest jobs data showed that 779,000 Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, which was lower than what the market had expected. At least 17.8 million Americans were receiving ongoing unemployment benefits in mid-January. This suggests long-term unemployment is entrenched and could boost US President Joe Biden's push for Congress to pass his $US1.9 trillion relief bill. In European markets, Britain's FTSE was down (-0.1pc) to 6,504, while Germany's DAX went up (+0.9pc) to 14,060.

Shares in Nick Scali initially rose after the company said its half-year profit jumped (+89.9pc) to $40.6 million. But they fell (-0.9pc) to $10.51 by the end of the trading day. The furniture retailer will pay an interim dividend of 40 cents per share (a big increase from last year's dividend of 25 cents). It received $3.6 million in JobKeeper wage subsidies in the second half of 2020. The Australian dollar recovered (+0.3pc) to 76.27 US cents. It is now almost back to where it was before the Reserve Bank announced an extra $100 billion worth of stimulus on Tuesday. Telstra chief executive Andy Penn said the company was resuming its massive retrenchment exercise. While a hodgepodge of technologies are behind some of the NBN's tech woes, it's an overvaluation of the network that's the biggest short-term barrier to faster internet speeds. ""As you all know, last year we put our T22 job reductions on hold when COVID hit,"" Mr Penn wrote on Wednesday, in a company-wide email. ""We did this to give you as much certainty as we could during a very challenging time. ""We also said we would have to move ahead on these early this year as we continue to transform the company and complete our T22 journey. Today we are proposing up to 1,425 net role reductions."" Back in mid-2018, the telco announced its plans to cut 8,000 jobs over the next three years in an effort to reduce costs by $2.5 billion, as part of its ""T22 strategy"". Mr Penn is expecting to finalise most of these job cuts by the middle of this year. ""Adding today's proposals, we expect to be more than 90 per cent through our T22 commitment to reduce our overall workforce by 8,000 net roles by 30 June 2021 and have completed or nearly finished by the end of this calendar year,"" he wrote. But there could be further job losses beyond that, he warned. ""We will need to continue making organisational changes, which will likely include role reductions beyond T22 as our business changes — just as we did before T22,"" Mr Penn wrote. Fixed wireless internet promised so much, like the ability for high-tech businesses to base themselves almost anywhere in Australia. But then along came Netflix and everything changed. The Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union (CEPU), which represents workers in the telco industry, has urged Telstra to reconsider its need to make further job cuts, particularly in rural and regional areas. ""While Telstra continues to cut staff, it's the workers and customers who are bearing the brunt of it,"" CEPU national president Shane Murphy said. ""A job cut of this scale will hamper the ability of the Telstra workforce to get the job done, hastening the deterioration of the network and contributing to longer waits and increased outages for customers."" In August, Telstra reported that its annual profit (for the 2019-20 financial year) had dropped 14.4 per cent to $1.8 billion. Three months later, it announced a major restructuring plan, amid widespread speculation it is positioning to buy the National Broadband Network in coming years. Under that plan, Telstra would split itself into three legal entities: Telstra shares finished trading 1.6 per cent lower at $3.14. Origin Energy plummeted (-6.9pc) to $4.62, after the company slashed the earnings forecast for its energy markets division because of weaker demand for oil and gas amid the pandemic. Some of Australia's leading labour market analysts warn wages stagnation is undermining financial stability and social cohesion and there is no improvement in sight. The gas and power retailer now expects underlying earnings before interest and tax (EBITDA) to be around $1 billion to $1.14 billion in the current financial year. It was a big downgrade from its previous estimate (of earnings between $1.15 billion and $1.3 billion). Shares in AGL Energy dropped (-3.6pc) to $11.42, after the company said it expected to book $2.69 billion worth of impairments. The dour outlook for energy prices has forced AGL to write down the value of its assets and its previously signed wind energy contracts. AGL said it expected a ""sustained and material reduction in [energy] prices"" due to the slump in the wholesale power market and government plans to underwrite new power plants. ""For AGL watchers looking to potentially pick the bottom, we think this is bearish,"" said Royal Bank of Canada analyst James Nevin, who has an ""underperform"" rating on the stock. ""We are of the view that it is hard to see a rebound in prices due to the structural change in wholesale electricity and the continued underwriting of new generation with contracts outside of the spot and futures market in the NEM (National Electricity Market)."" He said that it means ""additional supply would continue to come online despite low spot and futures prices"". China's reliance on steel-intensive infrastructure and construction — to sustain economic growth — means it has little choice but to keep importing Australian iron ore, even as prices for the mineral hit multi-year highs. National house prices continue to withstand the otherwise devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but how long will this last asks Nassim Khadem. Goods exports to China jumped 21 per cent in December (to a six-month high of $13.3 billion), with iron ore up sharply by both value and volume, according to figures published by the Bureau of Statistics (ABS) on Thursday. That helped Australia's trade surplus swell to $6.8 billion in December (up from $5 billion the month before). In the final month of the year, exports rose (-2.8pc) while imports fell (-2.4pc). The surplus for the December quarter widened (+28pc) to $17.4 billion, a timely positive for tax revenue that is helping the country quickly recover from its first recession in three decades. For all of 2020, exports climbed (+12pc) — a resilient result given the disruptions caused by the global pandemic. While China remains Australia's single biggest market, exporters are finding willing buyers elsewhere for goods targeted by Beijing's trade restrictions. ""In particular, Australian coal shut out of China is rapidly finding new homes,"" said Daniel Hynes, a senior commodity strategist at ANZ. ""The complete collapse of [coal] exports to China has been more than offset by gains in exports to Japan, India, South Korea and Thailand."" Shipments of hard coking coal jumped (+28pc) in December, from the previous month, while thermal coal rose by a quarter. Demand has proved so robust that prices for coking coal have risen by a quarter over the past year, while thermal coal shipped from the port of Newcastle is up nearly 60 per cent. China imposed crippling tariffs on Australian barley in May, a decision the Federal Government is appealing before the World Trade Organization (WTO). It also imposed an unofficial ban on Australia's coal shipments, and slapped huge tariffs on the wine industry, among many other restrictions on goods like timber, lobsters and beef. Wild swings in the share price of GameStop and other social media darlings subsided on Wednesday local time, a day after a sharp selloff, as investors turned their focus to the possibility of tighter US trading regulations. Mass buying over the past two weeks by amateur traders following posts on social media drove wild price moves in companies that big hedge funds had bet against, including video game retailer GameStop and cinema operator AMC Entertainment. GameStop shares had soared as high as $US483 last week fuelled by posts on the popular Reddit forum WallStreetBets, then lost more than half their value and fell briefly below $US90, earlier this week. They finished trading up 2.1 per cent (to $US92.41), changing direction several times but staying in a more narrow range. Shares of AMC rose 14.4 per cent, following a drop of 41 per cent, a day earlier. Any pullback in GameStop shares could expose investors to losses, especially if they bought the stock at recent highs, or on margin, or using options trading strategies. Regulators may want to quell such risks. Wondering why a struggling video game chain is grabbing global financial headlines, and what Reddit and Robinhood have to do with it? It has something to do with shorts, as Paul Donoughue and David Chau explain. Other so-called ""meme stocks"" caught up in the Reddit rally rose overnight, including headphone maker Koss Corp (+28pc) and home furnishing retailer Bed Bath & Beyond (+10.4pc). BlackBerry's US-listed shares gained 3.8 per cent (following a 21 per cent slide a day earlier). Silver prices, which surged to an eight-year high on Monday (after it became an alternate focus for retail traders) have stabilised. Its spot price lifted (+0.9pc) to $US26.84 an ounce — though it came after an 8 per cent slump the previous day. The head of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which regulates markets, will meet with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and the heads of the Federal Reserve and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as soon as Thursday, according to Reuters. What are hedge funds, and how did they (accidentally) send GameStop's stock flying 'to the moon'? This meeting will probably include ""some disguised reference to GameStop somewhere on the fringes, but it probably won't be called out specifically in order to keep the Government at bay and let the regulators do their thing,"" chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth in New York, Robert Pavlik, said. Experts expect the focus to fall on the ever-larger role played by non-bank firms such as hedge funds in financial markets, while small traders are bracing for a showdown. Regulators have not yet signalled what form any official actions could take. Potential targets range from retail brokers' capital requirements to questioning the fee-free brokerage model that has encouraged much of the trade. Online brokerage app Robinhood will allow investors to buy parts of shares in GameStop and AMC, a move that could encourage participation from smaller investors. After a choppy session on Wall Street overnight, the Nasdaq Composite was flat (down 2 points) at 13,611. The Dow Jones index closed marginally higher (+0.1pc) at 30,724 points. Is all that Reddit lingo about GameStop making your head spin? Here's your shortcut guide. The benchmark S&P 500 rose (+0.1pc) to 3,830, its third consecutive day of gains. The CBOE volatility index (VIX) has also dropped for three straight sessions as analysts said the Reddit action appeared to be constrained to a handful of stocks rather than spilling over to the broader US stock market. ""There isn't much of a worry that this is a signal that could destabilise the whole system,"" said Simona Gambarini, markets economist at Capital Economics. In European markets, Britain's FTSE was down (-0.1pc) to 6,508, while Germany's DAX closed moderately higher (+0.7pc) at 13,934. Oil prices climbed to their highest levels in almost a year, with Brent crude futures up (+1.6pc) to $US58.39 a barrel. Spot gold fell (-0.3pc) to $US1,832.85 an ounce. Shares in Google's parent company, Alphabet, jumped (+7.3pc) to $US2,058.88, following its strong quarterly results Google, which generates more revenue from internet advertising than any other company, benefited from lockdowns that drove retail and other clients online, helping offset cutbacks by travel and entertainment advertisers. Aided by $US3 billion in unrealised startup investment gains, Alphabet's December-quarter profit rose (+43pc) to $US15.2 billion. Within a couple of years the likes of Google and Facebook will devour more than half local ad revenues, leaving only crumbs for traditional media players. Expressed another way, it earned $US22.30 per share, which was much higher than analysts' estimates of $US15.95 per share. Google's advertising business, including YouTube, accounted for 81 per cent of Alphabet's record $US56.9 billion in quarterly sales, which rose 23 per cent compared with a year ago. Its cloud sales, also benefiting from the pandemic, were $US3.83 billion during the quarter, up 46 per cent from the same time last year. Amazon shares fell (-2pc) to $US3,312.53, as Jeff Bezos's surprise move to step down as chief executive (to take on the executive chairman role) quashed optimism about its bumper quarterly results. However, analysts were upbeat on the promotion of its cloud computing head Andy Jassy to the top job. Amazon's net sales rose to $US125.6 billion as consumers turned to the world's largest online retailer for their holiday shopping — beating analyst estimates of $119.7 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Meanwhile Amazon's e-commerce business has never been so large. Since the start of the US coronavirus outbreak, consumers have turned to Amazon for delivery of home staples and medical supplies. While bricks-and-mortar shops closed their doors, Amazon recruited more than 400,000 additional workers to keep up with demand. That has placed the Seattle-based company at the centre of workplace tumult. More than 19,000 staff have contracted COVID-19 as of September, and some employees have protested and demanded facility closures.

243,"Reserve Bank not worried about housing bubble, as ASX jumps to 11-month high",markets,"  Reserve Bank not worried about housing bubble, as Australian shares jump to 11-month high The local share market has closed near its highest level in almost a year, as retail investors dumped GameStop shares and silver, causing their prices to tumble. The ASX 200 index jumped 62 points (+0.9pc) to 6,825, around its levels from late February 2020, when the coronavirus sell-off began. The broader All Ordinaries lifted by a similar level to 7,090 points, notching its third consecutive day of gains. Shares in buy-now pay-later companies like Afterpay and Zip Co dropped after Britain announced it plans to introduce tougher regulation on the industry. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank is more worried about containing the Australian dollar's ""unwelcome"" surge than bubbles potentially forming in the property and share markets. The central bank surprised investors by pledging to inject an extra $100 billion worth of cash to prop up the economy on Tuesday — despite its upbeat comments that Australia was enjoying a faster-than-expected recovery from the pandemic. RBA governor Philip Lowe gave more detail about the ""significant"" bond buying (or quantitative easing) scheme today, during his speech at the National Press Club in Canberra. When asked whether the RBA was engaged in a ""cold war on currencies"" with other central banks, his short answer was ""no"". Since the pandemic began, many countries have tried to weaken their currencies, by cutting interest rates to zero (or into negative territory) and pumping trillions of dollars worth of stimulus into their economies. ""No one wants to see it [their currencies] go up by that much,"" Dr Lowe said. ""If some central banks are doing quantitative easing, the rest of us feel like we need to do that as well."" ""Do we need to do this for years? I hope not. I don't expect we'll need to do it for years."" Overnight, the Australian dollar fell as low as 75.65 US cents — but recovered to 76.1 US cents ahead of Dr Lowe's speech. The RBA chief pointed out the local share market had recovered to where it was at the start of last year, and that it was ""possible"" for house prices to rise further. In contrast, most economists are betting Australia's house prices will become a lot more expensive this year, driven by record low interest rates. ""But there's factors working in the opposite direction,"" Dr Lowe said. Some of Australia's leading labour market analysts warn wages stagnation is undermining financial stability and social cohesion and there is no improvement in sight. ""Population growth, I said, the lowest since 1916, [and] the rate of new house building is the highest in decades. ""We've still got falling rents for apartments in Sydney and Melbourne. So there are a lot of dynamics going on here. At the moment, I don't see anything that's unsustainable."" Dr Lowe also said the ""term funding facility"" (TFF) — which provides banks with additional funding at at a fixed rate of 0.1 per cent — will be maintained as it is. This means banks will be able to keep borrowing from the RBA's special fund until late June, and get the ""benefit of low-cost funding out to mid 2024"". ""The board would consider extending this facility if there were a marked deterioration in funding and credit conditions in the Australian financial system. At the moment, there are no signs of this."" ANZ's head of Australian economics David Plank believes this is a ""clear signal"" that the RBA will begin to roll back some of its stimulus measures in June. ""This will represent a tightening in monetary conditions,"" he said. ""So bringing it [the TFF] to an end is, in our view, inconsistent with Lowe's remark that 'it is premature to be considering withdrawal of the monetary stimulus'."" ""The RBA's stance implies it doesn't see the end to the TFF as having a material impact on the market. ""We aren't so sure, particularly given the competitive pressure in the mortgage market that comes from having all banks being able to obtain three-year funding at 10 basis points (0.1 per cent)."" Britain is planning to introduce new laws for buy-now pay-later (BNPL) credit as consumers increasingly struggled during the pandemic lockdowns. BNPL services are particularly popular with younger people, and is offered by companies like Afterpay (and its British subsidiary, Clearpay), Zip Co, Klarna, LayBuy, Openpay, and Paypal. They generally offer interest-free, short-term loans that spread the payment for retail goods over a few months. ""By stepping in and regulating, we're making sure people are treated fairly and only offered agreements they can afford – the same protections you'd expect with other loans,"" Britain's financial services minister John Glen said in a statement. Legislation will be brought in as soon as parliamentary time allows, forcing providers to make affordability checks before lending to a customer, he added. Britain is breaking from Australia, where the corporate regulator (ASIC) last year stopped short of recommending that BNPL be included in consumer finance regulation. This development led to big falls across Afterpay (-1.6pc), Zip (-1.1pc) and Splitit (-0.7pc) shares. But Sezzle departed from the trend, and saw its share price rise (+2.4pc). Mr Glen was responding to a review on the $448 billion (250 billion pound) unsecured credit market by former Financial Conduct Authority interim CEO Christopher Woolard, which was also published on Tuesday. Woolard told reporters retailers could start ""putting their own house in order"" by doing credit checks on customers and that new rules would hopefully come into force in ""months rather than years"". Demand for BNPL products spiked in tandem with COVID-19 restrictions, with products nearly quadrupling in 2020, and now total $4.8 billion (2.7 billion pounds), with 5 million users since the beginning of the pandemic, the review said. ""The emergence and expansion of unregulated BNPL products gives consumers a significant alternative to more expensive credit, but this also comes with significant potential for consumer harm,"" the review added. Eight out of every 10 stocks traded higher, including Carsales (+6.3pc), Flight Centre (+4.9pc) and Credit Corp (+4.7pc). More millennials are turning to 'buy now, pay later' players like Afterpay and Zip. Shares in Amcor jumped (+4.5pc) after the packaging company reported a two-thirds increase in its half year profit. Amcor rallied 6.7 per cent after reporting a 65 per cent hike in first-half profit and lifting its full year earnings per share guidance. Virgin Money UK jumped (+14.6pc) after saying it returned to a statutory profit in the first quarter — a big recovery compared to its $253 million (141 million pound) quarterly loss, a year earlier. The biggest boost to the market came from financial stocks like Commonwealth Bank (+1.2pc), Westpac (+1.5pc), ANZ (+1.8pc), NAB (+1.9pc), AMP (+2.6pc) and Bank of Queensland (+2pc). Mining stocks were some of today's worst performers as iron ore prices dropped (-4.6pc) to $US149.80 a tonne. That led to falls across BHP (-2.2pc), Rio Tinto (-1.1pc) and Fortescue Metals (-0.2pc). Shares in other miners also suffered heavy falls, like South32 (-2.9pc) and Mineral Resources (-1.9pc), Whitehaven Coal (-1.3pc), Northern Star Resources (-4.2pc) and Saracen Mineral (-4.1pc). On US markets, shares of video game retailer GameStop plunged (-60pc) to $90 on Tuesday (local time). Its shares had skyrocketed by more than 1,600 per cent last month, reaching a high of $US483. They are now worth about a fifth of that record high price. Other so-called meme stocks caught up in the Reddit rally also sold off, with hedge funds and other investors making or losing billions of dollars. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Express Inc and Koss Corp each dropped by about a third, while Naked Brand Group BlackBerry and Bed Bath & Beyond showed double-digit percentage losses. Nokia's US-listed shares fell 8 per cent. ""The rally is likely over [since] the short positions are pretty well taken care of,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""That's the game you play when you do this thing. It can work for a while until it stops working and when it stops working, it reverses pretty quickly."" Short sellers saw paper gains of $US3.4 billion during Tuesday’s session, according to S3 Partners. Year-to-date realised and unrealised losses for shorts recently stood at $9.2 billion. ""We have had a lot of shorts take their losses and walk away from the trade,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3. Spot silver also suffered a big fall, with prices down (-8.2pc) to $US26.61 an ounce. This was after exchange operator CME Group raised margins on its COMEX 5000 Silver Futures contract by 17.9 per cent (to their highest since October 2020). Wondering why a struggling video game chain is grabbing global financial headlines, and what Reddit and Robinhood have to do with it? It has something to do with shorts, as Paul Donoughue and David Chau explain. The main silver ETF, the iShares Silver Trust, was down (-7pc) to $US24.90. Earlier this week, the ""poor man's gold"" hit an eight-year high, above $US30 an ounce. Analysts said the silver pullback may show the limits of small investors' impact in a large market, while posts on the popular Reddit forum WallStreetBets ranged from those giving up on the GameStop trade to calls to stick with the stock. CME's decision to raise margins took the air out GameStop as well. Short interest fell to 53 per cent of the stock's available shares to trade (down from 140 per cent), said Tom Hayes, founder and chairman of hedge fund Great Hill Capital in New York. ""Everyone's rushing for the same narrow exit and trying to get off margin, and you have a lot of weak sisters that are coming out of the stock,"" Mr Hayes said. ""The squeeze is over."" Online broker Robinhood, on whose platform much of the buying and selling has taken place, raised trading limits on GameStop Corp, AMC and other stocks, according to an update on its website on Tuesday. Analysts predict that the market action, which has drawn the attention of regulators and politicians, was likely to fade, and said it was just a question of how soon. ""This is a pretty narrow strategy that likely creates some bizarre situations like GameStop and AMC but it's not broad enough to change how institutional investors are going to invest,"" said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Jersey. What are hedge funds, and how did they (accidentally) send GameStop's stock flying 'to the moon'? ""The strength of the move was so severe that it really opened up people's eyes to the power of social media in the investment world. ""But having seen it and how short-term the nature of it is, I think it'll lose its surprise."" Robinhood's app recorded more downloads than any other US trading app last week despite concerns about its restrictions on transactions. The GameStop saga is likely to expedite a regulatory review of the role non-bank firms play in markets, experts said. Broader markets appeared to be moving on and US stock indices built on the previous session's momentum as Wall Street's fear gauge (the VIX) retreated to an almost one-week low. Investors were feeling optimistic as they saw improved prospects for US President Joe Biden's proposed $US1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package. This was after he met with 10 Senate Republicans to discuss their vastly scaled-back $US618 billion plan. The Dow Jones index closed 475 points (or 1.6 per cent) higher at 30,687. The S&P 500 went up (+1.4pc) to 3,826, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced (+1.6pc) to 13,613. Spot gold prices fell (-1.3pc) to $US1,835.41 an ounce. Oil prices jumped, reaching their highest in nearly 12 months after the world's major producers showed they were reining in output roughly in line with their commitments. Brent crude futures lifted (+2.1pc) to $US57.55 a barrel.

244,analysis: Reddit army risks sparking a 'black swan event',markets,"  Silver the next target of exuberant Reddit social media traders Early on the morning of September 12, 2001, my home phone didn't stop ringing. I eventually picked it up and my panicked boss wanted me to come into work ASAP. I was a 'desk jockey' for a stockbroking firm and the phones were ringing off the hook. Clients wanted to ""sell, sell, sell"" following news of the terror attacks overnight in Manhattan. The trading floor was abuzz with a mixture of excitement, uncertainty and unease. Earlier this week, I walked into the trading room at ABC Bullion, a Sydney-based silver and gold dealer. The same feelings I had back in 2001 came over me like a wave, because the environment I walked into was eerily similar. Phones were ringing off the hook and there was excitement in the air. But this time, customers were calling in looking to open accounts and buy, buy, buy. What were they buying? Silver. The social media investor army making a name for themselves by taking on Wall Street are now turning their attention to the silver market, pushing the price of the precious metal to as much as an eight-year high above $US30 an ounce. Since Thursday, the ""poor man's gold"" had surged by around 20 per cent, after posts on Reddit led small investors to buy silver mining stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETF) backed by physical silver bars, in a GameStop-style squeeze. Overnight, it dropped 8.2 per cent back to $US26.61 an ounce, showing that what goes up on markets often comes back down, and the steeper the rise the quicker the descent. In recent weeks, the renegade traders have pumped up the share price of struggling bricks and mortar video game company GameStop to hurt big investment firms who were trying to profit from short-selling the stock. However, the GameStop bubble appears to have well and truly burst overnight, with prices plunging 60 per cent to $US90; they had reached a high of $US483 last month, although they were trading below $US20 last year before the Reddit crowd started moving in. Now, some are saying on blog posts they want to hurt the big banks which, they say, have been controlling and manipulating the price of silver for years. It's clear some big investment firms have short positions in silver. What's not clear is how big these positions are, and whether they are at risk of being ""squeezed"". Some on the reddit forum are saying ""let's execute a silver squeeze"". Others are saying: ""NO! It's a scam!"" Regardless, people are talking about it online. And silver shares, ETFs, bars, coins (basically anything silver-related) have shot up in value. The Reddit army has proved again it's an investment force. It has the ability, via critical mass, to target assets and drive their prices up. And financial authorities are getting nervous The US financial markets cop is watching on with interest. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Wednesday it was ""aware of and actively monitoring"" ongoing market volatility in options and equities markets, after the dramatic run-up in the share prices of companies such as GameStop, AMC Entertainment and Blackberry. Wondering why a struggling video game chain is grabbing global financial headlines, and what Reddit and Robinhood have to do with it? It has something to do with shorts, as Paul Donoughue and David Chau explain. And the Australian financial markets regulator, ASIC, also has one eye out looking at the silver market. ""ASIC is aware and monitoring the surge in prices of securities linked with silver to ensure markets remain orderly,"" an ASIC spokesperson told the ABC. Those last two words — ""remain orderly"" — are crucial. We know the army of investors is angry, we also know they're keen to hurt hedge funds and the big banks. We know their strategy, so far, has proven effective, at least against some funds. We also know that the brokers that facilitate their actions, and the regulators 'umpiring' the market, could act against their interests at a moment's notice. But there's a bigger risk. We've all assumed so far the ""squeeze"" hedge funds have faced in recent weeks has been the only pain they've endured, or the only time they've been caught wrong-footed. Not true. The CEO of Wincrest Capital, Barbara Ann Bernard, recently explained on a CNBC panel that hedge funds have been investing in a ""dumb"" way. What are hedge funds, and how did they (accidentally) send GameStop's stock flying 'to the moon'? She explained that the cost of borrowing stocks (think of that as the ''interest rate"") for many hedge funds has been 120 per cent. Meanwhile, the maximum return you can make from a short sale is, by definition, 100 per cent. In other words, she argues, there appear to be hedge fund investment managers making some basic mistakes, and those mistakes have been amplified when the stock itself they hope will fall starts to rise. The brokers, too, have been caught out. One of the major brokers facilitating the buy side for Reddit investors, Robinhood, also revealed last week it had to scramble to raise roughly $1 billion in order ""to comply with our financial requirements and our clearinghouse deposits,"" CEO Vladimir Tenev told Bloomberg. The Financial Times reported it raised another $US2.4 billion in a second capital infusion in recent days. A question that's come up again and again during this whole saga is where or how will this end? The answer is that social media trading could just become another investment force that hedge funds and banks need to watch closely. But another possibility is that, if the Reddit rebellion keeps attacking and successfully damaging the balance sheets of major banks and hedge funds, a large financial institution may go broke. Professional investor Danielle Ecuyer warns of a possible 'black swan' event. She says few knew that Lehman Brothers was holding billions of dollars in worthless assets (collateralised debt obligations linked to failed mortgages) towards the end of 2008. Similarly, she says, ""we have no idea"" which hedge funds and banks are overleveraged — lured into wracking up vast amounts of debt with record low interest rates — and are now coming under enormous financial pressure as they liquidate assets in order to cover their short positions. She tells the ABC that online trading platform Robinhood needing to raise capital in order to continue basic operations shows ""when it's this unbridled, it's likely to end in tears."" She says after decades investing in financial markets, she's learned to expect the unexpected. ""I've learnt that anything can happen. It's a risk."" She warns that it only takes one hedge fund to announce it cannot fulfill its obligations to potentially trigger a crisis of confidence in financial markets and a credit freeze. ""A hedge fund may already be in distress. We just don't know,"" she warned. Legislators and regulators are on edge. The US House of Representatives Financial Services Committee will hold a hearing on recent market volatility involving GameStop Corp and other stocks on February 18, the committee said in a statement on Monday. While the Reddit rebellion wants to cause disruption, they risk creating chaos, and that could hurt all the players in this risky game of financial chicken.

245,Reserve Bank to pump extra $100b into economy; ASX jumps as Robinhood forced to raise more cash,markets,"  Reserve Bank to pump extra $100b into economy; ASX jumps as Robinhood forced to raise more cash The Reserve Bank has kept its cash rate target on hold at a record low of 0.1 per cent, as expected, but it also pledged to pump more cash into the economy. The RBA decided to extend its so-called ""money printing"" (or quantitative easing) program by purchasing an additional $100 billion worth of bonds, issued by the Australian Government and states and territories. It will make these purchases at a rate of $5 billion per week from mid-April, when its current bond purchase program expires. Back in November, when it last cut interest rates, the RBA pledged to buy $100 billion in long-term government bonds over six-month period in an attempt to boost inflation. In total, the RBA has committed to purchasing $200 billion worth of government bonds. Australia's central bank also kept its three-year rate target near zero, a rate which will apply to the RBA's term funding facility. By 4:20pm AEDT, the Australian dollar slipped to 76.2 US cents (down from 76.6 US cents). Meanwhile, the local share closed sharply higher, as retail investors expanded their social media-fuelled battle with Wall Street to drive silver prices to an eight-year high. The ASX 200 recorded its strongest day in four weeks. The benchmark index jumped by 100 points (or 1.5 per cent) to close at 6,763. The broader All Ordinaries index lifted by 105 points (+1.5pc) to 7,028 points, as it recovered to where it was last Thursday. Overall, the RBA was cautiously optimistic about Australia's economic recovery from COVID-19. ""The outlook for the global economy has improved over recent months due to the development of vaccines,"" RBA governor Philip Lowe said his post-meeting statement. ""While the path ahead is likely to remain bumpy and uneven, there are better prospects for a sustained recovery than there were a few months ago."" Some of Australia's leading labour market analysts warn wages stagnation is undermining financial stability and social cohesion and there is no improvement in sight. However, he qualified that by saying it depends on ""the health situation and on significant fiscal and monetary support"" from the Government and RBA. The economy was benefitting from lower unemployment (down to 6.6 per cent) and strong retail spending. Dr Lowe expects the economy to return to pre-pandemic levels by the middle of this year, and for GDP to grow by 3.5 per (both this year, and in 2022). However, the governor warned that inflation was growing at its ""slowest rate on record"", and the jobless rate would remain higher than it had been for the past two decades — and would fall to 6 per cent by December, and 5.5 per cent by the end of next year. He emphasised the RBA would not raise Australia's benchmark interest rate until 2024 ""at the earliest"". ""If the economy continues to surprise on the upside like it has been lately, helped along by vaccines in the second half, then there is a good chance that the first rate hike will be in 2023 or maybe even late 2022,"" said AMP Capital's chief economist Shane Oliver. ""But that is still a long way off and so mortgage rates will remain low for now. ""One factor which could cause the RBA to reconsider is if the property market continues to hot up  - as it has been doing lately with strong house price gains and record monthly housing finance commitments."" Many economists had expected the RBA to announce a ramp-up of its bond-buying program, but not so early into the new year. ""Whilst speculation has been growing amongst economists that the RBA may soon begin to tinker with its policy settings, it is far too soon to be thinking about tightening any form of monetary policy,"" said Anthony Doyle, cross-asset investment specialist at Fidelity International. ""It isn't clear how much long-term damage has been done to the hospitality and tourism sectors, and as the Federal Government's fiscal measures such as the JobKeeper scheme begin to roll off, household incomes will begin to come under pressure."" The RBA governor will give a speech called ""The Year Ahead"" in Canberra on Wednesday, at the National Press Club. It will the first opportunity this week for Dr Lowe to be pressed for further details about his economic forecasts. The central bank chief will also be giving his testimony to the House of Representatives Economics Committee on Friday. On that same day, the RBA will publish its the quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy, which will include its latest forecasts. On the Australian market, 15 out of every 20 stocks traded higher, with Afterpay (+7.9pc), Tabcorp (+8.8pc), Nine Entertainment (+7.3pc) and Webjet (+7.5pc) among the best performers. Debt collection firm Credit Corp was the best performer on the benchmark index, up 8.8 per cent to $32.06. This was after the company said its first-half net profit grew (+10pc) to $42.3 million, compared to the same time last year, and it declared an interim dividend of 36 cents per share. Banks and miners provided the biggest boost to the market, including Commonwealth Bank (+2.3pc), NAB (+1.8cp), BHP (+2.2pc), Rio Tinto 3.4pc) and BHP (2pc). On the flip side, Unibail Rodamco Westfield (-7.1pc), Blackmores (-3.8pc), Worley (-1.8pc), Domino's Pizza (-1.6pc) and A2 Milk (-3.2pc) suffered heavy losses. Temple & Webster shares dropped (-4.6pc) to $10.53. This was after the online furniture retailer announced its first-half revenue jumped (+118pc) to $161.6 million. Robinhood has tapped $US2.4 billion in funding on top of the $US1 billion it raised last week after the online brokerage's finances were strained due to a retail trading frenzy in heavily shorted shares of companies such as GameStop. Wondering why a struggling video game chain is grabbing global financial headlines, and what Reddit and Robinhood have to do with it? It has something to do with shorts, as Paul Donoughue and David Chau explain. The latest round of fund injection meant Robinhood has raised more capital in a week than at any point since its inception in 2013, giving it enough financial muscle to meet any funding needs stemming from the trading boom. The funding round was led by Ribbit Capital and included existing investors ICONIQ, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Index Ventures and New Enterprise Associates. The fundraising comes at a time when Robinhood, which has become hugely popular with young investors for its easy-to use interface, is planning a high-profile initial public offering, although it is unclear whether it will push ahead with the plan due to recent developments. The online brokerage was at the heart of a mania that gripped retail investors last week following calls by Reddit thread WallStreetBets to trade certain stocks that were being heavily shorted by hedge funds. The trading frenzy in those shorted stocks raised deposit limits at its clearinghouse, with Robinhood's deposit requirements tied to equities rising tenfold. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said on Sunday that the trading app was forced to place curbs on some transactions because the clearinghouse had asked for $US3 billion in collateral. Those increased deposit limits forced Robinhood to seek emergency funding and also prompted the brokerage to curb the purchase of a handful of hot stocks including GameStop and AMC Entertainment, which drew the ire of customers, celebrities and politicians. Clearinghouses ensure the completion of a stock trade even if one side of the deal goes bust. Robinhood said that it would used the funds to invest in ""record customer growth"". ""This round of funding will help us scale to meet the incredible growth we've seen and demand for our platform,"" chief financial officer Jason Warnick said. The price of spot silver jumped (+6.9pc) to $US28.86 an ounce. Overnight, it climbed above $US30 an ounce (an eight-year high) before pulling back slightly. ""This social media speculation is at the early stage for silver and there is uncertainty about how much more momentum we can have,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA. Since Thursday, the ""poor man's gold"" has surged by around 20 per cent, after posts on sites like Reddit, YouTube and Twitter led small investors to buy silver mining stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETF) backed by physical silver bars. ""Silver Bullion Market is one of the most manipulated on earth. Any short squeeze in silver paper shorts would be EPIC. We know billion banks are manipulating gold and silver to cover real inflation,"" one Reddit user posted. What are hedge funds, and how did they (accidentally) send GameStop's stock flying 'to the moon'? Another user echoed similar sentiments, by saying: ""Not billions, but TRILLIONS in potential losses. Not just hedge funds, but the worlds largest commercial banks will become insolvent. This is how you seriously change the world."" However, those calls were far from unanimous across the Reddit community. Many are claiming this might be a plot staged by big companies who own a lot of silver, attracting heated comments like: Regardless of the motives at play across this fractured landscape, silver is a hot topic in social media forums, and its value has shot up considerably. Silver-mining stocks advanced globally, with Fresnillo shares soaring 14 per cent in London trading. A shift in the retail trading frenzy to silver drove up mining stocks on both sides of the Atlantic, with a 6.5 per cent jump in the iShares Silver Trust ETF, putting it on track for its best day since 2013. On Wall Street, the social media trading frenzy drove huge gains in companies such as GameStop Corp last week, forcing hedge funds to cover their short positions. Wall Street's main indices posted their biggest weekly falls since October. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed (+2.6pc) higher at 13,403 points on Tuesday (local time). Is all that Reddit lingo about GameStop making your head spin? Here's your shortcut guide. The Dow Jones rose (+0.8pc) to 30,212, and the S&P 500 went up (+1.6pc) to 3,774. GameStop fell sharply (-30.8pc) to $US225, but is still much higher than where it started the year at just $US17.25. Shorting shares of GameStop cost hedge funds a total $US12.5 billion over January, data from financial analytics firm Ortex showed on Monday. The number of GameStop shares shorted fell by over half in a week as these short-sellers covered their bets, S3 Partners said. Melvin Capital, which bet against GameStop, lost 53 per cent of its value in January. While the global coronavirus vaccine rollout remains slow, with concern about whether they will work on new COVID strains, Europe was also bolstered by news it would receive a further 9 million doses from AstraZeneca in the first quarter. Britain's FTSE finished (+0.9pc) higher at 6,466 points, while Germany's DAX lifted (+1.4pc) to 13,622. Oil prices rose, buoyed by shrinking inventories and hopes of a swifter global economic recovery, although halting vaccine rollouts and renewed travel restrictions capped gains. Brent crude futures rose sharply (+1pc) to $US56.90 a barrel. Spot gold slipped (-0.2pc) to $US1,855.71 an ounce.

246,"GameStop traders pour into silver, sending price to highest level since 2013",markets,"  GameStop traders pour into silver, sending price to highest level since 2013 The price of silver surged above $US30 an ounce for the first time since 2013, as an army of retail traders have stormed into the metal after betting billions of dollars on stocks last week. Organised in online forums and traded with fee-free brokers such as Robinhood, small-time investors have driven a 1,600 per cent rally in the shares of video game retailer GameStop, scooping up assets big fund managers had bet against. The phenomenon spilled over into silver late last week. It peaked at $US30.03 an ounce, having surged by more than 11 per cent overnight — its biggest one-day rise since 2008, taking gains to about 19 per cent since last Wednesday. By 8:35am AEDT, its gains had moderated. But its spot price still enjoyed a big gain (+7.5pc) at $US29.04 an ounce. The jump set off a rally in silver-mining stocks from Sydney to London, with Fresnillo shares soaring 20.5 per cent to top the UK blue-chip FTSE 100 index. The action in silver, following thousands of Reddit posts and hundreds of YouTube videos, suggests a rise in the physical price could hurt large investors with bearish bets, while also marking a foray into a much bigger and more liquid markets than individual stocks. Wondering why a struggling video game chain is grabbing global financial headlines, and what Reddit and Robinhood have to do with it? It has something to do with shorts, as Paul Donoughue and David Chau explain. ""I would look at the silver rally the same way as I would the GameStop saga — from the point of view of market stability, for now it's not an immediate concern, but if we see sharp moves we could see some deleveraging in markets,"" Antoine Bouvet, a rates strategist at ING, said. ""This reducing of risk through deleveraging could potentially boost demand for bonds if it is causing excess volatility."" In the first signs of deleveraging, Goldman Sachs said the amount of position-covering last week by US hedge funds buying and selling was the highest since the financial crisis more than a decade ago. Nevertheless, their market exposure to stocks remained near record levels, the investment bank warned. The rush to silver and GameStop-like stocks has been testing limitations in newer trading platforms and processing venues, frustrating retail traders who are unable to feed their hunger to buy and sell more frequently. Is all that Reddit lingo about GameStop making your head spin? Here's your shortcut guide. The feverish silver buying has hit a glitch, with large US broker Apmex warning of processing delays while it secures more bullion. The Money Metals exchange suspended trade until mid-morning on Monday. Trading volumes in small miners' stocks in Australia were unprecedented and jumps in some exploration firms, which do not actually produce silver, topped 90 per cent. Similar hiccups were seen in equities last week. GameStop, AMC and a few other volatile stocks saw temporary buying restrictions in trading apps like Robinhood as frenzied buying led to trading apps putting on curbs. ""The Reddit crowd has turned its sights on a bigger whale in terms of trying to catalyse something of a short squeeze in the silver market,"" Kyle Rodda, an analyst at brokerage IG Markets in Melbourne, said. ""This is their big, bold Moby Dick moment. The popularity of dabbling in stock markets has grown during the COVID-19 pandemic as volatility, stimulus cheques and lockdowns have driven account openings and investment. The craze hit fever pitch last week when the GameStop pile-on resulted in a ""short squeeze"", turning price gains stratospheric as hedge funds with bets against the stock desperately bought it at high prices to close their positions. Now it is silver's turn and once again the scale of buying is catching the professionals by surprise. What are hedge funds, and how did they (accidentally) send GameStop's stock flying 'to the moon'? Online discussions turned to silver late last week as Reddit posts suggested higher prices could hurt banks with large short positions, and that buying easy-to-access exchange-traded silver funds could quickly ramp up the metal's value. Retail traders poured a record $US30.6 million ($40 million) into Australian ETF Securities' Physical Silver fund by the afternoon. A silver ETF in Japan surged 11 per cent. All eyes are on possible gains later in the day in iShares' US-listed, $US16.5 billion Silver Trust ETF which rose 5.6 per cent last week. ""We see little chances of any tightening of the silver market,"" Eugen Weinberg from Commerzbank said. ""After all, the market is not only large and difficult to manipulate; unlike with shares, there is no excessive short selling with silver."" Global short interest in silver, or the cumulative value of bets it falls in price, is equivalent to about 900 million ounces — just short of global annual production. Banks and brokers hold most of that — about 610 million ounces — but it is not clear whether they are net short on the metal or whether their bets offset very big physical holdings. ""Allegations that some market participants artificially keep silver prices low have been around for years, but are somewhat hard to square,"" BofA's precious metals analyst, Michael Jalonen, said. He said he was ""bullish [on] silver for a while"" based on new applications including solar panels, and he expected it to rally above $US31 an ounce. Several of the renegade traders are millionaires on paper and their hedge fund adversaries are nursing their wounds. Melvin Capital, which bet against GameStop, lost 53 per cent in January. Robinhood, the main broker used by traders from online forums, has also backed down and lifted some of the buying restrictions it imposed last week, although limits remain on eight companies including GameStop, AMC Entertainment and BlackBerry. However, with regulators circling both Robinhood and Reddit forums, the battle is far from over. ""I'll tell you one thing, I absolutely guarantee this ends in tears. I just don't know when,"" CMC's Michael McCarthy said.

248,"Reddit traders take a shine to silver, ASX recovers",markets,"  ASX recovers from early tumble as Reddit WallStreetBets traders drive silver surge Silver prices have surged as Reddit traders take a shine to the precious metal, while the local share market has pushed higher, reversing an early tumble. The ASX 200 closed 0.8 per cent, or 55 points, higher at 6,663 points. The major bank and mining stocks rose strongly, including Fortescue (+2.2pc), BHP (+1.3pc), South 32 (+3.9pc) and ANZ (+1.5pc). Energy stocks recovered after earlier being the major drag on the market, but shares in Worley remained deep in the red (-10.9pc), after it warned that COVID-19 had hit its earnings. Retail stocks also slumped, with shares in online retailer Kogan closing down by 3.8 per cent, adding to Friday's 8.5 per cent fall. Kogan reported strong sales growth over the Black Friday and Christmas sales periods but admitted to having to tackle ""significant challenges caused by extreme growth"". JB Hi-Fi (-2pc), Super Retail (-3.3pc) and Mosaic (-1.9pc) also ended lower. At 5:05pm (AEDT), the Australian dollar was buying around 76.56 US cents. Silver prices surged to hit a five-month high amid the spread of a buying frenzy that has seen shares in US gaming retailer GameStop soar 1,500 per cent in two weeks. Spot silver rose as much as 6.4 per cent to $US28.72 an ounce, the highest since early September. Wondering why a struggling video game chain is grabbing global financial headlines, and what Reddit and Robinhood have to do with it? It has something to do with shorts, as Paul Donoughue and David Chau explain. Silver prices are up by around 15 per cent since the middle of last week, which was when messages began circulating on forums such as Reddit encouraging users to buy the metal and drive up prices. Investors also piled into silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs), some of which are backed by physical silver. On the WallStreetBets Reddit forum, users discussed buying shares in ETFs in order to force the funds to buy more silver, therefore driving up the price and hurting banks that were betting the price of the metal would fall. ""The Reddit crowd has turned its sights on a bigger whale in terms of trying to catalyse something of a short squeeze in the silver market,"" IG analyst Kyle Rodda told Reuters. ""The most important factor here is that silver is heavily shorted, the paper market is much, much larger than the underlying commodity can justify."" Australian silver mining stocks surged, including Adriatic Metals, Argent Minerals, Boab Metals and Investigator Resources. There were similar moves around the region, with a silver ETF listed on the Tokyo stock exchange gaining more than 10 per cent, while Chinese-listed silver miners also rallied. Meantime, shares in Australian nickel and cobalt explorer GME Resources continued on a tear, after being swept up in the GameStop volatility. The stock, which has the same code as GameStop, rose by 22.1 per cent, after rising around 80 per cent in three days last week. On Friday, global stock markets closed deep in the red, with the Dow Jones and Nasdaq dropping 2 per cent on Wall Street. In economic news, ANZ's monthly job advertisements survey rose for the eighth month in a row. The number of job ads rose by 2.3 per cent in January, a slightly slower pace than in the previous month, but that was little cause for concern, according to ANZ. ""[The job ads survey] is heading in the right direction and is now 5.3 per cent higher than its pre-pandemic level,"" economists Catherine Birch and Bansi Madhavani wrote. ""Overall, the indicators suggest solid employment gains should continue into [the first half of this year] and hopefully alleviate the effect of the end of JobKeeper in March, although it will be harder if that support is not replaced by more targeted assistance."" On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank board will meet for the first time this year, and the ANZ economists expect the central bank to retain its current accommodative settings, and that an extension to quantitative easing could be announced as early as tomorrow.

249,analysis: The Reddit army is doomed,markets,"  The Reddit army has beaten the establishment but reality can only be suspended for so long It's the revolution that has rattled the investment establishment. During the past few weeks, several Wall Street titans, along with some big-name European firms, have found themselves under siege by an international army of loosely coordinated and newly enriched retail traders. Small investors, many of them first timers, have flocked to financial markets in their millions since the pandemic swept the Western world early last year. They not only have the numbers. They also have the wherewithal, as many have become incredibly wealthy in a market turbocharged by central bank money printing. And they've discovered that, when acting in unison, they have the weight of money on their side, which delivers incredible power — at least in the short term. What they lack is logic. Spurred on by a ""stick it to the man"" attitude and sense of invincibility driven by almost a year of continuous wins, they've managed over January to call the bluff of some of the world's most powerful hedge funds. The power play has centred around a handful of dangerously speculative stocks, epitomised by a struggling bricks and mortar video game retailer called GameStop. Despite poor results and a bleak future, given you can buy video games online these days, its share price has soared into the stratosphere, up 1,600 per cent in the past three weeks. That's left a bunch of powerful hedge funds, betting these stocks would fall, reeling. They've incurred multi-billion-dollar losses across their portfolios. In a market inflated by trillions of dollars in global stimulus, last week's events have been portrayed as a morality tale, a David versus Goliath battle that has the establishment on the ropes. So far, the Reddit army — trading on free apps such as Robinhood and with 3.5 million communicating via the subreddit r/wallstreetbets — has beaten the big guys at their own game. But is this a permanent shift? And if not, how long can this struggle continue? Ultimately, the Reddit army is doomed. Reality can only be suspended for so long. But they are likely to continue creating havoc for as long as the stimulus merry-go-round continues, threatening the cosy cabal of bankers and financiers who escaped the 2008 financial crisis not just intact, but enriched. With the casinos shut and sports on hold, what was an average punter with plenty of COVID-inspired downtime to do? Why, check out the biggest roulette game in town, of course, and dabble in a little stock trading. As millions of bored and housebound Americans, and quite a few Australians too, have discovered, the odds are so much better when it comes to stocks than anything you can pick up at the track or the tables. Despite the worst recession in almost a century, financial markets have barely stopped for breath since March last year, with Wall Street continually scaling new heights. And it's all thanks to 0 per cent interest rates and the greatest expansion in money supply in history. Place a bet. Everyone's a winner. Wall Street has surged almost 70 per cent from its low point on March 23 last year while ASX has jumped 45 per cent. Technology stocks, among others, have gone nuts. Elon Musk has become the world's richest man, courtesy of a 900 per cent rise in the stock price of Tesla, his electric car company. Despite only recently clocking up a modest profit, the company is valued at an insane $US880 billion ($1,152 billion); more than the combined worth of almost every other automaker on the planet. He's not the only one. Wondering why a struggling video game chain is grabbing global financial headlines, and what Reddit and Robinhood have to do with it? It has something to do with shorts, as Paul Donoughue and David Chau explain. The trend has enriched and emboldened the gamers and gamblers who switched to stocks, spurred on by new trading platforms that have made it easy to access the world's biggest capital markets. For most of last year, they were known as the Robinhood investors, after the free trading app many use. The more they made, the more they pumped back in. Grizzled and grey-haired professionals, many of whom were cautious and openly concerned about the strength of the gains, held back. 2020 may have been the year of the pandemic. It was also the year when small, private and mostly inexperienced investors beat the professionals. In the first month of 2021 though, they've beaten them senseless. Hedge funds may have become the new global pariah. Most of us, however, have money riding with them through our super funds. Hedge fund is a loose term but here's an example of how they operate. What are hedge funds, and how did they (accidentally) send GameStop's stock flying 'to the moon'? Just as you hedge your bets at the track, by taking a win and a place or splitting between the favourite and a rank outsider, hedge funds attempt to perform well whether financial markets are going up or down. During the past year, with the world shifting in droves to online, they would have ploughed money into online retailers and technology stocks. That's what's called ""going long"". At the other end of the spectrum, they would have sought out companies like shopping centre owners and bricks and mortar retailers and engaged in a trade that would deliver profits if markets fell or if there was a renewed spike in the pandemic. They would have ""gone short"". Here's how it works. Essentially, you sell before you buy, and like any trade, you hope to sell at a higher price than your purchase price. It's just the timing is reversed. To do so, they have to borrow or rent the shares from someone, usually a big insurance company or investment fund. That makes it a risky trade. Because unlike a purchase, you can't just sit on your investment indefinitely. You have to hand those rented shares back. While many find short selling abhorrent because they target the weak and vulnerable, it tends to keep the sales zealots and those spruiking duds in check. What has happened with GameStop is that the big hedge funds that have sold it down have been caught out by the sudden surge in its share price. A Reddit trader known as DeepF***ingValue started the ball rolling, deciding to take on the titans. Ignoring the fact that GameStop's value is so deep no snorkel will ever deliver it enough oxygen, his foray attracted support. As his gains accelerated, more traders joined the frenzy and the hedge funds began lurching deep into the red. Is all that Reddit lingo about GameStop making your head spin? Here's your shortcut guide. The only way they could limit those losses — reverse the trade — was to buy the stock back on the market. And because they required huge volumes, they've caused prices to soar. The gains have accelerated, delivering fabulous riches to the punters as the hedge funds have haemorrhaged. US fund Melvin Capital needed a $US3 billion bailout last week, Maplelane Capital has shed 33 per cent, and Point72 has lost around $US3 billion on the trade. The developments have jolted hedge funds globally. No-one wants to be caught short. Hedge funds are unwinding their short positions like crazy. Last Thursday, Unibail Rodamco, the European company that owns the Westfield shopping centres, surged 15 per cent as hedge funds which had shorted the stock scrambled for shares on market to close out their position. It's a cracker of a story, with all the hallmarks of a Hollywood blockbuster. But it's also just one more unexpected factor that could destabilise an already brittle global economy.

250,Even Karl Marx used his stimulus payment to bet against professional traders,markets,"  Even Karl Marx used his stimulus payment to bet against professional traders In 1864, Karl Marx received an £820 bequest from an old friend who had died. A huge stimulus payment, essentially. It was far more money than he'd ever earned from his journalism, and he wasted no time spending it. His wife, Jenny, had their new home in London redecorated and furnished. ""I thought it better to put the money to this use rather than to fritter it away piecemeal on trifles."" They bought pets for their children (three dogs, two cats, and some birds), which they named after Karl's favourite alcoholic drinks (Whisky, Toddy, etc). They took the family on a three-week holiday to Ramsgate, Kent, one of 19th century England's most famous seaside towns, where Karl spent much of the time sulking in bed in their guest house, in pain, after a malignant carbuncle erupted above his penis. Back in London, they blew more of the money on a large party for their daughters, where 50 of the girls' friends were entertained until the early hours of the morning. And deliciously — especially for anyone who's been engrossed by the GameStop saga this month — Karl used some of his stimmy cheques to speculate on the stock market, relishing the chance to inflict pain on professional traders. In a letter to his maternal uncle, Lion Phillips, a wealthy Dutch businessman, he even bragged about his winnings. ""I have, which will surprise you not a little, been speculating — partly in American funds, but more especially in English stocks, which are springing up like mushrooms this year … [and which] are forced up to quite an unreasonable level and then, for the most part, collapse,"" he wrote. ""In this way, I have made over £400 and, now that the complexity of the political situation affords greater scope, I shall begin all over again. ""It's a type of operation that makes small demands on one's time, and it's worthwhile running some risk in order to relieve the enemy of his money."" In a letter to Friedrich Engels, his great friend and benefactor, Marx even dreamed of the fortune he could have made if he'd had more money to buy stonks. ""Had I had the money during the past 10 days, I'd have made a killing on the Stock Exchange here,"" he wrote. ""The time has come again when, with wit and very little money, it's possible to make money in London."" The above story is recounted wonderfully by Francis Wheen, the British journalist, in his 1999 award-winning biography of Marx. According to Wheen, historians have struggled to find hard evidence for Marx's stock trades, and some suspect he may have invented the story ""to impress his businesslike uncle"". ""But it may be true,"" Wheen also says, enticingly. Tristram Hunt, in his 2009 biography, The Frock-Coated Communist: The Revolutionary Life of Friedrich Engels, details how Engels played the stock market, too. Engels figured it was perfectly acceptable to jump into shares because ""the stock exchange simply adjusts the distribution of surplus value already stolen from the workers"". In other words, go ahead lad, you'll simply be taking some money back from the 1 per cent. Although, as usual with Engels, things were a bit more complicated than that, given he was a member of the wealthy manufacturing class himself, and he did far more than dabble in the stock market. According to Hunt, Engels' probate at death revealed a stock portfolio worth more than £2 million in today's money. He had shares in everything from the London and Northern Railway Company, to the South Metropolitan Gas Company, the Channel Tunnel Corporation Ltd, and even some imperial investments, including in the Foreign and Colonial Government Trust Company. It meant Engels' experience of the stock market, and the type of behaviour that goes on there, was not rudimentary. In an exchange of letters (in early 1883) with Eduard Bernstein, a German socialist and politician, Engels agreed with Bernstein that a recent public outcry against a ""stock exchange tax"" was a ""petty-bourgeois"" concern. Nevertheless, he said, he was against the tax too. He said a stock exchange tax already existed in England, where he lived, in the form of a simple, everyday stamp on the transfer document (at the time, 0.5 per cent of the amount paid, plus a small transfer fee), and the consequence was ""that the real speculation on the stock exchange is in margin dealings where no actual transfer takes place"". ""Hence [the stock exchange tax] only affects the so-called 'solid capital investment',"" he said, because it diverts trading activity into unproductive side-bets that didn't face taxation. He figured any attempt to control traders' behaviour with taxes was fruitless. ""Nor has anything ever been devised that the stock market speculators cannot circumvent."" He told Bernstein the stock exchange should ""be allowed to deploy perfectly freely, so that even the most stupid can see where the present economy is taking them,"" and it was a shame the stock exchange fell victim to exploitative trading practices because, when used properly, it had obvious revolutionary potential. ""[It] vastly accelerates the concentration of capitals and is therefore as revolutionary as the steam engine,"" he said. ""Had the stock exchange in America not created colossal fortunes, how would large-scale industry and a social movement have been possible in that land of farmers?"" It's humorous food for thought. Jump forward to the recent shenanigans on Wall Street, where individuals who use the website Reddit have, in past months, been purchasing as many GameStop stocks as humanly possible (using their stimulus cheques from the US government) and sending GameStop's stock price soaring, causing some hedge funds, who had placed bets that GameStop's price would only fall, to lose billions of dollars as a consequence. Many of the Redditors have been using a trading app called Robinhood, which allows them to trade for free — essentially, with no stock exchange tax. (Although, as the US regulator found, Robinhood's execution of its customers' trades has been so poor behind the scenes, in recent years, that the financial costs for its customers have outweighed the benefits of commission-free trading). The founders of the app, former physics students Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, say they created the app ""to democratise finance,"" having been inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement that emerged from the wreckage of the 2007-08 global financial crisis. Now, there are calls for ""free"" trading apps to be better regulated. Aside from last week's mayhem on Wall Street, it will be a week for central bank watchers this week. We'll see the resumption of normal duties for the Reserve Bank of Australia. The RBA board will hold its first monthly interest rate meeting for the year on Tuesday. Philip Lowe, the RBA governor, will be speaking in Canberra on Wednesday, at the National Press Club. The theme of his speech will be ""The Year Ahead"", which seems self-explanatory. On Friday, he will then appear before a parliamentary committee in Canberra, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, at 9:30am. The RBA will also release its quarterly ""Statement on Monetary Policy"" on Friday, at 11:30am.

251,"What are hedge funds, and how did they (accidentally) cause GameStop's massive surge?",markets,"  What are hedge funds, and how did they (accidentally) send GameStop's stock flying 'to the moon'? An unusual battle has been playing out between anti-establishment Reddit nerds and Wall Street's corporate titans over the past week. Caught in the middle is a struggling video game chain called GameStop, which you wouldn't suspect to be in any trouble if all you looked at was its share price. It surged from about $US19 to $US483 (at its peak) in just three weeks — a gain of more than 2,400 per cent. Not bad for an old-fashioned retailer (which has been dubbed the ""Blockbuster Video"" of the gaming industry) as consumers are increasingly abandoning physical stores, and downloading their games online. Despite its doomed business model, users of a Reddit group called ""WallStreetBets"" (which has over 5.7 million members) have been frenetically buying GameStop shares like there was no tomorrow, driving its price ""to the moon"". Meanwhile, Wall Street's multi-billion dollar hedge funds were betting against the company, hoping to make a quick buck. They've been trying to talk down the company to sink its shares and buy them at bargain basement prices. It's a process called ""shorting"" (which we'll explain shortly). As the share price climbs higher, the GameStop investors on Reddit are getting richer — while the ""short-selling"" hedge funds are bleeding cash profusely. To give you an idea of how exuberant the ""investing"" has been — there are only 65 million shares on GameStop on the stock market. But at one stage (over a four-day period), its stock was bought and sold 650 million times. This means each share changed hands 10 times in four days. Eventually, the GameStop bubble will burst, and its share price will tumble. Unfortunately, the last ones to sell their GameStop shares (especially if they were bought at record high prices) will be the ""biggest losers"" from this experience. Judging from recent posts, many of these users were motivated by a desire to take revenge against ""greedy fat cats"" from America's multi-billion dollar hedge funds. One Reddit member (called ""aoechamp"") explained what they have against hedge fund managers, in this post: ""For all the recessions they caused. For all the jobs and homes people have lost. For all the people that can't pay for college because minimum wage has stagnated while Wall Street gets rich. For all the retail traders they left holding the bag. For all the times they got bailed out with our tax money while we got nothing."" The online warriors were particularly outraged by a Twitter post, from Citron on January 20 (when GameStop shares were trading around $US39). The US hedge fund tweeted: ""GameStop buyers at these levels are the suckers at this poker game"". It also said: ""We understand short interest better than you"" and that the shares would plunge ""back to $[US]20 fast"". How wrong it turned out to be. Citron's founder Andrew Left confirmed his fund had ""covered the majority of the [GameStop] short"" and made ""a loss of 100 per cent"", in a YouTube video posted on January 27. Melvin Capital, another hedge fund which bet against the gaming retailer, also suffered heavy losses. It had to get a $US2.75 billion bail out from two other hedge funds (Citadel and Point72 Asset Management). Essentially, it's a fancy word for an ""alternative"" investment partnership that has the freedom to invest aggressively in a broad range of financial products. They're actively managed, and more expensive to invest in, compared to other funds. Many of them use a ""2 and 20"" compensation structure. It means means hedge fund managers are paid a 2 per cent commission (of the assets they're managing), and 20 per cent of profits (above a certain benchmark) each year. Even if the fund manager does nothing (or worse, loses money on your investments), they'll still get paid their 2 per cent. Their goal is to maximise investor returns, but only ""sophisticated investors"" can join. To qualify, you typically need to own about $2.5 million worth of net assets, or earn $250,000 per year in gross income (for the past two financial years). So a hedge fund's clients tend to be rich people, or big institutional investors (like an insurance company or superannuation fund). The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) doesn't define the term ""hedge fund"" very strictly. Firstly, the fund needs to be ""promoted"" as ""being"" a hedge fund. It also needs to have two of the following characteristics: When you buy shares in a company, you're usually betting that it will become more profitable over time. So you're going ""long"" on the stock. Wondering why a struggling video game chain is grabbing global financial headlines, and what Reddit and Robinhood have to do with it? It has something to do with shorts, as Paul Donoughue and David Chau explain. But if you believe a company's shares will tank, you can place a bet on its declining fortunes. Basically, it involves you borrowing the shares at their current price and selling them to others (even though you don't own them). If your hunch is correct, and the share price falls, you can purchase them back from the market at a lower price. You would have made a profit in this situation. Then you can return the shares to the original lender, and pocket the windfall. If all goes well, that's how you make money as a ""short seller"" — a move most famously depicted in the The Big Short, the Adam McKay movie based on the Michael Lewis book. It's a very risky investment strategy, and a lot can go wrong. Let's say you shorted Afterpay for $50, and it announces a surprise profit (taking its share price to $500), then you're going to lose $450. If you make the wrong bet, there are ways to minimise your losses. If the company's share price suddenly surges, the ""short seller"" can buy those shares back at a slightly higher price. For example, you decide to short Westpac at $20. But its share price jumps to $25 soon afterwards. You might decide to wear the $5 loss, rather than risk an even bigger loss — especially if the bank's share price climbs even higher. This is precisely what happened to the Citron and Melvin hedge funds. They thought GameStop's share price would tank. Unfortunately for them, their bet failed spectacularly as the company's stock has surged more than 2,000 per cent. Basically, it's an investment strategy used to reduce the risk of your assets' value plunging. One way to achieve this is by using the ""long-short"" strategy. It's a mix of buying investments that are undervalued (or ones you think will rise in value), but also selling ""borrowed"" assets that (you think) are overvalued and will see their values fall. So you'd be trying to accentuate the positive (by maximising the price rises) and, as much as possible, eliminating the negative (by limiting the price falls). But the objective of hedge funds is to maximise returns — and the higher the risk, the higher the reward. Admittedly, taking on more risk, while trying to reduce it at the same time sounds somewhat paradoxical. Leverage is an investment strategy which uses debt (or borrowed money) to magnify the return on investment. For example, you invest in Tesla shares and they soar by 500 per cent. Obviously, you'll earn a bigger reward if you borrowed $10 million to buy those shares — as opposed to just purchasing Tesla stock with the $100 already saved in your bank account. Of course, leverage can work both ways. It can magnify the amount you earn, but it could also cause massive debts (if your bet goes the wrong way). At a basic level, a ""derivative"" is a contract you enter into to buy an asset (like shares, gold or oil) on a particular date in the future — at a set price. Let's say Brent crude oil is fetching $US60 per barrel right now. You could enter into a ""futures contract"" to buy it at $65 per barrel in the future (say, June). Is all that Reddit lingo about GameStop making your head spin? Here's your shortcut guide. But if you believe the price oil will double (to $US120) then, you might be very happy to pay $US65. If your hunch is correct (and oil prices actually double), then you can buy the oil at $U65, and quickly sell it for a $US55 profit. However, if the price of oil goes the other way and plunges (by half), your bet would have failed and (you'd be paying way too much). That's what happened in April last year. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns were imposed in many countries and international travel was halted worldwide. It led to a huge oversupply of oil, and the price of oil futures (for West Texas Intermediate crude to be delivered in May) plunged to minus $US37.63 a barrel. You heard right — negative. Less than zero. So you had to actually pay someone else to take that ""black gold"" off your hands. A lot of investors who bought oil futures didn't consider the fact they would actually have to physically take possession of those barrels — or sell the futures contract to someone else (except nobody wanted them).

253,"ASX swings to red as Wall St futures drop, Domino's returns JobKeeper payments",markets,"  ASX swings to red as Wall St futures point to further falls, Domino's returns JobKeeper payments The Australian share market gave up morning gains to finish in the red again, as US share futures point to renewed losses on Wall Street tonight. Australian shares had been rebounding from yesterday's heavy sell-off, which wiped $46 billion off the market and took it to a three-week low. Both the benchmark ASX 200 and broader All Ordinaries indices were up 1.2 per cent in early trade. However, the market reversed sharply in the afternoon, closing around 100 points off this morning's intraday peak. A major factor in the late swing lower was a decline in US share futures, with the S&P 500 contract down 1.3 per cent late in the Australian afternoon, pointing to renewed selling on Wall Street tonight. The benchmark ASX 200 index lost 0.6 per cent on yesterday's close to finish at 6,607, while the All Ords shed 0.7 per cent to 6,871 having briefly passed 7,000 points early in the session. The index falls came despite more than half the companies on the ASX 200 posting gains — with 106 in the black and 11 steady for the day. But it was the large blue-chip miners and banks that were sold off in the afternoon, leading the indices lower. Fortescue Metals dropped 4.1 per cent, with Rio Tinto losing 3 per cent and BHP Billiton 1.6 per cent. Falls in major energy producers, such as Woodside Petroleum (-2.7pc) and Whitehaven Coal (-3.9pc) also dragged on the broader market — energy was the worst-performing sector. All four major banks posted substantial declines, led by a 2.1 per cent drop for ANZ, while Westpac had the smallest fall of the group at 1.5 per cent. Network designer, engineer and operator Service Stream jumped 10.1 per cent, real estate advertiser Domain was up 8 per cent, medical information systems provider Pro Medicus climbed 4 per cent and some smaller miners, such as gold producers Evolution (+4pc) and Ramelius (+3.7pc), bucked the general downward trend in resources. Domino's will return JobKeeper payments it received last year, saying the need for the coronavirus wage scheme has passed. In a note to the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) on Friday, the fast-food giant confirmed it would return $792,000 to taxpayers by the end of the current financial year. Domino's franchises were eligible for JobKeeper during the pandemic when businesses were under strain from state-imposed lockdowns and travel restrictions. But Domino's had a strong year in 2020. Profit rose to $138.4 million across the chain, driven by revenue growth of 32.7 per cent to $1.9 billion as locked-down consumers sought home-delivered food. Domino's Group CEO and managing director Don Meij said the Federal Government's short-term assistance had served an important purpose — ""to keep employees connected to their employer where their work had stopped through no fault of their own"". ""We appreciate the availability and support of JobKeeper during a period of significant uncertainty,"" Mr Meij said. ""That period has passed, the assistance package has served its purpose, and we return it to Australian taxpayers with our thanks."" The company said no executive had received short term incentives for the financial year where JobKeeper had contributed to their division's performance. A small number of independently-owned Domino's franchisees have separately received JobKeeper support, the statement said. The company said the return of the JobKeeper payments will happen later this year. It follows a bounce back on US markets as it also tried to recover from yesterday's sharp losses, after fears eased around hedge funds selling off long positions to cover a ""short squeeze"". Shares in videogame retailer GameStop (-44.1pc) and cinema chain AMC Entertainment (-56.6pc) tumbled overnight. This was after trading platforms like Robinhood and Interactive Brokers restricted trading in stocks that soared this week in a social media-driven trading frenzy that shook stock markets. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones ended its day 300 points (+1pc) higher at 30,603. The S&P 500 rose (+1pc) to 3,787, while the Nasdaq Composite lifted (+0.5pc) to 13,337 points. European markets were mixed, with Britain's FTSE down (-0.6pc) to 6,526 and Germany's DAX up (+0.3pc) to 13,666. The Australian dollar fell to 76.5 US cents by 5:20pm AEDT. Tech heavyweights including Microsoft, Facebook, Netflix and Alphabet led the gains, a day after the US stock indices endured their worst session in three months. With the quarterly earnings season in full swing, market participants have now started to question whether companies including Apple, Facebook and Tesla can sustain their high valuations. ""Investors are digesting earnings that came out overnight and this morning, and taking a look at the fundamentals of what's going on in specific companies, as well as any outlook that can be provided to try to justify valuations,"" said Brian Vendig, managing executive at MJP Wealth Advisors in Westport, Connecticut. Apple reported holiday-quarter sales and profit that beat Wall Street expectations, however, shares of the iPhone maker fell 2.3 per cent. Facebook shares dropped (-2.2pc) despite the company soundly beating quarterly revenue estimates. Tesla's stock fell (-2.3pc) after the electric vehicle maker posted disappointing December-quarter results and failing to provide a clear target for 2021 vehicle deliveries. Meanwhile, the US economy grew at a 4 per cent annualised rate, in line with expectations, as the virus and lack of another spending package curtailed consumer spending. That was according to the December-quarter GDP figures from the US Commerce Department. A separate report showed 847,000 more Americans likely filed jobless claims last week, lower than what the market had expected (875,000). Concerns about slowing momentum in economic recovery due to rising coronavirus cases, heightened stock market valuations, and uneven distribution of vaccine rollouts have kept investors on edge about a pullback and increase in volatility in the near-term.

254,analysis: Are Elon Musk and Tesla the next bubble waiting to burst?,markets,"  Are Elon Musk and Tesla the next bubble waiting to burst? Elon Musk is now the world's richest person, edging out previous title holder Amazon's Jeff Bezos. His rocketing fortune is due to the booming share price of Tesla, the maker of electric vehicles and clean energy technologies. In the past week Tesla's share price surpassed $US880 — 10 times its March 2020 low of $US85 — giving the company a market capitalisation (or total value) in excess of $US880 billion — more than Toyota, Volkswagen, Daimler, General Motors, BMW, Honda, Hyundai and Ford combined. That's an extraordinary amount for a company that only last financial year made its first full-year profit since being founded in 2003; and that profit was relatively modest. It gave Tesla a price-to-earnings ratio — a standard measure of a stock's value — close to 1,700. Compare that to the other shares that have boomed since global stock markets rebounded from the COVID-induced lows of March 2020 — technology companies such as Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Amazon's PE ratio is about 97, Apple's about 44, and others in the 30-40 range. Telsa's latest quarterly profit is equally modest, missing analysts' expectations with reported earnings per share of just 80 cents. Its share price has dipped as a result, but still remains a very optimistic valuation. So can Tesla's valuation be justified, or is this one more example of a bubble waiting to burst? Well, Tesla is clearly an extraordinary innovator, but there are several reasons to think that, though irrational exuberance may drive its value even higher, sooner or later it's going to come crashing back down to earth. Tesla has benefited from its founder's vision. It has established a strong brand as the premiere producer of electric vehicles and renewable energy systems — two industries on the cusp of significant growth as the world moves away from fossil fuels. It has successfully developed a suite of electric cars where other car companies have failed. It has done this by capturing the imagination of investors and technology enthusiasts alike with technically impressive and aesthetically beautiful products. It has become a major manufacturer of solar photovoltaic systems. Connected to both these markets are its developments in batteries to power vehicles, homes and entire communities. In South Australia it built the world's largest lithium-ion battery, storing renewable energy from nearby wind turbines when generation exceeds demand and balancing out the grid when demand exceeds variable supply. These industries will accrue a greater share of vehicle and energy markets over time, and Tesla will be a major player in both. However, Tesla faces serious challenges. The major car makers, once wedded to their old internal combustion technologies, are embracing electric in response to what is, for them, an existential threat. Car makers from Korea to Japan to Germany — and of course China — are responding with new products to challenge Tesla's position. In strategic management, this response is called ""disruption"". The term is most closely associated with the American academic Clayton Christensen. In his influential 1997 book The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail, he describes the inexorable processes of how ""early movers"" are confronted with a new batch of entrants intent on securing their share of growing markets. Tesla's success is tantalising, something both established and start-up competitors will seek to emulate. Late movers may start with simpler, cheaper and by some measures inferior products. But over time they can learn what consumers want and are willing to pay for. They then challenge industry leaders for a share of the market, starting at the bottom but always moving upward. Indeed, Tesla itself has benefited from these very processes. As an early mover, Tesla is also laying the foundations for emulators' success. By establishing the impetus for infrastructure needed for the massive roll-out of electric vehicles, later movers will face fewer entry obstacles than Tesla and other early movers. These include creating charging stations that, once established, will drive a virtuous cycle of increased demand for electric vehicles and supply of stations. If things had gone differently a century ago, we'd probably all be driving electric cars already. But the differences between Tesla and its big-tech peers may be a source of serious challenge. Other tech companies benefit from what economists call network effects: the more ubiquitous a product, the more valuable it becomes to users. Social media platforms are an obvious example, but it also applies to companies such as eBay and Amazon: the more buyers and sellers on these platform, the greater their value to sellers and buyers — and therefore the greater the returns to the service provider. For Tesla, network benefits are harder to protect. More electric vehicles will create more demand for charging stations, and more charging stations will help vehicles sales. But it will be harder for Tesla to protect its stations from benefiting competitors. Perhaps for Tesla's visionary founder that's just fine. His plans extend far beyond making money — and Earth. But if you're an investor, it's something to be careful about. You might be able to ride the speculative rocket, so long as you time when you hop off. But if you're looking at Tesla as a long-term investment — as you should — there are no guarantees. John Rice is a professor of management at the University of New England.

257,"ASX rises to 11-month high, as Biden era begins and more Aussies get hired",markets,"  Australian shares rise to 11-month high, as Wall Street rallies on Joe Biden's inauguration as US President Australian shares have risen to their highest level in 11 months as Joe Biden's inauguration boosted global sentiment, while local data showed a faster-than-expected recovery for the nation's job market. The ASX 200 finished trading (+0.8pc) higher at 6,824 points. The broader All Ordinaries index went up by a similar margin to 7,107. The market traded around these levels back in February 2020, before the massive COVID-19 sell-off. Buy now, pay later company Zip Co was one of the best performers, after its shares surged (+23.1pc) to $7.36. That comes as the fintech announced its total customer numbers virtually doubled to 5.7 million (in the past year). Zip's quarterly revenue jumped to $102 million, having surged (+88pc) in the past 12 months. Most of its customer and transaction gains come from the US, where it recently entered the market by acquiring the platform Quadpay. Its rival Afterpay saw its share price rise (+5.7pc) to $149, close to its highest value ever. Mosaic Brands surged (+31.3pc) to $1.15 after it gave a strong trading update. The company, which owns retail brands like Katies and Noni B, said it sees first-half earnings (before interest an tax) to be around $40 million to $45 million. It said the result would ""materially exceeding market expectations"", being 22 to 38 per cent higher than it a year ago. Shares in WiseTech Global (+5.2pc), Domain Holdings (+4.3pc), Megaport (+4.4pc) and Seek (+3.8pc) also made strong gains. On the flip side, Super Retail Group (-4.6pc), Pro Medicus (-3.5pc), Elders (-3.2pc) and Whitehaven Coal (-2.7pc) were some of Thursday's worst performers. Cleanaway Waste Management was the worst performer, down 8.5 per cent to $2.38. It was after the company announced its chief executive Vik Bansal is standing down after almost six years in the job. In an ASX announcement, the company said the board and Mr Bansal had been ""discussing succession planning for some time"" and that it had now been decided he would leave in the first half of 2021. Mr Bansal said in the statement that ""now is the right time to hand the baton across to a new leader"". A memo sent to staff by Mr Bansal also said doing his job had come at the expense of his personal life. ""For the past five and a half years, I have spent every Sunday flying to Melbourne and being away from my daughter for most of the week, and it has taken its toll,"" he wrote. ""On honest reflection, I don't want to keep doing it for another three to five years."" Mr Bansal was accused of misconduct last year and the board said at the time to the ASX that his ""behaviour should have been better"" and that it had been working closely with him. A spokesperson for the company said Mr Bansal's resignation was not linked to those allegations. Cleanaway's share price is down 7.9 per cent. As of Wednesday evening, iron ore was 2.2 per cent down to $164.85. ANZ analysts said this was off the back of stronger supply than expected being announced by major Australian miners including BHP and Rio Tinto. ""Vessel-tracking data already shows a strong rise in Australian exports,"" ANZ's guidance note read. ""In the week to 15 January, shipments rose to 17 million tonnes, up from 16.2mt the prior week. ""The market is concerned about the small outbreak of coronavirus cases in China, which could impact steelmaking facilities (if) lockdown measures are implemented."" BHP is up 0.4 per cent on Thursday while Rio Tinto is 0.6 per cent higher. ABS data out this morning shows Australia's official unemployment rate fell to 6.6 per cent in December, with 50,000 people starting a new job that month. It was a slight decrease compared to November' s unemployment figure of 6.8 per cent. ANZ analysts said a reduction in the unemployment rate to this level is beyond what the Reserve Bank had originally been forecasting for late 2020. ""A stronger than expected labour force report, combined with high commodity prices, could see the AUD [go over] US 78 cents, which has been a strong resistance level lately,"" the said. The Australian dollar had risen (+0.4pc) to 77.74 US cents, largely because of a weaker US greenback. The improved job figures were within market expectations, so they were shrugged off by currency traders. US markets hit record highs in their afternoon trade as Joe Biden was inaugurated as the 46th US president. All three major indexes ended the session higher. As well as responding to the start of a potentially more stable political era, the markets are potentially hopeful about the new President passing a proposed $US1.9 trillion ($2.5 trillion) stimulus package. The Dow has gained about 57 per cent since Donald Trump assumed office on January 20, 2017, which compares with a 72 per cent jump in the first term of the Obama administration. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have hit all-time highs on Wednesday. Shares in the streaming service Netflix rose a staggering 16.9 per cent after the mega-tech announced strong results. The world's largest streaming service has been doing nicely off the pandemic, as people stay home to watch television. It said it would no longer need to borrow billions of dollars to finance its own TV shows and movies. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Google-parent Alphabet are also rising between 2 and 5 per cent in the lead-up to their week of results. Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble raised its full-year sales forecast for a second time. It has been benefiting from a rise in demand for cleaning products during the pandemic. Despite that, its shares dropped 1.4 per cent, after it warned that sales growth might slow as vaccines roll out. The major European stock markets also closed up in their Wednesday trade, with the German DAX the best performer by adding 0.8 per cent. Tech stocks rallied to a two-decade peak in Europe after Dutch chip equipment maker ASML rose 3 per cent to all-time highs on better-than-expected quarterly sales. Meanwhile, luxury brand group Richemont rose 2.8 per cent. It posted a 5 per cent increase in quarterly sales as Chinese shoppers splashed out on Cartier, its flagship jewellery brand. Britain's Burberry also jumped 3.9 per cent after it stuck to its full-year goals, saying higher full-price sales would boost annual margins, while Asian demand remained strong. Both the groups are reliant on sales to China's huge luxury market. Optimism about China's buying power was boosted last week after quarterly GDP results showed its economy is growing, despite the pandemic.

258,ASX rises as Wall Street rebounds on trillion-dollar stimulus bets,markets,"  Australian shares rise as Wall Street rebounds on trillion-dollar stimulus bets Australian shares have risen after Wall Street rebounded from a rough week on hopes the incoming Biden administration will pass its proposed $US1.9 trillion stimulus package. The benchmark ASX 200 index gained 0.4 per cent, or 27 points, to 6,770 points, while the All Ordinaries rose by half a per cent, to 7,051. By 4:25pm (AEDT), the Australian dollar had rise 0.4 per cent against the greenback, to 77.23 US cents. Some of the best performers were healthcare company PolyNovo (+7.3pc), along with Netwealth Group (+5.6pc), Afterpay (+5.2pc), Lynas Rare Earth (+4.9pc) and WiseTech Global (+4.8pc). On the flipside, the worst performers of the session were Megaport (-5.5pc), Whitehaven Coal (-4.6pc), Pro Medicus (-4.4pc), Mesoblast (-3.5pc) and Harvey Norman (-3.5pc). Commercial property and shopping centre owners Scentre Group (-1.7pc), Vicinity Centres (-1.3pc), Shopping Centres Australia (-2pc) and Charter Hall Retail REIT (-1.7pc) suffered losses, while shares in Stockland (+4pc) rose strongly. National house prices continue to withstand the otherwise devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but how long will this last asks Nassim Khadem. Spot gold went up (+0.5pc) to $US1,848.95 an ounce. Brent crude oil lifted (+0.7pc) to $US56.27 on optimism that government stimulus will buoy global economic growth and oil demand. US markets finished trading higher overnight, with the Dow Jones index up (+0.4pc) to 30,948 points. The S&P 500 rose (+0.8pc) to 3,799, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced (+1.5pc) to 13,197. Boeing shares lifted (+3.1pc) as Canada said it would lift a near two-year flight ban on its 737 MAX following two fatal crashes involving the model, while a final clearance from Europe to resume flying the jet is expected next week. European markets closed marginally lower, with Britain's FTSE down (-0.1pc) to 6,713, and Germany's DAX slipping (-0.2pc) to 13,815 points. US Treasury Secretary nominee (and former Federal Reserve chair) Janet Yellen had her confirmation hearing before the Senate's finance committee on Tuesday (local time). She argued that a lot more cash needs to be pumped into the US economy to ride out its pandemic-driven slump, and it outweigh the costs of a multi-trillion-dollar debt burden. Asked what outlays would provide the biggest ""bang for the buck,"" Dr Yellen said spending on public health and widespread vaccinations was the first step. Extended unemployment and SNAP benefits, better known as food stamps, should be next, she said. Targeting relief to people in the greatest need, and to small businesses, will create ""a great deal of spending per dollar spent, they'll create jobs throughout the economy"", she added. ""Neither the president-elect, nor I, propose this relief package without an appreciation for the country’s debt burden. ""But right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big."" ""Even though the amount of debt relative to the economy has gone up, the interest burden hasn't,"" Dr Yellen said, referring to the amount of money the federal government pays in interest on that debt.

259,"ASX jump, as global markets waver on COVID-19 recovery doubts",markets,"  Australian shares jump, as global markets waver on COVID-19 recovery doubts Australian shares have closed higher, following a subdued overnight session across overseas markets. The benchmark ASX 200 index was up 1.1 per cent to 6,742 points. The broader All Ordinaries advanced by a similar margin to 7,015. The Australian dollar rose (+0.4pc) to 77.1 US cents. US markets were closed for Martin Luther King Jr Day, but were last trading near record-high levels. Visit our US Politics page for all the latest news on Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Cryptocurrency bitcoin lifted (+3.5pc) to $US37,026, while spot gold rose (+0.1pc) to $US1,838.59 an ounce. Iron ore went up slightly (+0.2pc) to $US174.07 a tonne. Brent crude futures were up (+0.4pc) to $US55 a barrel. Eight out of every 10 stocks on the benchmark index were trading higher. National house prices continue to withstand the otherwise devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but how long will this last asks Nassim Khadem. Shares in Nufarm (+8.3pc), Domino's Pizza (+8pc), TabCorp (+4.8pc) and WiseTech Global (+5pc) saw strong gains. BHP shares rose (+0.9pc), despite facing an OECD investigation over environmental damage and human rights abuses at its coal mine in Colombia. Rio Tinto shares also went up (+0.7pc) after it reported a 2.4 per cent rise in December-quarter iron ore shipments, helped by industrial activity in its top consumer, China — which the company said had returned to pre-pandemic levels. Iron ore imports by the world's second-largest economy hit a record high in 2020 as it spent big on infrastructure to trigger an economic rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. Rio and its peers are banking on continued growth in China, and other countries looking to reignite their battered economies with big construction projects that may have been sidelined last year. Waste management company Bingo Industries was, by far, the best performer after its share price jumped (+20.4pc) to $3.30. Bingo said it received a takeover offer from a consortium led by private equity firm CPE Capital, which values the firm at $2.3 billion. Under the proposed deal, Bingo's shareholders will get $3.50 per share, which is 28 per cent higher than its closing share price on Monday. ""Proposal is being considered by an Independent Board Committee of Bingo, and discussions and due diligence with the Consortium have been ongoing,"" the recycling firm said in a statement. Bingo, which reported a three-fold jump in profit for the 2019-20 financial year due to increased network capacity, is likely to benefit from a potential boom in infrastructure investment as the economy reopens after coronavirus-enforced lockdowns. On the flip side, Megaport (-1.3pc), Premier Investments (-1.2pc), BlueScope Steel (-1.5pc), Auckland International Airport (-0.9pc) and Worley (-2.8pc) were the worst performers. Shares of electronic payments firm Tyro Payments jumped (+25pc) to $2.90, snapping a five-day losing streak. The company said it expects to resolve a mass outage of its EFTPOS payment terminals, which affected about 30 per cent of its 32,000 customers, by the end of this week. Tyro also rejected a short-seller report by Viceroy Research — which accused the company of under-reporting the extent of outages across its payments terminals, and caused its share price to fall heavily in recent days. The payment operator dismissed Viceroy's claims as being ""false"". But its problems may not be over, and Tyro said it had received correspondence from a law firm about a potential class action, though a lawsuit has not been filed against it yet. Tyro has shed around 30 per cent of its value since January 7, when it first announced connectivity issues with its payment terminals. China's economy grew by (+6.5pc) in the December quarter, compared to a year earlier, according to data released by its government on Monday. This was its fastest rate of quarterly economic growth in two years. Here are the online platforms that have either banned or restricted harmful speech, and where Donald Trump might look next in his search for a new megaphone. But viewed through a different lens, its economy grew at a slower pace (+2.3pc) last year — its slowest annual rate in more than 40 years. However, retail spending came in below expectations as domestic consumer demand remained weak for Australia's largest trading partner. Retail sales for the December quarter were up (+4.6pc) from a year ago, but sales fell (-3.9pc) in 2020, as a whole. ""The recovery in domestic demand still lacks a solid backing,"" said Lauri Halikka, fixed income and FX strategist at SEB. ""Sporadic virus outbreaks have intensified downside risks in the near term."" China reported more than 100 new COVID-19 cases for the sixth consecutive day, with rising infections in the north-east fuelling concern of another wave when hundreds of millions of people travel for the Lunar New Year holiday. Tough new controls in the city of Gongzhuling in Jilin province, which has a population of about 1 million people, brings the total number of people under lockdown to more than 29 million. Mr Halikka said the impact of the latest regional lockdowns and mass testing was likely to be limited and short-lived. The economic pick-up in China was a marked contrast to the United States and Europe, where the spread of coronavirus has hit consumer spending, underlined by dismal retail sales reported on Friday. Also evident are doubts about how much of US president-elect Joe Biden's stimulus package will make it through Congress given Republican opposition, and the risk of more violence at his inauguration on Wednesday local time. European markets wavered on Monday local time, as soaring COVID-19 cases offset investor hopes of a quick economic recovery, even after data showed the Chinese economy rebounded faster than expected in the fourth quarter of 2020. Shortly after President Donald Trump ended his speech to the ""Save America"" rally, where he called for the crowd to march on Congress, riled up protesters stormed the Capitol Building. Britain's FTSE fell (-0.2pc) to 6,721 points, while Germany's DAX rose (+0.4pc) to 13,848. Meanwhile, a recent surge in markets has prompted investors to discuss whether asset markets may be overvalued. In a monthly letter to clients last week, Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said all of the preconditions for a bubble were in place. ""Financing costs are at record lows, new participants are being drawn into markets, and the combination of high accumulated savings and low prospective returns on traditional assets create both the means and the desire to engage in speculative activity,"" he said. He warned that in the months ahead investors would need to pay particular attention to ""risks of a monetary policy reversal, rising stock valuations, and the rate of the post-pandemic recovery"". Mr Haefele said that while he saw pockets of speculation, the broader equity market was not in a bubble.

261,ASX trades lower but China's economy continues to grow,markets,"  ASX trades lower as Super Retail Group sees boost from Australian campers during COVID The Australian share market has started the week on a lull, despite several large retailers announcing sales growth off the back of the pandemic. The ASX 200 progressively traded down on Monday and closed 0.8 per cent lower at 6,663. The All Ordinaries also closed down 0.7 per cent. Australian healthcare company Pro Medicus was Monday's top performer as it continued to rise off news of a US contract. Shares in the company, which does imaging for radiology and other health services, rose to a 10-month high last week after it announced the deal with the largest health system in Utah. It closed on Monday 11 per cent higher. Electronics and music chain JB Hi-Fi also performed well (+3.8pc) after announcing good sales growth during the pandemic. Preliminary half-year online sales were up 162 per cent to $679 million. Net profit after tax was $318 million versus $171 million for the same period the year before. Other top performers include rival online retailers Kogan, which closed up 3.1 per cent, and Harvey Norman, which ended the day 3.7 per cent higher. Energy stocks lost the most ground on Monday, including Mineral Resources (-3.3pc), gold miner Gold Road (-3.3p), and BHP (-2.9pc) That followed oil prices falling sharply on the weekend. Super Retail Group (SUL), the owner of Rebel Sports, Boating Camping & Fishing (BCF), and Supercheap Auto, is handing back $1.7 million in wage subsidies to the Federal Government. The ASX-listed retailer announced the decision in a trade update on Monday morning where it boasted sales growth of 23 per cent for the past six months of 2020. It told the ABC it was handing back the JobKeeper payments voluntarily due to its better-than-expected results. The JobKeeper payments had only been for staff hired at the group's Macpac chain, which includes 72 bricks-and-mortar stores. Staff will instead be paid out of the company's coffers. SRG's sales were boosted by online sales, which soared 87 per cent to $237 million during the pandemic. But this rise was coming off a low base, with online sales still making up just 13 per cent of overall sales. One of the company's biggest boosts was to online sales at BCF, as Australians with no choice but to travel at home flocked to buy camping and outdoors gear. SRG's formal half-yearly results are released on 17 February. Its shares were trading several points up on this news on Monday and at one point reached a three-month high. But it ended the day one per cent lower. Meanwhile, the chief executive of Premier Investments will leave the job by 2022. Mark McInnes, who has been leading the owner of Just Jeans, Smiggle and Peter Alexander for the past decade, has had to give Premier a year's notice before quitting. Retail mogul Solomon Lew, who chairs Premier, has thanked Mr McInnes for his time in the role. ""We have thrived in very challenging times while many of our competitors have struggled or failed,"" Mr Lew said. ""In discussions with Mark, he indicated his desire to commit more time to his family than the demands of his role allow. ""After a decade in the CEO role, I understand and fully support Mark's decision to leave for personal reasons."" Just last week, Premier flagged a rise in its first-half earnings. Premier ended Monday down 2.3 per cent. Asian share markets pared back early losses on Monday as data confirmed China's economy had bounced back last quarter following a jump in factory output. Chinese blue chips edged up 0.4 per cent after the economy was reported to have grown 6.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, on a year earlier, topping forecasts of 6.1 per cent. Capital Economics' Senior China Economist, Julian Evans-Pritchard, said GDP figures ""often need to be taken with a grain of salt"". ""But our in-house measure, the China Activity Proxy (CAP), also points to a marked pick-up in growth last quarter, despite showing a deeper downturn earlier in the year,"" he said. ""Our initial estimate, based on full data for October and November and partial data for December, is that the economy grew 7.4 per cent year on year in Q4, up from 4.9 per cent in Q3. ""The monthly data suggests that growth dropped back slightly heading into 2021 but it remains strong. ""We think this strength will persist during the first half of this year, before giving way to a weaker second half."" China is Australia's biggest trading partner. Its dependence on iron ore from Australia helps boost our economy. The Australian dollar was unmoved by the latest China data. It was still down 0.2 per cent to 76.9 US cents.

263,ASX ends the week down despite a US pandemic sweetener,markets,"  Australian shares end week down despite Joe Biden unveiling $US1.9t stimulus plan Australian shares have ended the week on a downer after a mixed bag of a week marked by vaccine rollout news and US pandemic relief. The ASX 200 ended Friday flat at 6,715 points. Overall, it ended the week 0.6 per cent down, after starting on Monday at 6,758 points. The All Ords did end Friday slightly higher (+0.1pc) but also ended the week very slightly down. Stocks did edge slightly higher on Friday at one point as president-elect Joe Biden unveiled his $US1.9 trillion pandemic relief plan to jump-start a struggling US economy. Global markets have risen sharply in the past week after the Democrats won the Georgia runoff elections, giving them a majority in the US Senate, which makes it easier for them to pass laws and approve more stimulus. Real estate, tech stocks and some medical companies led the way on Friday, like Afterpay (+10pc), Vicinity Centres (+5pc) and Domain (+3.1pc). Visit our US Politics page for all the latest news on Joe Biden and Donald Trump. At the other end of the spectrum, gold miners like Resolute Mining (-6.2pc), along with healthcare companies Polynovo (-7.8pc), Resmed (-4.6pc) and Mesoblast (-2.9pc) experienced heavy losses. The Australian dollar lifted (+0.6pc) to 77.77 US cents. Bitcoin briefly hit $US40,000 overnight, as the volatile cryptocurrency has clawed back much of last week's heavy losses. Brent crude oil went up (+0.7pc) to $US56.46 per barrel. Spot gold was slightly higher (+0.3pc) to $US1,847.44 an ounce. Mr Biden announced his $US1.9 trillion stimulus proposal on Thursday evening local time, saying in prime-time remarks that bold investment was needed to jump-start the economy and speed up the US response to the coronavirus pandemic. ""A crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight, and there's no time to waste,"" Mr Biden said. ""We have to act and we have to act now."" The aid package includes $US415 billion to bolster the response to the virus and the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, some $US1 trillion in direct relief to households, and roughly $US440 billion for small businesses and communities particularly hard hit by the pandemic. Shortly after President Donald Trump ended his speech to the ""Save America"" rally, where he called for the crowd to march on Congress, riled up protesters stormed the Capitol Building. Stimulus payment cheques for $US1,400 would be issued to top up the $US600 cheques issued under the last congressional stimulus legislation in December. Supplemental unemployment insurance would also increase to $US400 a week (up from its current $US300 a week) and would be extended to September. The Democrat leader's plan is meant to kick off his time in office with a large bill that sets his short-term agenda into motion quickly; helping the economy and getting a handle on a virus that has killed more than 385,000 people in the United States. It also provides a sharp contrast with outgoing President Donald Trump, who spent the last months of his administration seeking to undermine Mr Biden's election victory rather than focusing on additional coronavirus relief. Mr Trump, who leaves office on Wednesday, did support the $US2,000 stimulus payments. Many Republicans in Congress baulked at the price tag for such payments. The president-elect will face similar hurdles with his proposals, though he will be helped by the fact that his fellow Democrats will control both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The incoming president will seek to pass the legislation even as his predecessor faces a second impeachment trial. Transition officials said Mr Biden's plan would be a rescue package that would be followed up with another recovery package in the coming weeks. The plan would extend moratoriums on mortgage foreclosures and evictions until September, and include funding for rental and utility assistance. Mr  Biden also called on Congress to increase the minimum wage to $US15 an hour, and said the package would include assistance to fight hunger. ""I know what I just described does not come cheaply, but failure to do so will cost us dearly,"" Mr Biden said, adding that economists, financial institutions and Wall Street banks supported the need for stimulus. The COVID relief-related funds will go towards a national vaccine program, testing, investments for workers to do vaccine outreach and contact tracing, and money for states. ""The vaccines offer so much hope ... but the vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure thus far,"" Mr Biden said. The incoming President also said, from tomorrow, he would set out his plan to vaccinate 100 million Americans in 100 days after taking office. Pandemic-related shutdowns and restrictions have cost millions of US jobs. The Biden plan — if approved by the House and Senate — would buy more time for the US economy to bridge the period until the distribution of vaccines allows for a wider resumption of economic activity. The Dow Jones and Nasdaq indices briefly hit fresh records on Thursday (local time), but wiped out all their gains in the final trading hour. In the end, the Dow closed (-0.2pc) lower at 30,992, while the Nasdaq fell (-0.1pc) to 13,113. The benchmark S&P 500 dropped (-0.4pc) to 3,796 points. National house prices continue to withstand the otherwise devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but how long will this last asks Nassim Khadem. The US Labor Department's latest weekly jobless report showed the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits increased more than expected last week. Surging COVID-19 infections disrupted operations at restaurants and other businesses, underscoring its severe impact on the economy. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose to 965,000 last week, the highest number since late August. It was a significant jump, with 181,000 more Americans applying filing jobless claims, compared to the week before. ""There's a tug-of-war going on between the prospects for further fiscal stimulus, as a result of Democratic control of the Senate, and a jobs market that has a long way to go before it heals,"" said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. ""You have these competing forces going on which are keeping markets range bound."" But Ms Roland noted that disappointing jobs data could provide ""further fodder for Biden to potentially market this plan."" Wall Street has been trading near record highs, despite the recent spate of weak economic data.

265,ASX rebounds as investors await Biden's trillion-dollar COVID stimulus,markets,"  Australian shares close higher as investors await Joe Biden's trillion-dollar COVID stimulus Australian shares have held at the close, as investors wait for details of US President-elect Joe Biden's pandemic recovery plan. Mr Biden is expected to push US politicians to approve an economic stimulus package costing trillions of dollars on Thursday evening or Friday morning (AEDT). By the end of trading, the benchmark ASX 200 index was up by 0.5 per cent to 6,716 — near its highest level since late-February. The broader All Ordinaries index also rose by a similar margin to 6,983 points. Before that, the market had spent much of its day drifting in and out of negative territory. Some of the the worst performers were gold miners Resolute Mining (-2.6pc) and Silver Lake Resources (-3.1pc), along with St Barbara (-2.6pc) and Virgin Money UK (-2.4pc). Shares in Premier Investments dropped (-3.5pc) to $24.46 as investors cashed out. Visit our US Politics page for all the latest news on Joe Biden and Donald Trump. It was nothing compared to Premier's 12.7 per cent surge yesterday. That was after the company — which owns Peter Alexander, Just Jeans and Smiggle — said its first-half earnings are expected to almost double. On the flip side, healthcare and technology stocks clawed back yesterday's losses, including Afterpay (+9.7pc), Zip Co (+4.5pc), Pro Medicus (+15pc), Breville Group (+4.5pc) and Cochlear (+4.9pc). The Australian dollar recovered slightly (+0.2pc) at 77.45 US cents. Bitcoin jumped (+13.3pc) to $US37,456 in the past 24 hours. But it remains far below the record high it reached on Saturday ($US41,692). Spot gold slipped (-0.1pc) to $US1,841.09 an ounce, as the US greenback recovered from an almost three-year low. Mr Biden wants Congress to deliver immediate pandemic ""rescue"" efforts, according to his incoming administration's top economic adviser. In an appearance at the Reuters Next online conference, Brian Deese — who will head the National Economic Council in the new Democratic administration — said Mr Biden will lay out a two-track economic plan. Shortly after President Donald Trump ended his speech to the ""Save America"" rally, where he called for the crowd to march on Congress, riled up protesters stormed the Capitol Building. The first will be a ""rescue bucket,"" which includes sending out $US2,000 stimulus cheques to help people weather the COVID-19 downturn, and a longer-term recovery effort that aims to deliver on the ""Build Back Better"" plan he laid out during the presidential campaign. In addition to making direct payments, Mr Biden's proposal will include money to ramp up a national vaccinations effort, testing, contact tracing and funding to get most schools reopened shortly. ""We need an immediate rescue package that finishes the work that Congress took an important step on in December, but left a lot of work undone,"" Mr Deese said. ""We need to focus immediately again on underwriting the investments necessary to make a nationwide vaccination program work."" Mr Biden estimated that his plan would cost ""trillions"" of dollars, investments he said were needed to stave off long-term damage and human suffering as the labour market wobbles. The Democrat, who takes office on January 20, emerged emboldened from a pair of Senate elections in Georgia last week that handed his party a majority in that chamber to complement control of the House of Representatives. The majorities could allow Biden to pass larger spending bills. However, Republicans and even some Democrats may be resistant to greater deficit-fuelled spending. Mr Deese pointed to the most recent US employment report, which showed 140,000 Americans had lost their jobs in December. It was the first time in eight months that US job numbers had dropped, and it coincided with a surge in COVID-19 infections nationwide. ""The December jobs report I think is a signal for all of us to take very seriously that the trajectory of the virus and the trajectory of the economy are not where they need to be,"" he said. Whitehaven Coal's share price jumped (+2.3pc) after it forecast that could prices and sales volume will rebound this year. The coal miner also announced a 29 per cent jump in its quarterly output — boosted by a recovery in key Asian economies. National house prices continue to withstand the otherwise devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but how long will this last asks Nassim Khadem. It said the improved pricing environment reflects increased demand for thermal coal as economies recover from the pandemic's hit and supply cuts. The company also said its saleable coal production for the December quarter was 3.9 million tonnes, a significant increase from 3.1 million tonnes a year ago. Meanwhile, shares in global miner Rio Tinto slipped (-1.1pc) to $119.37. Rio said that it had struck a deal with electricity provider Meridian Energy, which allows its aluminium smelter in New Zealand to continue running until December 2024. Back in July, Rio Tinto said it would shut down New Zealand's Aluminium Smelter (NZAS) — which is the country's single largest power user, due to high costs and a challenging market. The move would put more than a thousand jobs on the line and dealing a blow to the country's top power producers. NZAS employs over 1,000 people directly and creates a further 1,600 indirect jobs in Tiwai, located in the country's southernmost region of Southland. The decision to close the smelter had disappointed politicians and local power firms as it came when the COVID-19 pandemic began to cripple the economy. The miner said that while talks were ongoing with the government to address the smelter's high transmission costs, the deal with Meridian over power prices would make the smelter economically viable. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who won a second term in office last year, had said she would negotiate with Rio Tinto to extend the smelter's operations. Investors were also watching events in Washington, where the US House of Representatives gathered to vote on President Donald Trump's impeachment, for his role in last week's assault on Capitol, which left five dead. The House voted (232 to 197) to impeach Mr Trump for inciting an insurrection, with 10 Republicans crossing the floor to vote against their President. Mr Trump has made history by becoming the first US president to get impeached twice. The matter will next proceed to the US Senate. But its Republican leader Mitch McConnell said he will not put Mr Trump on trial until after January 20, when Joe Biden is inaugurated as the new president. The results of the House impeachment were finalised after Wall Street finished trading, and before the Australian market opened. The Dow Jones index closed down 8 points lower (flat) at 31,060, the S&P 500 gained 0.2 per cent to 3,810, while the Nasdaq added 0.4 per cent to 13,129. Here are the online platforms that have either banned or restricted harmful speech, and where Donald Trump might look next in his search for a new megaphone. The US technology sector was boosted by a change of leadership at Intel, which jumped 7 per cent. The chipmaker has ousted its chief executive Bob Swan, and will replace him with next month with Pat Gelsinger, the boss of VMware. US markets hit record highs last week as expectations of a hefty COVID-19 relief package and hopes of a rebound in corporate earnings this year eclipsed concerns over signs that the labour market recovery had stalled amid rampant COVID-19 infections. ""The market is starting to price in that there are some risks ... valuation is pretty extreme, optimism is way too high, we've got a disappointing rollout of further vaccine,"" said David Spika, president of GuideStone Capital Management in Dallas, Texas. ""The expectation is that we'll have a significant increase in earnings and economic growth in 2021, but both are really dependent on the vaccine. ""The market is looking through the impeachment and saying we're going to get this stimulus, which will be a bridge between now and when the vaccine can be adequately distributed."" Brent crude oil fell (-1.2pc) to $US55.91 per barrel as the threat of lower demand due to rising global COVID-19 cases outweighed support from a greater-than-anticipated drop in US crude inventories. ""While I see crude prices trading higher over the coming months, investors need to be mindful that the road to higher oil demand and prices will remain bumpy,"" UBS oil analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.

267,"Job vacancies surge to pre-COVID levels, as ASX ends day flat",markets,"  Job vacancies surge to pre-COVID levels, as Australian share market loses momentum The Australian share market has ended Wednesday marginally higher, with high-flying tech and healthcare stocks being the weakest links. The benchmark ASX 200 ended the day 0.1 per cent up at 6,687 points. That was after it drifted in and out of negative territory a few times during the day's trade. The broader All Ordinaries index fared slightly better, rising 0.2 per cent to 6,954 points after also spending most of the day in the red. Some of Wednesday's worst performers were Mesoblast (-6.2pc), Polynovo (-9.2pc), and Altium (-6.3pc). Supermarket giants Coles (-2.4pc) and Woolworths (-1.5pc) also weighed on the share market. National house prices continue to withstand the otherwise devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but how long will this last asks Nassim Khadem. The energy and materials sectors helped limit the losses, with solid gains from Beach Energy (+4.2pc), Iluka Resources (+4.7pc), Oil Search (+6.2pc), Santos (+3.9pc) and Woodside Petroleum (+5.4pc). Premier Investments was the best performing stock. It surged 12.7 per cent to $25.35 and had its best day in 10 months. The owner of retail brands like Just Jeans, Smiggle and Peter Alexander flagged that its first-half earnings would rise between 75 and 85 per cent, and it would record between $221 million and $233 million in earnings before interest and tax. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar rose to 77.61 US cents, as the greenback slipped to its weakest level in more than 2.5 years. It was a significant rebound given the Australian dollar fell as low as 76.68 US cents earlier this week. The number of job vacancies in Australia surged to 254,000 in the November quarter, in the latest sign that Australia's economy is recovering quickly from COVID-19. It was a big jump (+23.4pc) since the last quarter (August), according to new data released by the Bureau of Statistics (ABS). As social distancing rules and fear kept people away from the shops, online sales have taken off and many analysts say a lot of consumers will not return in-store. The data also showed the number of advertised opportunities was 12 per cent higher than where it was over the previous year. ABS head of Labour Statistics Bjorn Jarvis said it was also ""higher than the pre-COVID level in February"" and this ""reflected the pace of recovery in labour demand in the second half of the year and labour shortages in some industries"". The latest figures show the biggest gains came in the sectors hardest hit during the pandemic: arts and recreation (+233pc), accommodation and food (+66pc) and retail trade (+39pc). While public sector opportunities lifted sharply (+16.9pc), private sector vacancies saw an even bigger rise (+24.2pc). The ABS obtained these figures by tracking the number of jobs currently advertised, via phone surveys and online electronic collection. The surge offers hope that the job market can continue its surprisingly quick recovery, which saw the unemployment rate drop to 6.8 per cent in November (from a July peak of 7.5 per cent). It was a major improvement over the May quarter result, which showed job vacancies plunging to 129,200 at the height of the pandemic. ""Today’s data adds to the evidence that the employment recovery should continue into early 2021 at least,"" said ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch. ""A much quicker labour market recovery poses a question about the right balance of policy settings. ""We think the RBA will be clear about the answer — keep the stimulus flowing. ""Also, it's worth keeping in mind that some component of the very strong vacancy numbers would reflect skills mismatches, which may become more significant as long as international borders remain closed, curtailing skilled migration. ""This component of job vacancies is not helpful in reducing unemployment or improving growth and productivity."" US markets posted miniscule gains on Tuesday (local time), as investors eyed the latest stimulus developments and US President Donald Trump's second impeachment saga. Democrats in the US Congress will try to remove Republican President Donald Trump from office this week following a riot at the US Capitol last week, which Mr Trump has been accused of inciting. The Dow Jones index closed slightly higher (+0.2pc) at 31,069 points, the benchmark S&P 500 was steady at 3,801, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lifted (+0.3pc) to 13,072. Wall Street has been trading near record highs lately, on hopes of a large boost to public spending and speedy roll-out of coronavirus vaccines under a Democratic-led Congress. ""The Georgia Senate run-off elections (that gave the majority to the Democrats) really changed the landscape for the outlook pretty significantly, as there is now potentially very significant additional stimulus,"" said Tom Simons, money market economist at Jefferies in New York. The benchmark yield on America's 10-year Treasury bonds lifted for a seventh straight session, to its highest level since March (at 1.136 per cent). European markets weakened overnight, with Britain's FTSE falling (-0.7pc) to 6,754 and Germany's DAX down (-0.1pc) to 13,925 points. Spot gold lifted (+0.6pc) to $US1,860.66 an ounce. Silver jumped (+2.4pc) to $US25.58 an ounce. Bitcoin dropped (-4.8pc) to $US33,055 in the past 24 hours. The volatile cryptocurrency jumped to its highest value ever ($US41,692) on Saturday, prompting some investors to cash out while they were still ahead. Democrats said they would give Mr Trump one last chance to leave office days before his term expires or face an unprecedented second impeachment over his supporters' deadly January 6 assault on the US Capitol. Shortly after President Donald Trump ended his speech to the ""Save America"" rally, where he called for the crowd to march on Congress, riled up protesters stormed the Capitol Building. An impeachment trial could proceed even after the Republican president leaves office. However, some Democrats have expressed concern that a trial could hamper president-elect Joe Biden's agenda, slowing confirmation of his appointees and distracting from legislative priorities such as a new coronavirus relief package. ""Even if [additional stimulus] is delayed, it's going to be a matter of days, maybe weeks, not months,"" said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at GlobAlt in Atlanta. ""The question is the shape and form of it."" Meanwhile, oil hit its highest since February as tighter supply and expectations of a drop in US inventories offset concerns over rising coronavirus cases globally. Last week, Saudi Arabia said it planned to cut output by an extra 1 million barrels per day in February and March. ""Saudi Arabia in particular is ensuring, through its additional voluntary production cuts, that the market is undersupplied, if anything,"" said Eugen Weinberg of Commerzbank.

270,"ASX falls sharply, but retail trade surges on Black Friday and Victoria sales",markets,"  Gold and technology stocks dragged the Australian market sharply lower on Monday, but it still closed around a 10-month high. The ASX 200 lost 61 points (or 0.9 per cent) to end at 6,697. The broader All Ordinaries index was also down by a similar margin to 6,959 points. Despite heavy losses, the local share market is trading optimistically around its late-February levels, before the massive coronavirus sell-off. Markets have largely put aside concerns about more contagious strains of COVID-19 and another attempt to impeach Donald Trump in the final days of his presidency. By 4:35pm AEDT, the Australian dollar was moderately weaker (-0.8pc) at 76.98 US cents due to a stronger US greenback. Last week, the local currency to 78.2 US cents, its strongest level since April 2018. ""The US dollar was supported with increasing calls for stimulus driving relative yields [for US long-term Treasury bonds] higher,"" said ANZ's head of Australian economics David Plank. But he said ""the outlook for the Australian dollar remains positive as stimulus expectations and falling volatility support the risk trade."" Meanwhile, bitcoin surged to a fresh record high ($US41,962) on Saturday, according to figures from Coindesk. But it has since plunged (-16pc) $US35,342 — just another day for the volatile cryptocurrency. Australian consumers spent $31.65 billion in November, as the latest data from the Bureau of Statistics (ABS) pointed to the domestic economy's ongoing recovery. Retail sales jumped (+7.1pc) since the previous month, and were significantly higher (+13.3pc) compared to a year ago. As social distancing rules and fear kept people away from the shops, online sales have taken off and many analysts say a lot of consumers will not return in-store. ""The rise is led by Victoria (+22.4pc) as Melbourne retail stores were able to trade for a full month in November,"" said Ben James, the ABS director of quarterly economy-wide surveys. He said that if Victoria's post-lockdown results were excluded, retail sales in November would have seen a much more tepid rise (+2.6pc), compared to the month before. November's strong result coincided with the popular Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales — as more consumers bring forward their Christmas shopping. There was further evidence in the figures that COVID-19 has led to major changes in shopping habits of Australians. Online sales made up 11 per cent of all retail turnover in November, last year. It was a big jump compared to November 2019, when 7.2 per cent of retail sales were conducted online. Apart from Victoria, other states and territories had relatively strong results, including Queensland (+4.5pc), NSW (+2.3pc), WA (+1.2pc), Tasmania (+3.4pc), the ACT (+2.5pc) and NT (+2.2pc). South Australia was the only state where retail sales fell (-0.2pc) due to its ""brief lockdown"", sparked by an Adelaide pizza bar worker giving false information to SA health authorities. More millennials are turning to 'buy now, pay later' players like Afterpay and Zip. Meanwhile, the industries with the biggest rise in sales were household goods retailing (+12.7pc), clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing (+26.7pc ), department stores (+21.1pc), and cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services (+6.7pc). ""The release of new games consoles and new iPhones added to sales in household goods and other retailing, while Black Friday sales also contributed to the increase across a number of industries,"" Mr James said. But a lot has changed since November, Commonwealth Bank's senior economist Kristina Clifton warned. ""We are a little more cautious on the domestic economic outlook following Sydney's outbreak and restrictions,"" she said. ""Jobs and business have been negatively impacted by the restrictions on the Northern Beaches and consumers have been reminded that the coronavirus pandemic is not necessarily over yet. ""Domestic tourism has received another hit from interstate border closures during a peak period for this sector. ""However, working the other way, a large pool of savings for the household sector will provide support to spending."" Energy stocks were the best performers on the ASX, including Whitehaven Coal (+2.9pc), Woodside Petroleum (+2.6pc) and Santos (+3.2pc). Brent crude had risen to its highest level in almost a year, but retreated (-0.9pc) to $US55.48 per barrel on Monday. While the tradition of Boxing Day sales isn't likely to die overnight, it is being challenged by online sales events like Black Friday. ""Oil is still pricing in a great deal of optimism linked to the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and any negative news flow on this front would prompt a sharp negative reaction,"" said Stephen Innes, Axi's chief global market strategist. ""Demand will always improve as the vaccines roll out, and the supply side is under control thanks to OPEC+ and Saudi Arabia's continued efforts."" Last week, oil prices surged after Saudi Arabia pledged to cut its output by 1 million barrels per day, in February and March. It was part of a deal to persuade most OPEC+ producers, including Russia, Libya and others, to hold output steady amid concerns that new coronavirus lockdowns in Europe will crimp demand. Apart from oil and gas stocks, Insurance Australia Group (+3.2pc), Resmed (+3.3pc) and Magellan Financial Group (+1.64c) also experienced solid gains. On the flip side, gold miners suffered the heaviest losses, like Perseus Mining (-8.1pc), Westgold Resources (-8.7pc), Silver Lake Resources (-5.7pc) and Gold Road Resources (-6.6pc). Spot gold dropped (-0.4pc) to $US1,841.26 an ounce today, which exacerbates its 4 per cent slump on Friday. Technology stocks were also sold off, including Nearmap (-7pc), Xero (-4.7pc), Appen (-4.1pc), WiseTech Global (-2.6pc) and Afterpay (-1.7pc). Shortly after President Donald Trump ended his speech to the ""Save America"" rally, where he called for the crowd to march on Congress, riled up protesters stormed the Capitol Building. Investors are betting US president-elect Joe Biden will push for more stimulus (hundreds of billions of dollars) to boost the US economy, propping up global share prices even further — given Democrats now control the House, Senate and presidency. Expectations of a ""blue wave"" cash injection have propelled Wall Street to record highs. The Dow Jones rose (+0.2pc) to 31,098 points, while the S&P 500 lifted (+0.6pc) to 3,825 and the Nasdaq Composite jumped (+1pc) to 13,202 on Friday. Investors shrugged off the latest US job figures which showed that 140,000 Americans lost their jobs in December, and coincided with a surge in COVID-19 infections nationwide. The results from the US Labor Department were far below expectations, as economists had predicted 71,000 jobs would be added to the US economy. However, the US unemployment rate was steady at 6.7 per cent.

271,'Unheard of' prices put pressure on cattle farmer margins,markets,"  'Unheard of' prices at Victorian weaner sales spark concern cattle market is overcooked Farmers are banking on an ever-increasing market to get a return after paying ""never seen before"" prices for young cattle at sales in Victoria this week. It has prompted concerns buyers will struggle to turn a profit Each year the state hosts a series of ""weaner"" cattle sales, which kicks off in the first week of January. Young, recently-weaned cattle are sold to buyers who will continue to feed them and grow them until they reach full weight. However, increased competition has led many to suggest this year's sales are the best, or most expensive, ever — prompting fears that beef farmers might struggle to make a profit at the other end. The extra demand has, in part, been attributed to buyers travelling to Victoria from Queensland and New South Wales, where farmers are seeking cattle to restock their paddocks after years of drought. The first sale of the week was held on Tuesday at Mortlake, in south-west Victoria, where agents' association president Matt Baxter said there was a ""massive"" crowd of buyers, many of whom had travelled from as far as Tamworth and Dubbo. ""We didn't have (that competition) last year,"" Mr Baxter said. ""There was no real interest from the north."" The sentiment was reflected at many sales across the state this week, including at Pakenham on Thursday, where Alex Scott & Staff livestock manager David Setches said ""it was certainly one of the biggest crowds I've seen there for a long time"". Celebrating 75 years of Rural reporting. ""The carpark was full an hour before the sale and they were parking blocks away,"" he said. The extra interest from northern buyers is largely driven by rain. ""For the last six months a lot of the cattle have been going back into NSW with rain up there,"" Mr Setches said. ""A lot of the calves that we'd normally retain for this weaner sale were sold before winter when NSW was really in full swing buying cattle to go back up there after that drought-breaking rain."" Mr Setches said many producers opted to take the money last year and part with their cattle early, thinking the prices were good at the time. Market reporter Jenny Kelly said prices had increased significantly since last year, and continued to increase at Hamilton in western Victoria throughout the week. ""We started at an average of 494c/kg for the opening sale of Angus steers on Monday, but by Wednesday we were seeing averages of 525c/kg,"" she said. ""Over the whole week the calves are averaging 500c/kg, which is just amazing."" ""Prices have broken new ground … it's something the industry has never seen before."" Prices at Hamilton topped $2,143 for heavy Angus steers on the first day, while at Pakenham they sold for up to $2,010. The top price for lighter steers at Casterton was 644c/kg, paid for light Hereford steers weighing 240kg ($1,545). Paying over 600c/kg for cattle is rare. Ms Kelly said despite crowds being subdued at the sales, excitement among sellers was high. ""Some of the comments are unprintable … even the sellers themselves have been quite in awe of the money that's come out for their calves,"" she said. Mr Baxter estimated prices at Mortlake on Tuesday were 30 to 40 per cent up on 2020 prices, with consignments of larger numbers of cattle in particular demand. ""Buyers were jumping over the rail for the bigger runs,"" he said. ""If you put a taxi ride on them to get back to NSW, they're going to be dear enough cattle."" Ms Kelly said despite this, some buyers were still leaving the sales empty handed, which suggested the higher prices could continue for some time. ""In the short term it looks to be sustainable, in that even though we've had big crowds at these sales there's a lot of people still going home empty handed,"" she said. ""A lot of agents are telling me they've still got a big list of clients who want cattle."" The agents now have to hope that those buyers who did secure cattle at higher prices are able to make a profit when they sell a finished product. ""We just hope (the market improvement) continues and we can get some sort of margin out of these cattle,"" Mr Setches said. ""Hopefully the finished product gets stronger because of the lack of cattle that are out there in the paddock. ""There nearly seems to be a frantic feeling out there ... people are concerned that if they don't come in even at these prices they won't get numbers."" Ms Kelly said there was concern that the market was overheated. ""When you look at what's happening at the other end of the market in terms of returns for prime bullocks and feeder steers ... this money shouldn't be on the table,"" she said.

272,Bitcoin is hitting fresh records on 'FOMO' and Biden stimulus bets,markets,"  Bitcoin is surging to record highs on 'FOMO' and Joe Biden stimulus bets ""Bitcoin hits another all-time high"". You've probably seen headlines like this way too many times recently, even if you have no idea what bitcoin is. Speculation, ""FOMO"" (fear of missing out) and inflation hedging are some of the reasons why this volatile digital currency has surged more than 400 per cent in the past year. Bitcoin's supporters were excited when it hit $US20,000 on December 17, then celebrated again two weeks later — when it jumped to a new high of $US30,000. It took just six days for bitcoin to surge again (at even more rapid pace) to $US40,000. Its value has since risen slightly to $US40,300 by 6.45am AEDT on Saturday. When you count the value of every bitcoin and other cryptocurrency (ethereum, tether, litecoin, and 4,180 others), their total market value has now surpassed $US1 trillion. Political developments in the United States appear to have fuelled the latest rally. Bitcoin has surged more than 16 per cent since Wednesday afternoon (local time), when a mob of pro-Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol building, in a failed attempt to prevent Congress certifying the 2020 election result. But the more important factor (from an economic perspective) was the Democrats' improbable victory in the Georgia run-off elections, which effectively hands them control of the US Senate (with a slim majority). This means the so-called ""blue wave"" has materialised, since Joe Biden and the Democrats have also won the White House and House of Representatives. Investors are betting the US Government will soon inject more cash (up to $US800 billion) into its COVID-ridden economy — which is easier to do when a single party controls all arms of Government. While bitcoin has surged 400 per cent in the past 12 months, the US dollar has tumbled (-7.5pc) to its lowest value in three years. It coincided with US Congress pumping a record $US2 trillion into pandemic relief, followed by another cash splash of $US892 billion in December. The Federal Reserve was also forced to slash US interest rates to near zero in March, in a desperate attempt to stimulate an economic recovery. Across the world, governments and central banks have also made similar moves — slashing rates to zero (or negative territory) and printing trillions of dollars' worth of cash (also known as quantitative easing). Supporters of bitcoin have long trumpeted the idea that cryptocurrencies are ""digital gold"" which serve as a ""hedge against inflation"". Basically, it's a strategy where you buy an asset (which is expected to maintain or increase its value), while the value of money falls —because the Government prints more of it, so the currency is no longer in short supply. Back in December 2017, cryptocurrency enthusiasts rejoiced when bitcoin climbed above $US19,783 (its record high at the time). Much of it was driven by ""FOMO"" as speculators piled in. It took less than a month for its value to crash below $US11,000. Then its value plunged below $US3,300 in less than a year. Analysts are sceptical of Bitcoin's meteoric rise. Here's why some are predicting a crash, and what that would mean. However, cryptocurrencies made a comeback in 2020 as the pandemic ravaged global share markets (hitting oil and travel stocks particularly hard). ""It was our busiest year since 2017 — the last big bull run we had,"" said Adrian Przelozny, head of cryptocurrency exchange, the Independent Reserve. ""What we've seen over the last year is larger, more sophisticated investors entered this space. Hedge funds, large companies and a lot of banks entering this area as well."" ""So it's really a sign of the growing maturity of the industry, and it's becoming seen as a more accepted asset class … one of those things you'd hold in a portfolio."" Its recent popularity was also partly due to the perception that cryptocurrencies are gaining more mainstream acceptance — as major companies like PayPal now allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on its ubiquitous payment platform. Speculation and ""FOMO"" are still playing a role, especially with banking giants like JP Morgan predicting in a research note (earlier this week) that bitcoin could hit $US146,000 in the long term. Interestingly, JP Morgan's chief executive Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin a ""fraud"" that will eventually ""blow up"", and that he would fire his traders ""in a second"" if he discovered they were trading bitcoin. In the long term, Mr Przelozny believes that as bitcoin's value soars it will become tougher for major investors to manipulate its value. ""In 2011, during its infancy, the volatility was higher as its market capitalisation was lower, so it was much easier for a large player to move the price,"" he said. ""As the market cap increases, it takes a much bigger investor to move the price. ""We'll see volatility decrease in the next year or two as it becomes less of a risky investment. But it's still very volatile of course."" AMP Capital's chief economist Shane Oliver has long been a bitcoin sceptic, and he has no regrets about ""missing out"" on the recent surge. ""It just reinforces my view that this is a highly volatile, speculative investment,"" he said. Dr Oliver said bitcoin's extreme volatility makes it an unreliable ""store of value"". The boss of JPMorgan Chase said if his staff were caught trading bitcoin he would ""fire them in a second"" and it's a ""fraud"". So, is it? ""Through the time, that it's gone from virtually zero to $US19,500, back to $US3,500 … and now to $US23,000."" ""The value of the $50 note in my wallet has hardly changed in value, in terms of what it can buy — but if I had the equivalent in bitcoin, it would have varied dramatically."" Dr Oliver argued that ""the problem with bitcoin"" is that it's very hard to value it objectively. ""When you look at the share market and property, you can look at the income they generate. But with bitcoin it's all bit of a mystery."" ""We also don't know to what degree it's ultimately going to be used as a digital currency. ""If you're confident on the global economic outlook and you believe the US dollar is going to fall — which I think it will — there are better fundamental ways to play that, than via bitcoin. ""But that's not to say it can't double in value in the next 12 months."" However, ""bitcoin mining"" is an energy-intensive process, which is estimated to consume more power than it takes to keep the lights on in nations like New Zealand. In 2018, more than 1,200 Australians complained to the consumer watchdog (the ACCC) about cryptocurrency scams. Cryptocurrencies are frequently used on darkweb marketplaces like Silk Road and Valhalla to facilitate the sale and trafficking of illicit drugs, firearms, precursor chemicals and child exploitation materials. Australia's Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) also warned, in a report, that cryptocurrencies are getting increasingly used by ""serious and organised crime groups"".

273,"There could be another mining boom, but it all hangs in the success of COVID-19 vaccines",markets,"  The year 2020 has been one of fluctuating fortunes for Australia's biggest exports amid the coronavirus-fuelled recession and trade row with China. Gold hit a record high above $US2,000 an ounce and iron ore prices jumped by more than two-thirds in 2020 as China's economy recovered from the COVID-19 shutdown and a coronavirus outbreak in Brazil closed iron ore mines. But the coronavirus recession sent oil prices below zero for the first time as economies came to a standstill, crushing demand for fuel. The diplomatic row with China saw multiple Australian exports caught in the crossfire including coal, beef, barley, lobsters and wine. So where to from here for Australia's resources exports? There is a lot riding on luck: effective coronavirus vaccines and détente in tensions with China. However, some analysts are predicting a new mining boom as the global economy improves and demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy surges. The price of fuel plummeted as government lockdowns and business shutdowns brought the global economy and international travel to a standstill. At its low point in April last year, West Texas Crude oil fell below zero to negative $US40 a barrel as the US ran out of storage space. Fuel prices recovered some lost ground as Joe Biden's win in the US presidential election and progress in the development of coronavirus vaccines bolstered shaky investor confidence. Overall, oil prices lost one-fifth of their value in 2020, ending the year at around $US50 a barrel. Prices rose early this month after Saudi Arabia announced surprise production cuts for 2021 following a standoff with Russia over supply increases and after Iran seized a South Korean ship, heightening Middle East tensions. ANZ commodity strategists Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari said commodity prices in 2021 will be driven by the success or failure of coronavirus vaccines. ""COVID-19 vaccines are a major turning point for the world, which could put a floor under low demand for oil,"" they said in a report last month. ""However, there are some major hurdles to overcome before they can have an impact on economies and the oil market."" ANZ said those hurdles include a resurgence of coronavirus cases and new government restrictions, which could see black gold fall again in 2021. West Texas Crude is tipped to trade between $US42.50 to $US52.50 a barrel this year and the international benchmark Brent Crude is forecast at $US45 to $US55 a barrel. Coronavirus has taken a big economic toll but the upside for Australian motorists has been lower petrol prices, a precious jewel in an economy where the pandemic saw Australia plunged into the first recession in nearly 30 years with 1 million people out of work for the first time. Weak demand for fuel saw prices at the pump fall to $1 a litre in some capital cities late last year, including in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, although prices have fluctuated wildly. Peter Khoury from motoring group the NRMA said petrol prices were set to stay in the slow lane for a while in 2021 because of the coronavirus uncertainty and the higher Australian dollar, which makes oil imports cheaper. ""Some service stations have gone below $1 and they have been below $1 for quite some time and so there are bargains to be found in capital cities,"" Mr Khoury said. He advised motorists to shop around, with the price differential as much as $0.50 a litre in Sydney and $0.30 in other cities. The lower petrol prices have been welcomed by consumers. New mother Lee Leo said cheaper petrol prices in Sydney have helped her family get out and about during difficult times. ""We are able to go out and go for drives as a family, day trips, so it's been great,"" she said. The big winner from the coronavirus pandemic was the king of commodities: Australia's biggest export, iron ore, which hit new record highs in China. Benchmark prices of the steel-making material doubled to nearly $US160 a tonne in 2020, the highest level since 2011, as the Chinese economy rebounded from its coronavirus shutdown with Beijing ramping up construction and manufacturing. The spread of the coronavirus in Brazil also shuttered mines there, leading to increased demand for Australian iron ore. In fact, Australia exported a record $11 billion worth of iron ore in October last year, although metal and ore exports eased back in November. UBS managing director and resources expert Glyn Lawcock expects iron ore prices to pull back and trade around $US110 a tonne in 2021. However, he said the failure of another giant mining waste dam in Brazil could clamp supply and further push up prices. Prices have already jumped to nearly $US170 a tonne, near record highs, in the first week of the new year. But trade tensions with China could hurt prices as Chinese firms seek out new global suppliers of iron ore such as the giant Simandou project in Guinea in Africa. Beijing is also looking to control more of the world's iron ore to shore up its supplies and has indicated it will cut steel production in 2021. Also on the downside, China has lifted restrictions on high-quality scrap metal imports, which will allow more recycling to ease a shortage in metals as the economy recovers. ANZ predicts iron ore prices could trade in the range of $US85 to $US115 a tonne this year. The ghosts of Juukan Gorge will forever haunt Rio Tinto and the mining industry with more pressure on miners to gain the consent of traditional owners before destroying culturally important sites. Rio Tinto boss Jean-Sebastien Jacques and two top executives were forced to resign after two 46,000-year-old caves at the Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara in north-west Western Australia were blown up to mine $135 million worth of iron ore, despite urgent attempts by the native title holders, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) Aboriginal Corporation, to stop the work. Standard & Poor's said the mining industry would continue to experience pressure to become more environmentally friendly. ""The accident emphasises the importance of ties between the company and local communities and ultimately its ability the run its operations smoothly,"" S&P analysts said. PWC Australia mining leader Debbie Smith said protecting cultural heritage needed to be a priority for all corporations, not just miners. ""Everyone will be very cognisant of protecting our cultural heritage … and making sure that we have the right relationship with First Nations people,"" Ms Smith said. Jamie Lowe from the National Native Title Council has called on Rio Tinto to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation to the PKKP for the destruction of the caves. He said jail terms and ""really significant fines"" were needed to protect cultural heritage in Australia. Rio Tinto ignored calls for an Australian chief executive to replace JS Jacques and instead appointed its chief financial officer Jakob Stausholm to the top job. Gold also shone in 2020, reaching a new record high of $US2,063.54 an ounce, according to Bloomberg data, as investors turned to their favourite safe haven and hedge against inflation. With investment yields near zero or even negative, investors looked to gold as a store of value. Massive government stimulus globally and the weak greenback bolstered the precious metal with the price of the commodity rising by one quarter over the year. It ended 2020 at above $US1,920 an ounce. UBS thinks gold prices could climb to a new record of $US2,100 an ounce in 2021 because of continuing government handouts and low interest rates, which have both weakened the US dollar. It was a bumpy year for coal in 2020, amid the coronavirus recession and diplomatic tensions between Australia and China with the commodity caught in the crosshairs. The price of thermal coal at the port of Newcastle slumped to a low of just over $US43 a tonne in 2020 because of the coronavirus recession and as China blocked Australian coal imports. But it rebounded to a 19-month high by year's end to nearly $US90 a tonne. Thermal coal is used to generate electricity. Australian coking coal, used to make iron ore, lost ground and ended the year at just above $US100 a tonne, UBS predicts it will pick up this year to $US135 a tonne. The unofficial coal ban by China appeared to hit Australia's coal exports in November, although they rose in October. JP Morgan economist Tom Kennedy said the Bureau of Statistics data suggested ""modest trade frictions"". He said coal exports fell 4 per cent in in November and are 44 per cent below the 2019 average. ANZ economists said despite China's import restrictions, coal exports were down only slightly, ""suggesting Australia has so far been able to find alternative buyers"". Japan buys nearly half of Australia's coal exports. Unusually, there were no thermal coal shipments to China from the world's biggest coal port, the Port of Newcastle, in December. ANZ expects Chinese import curbs on coal to ease after the first few months of this year. And UBS sees coal prices continuing to rebound into 2021 with high-cost producers losing money and going out of business or reducing supply. It thinks coal will be underpinned by strong global growth and continued government focus on the environment. However, demand for coal is set to fall over the next few years as more countries seek to limit their greenhouse gas pollution in line with the United Nations international treaty on climate change, the Paris Agreement. In fact, the Federal Government's commodities forecaster has predicted another fall in the value of our global coal exports in 2020-21. Last month, the International Energy Agency said global coal demand probably peaked seven years ago in 2013 as countries turned to gas as a transition fuel to renewable energy. It said despite a forecast pick-up in demand this year as economies rebound from the coronavirus lockdowns, global demand for coal is forecast to ""flatten out"" over the next five years, saying that ""construction of new coal-fired power plants is in decline."" BHP and Rio Tinto have committed to net zero emissions by 2050, pledged to help their customers cut carbon emissions and are investing in pollution reduction technology. PWC's head of mining Debbie Smith expects more divestment of fossil fuel businesses in 2021. ""We are seeing global financiers and insurers putting pressure on companies that have thermal coal assets."" ""I do think we might see more pure play companies rather than diversified companies into the future,"" Ms Smith said. UBS thinks it will be another good year for electric battery raw materials in 2021: lithium, graphite and raw earths as global growth resurges and the world turns away from fossil fuels n the journey towards renewable energy. Investment house Ausbil goes further and has predicted another mining boom, driven by demand for Australian resources, especially battery making materials. ""We are at the early stages of a resources super-cycle linked to a stimulus-led global demand recovery,"" global resources portfolio managers James Stewart and Luke Smith wrote. ""The interrelated themes of electric vehicles, battery storage and renewable energy, and a general trend towards electrification, is driving demand which previously has not existed.' ANZ said China's transition to a low-carbon economy ""will start reshaping commodities in 2021"" with the Communist Party's upcoming economic blueprint, the 14th Five Year Plan, to focus on technological innovation and environmentally sustainability. However, ANZ warned that rising geopolitical tensions could rock commodity prices, including how the incoming Biden administration in the United States handles Iran and the trade dispute with China.

275,ASX inches higher as US trade sees Tesla briefly overtake Facebook,markets,"  ASX200 closes higher as US trade sees Tesla briefly overtake Facebook The ASX has ended its first week of trade for 2021 in positive territory. At the close, the benchmark ASX200 had risen by 0.6 per cent and the All Ords by 0.7 per cent. Some of the best-performing stocks were Afterpay (+6.6pc), Zip Co (+6.3pc), JB Hi-Fi (+5pc) and Bingo Industries (+8.7pc). On the flip side, gold miners suffered with Silver Lake Resources (-3.6pc), Ramelius Resources (3.1-pc) and Perseus Mining (-2.6pc) all slipping. The Australian dollar is making 77.59 US cents. Brent crude was up 0.4 per cent to $US54.50 a barrel and spot gold was worth $US1,918 an ounce. The ASX200 closed 1.8 per cent higher on Thursday on news that the US Congress was going to be under Democratic control and that the Australian Government will vaccinate people for COVID-19 earlier than expected. The European and US stock markets are both in the green on Thursday (local time) trade despite the turmoil in the US Capitol. The Nasdaq was slipping on the news yesterday that Democrats would control the Congress, given its threats of more regulation of Silicon Valley. The Dow Jones gained 0.8 per cent to 31,061 points and the S&P500 rose 1.6 per cent to 3,808 points. However, the Nasdaq is in positive territory during Thursday trade (+2.4pc) with a boost from Tesla's shares. Shares of the electric car maker surged to a record high with its stock market value briefly exceeding Facebook's for the first time. The stock for the company led by Elon Musk briefly hit US$811.61 during the session, putting its market capitalisation at US$769 billion ($991.3 billion) The stock has since slipped slightly off that high, bringing it back down to under Facebook's value. The stock is up more than 700 per cent in the past 12 months. That makes the California car maker the most valuable auto company in the world, by far, despite production that is a fraction of rivals such as Toyota, Volkswagen and General Motors. Meanwhile, Bloomberg News has also published a story that claims Mr Musk has now become the world's richest man, overtaking the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos. Including Thursday's gains in Tesla shares, Mr Musk had a net worth of more than US$188.5 billion, which is US$1.5 billion more than Bezos, the report claimed. The Forbes Billionaires List, however, said Mr Musk still trails Amazon's Bezos by $7.8 billion. Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange said on Wednesday it will delist three Chinese telecom companies, confirming its latest U-turn on the matter. Last week, it announced it would delist the shares of China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicorn amid a potential US crackdown on firms said to be linked to China's military. Then, again, earlier this week, it announced it will no longer delist them. Now it has flipped on the subject, again. That makes the latest move the third time in less than a week the Big Board has ruled on the issue. The flip-flopping highlights the confusion over which companies were included in an executive order issued by outgoing President Donald Trump in November barring US persons from investing in publicly traded companies Washington deems to be tied to the Chinese military. It also coincides with escalating tensions within Washington on China policy in the final days of the Trump administration.

276,analysis: The US Capitol was stormed but markets didn't bat an eyelid,markets,"  On the day the US Capitol building was stormed by a mob, Wall Street and Asian markets continued going up The financial markets have their own message for the mob: you achieved nothing. As chaotic scenes of protestors storming the US Congress in Washington DC were beamed all over the world, Wall Street was surging to an all-time high. But it wasn't just Wall Street, Asian stock markets rallied as did Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index. And it wasn't just stock markets flexing their muscles. The US 10-Year Treasury Yield hit one per cent for the first time since March. Interest rates rise when financial markets start to see better economic times ahead. Financial markets are looking through the flash bomb smoke on Capitol Hill and the smashed windows of Congress, and actually seeing less political uncertainty and more economic stimulus. Visit our US Politics page for all the latest news on Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Financial markets were only interested in one event this week: the Georgia runoff elections. When it became clear it was tilting towards the Democrats, stock market buyers moved in and bonds were sold off. They don't. Indeed, financial markets are as bipartisan as institutions come. They're only interested in two things: which party will offer the most stimulus and what is the easiest passage to that stimulus? What we're looking at now (a Democrat-controlled Congress) is what was considered back in October and November of last year as being the 'best case scenario'. Yes, Joe Biden promised to raise taxes and tighten regulations, especially around the tech sector, but financial markets can price this in. In fact, the hit to company earnings is quite quantifiable according to Ed Keon, chief market strategist chief market strategist at QMA. ""The negative of higher taxes, the market is concluding would be offset by infrastructure spending and a more aggressive action on the pandemic and a change of tone that might not be 100 per cent positive for stocks but the market concluded it was positive,"" he told CNBC. A Biden Administration is offering the potential for a further $800 billion in economic stimulus and the markets, especially the stock market, believe that will put more money into Americans' pockets, and, ultimately, will boost company valuations and stock prices. In the years leading up to last November's US election, investors have sought reassurance that interest rates were going to stay low. That, along with Trump's tax cuts, and less corporate regulation pushed the US stock market to a phenomenal decades-long rally. Coronavirus threw a spanner in the works. Economy-wide shutdowns meant commerce and business ground to a halt and as a result the share market crashed. However, with policy stimulus from both the US Federal Reserve and the Government, markets found their foot again and pushed higher. The US election created the next inflection point for the markets. A few weeks before election day, derivative products (financial products that investors buy to protect themselves from wild stock market swings) became more in demand than ever before. What markets feared most was a contested election that depended on a Supreme Court ruling. The anxiety around this was enormous. Why? Well, when you've got a nation and an economy on its knees, hit by COVID-19, an economic stimulus package and a big one at that, became vital. If the stimulus package became hostage to a contested election, the potential for economic collapse became real. The solution? A clear win for either Trump or Biden. Financial markets began to favour Biden after Trump appeared too unhinged in the first presidential debate. Markets were also hoping for clearer, more stable policy, and better trade relations with China. The Democrats' success in Georgia secures what the markets have been hoping for. The US economy is the world's biggest. It also has the biggest debt market in the world. On Wednesday, US time, the 10-year US Treasury note yield topped 1 per cent for the first time since March. At market close, the benchmark rate was at 1.03 per cent. Yields move inversely to prices. As chaos was unfolding on Capitol Hill, the bond market was singing to the same hymn sheet as the stock market. Financial markets were saying: Biden will be confirmed president, he will manage coronavirus based on scientific advice and, in the meantime, will offer more financial support to American families and businesses. This lays the foundation, financial markets believe, for sustainable economic growth. The economy isn't out of the woods yet but the markets aren't looking at tomorrow or the next day, they're looking six months from now — and they see better times ahead. The Australian stock market has a way to go to get back to its February highs, but it too has shrugged off events in Washington. Higher commodities prices, especially iron ore, are driving both stocks and the Australian dollar higher. There's also a strong belief that if a vaccine rollout begins in February, business and consumer confidence may rebound quicker than we dared hope. With evidence that the unemployment rate may come down faster than expected, especially given the rebound in ANZ Job Ads revealed earlier this week, conditions for economic improvement are building. Tomorrow is another day Senior members of Congress sent a message to the mob from the floor of the House not long after the Capitol was secured. Vice-President Pence said, ""To those who wreaked havoc in our Capitol today: you did not win."" But the markets and the trillions of dollars tied up in them, also sent a message: ""We're banking on Biden"". You obviously can't rule out further financial market gyrations and other threats to the economy may emerge but for now, financial markets have sent a clear message about how they view the stability of the world's largest democracy.

277,"US Congress result, oil prices and COVID vaccine news pushes ASX into positive territory",markets,"  US Congress result, COVID-19 vaccine rollout push ASX higher as Australian dollar continues rally A rally on Wall Street, surging oil prices and news Australians could receive the COVID-19 vaccination as early as February, saw local shares trade up on Thursday. The ASX200 closed 1.8 per cent higher to 6,727 points. The All Ords rose by a similar margin to 6,995 points. It follows several days of the market closing down as COVID-19 cases dampened optimism in Australia. Australian shares performed solidly on Thursday after the Democrats won two Senate seats in Georgia and the Australian Government announced it would begin vaccinating people against coronavirus from next month. Previously, the Government planned to start rolling out vaccines in March. Oil stocks rose after the price of the commodity jumped yesterday on news Saudi Arabia would restrict its supply. Rio Tinto jumped 8.9 per cent to $126 and PNG-focused Oil Search was up 6.9 per cent — its best day of trade in more than 10 months. BHP was also up 6.3 per cent. Overall, Australian energy stocks rose 4.5 per cent to their highest since November 25. Some of the stocks trading down include gold miners Silver Lake (-4.8pc) and Westgold Resources (-3.3pc). Gold stocks had been holding up the market earlier this week but now the spot price has been wavering off its high. Other downers include Afterpay (-4.5pc), Charter Hall (-5.1pc) and Xero (-5.2pc). The Australian dollar continued to rise during the day to 77.96 US cents. Some analysts have even been predicting the dollar could rise above 80 US cents again, as China demands Australian iron ore. The Australian share market is also taking a positive lead from the US. The Democrats have won the balance of power of the US Congress, although the situation is still fraught with Congress being evacuated as protestors storm the Capitol building. Ten-year US Treasury yields topped 1 per cent for the first time since March on that news. A Democratic-controlled Senate could bring about more fiscal stimulus spending, boosting some investor's positivity. The only main index that did not end Wednesday (US time) trade in positive territory on the news was the tech-laden Nasdaq. There have been concerns by Silicon Valley about increased regulatory scrutiny of technology mega-caps if the Democrats gain control of the Senate. ""What investors are trying to figure out is how quickly the Democrats would be able to introduce their tax agenda if they take control of the Senate,"" said US analyst Quincy Krosby. ""And would they be more likely to act on regulation on big tech?"" Meanwhile, European stocks jumped after a second COVID-19 vaccine won regulatory approval in the region. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.4 per cent to its highest level since late February 2020. While the UK's FTSE 100 rose 3.5 per cent and Germany's DAX gained 1.8 per cent. The Moderna vaccine is seen as a big boost for European hopes of containing the coronavirus. Oil majors BP, Royal Dutch Shell, and Total also rose almost 6.5 per cent as crude prices hit their highest since February 2020. That comes after Saudi Arabia's pledge to cut output in a meeting with allied producers at OPEC.

279,Tech stocks slip on fears Georgia's Senate race could tighten regulations,markets,"  ASX 200 closes lower with tech stocks falling over fears Democrats could tighten regulations The Australian share market has closed lower as the tech sector took a hit, but oil stocks were among the few strong performers off the back of a surprise announcement by OPEC. The ASX 200 and All Ordinaries were both down by 1 per cent at the close to 6,607 and 6,881 points, respectively. Both the benchmark and the All Ords broke even yesterday. The market has been buoyed by gold stocks, which were Tuesday's top performers in Australia. The price of the reliable commodity has been steadily rising since December. The spot price was up 0.5 per cent to US$1,956 early Wednesday. The Australian dollar surged (+1.4pc) to 77.70 US cents. Some analysts have even been predicting the dollar could rise above 80 US cents again, as China demands Australian iron ore. Oil prices are also rising, with a surge of almost 5 per cent. That is on news that Saudi Arabia will make voluntary cuts to its oil output, to try to keep supply steady as demand possibly decreases. Saudi Arabia said it will make additional, voluntary oil output cuts of 1 million barrels per day in February and March. The cuts are part of a deal to persuade most OPEC producers to hold output steady amid concerns that new coronavirus lockdowns will hit demand. Oil stocks were the best performers on the ASX 200 by the end of Wednesday trading. Oil Search is up 5.7 per cent, Beach Energy has gained 3 per cent, and Woodside is up 1.7 per cent. Other energy stocks including IGO, Santos and Worley are also up. Director of research at stock analyst firm Kalkine, Hina Chowdhary, said it was clear the oil price rise internationally was a plus for ASX players. ""Sustainability of high levels needs to be monitored though,"" she said. ""The pessimism in the oil space might get some reversal now, hence stocks with stable aspects and quality business might bring a good change in the space with prices going in favour this year to an extent. ""Volatility can be and is always expected, as we have to consider production scenario with demand and supply bracket."" Australian technology stocks fell as much as 3.5 per cent to their lowest in more than three weeks, with industry heavyweight Afterpay being the biggest drag amid weakness in US tech futures. The sub-index's biggest firm dropped 4.5 per cent and Xero slipped 3.1 per cent to lead losses. While US Democrats and Republicans are neck-and-neck in the race for Georgia's Senate, tech-heavy Nasdaq futures dropped 1 per cent on fears a Democratic win could lead to tighter regulations on big tech firms. The US stock market traded up on its second day of trade for 2021, with gains of 0.9 per cent in all three of its main benchmarks. Energy stocks jumped 4.5 per cent on the back of higher oil prices. But trade was choppy, as investors took advantage of the previous session's slump to buy them back, ahead of the outcome of the Senate runoff elections in Georgia. The Georgia election will determine the balance of power in Washington DC. Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange announced it will no longer delist three Chinese telecom giants. It made that announcement about China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicorn only last week amid deepening confusion over a US crackdown on firms said to be linked to China's military. The U-turn comes in the waning days of the Trump administration and against a backdrop of tension within Washington on China policy. European stocks closed their Tuesday trade largely in the red, as London goes into another COVID lockdown. More than 75,500 people have now died of the virus in the UK. However, UK's FTSE 100 rose 0.6 per cent due to a boost by oil majors Royal Dutch Shell and BP, as oil prices surged.

280,Australian shares close flat as energy regulator recommends caps on renewables,markets,"  ASX 200 trading closing flat as regulator publishes scathing assessment of energy sector The Australian share market has come off its new year high, as the nation and the US both grapple with what 2021 could really bring. The ASX200 closed 0.03 per cent lower, finishing at 6,681 points and the All Ordinaries rose 0.03 per cent to 6,955 points. The ASX finished its first day of trade for 2021 yesterday on a positive note, enjoying its best day of trade since November 24. But the market dropped on the back of US markets trading down on their first session of the year. Education and energy led the falls, however, gold stocks, including Silver Lake Resources (+7.3pc) and Newcrest Mining (+4.3pc), are holding it up. The price of spot gold is currently slightly higher at US$1,939 an ounce. Some of the downers including shopping centre owner Unibail-Rodamco Westfield (-4pc), Zip Co (-4.8pc) and EML Payments (-4pc). Qantas Airways slipped 1.4 per cent earlier despite the airline opening up international flights to the US and UK on July 1. The local currency is down 0.5 per cent to 77.01 US cents. Energy stocks finished in the red after a report from the energy regulator, the Energy Security Board, suggested capping the number of new renewable energy connections to reduce the risk of congesting the network. The overhaul of the power grid is needed to improve stability as the fast uptake of renewable energy generation risks overburdening a transmission system originally built for more reliable but dirtier coal-generated energy. When there is too much energy flooding the grid in the middle of a sunny day, for example, it can cause disturbances in the system that can lead to transformers tripping off to protect themselves from being damaged, causing local blackouts. The report said connection caps on ""renewable energy zones"" with tender processes would help the orderly introduction of new generators, and the improved stability would reduce uncertainty for investors and benefit customers in the long run. Origin Energy fell 0.8 per cent, Whitehaven Coal was down 0.9 per cent and Oil Search tanked 2.4 per cent. Nearly two-thirds of coal-fired capacity in the National Electricity Market (NEM), one of the world's largest interconnected electricity systems, is due to close by 2040. The NEM serves most of Australia. Australia faces the complex challenge of managing the rise of weather-dependent renewables and flexible power sources on its power grid as coal plants shut, while households increasingly turn to roof-top solar energy, batteries and electric vehicles. ""The record levels of intermittent generation along with major thermal generator closures demands a clear focus on reliability and investment in reliable generation,"" said Energy Minister Angus Taylor. ""The NEM needs to adapt to address risks to reliability, security and affordability … we need long-term signals for private sector investment in reliable generation and storage, to replace existing generators with like for like capacity."" The Federal Government is already backing some new grid links and power projects and building the Snowy 2.0 hydro project, but warned against too much new transmission capacity. The Government previously said gas, not solar or wind projects, would be key to the country's transition towards cleaner energy generation. Other proposals in the report include changing the way power reserves are managed, improving the accuracy of net demand forecasts, and publishing more market data. US markets traded down on their first session of the new year. The Dow touched a record high earlier in the session along with the S&P 500, but was dragged down by a more than 4 per cent fall in shares in the aeroplane maker Boeing, after Bernstein cut its rating to ""underperform"". That comes after issues with its plane, the MAX787, which the ratings agency said could significantly hurt its cash flow. All three main indexes dropped to two-week lows from record highs, fuelled by monetary stimulus and the start of vaccine rollouts. The fate of US president-elect Joe Biden's agenda, meanwhile, including rewriting the tax code, boosting stimulus and infrastructure spending, hinges firmly on Tuesday's twin Senate races in the battleground state of Georgia that will determine control of the chamber. ""Investors are feeling a bit nervous on the first trading day of the new year and I think this is a confluence of factors,"" Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest, said. She cited the rise in COVID-19 cases, the new virus variant that has spread around the world, and the Georgia Senate race. ""Investors are at a point where they want to take breather while they assess all the different things coming in the new year,"" Ms Bell said. On the data front, US manufacturing activity picked up at its briskest pace in more than six years in December, a survey showed on Monday. Some investors are cautious about the pace of economic growth as US jobless claims remain stubbornly high, while a new round of pandemic-related restrictions last month and a new variant of coronavirus have cast a shadow on the outlook. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also fell despite Tesla rallying. Its shares extended a meteoric rally to scale a record high, after the electric-car maker reported better-than-expected vehicle deliveries in 2020. Meanwhile, European shares rallied in the first trading session of the year, as a landmark Brexit trade deal and coronavirus vaccination campaigns across the continent bolstered expectations of a strong economic rebound. The pan-regional STOXX 600 gained 0.7 per cent to touch fresh February 2020 highs. Germany-listed shares in the world's biggest holiday company TUI rose 2.7 per cent after its chief executive told a newspaper that he expects ""a largely normal summer"" this year. Germany's DAX was up marginally (+0.1pc) after a long weekend to trade below all-time highs, while France's CAC 40 added 0.7 per cent. Britain began vaccinating its population with the COVID-19 shot developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca on Monday. London's blue-chip index FTSE gained 1.7 per cent in its first day of trading with Britain outside the European Union's orbit. While the hard-fought trade Brexit deal agreed late December set rules for industries such as fishing and agriculture, it did not cover Britain's much larger finance sector, meaning automatic access to the EU's financial markets came to an end on Dec. 31.

282,Australian shares close higher as Wesfarmers predicts big spending on work-from-home supplies,markets,"  Australian shares have closed higher slightly despite the continued spread of COVID-19 in NSW and Victoria. The ASX 200 and All Ordinaries both closed 1.4 per cent higher on Monday to 6,684 and 6,953 points, respectively. The rise was unexpected after the number of cases of coronavirus linked to Sydney's northern beaches outbreak continued to grow and Victoria implemented border restrictions with NSW late last week. Victoria recorded three new locally acquired cases of COVID-19 on Monday, and NSW recorded two, as residents of Greater Sydney now face $200 fines for not wearing a face masks in indoor venues. Unsurprisingly, travel and casino stocks dipped, including Corporate Travel Management (-2.1pc), SkyCity Entertainment (-1.2pc), New Zealand's Auckland International Airport (-1.9pc) and Flight Centre dropping early before regaining ground (+1pc). Link Administrative Holdings led the bottom movers, tanking 13.5 per cent after it said SS&C Technology Holdings had withdrawn its takeover bid. The top movers were Zip Co (+5.6pc), Silver Lake Resources (+6.7pc), and Saracen Mineral Holdings (+6.1pc). The big four banks have all risen between 1 and 2 per cent and the Australian dollar dropped to 76.92 US cents. The tech and consumer staples sectors recorded the strongest start to trading with buy now, pay later company Afterpay up 0.85 per cent to $119 and Woolworths up 1.8 per cent. Wesfarmers also jumped as much as 2.3 per cent, anticipating an increased spending on working-from-home supplies. Australia's gold sub-index has risen almost 3 per cent with spot gold jumping 0.7 per cent to $1,911.90 an ounce. Dacian Gold was the biggest gainers in the sub-index, climbing as much as 12.2 per cent and Evolution Mining, Newcrest Mining and Northern Star Resources were up between 3 and 5 per cent. The latest data from CoreLogic shows house prices in Australia rose by 1 per cent in December and 3 per cent in 2020 with regional Australian prices rising far above capital cities. The median Australian capital city house price in December was $696,413 and $574,388 for units. Regional prices grew almost 7 per cent compared to 2 per cent growth for capital cities last month. The Sydney eastern suburbs (-1pc) and Far West and Orana region of NSW (-0.4pc) were the only two regions to record falls in home prices in December. Craig James, chief economist at CommSec, said CoreLogic's data showed home prices and manufacturing activity were exhibiting signs of economic strength rather than weakness. ""Home prices are rising across the country. In fact, home prices only fell in two of the 88 regions in the past month. And over the past year, all but 12 regions posted gains in home prices,"" he said. ""Many companies reported backlogs of work had risen due to a short-term inability to expand production capacity sufficiently to meet the recent surge in demand."" Home prices were higher than a year ago in seven of the eight capital cities in December: Investors are cautiously watching runoff elections in Georgia for two US senate seats on Tuesday (local time) that will determine which party controls the Senate. If the Republicans win one or both, they will retain a slim majority in the chamber and can block president-elect Joe Biden's legislative goals and judicial nominees. ""If Democrats win both races, vice-president-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote, giving the party unified control of the White House and Congress,"" analysts at CBA said. ""This would raise the likelihood a material US infrastructure spending package gets fast-tracked through Congress."" Minutes of the Federal Reserve's December meeting, due on Wednesday, should offer more detail on discussions about making their forward policy guidance more explicit and the chance of a further increase in asset buying this year. The data calendar includes a raft of manufacturing surveys across the globe, which will show how industry is coping with the spread of the coronavirus, and the closely watched ISM surveys of US factories and services. On Monday, Brent crude futures fell 8 cents to $51.72, while US crude eased 12 cents to $48.40 a barrel.

283,"analysis: Novice investors chasing IPO 'hot money', but the risks are huge",markets,"  Want to make some money in 2021? IPOs are luring investors, but the risks are huge After ""crashing"" in March this year, the Australian share market is booming once more. But within the stock market itself there is also a mini-boom occurring in initial public offerings, or IPOs. Financial planners say their clients, sick of earnings next to nothing on their bank deposits, are handing over their cash to buy up these new stocks. ""I'd say the majority [want to invest in IPOs],"" says James Gerrard, the founder of financialadvisor.com.au. ""Whether it be young or old, there is risk with IPOs, but with rising share markets and optimism going into 2021, clients of all ages are happy to roll the dice."" Companies looking to expand and to take advantage of investor interest are rushing to list, and so far this calendar year 115 companies have listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, up 25 per cent on last year. ""Our pipeline extended well into the third week of December when it normally is wrapping in the first,"" an ASX spokesperson said. ""It's definitely been some time since we have experienced so many listings in such a concentrated period."" The boom in IPOs is a global phenomenon. According to data provider Refinitiv, businesses raised almost $300 billion through flotations globally in 2020. In Australia, companies have raised $5.2 billion from investors. An initial public offering is when a private company applies to list on the stock exchange, so shares in it can be publicly traded. Record low interest rates are helping drive stocks higher. But investor sentiment is also being propped up by billions in government stimulus and promise of a coronavirus vaccine in 2021. Independent stock trader Danielle Ecuyer calls it ""hot money"". ""You get a lot of hot money coming in and, excuse the expression, but it's kind of like the pump and dump scenario,"" she says. ""And I think that's the most difficult part for new investors, to actually work out what's going to be a stayer, what's going to be a high-quality stock down the track."" But the actual process of signing up to be a founding shareholder of a company is a surprisingly straightforward task. Once you've filled out a prospectus, and send it to the company (to be added to the share registry) or your stockbroker, you can sit back and wait for the stock to hit the boards of the stock exchange. Millions of Australians will be taking an indirect pay cut from COVID-19, through their shareholdings and super funds, explains David Taylor. Once it hits the boards the stock price will either go up, down or remain the same. You can sell your holding on the day it lists (within minutes if you wish) or hold onto the stock for as long as it's on the boards. It is an opportunity to make a lot of cash quickly. Equally, says Gerrard, you can lose a lot of money in an instant too. ""So, for example, if that company that you bought IPOs for $2 per share, but the share market felt it was only worth $1, you could be down 50 per cent on the first day. It's a little bit for a venture into the unknown when you buy into an IPO."" And trader Ecuyer warns most amateur investors don't have the stomach for such risky trading activities, especially those who aren't following the market every minute of the day. For novice investors, working out whether or not a company's listing price is over or undervalued is the biggest challenge. That's because it's actually the job of professional investment banking analysts to do it. Companies who want to list on the exchange will ask an investment bank to underwrite their offer. That means the analysts at the bank have to crunch the numbers and determine what the company looking to list is worth. From there, the analysts work out a listing price. Many small companies list on the ASX for anything from 15 cents to $1.00. The COVID-19 economic crisis brought about record low interest rates and enormous amounts of policy stimulus. It's meant a once-in-a-generation stock market crash has given rise to an equally impressive bull market. But the level of interest in IPOs also speak to Australians' desire now for making large amounts of cash quickly. Any profit made on an IPO is taxable, but it is possible to make thousands of dollars in an afternoon, assuming you invest thousands. Some commentators are already predicting that the financial landscape in 2021 will be dominated by investors looking for double-digit investment returns in the hopes of generating wealth. The evidence suggests this is already well underway, and ordinary Australians are taking on risks they otherwise would not have dared.

284,"Market experts say ASX will rebound in 2021, thanks to COVID-19 vaccines",markets,"  Market experts say Australian shares will rebound in 2021, thanks to COVID-19 vaccines As that old saying goes, ""hindsight is 20/20"", and it certainly applies to the share market every year. Let's assume you a had a time machine, and travelled back to January 1 (last year) to buy shares as part of a retrospective ""get rich quick"" scheme. Certain stocks might have earned you a truckload of money if you sold them just before last night's New Years' Eve fireworks. These ""missed opportunities"" include Marley Spoon (+980pc), Temple & Webster (+307pc), Afterpay (+303pc) and Kogan (+150pc). All of them benefited from the pandemic-driven shift to online shopping. Given how much they rose, it’s unlikely those gains will be replicated this year. Millions of Australians will be taking an indirect pay cut from COVID-19, through their shareholdings and super funds, explains David Taylor. ABC News spoke with several market analysts about their thoughts on where the Australian market is headed. Even the least optimistic person was quite ""optimistic"", as they estimated the ASX 200 could lift by about 10 to 13 per cent this year. That's compared to the 1.5 per cent loss the benchmark index sustained in 2020. They based their assumptions on a COVID-19 vaccine being rolled out within months, the Government and Reserve Bank pumping more stimulus into the economy, and the hardest-hit sectors making a recovery. Here are some of their forecasts for the year ahead — but please remember to also do your own research, and obtain independent financial advice. ""I think that the big story in the year ahead is a lot of the winners from 2020, or more from the pandemic at least, won't do as well as we go into economic recovery. ""I think the environment we're coming into is the one where cyclical stocks will be the star performers — banks, industrials, mining companies, energy companies. ""And stocks which at least initially benefited from the pandemic and lockdowns, such as healthcare and IT stocks will probably take a bit of a backseat."" ""I think our market's strength will be led for the first part of the year by bank and energy stocks. ""Bank stocks still have the capacity to climb as the local economy recovers. ""The reopening of the global economy ought to lift energy demand and benefit what's generally been an underperforming sector for most of this year."" ""I am hopeful of a recovery in the banking sector provided bad debts remain subdued, NIM [net interest margins] remain stable and loan growth shows signs of improvement. ""Energy should also outperform if global economies reopen and demand for oil and gas improve."" NAB, Westpac, Santos, Woodside Petroleum, Telstra and CIMIC Group were some of the stocks Mr Sidney said he would watch closely — given they are ""blue chip"" stocks which suffered heavy falls last year. ""Although the rising Australian dollar is a headwind to our economic recovery and those companies that earn US dollars, I think the quality healthcare shares, such as CSL, Cochlear and Ramsay will benefit from the rollout of the vaccines. ""I think shares exposed to the Australian housing market will do well, including Australian Finance Group and Liberty Finance. ""I remain wary about travel and shares related to international tourism, as I think the virus will continue to be an obstacle to any return to normal, in spite of the vaccine rollouts. ""I would buy Mineral Resources and Fortescue Metals on a pullback in the iron ore price and weakness. There will be some good dividends from the iron ore plays."" Mr Weston is optimistic about cyclical sectors, like energy and materials, as ""inflationary pressures should become more of a consideration"" as the year progresses. ""Central bank debasement will remain a continued theme, and if the US dollar continues to trend weaker then it limits global central banks to do anything other than stay in lock-step with the Federal Reserve,"" he said. ""This leads to gold miners as a hedge against the madness in central banking regimes. ""With dividend income improving, banks should work fairly well in 2021 and should offer benchmark returns. ""With the Aussie economy growing closer to 4 per cent in 2021 we should have greater confidence to hold exposures in this space."" Mr Pedersen is expecting banking stocks to recover as their ""dividend growth rates are looking very attractive"". ""Dividends will start going back to where they were in 2019, if we take long-term view — up to 2024,"" he said. ""Iron ore miners have been phenomenally strong lately — their free cashflow is ridiculously high. ""I'd continue owning iron ore companies until global supply starts increasing to the point where there is more supply than demand … probably towards the end of 2021."" ""Tech is expensive. However, in a world where growth is harder to come by, they will hold their value. I'm a believer of buy now, pay later, so we like Afterpay. ""In the next 12 months, we expect it to outperform, combined with some beaten-down sectors."" Ms Liu is also expecting property trust shares to recover this year as ""foot traffic will return"" to shopping centres. She was also optimistic about private hospitals, including Ramsay Healthcare, and ""premium assets"" like Sydney Airport, which she expects to ""lead the returns over the next 12 months"".

285,ASX closes lower as Victoria closes its border to NSW amid growing COVID-19 outbreak,markets,"  Australian share market closes lower as fears rise over spread of NSW coronavirus outbreak into Victoria The Australian stock market has closed lower after the Victorian Government announced a border closure with NSW due to coronavirus. The ASX200 ended the year down 1.4 per cent to 6,587 and the All Ords dropped 1.3 per cent 6,850 points. Two more positive cases of coronavirus were recorded on Thursday afternoon, linked to the six other positive cases announced in the past 24 hours. It's believed the cases are linked to the outbreak in NSW. On Thursday afternoon, the Victorian Government announced new coronavirus restrictions limiting private home gatherings to 15 visitors and making mask use indoors mandatory. From midnight, Victoria will close its border to NSW. The border closure hit travel companies with Qantas closing 2.2 per cent lower to $4.85. Sydney Airport also dropped (-0.6pc) while Flight Centre ended the year as Australia's worst performer, falling 60 per cent to $15.9 over the year. Buy now, pay-later fintech Afterpay was the winner of 2020, surging 303 per cent to $118, followed by Kogan that grew 150.6 per cent to Gold miners rallied with Gold Road Resources up 3.9 per cent, Ramelius Resources up 3.7 per cent and Perseus Mining rising 2.9 per cent. Iron ore company Fortescue Metals dropped 2.3 per cent after an earlier rise. Bottom movers at the close were GUD Holding (-3.6pc), Flight Centre (-3.9pc), and property group Ingenia Communities Group (-3.9pc). Brent crude oil gained 0.2 per cent to $US51.18 a barrel while iron ore dropped almost 2 per cent to $US159.85 a tonne. US stocks rose to just below record levels after US investors bet on a strong economic recovery in 2021 on the back of COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and hopes for more fiscal support. Near-term expectations of bigger stimulus checks dimmed after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked a quick vote to back President Donald Trump's call to increase COVID-19 relief checks. Mr McConnell then introduced a bill that tied the increased $US2,000 stimulus checks with the removal of protections for social media companies and a study on election security. ""It will be hard to get something passed with a lame duck Congress — let the calendar roll over and see what happens there,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. ""It seems like McConnell is just trying to play kick the can until we get a new Congress in place."" Optimism over vaccine rollouts was boosted after Britain approved the emergency use of AstraZeneca and Oxford University's COVID-19 vaccine, which will start being administered on Monday. That was tempered somewhat by the first known US case of a highly infectious coronavirus variant discovered in Britain that is now detected in Colorado. ""At some point we are going to start to have volatility again that is related to COVID; this is not a story that is going away in the first six months of 2021,"" Mr Kinahan said. The Dow Jones rose 67.6 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 30,403.3. The S&P 500 gained 4.6 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 3,731.7 and the Nasdaq 26 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 12,876.2. The S&P 500 index is up nearly 16 per cent on the year, after trillions of dollar in fiscal and monetary stimulus and progress in developing vaccines helped the benchmark index bounce back more than 65 per cent from its March 23 closing low. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which was the first among Wall Street's main indexes to turn positive for the year, is also set for its best yearly performance since 2009, with the majority of gains led by Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet.

286,"Australian shares close lower, Afterpay falls after months of record-breaking gains",markets,"  Australia's stock market has closed lower a day after investors looked to Washington for signs that an enhanced stimulus package would pass a Senate vote. The All Ordinaries and the ASX200 both dropped 0.3 per cent by the close to 6,942 points and 6,682 points, respectively. The big four banks followed suit with ANZ down 0.4 per cent, Commonwealth Bank down 0.5 per cent, NAB 0.4 per cent and Westpac flat. The Australian dollar was up to 76.11 US cents. Crude oil gained ground (+0.5pc to $US51.13 a barrel), but iron ore dropped 0.5 per cent to $US163.02 a tonne. At the close local time, the Dow Jones and S&P500 were down 0.2 per cent and the Nasdaq slipped by 0.4 per cent. Back home, the energy sector made a comeback, up 0.5 per cent, with Beach Energy gaining 2.2 per cent despite announcing on Tuesday it had abandoned its Ironbark 1 joint venture with BP. Kogan also gained 1.9 per cent to $19.30. Recycling company Sims Metal Management held steady throughout trading, closing 2.5 per cent higher. However, Afterpay dropped 3.7 per cent to $117.6 after a year of record-breaking gains. Growthpoint Properties fell 4.3 per cent after the company announced Deborah Page as a new board member. Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint, said while the original stimulus plan ""is baked in"", there remained questions over whether bigger individual checks of US$2,000 would pass the Senate. ""It may mean that it's time to put 2020 in the review mirror and take some money off the table. It's been a long year and there's a lot of tired investors out there."" The House of Representatives had approved a bill on Monday local time proposing to increase the size of stimulus cheques from $US600 to $US2,000, sending the measure to the Republican-controlled Senate. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday blocked an effort to approve the larger cheques, blocking calls from Democrats for a stand-alone vote on the payments sought by President Trump but opposed by most Republicans. European stocks extended their end-of-year rally to close at a 10-month high in anticipation of fresh stimulus and as the European Union vaccination program got under way. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.76 per cent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.29 per cent. Emerging market stocks rose 1.13 per cent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.09 per cent higher, while Japan's Nikkei rose 2.66 per cent.

287,ASX closes high on the back of US trillion-dollar COVID-19 relief bill,markets,"  Australia's share market has closed more than half a per cent higher on the back of the United States passing its long-awaited stimulus bill to help the country's economic recovery from COVID-19. The ASX200 and the All Ords were both up roughly 0.6 per cent to 6,700 points and 6,962 points, respectively. Afterpay continued its climb, gaining 5.3 per cent to another record high of $122, and milk company A2 remained high throughout trading (+5.8pc). All of Wall Street's main indexes touched record levels following US President Donald Trump's signing of a $US2.3 trillion ($3.02 trillion) pandemic aid bill. The Dow Jones closed 204 points higher (+0.7pc) to 30,403. The S&P500 was up 0.9 per cent to 3,735 points and the Nasdaq gained 0.7 per cent to 12,899. The Australian dollar edged up to 75.95 US cents. Omni Bridgeway has bounced back after taking a hit last week when a final report into class actions was tabled in Parliament. The joint committee's report into litigation funding and regulation of class actions made 31 recommendations, including legislative changes to court proceedings aimed at ensuring class action members had access to fair and equitable justice. It led to Omni shares falling 4.3 per cent, but they rose on Tuesday by 6.2 per cent to $4.12. Beach Energy fell 4.3 per cent after it abandoned its Ironbark exploration well in Western Australia when no significant hydrocarbon shows were found. International education organisation IDP Education, which offers student placement in Australia, dropped 2.4 per cent, and AusNet Services was down 1.4 per cent. In a sudden reversal on Sunday (local time), Mr Trump backed down from his threat to block the bill, restoring unemployment benefits to millions of Americans and averting a federal government shutdown. The fiscal package increased optimism on Wall Street that the country could see an economic recovery. ""Stocks are riding the coattails of the additional stimulus program and that is for good reason,"" Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management, said. ""You've still got monetary and fiscal stimulus that is in motion and that clearly provides economic stability, medical progress for COVID-19 continues to evolve and that will unfold at a more accelerated rate now as you get into the new year and importantly, the macro environment is favourable for stocks."" Stocks battered by coronavirus lockdowns, such as airlines and cruise lines, advanced. The S&P 1500 airlines index added 1.5 per cent as carriers are set to receive $US15 billion in additional payroll assistance under the new government aid. Cruise operators Royal Caribbean Cruises, Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Line each rose by at least 4 per cent. On a sector basis, gains were led by communication services, consumer discretionary and tech as each posted gains of more than 1 per cent. After a sharp recovery from a coronavirus crash in March, the S&P 500 is on track to rise more than 15 per cent this year on the back of a loose monetary policy, high liquidity and a COVID-19 vaccine program. Despite the generally favourable conditions for equities, worries over a resurgence in coronavirus cases, upcoming US Senate runoffs in Georgia and stretched valuations could become headwinds. The forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P is currently about 22.2, well above its long-term average of 15.3. Trading volumes are expected to be thin in the final week of the year that has historically been a seasonally strong period for equities. Adding to a global appetite for risk, Britain and the European Union clinched a lean post-Brexit trade deal on Thursday, while a mass COVID-19 vaccination drive in Europe was launched over the weekend.

288,Take a look back at a year that rocked markets and the global economy,markets," Updated 
    
      December 28, 2020 10:31:26 The health crisis caused by COVID-19 was a once-in-a-century event, and so too was the economic fallout. Millions of jobs were lost and countless businesses went into hibernation, with many not making it out the other side. Equity markets hit record highs and posted historic plunges, with volatility surpassing the peak of the global financial crisis. Interest rates were slashed, trillions of dollars were loaded onto central bank balance sheets and governments pumped cash at an unprecedented rate, causing debt and deficits to soar. Take a look back at the key events of 2020, what they cost and how they've shaped the world we live in.  When Australia rings in 2020, large swathes of the country are on fire. Hundreds of towns along the east of the country are either burning, blocked off, or under threat. The prolonged bushfire emergency costs lives and homes and devastates businesses. Tourist towns are evacuated, like at Lake Conjola on the New South Wales south coast, where people drive into the water to shelter from the flames. Retailers warn of a hit to their bottom line as shops close and the tourism sector is cut off. The Prime Minister announces a $2 billion rescue package, establishing the National Bushfire Recovery Agency to help rebuild communities and livelihoods. ""It's a long road ahead and we will be with these communities every step of the way as they rebuild,"" Scott Morrison says.  Internationally, tensions rise as missiles hit US military bases in Iraq, after Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani is killed in a US airstrike.  The Pentagon says at least a dozen ballistic missiles were fired from Iran. Airlines, including Qantas, redirect flights to avoid airspace over Iran and Iraq, adding to their operating costs. Oil prices initially jump, before receding as investors bet on no further escalation. But the conflict in the Middle East isn't the biggest international catastrophe the world will face in 2020. A small but deadly threat is starting to spread.  Australia records its first case of coronavirus, but it's still viewed largely as a China problem. A ban on tour groups leaving China hurts the Australian tourism sector, already reeling from the black summer of bushfires. Regions that lost international tourism because of the fire and smoke are concerned about the loss of business from China. ""For many businesses, I think this is already a crisis situation,"" Margy Osmond from the Transport & Tourism Forum tells The Business. The World Health Organisation names the strain of coronavirus spreading throughout the world 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2' — SARS-CoV-2. The disease is COVID-19.  Despite China's bank stepping in to keep its financial markets functioning, providing liquidity and slashing interest rates, global markets seem oblivious to the looming virus disaster. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq post new closing highs, while in Australia, the All Ordinaries hits a new record, surpassing its high of late January. Australian companies report their results, with coronavirus clouding forecasts, but it's a mood of caution rather than panic. ""Coronavirus at this point does create a bit of uncertainty about the outlook, but so far the impact on our markets has been muted,"" BHP chief executive officer Mike Henry tells The Business. Then-Virgin Australia boss Paul Scurrah says: ""As a predominantly domestic airline, with a feed of international routes, we can pivot our focus into the domestic market."" What goes up inevitably comes down, and a week after their record highs, markets crash, posting their worst week since the global financial crisis. It's not just equity markets that plunge — oil prices fall even further, with West Texas below $US45 a barrel, on fears the spread of the virus will dry up demand. Bond prices soar and yields sink, as investors flock to safe-haven assets amid the stock market rout.   The Reserve Bank of Australia takes the knife to interest rates, cutting the official cash rate from 0.75 per cent to 0.5 per cent. ""The coronavirus outbreak overseas is having a significant effect on the Australian economy at present, particularly in the education and travel sectors,"" RBA governor Philip Lowe writes in his post-meeting statement. He adds, the RBA is ready to do more if the virus outbreak worsens. ANU economics professor and former RBA board member Warwick McKibbin and PhD student Roshen Fernando warn GDP could fall as much as 7.9 per cent in the most severe outbreak. And they predict that even a less dire scenario will clip 2 percentage points off GDP in 2020.  The falls across equity markets intensify, triggering a circuit breaker, a 15-minute trading halt, on Wall Street — the first since 1997. The US Securities and Exchange Commission mandated the creation of circuit breakers to prevent a repeat of the 1987 market crash, when almost a quarter of the value of the entire Dow Jones was wiped off in one day. A circuit breaker is triggered if the S&P 500 index falls more than 7 per cent before 3:25pm New York time. The economic impacts of coronavirus are starting to be felt in Australia, as some industries feel the early brunt. The Government announces a $17.6 billion economic plan, supporting up to 6.5 million people and 3.5 million businesses. Welfare recipients get a one-off payment of $750. The instant asset write-off threshold for businesses is increased from $30,000 to $150,000 and expanded to include businesses with turnover up to $500 million. The World Health Organization declares COVID-19 is a pandemic.  Global markets experience the biggest falls since the 1987 stock market crash. Australia posts its worst session on the ASX 200 on record, a 9.7 per cent plunge. On Wall Street the Dow Jones drops 12.9 per cent, the S&P 500 loses 12 per cent and the Nasdaq falls 12.3 per cent. It's the third worst day in the Dow Jones' history, after the 22.6 per cent crash of 1987 and 13.5 per cent fall in 1929 that signalled the start of the Great Depression. Wall Street ceases trading as the fourth circuit breaker in eight trading days is triggered. The Prime Minister announces restrictions to limit the spread of COVID-19, including caps on the number of people gathering in one area, domestic travel is limited to essential only and international travel is banned. The impact is immediate.  The Reserve Bank holds an emergency meeting and cuts the cash rate cut for the second time in 16 days, to 0.25 per cent, and for the first time announces it'll buy bonds. The Australian dollar falls to an 18-year low — it's worth 55 US cents. Qantas takes drastic action, standing down 20,000 employees and grounding more than 150 aircraft. Its $201 million shareholder dividend payment is deferred. ""With the huge drop in revenue we're facing, we have to make difficult decisions to guarantee the future of the national carrier,"" Qantas chief executive officer Alan Joyce says. In the UK, the Government steps to help businesses and workers. It gives grants to cover 80 per cent of a worker's salary, of up to 2,500 pounds a month, if a business keeps them on its books. ""We are telling cafes, pubs, bars and restaurants to close tonight, as soon as they reasonably can, and not to open tomorrow,"" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says.  Prime Minister Scott Morrison announces widespread restrictions and many businesses are shut down. Lines form outside Centrelink offices, as thousands become unemployed overnight. ""Australians who have lost their jobs, lost hours of work, businesses that have been forced to close their businesses. ""These are heartbreaking events in our nation's history,"" Mr Morrison says. In the US, after days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure, Congress passes a record-breaking $US2.2 trillion stimulus bill. President Donald Trump insists the country will reopen by Easter. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg unveils a $130 billion wage subsidy package — JobKeeper. The Government estimates 6 million workers will access the $1,500 a fortnight payment, equivalent to about 70 per cent of the minimum wage, via their employer. The Prime Minister says the JobKeeper payment brings the Government's total economic support to $320 billion, or 16.4 per cent of GDP. Childcare becomes free for about 1 million families, as the Government commits an estimated $1.6 billion to fund the radical, but temporary, overhaul. The sectors had been pleading for a bailout as parents pulled kids out of care. Families will also be able to use 20 extra absence days without giving up their place in a centre. The price of US crude oil turns negative for the first time in history. With countries in lockdown, factories, airlines and cars no longer need fuel and stockpiles have reached capacity. ""There's no available storage anymore so the price of the commodity is effectively worthless,"" Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Securities, observes.  The Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe addresses the nation. ""We are likely to experience the biggest contraction in national output and national income that we have witnessed since the 1930s. ""Whatever the timing of the recovery, when it does come, we should not be expecting that we will return quickly to business as usual,"" he says. ""Rather, the twin health and economic emergencies that we are experiencing now will cast a shadow over our economy for some time to come."" Bureau of Statistics data shows 780,000 jobs have been lost in just three weeks. One of Australia's major airlines, Virgin Australia, enters in administration and there is no Federal Government rescue. ""The Government was not going to bail out five large foreign shareholders with deep pockets, who, together, own 90 per cent of this airline,"" Josh Frydenberg says In the US, unemployment reaches historic levels — 20.5 million jobs are lost in April. The US Department of Labor's closely watched monthly employment report shows the unemployment rate surging to 14.7 per cent, shattering the post-World War II record of 10.8 per cent reached in November 1982.  China fires its first shot in a bitter diplomatic row with Australia, threatening to slap major tariffs on barley exports. Throughout the rest of the year, China goes on to slap tariffs or hold up shipments of Australian beef, cotton, wine and lobster, and ban coal imports.  Australia get its first official look at how damaging the pandemic has been across the economy. GDP contracts 0.3 per cent in the March quarter. Australia is on track for its first recession in 29 years. ""We have avoided the economic fate and the health fate of other nations,"" Treasurer Josh Frydenberg says. ""The fact that the Australian economy only contracted by 0.3 per cent shows the Australian economy's remarkable resilience."" Labor's Shadow Treasurer Jim Chalmers isn't buying it: ""His argument appears to be that our recession is a bit better than the American recession.""  Victoria goes back into lockdown as stay-at-home orders are reintroduced in Melbourne and the Mitchell Shire, placing those areas back into stage 3 restrictions. ""I also understand six weeks might feel like an eternity, but it's the time our health experts tell us they need to really get on top of this thing,"" says Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews. The lockdown is later extended far beyond the initial six weeks.  The economic impact deepens in Australia, as unemployment surges to 7.5 per cent. For the first time, official figures show more than 1 million people are out of work — but the real figure is thought to be much higher. ""Without JobKeeper, the ABS estimates that the unemployment rate would be 0.8 percentage points higher,"" BIS Oxford Economics chief economist Sarah Hunter says. ""Adding in those people that have lost their job and exited the workforce since March, the rate rises to around 10 per cent."" In China, the economy is in recovery mode — its GDP rises 3.2 per cent in the second quarter, after contracting 6.8 per cent in the first quarter. The Government announces the more than 5 million Australians on JobKeeper and the increased JobSeeker subsidy will have their payments reduced, but the schemes are extended to March 2021. The JobKeeper wage subsidy will fall in September and January, before it's axed in March. The JobSeeker coronavirus supplement will more than halve, to $250 a fortnight in September.  In the US, the S&P 500 recovers all of its COVID losses and closes at a new high. The ASX regains 35 per cent from its March low. The price of gold continues to surge, topping $US2,000 an ounce.  Second quarter GDP figures show the economy contracted 7 per cent in the three months through June. Two successive quarters of negative GDP growth put Australia into technical recession for the first time in almost three decades. The scale of the downturn is vastly greater than ""the recession we had to have"" in 1991, where the economy shrank 1.3 and 0.1 per cent. The 7 per cent slump is also more than three times worse than the previous biggest fall of 2 per cent in June 1974. Indeed economist Callam Pickering says Government support is all that's preventing an even more catastrophic recession. ""This economy is being held together with duct tape by JobKeeper and JobSeeker."" The delayed October budget details how the Government plans to pull Australia out of recession. The deficit is forecast to surpass $213 billion in financial year 2021. The Government forecasts net debt to peak at $966 billion in 2024 — the equivalent of 44 per cent of GDP. ""This is a heavy burden but a necessary one to responsibly deal with the greatest challenge of our time,"" Treasurer Josh Frydenberg tells Australians.  Victoria emerges from lockdown after 111 days. Jess Grunow and her partner David Chapman are among Melburnians who rush to restaurants now allowed to open with limited capacity, sparking hopes of a recovery for the Victorian economy. ""It's one of those things you'll tell your grandkids about,"" Ms Grunow tells ABC News. ""When we came out of lockdown we were there waiting for the doors to open."" Despite earlier predictions house prices could fall as much as 30 per cent because of the COVID economic crisis, national house prices rise in October after just five months of falls. ""The numbers out today are quite remarkable,"" CoreLogic's head of research Eliza Owen observes.   The Reserve Bank cuts the cash rate for a third time since COVID-19 arrived in Australia, down to 0.1 per cent. The central bank announces it will buy $100 billion worth of government bonds. It also lowers its three-year bond rate target to 0.1 per cent, and the new record-low rate also applies to its term funding facility. ""We've done as much as we can on interest rates and the focus now is really on the quantitative asset purchases,"" RBA Governor Philip Lowe says. The measures are aimed at driving the Australian dollar lower, but they have the opposite effect — it rises above 72 US cents. In the US, voters elect Joe Biden as President but there's no concession from Donald Trump.  Saved from collapse, Bain Capital takes over as the new owner of Virgin Australia Virgin was one of the biggest corporate casualties of the coronavirus crisis, making a third of its workforce redundant. The now Boston-based owner vows to keep thousands of jobs, honour all employee entitlements and carry forward all travel credits and Velocity frequent flyer booked flights. The oil price rises sharply after Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford University/AstraZeneca all announce the results of their phase 3 vaccine trials. West Texas nears $US45 a barrel, recouping most of its losses since early in the year, following missile attacks in the Middle East. Qantas boss Alan Joyce, keen to resume international air travel, says the airline is ""looking at changing our terms and conditions to say, for international travellers, that we will ask people to have a vaccination before they can get on the aircraft.""  The recession ends by the technical definition, as GDP returns to growth, rising 3.3 per cent in the September quarter. But is the downturn really over? ""Practically, the answer is absolutely not and that's why we're seeing that the support that's been put in place by the Government and by the RBA is going to be there for quite some time,"" BIS Oxford Economics chief economist Sarah Hunter says. GDP is still down 3.8 per cent for the year. ""Technically the recession is over, but the recovery is not,"" Treasurer Josh Frydenberg cautions. ""This is a very challenging time and there's a lot of ground to make up."" Iron prices are on a tear, rising to $US150 a tonne, a more than seven-year high. Strong demand from China and supply concerns, fuelled by disappointing forecasts by Brazilian miner Vale, are driving the price of the commodity higher. Victoria and New South Wales lose their AAA credit ratings from S&P Global Ratings as both states take on huge debt to rebuild their economies. Wall Street sets new records as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq climb to new highs on positive vaccine news. The ASX 200 and All Ordinaries rise almost 13 per cent in five weeks, but are yet to recover all of their COVID losses.  Australia's jobs recovery appears to be continuing, with 90,000 new jobs are created in November, the vast majority being full-time positions. The unemployment rate edges down to 6.8 per cent, its lowest level since April, as Victoria drives the pick-up in employment. The Australian share market starts the final trading week of the year — with the ASX 200 down 0.3 per cent since January 1. But it's still 7.4 per cent below its February pre-pandemic peak. The virus continues to run rampant overseas but vaccines are starting to be rolled out, giving hope the health, and financial, costs of 2020 won't be redoubled in 2021.

289,ASX filled with festive cheer as markets shrug off COVID Christmas scare,markets,"  ASX filled with festive cheer as markets shrug off COVID Christmas scare Despite a last-minute COVID scare, Australian shareholders are feeling cautiously festive, with the ASX 200 closing in positive territory on Christmas Eve. Due to Christmas, the ASX closed early at 2.10pm. The benchmark ASX 200 finished 0.3 per cent higher at 6,665 points. The best performing stocks on Christmas Eve included ZipCo (+2.3pc), Webjet (+1.4pc), Woodside (+0.8pc) and Whitehaven (+0.9pc). The All Ordinaries also ended the day 0.4 per cent higher at 6,918. The local sharemarket had been rocked for several days as Sydney battled a fresh outbreak of COVID-19 that threatened to derail Christmas. However, it closed higher for the first time in four days on Wednesday, on news that numbers of cases were steady and most parts of Sydney will be able to have gatherings of 10 people on Christmas Day. Overall, the benchmark ended 0.2 per cent lower for the week, as gains in the last two trading days offset most of the losses earlier in the week. At 2:30pm, the Australian dollar was trading 0.2 per cent higher at 75.83 US cents. The dollar has been steadily rising on the back of the nation's recovery from the pandemic and China's demand for iron ore. The Australian sharemarket will now be closed for trade entirely on both Friday (Christmas Day) and Monday (a public holiday for Boxing Day) before reopening on Tuesday. At one point during the day's shortened trade, the mining sub-index rose as much as 1.4 per cent. Mining giant BHP Group climbed as it confirmed it had met licensing requirements to restart operations and had begun iron ore pellet production at its Samarco joint venture with Brazil's Vale SA. That comes five years after a deadly dam disaster there which killed 19 people. The collapse is considered Brazil's worst-ever environmental disaster. It contaminated a river for hundreds of kilometres to the ocean. The company's restart of iron ore mining comes just as prices of the commodity are soaring. That has been led by expectation of bullish demand in 2021, as top consumer China further recovers from the pandemic and Brazilian shortfalls persist. BHP closed 1.2 per cent higher. The corporate regulator has wrapped up its investigation into the bank's money laundering failures and will not be taking further action against executives. After an investigation by the financial crimes regulator AUSTRAC, in September the bank agreed to pay the largest fine in Australian corporate history — a $1.3 billion civil penalty. That was over more than 23 million breaches of anti-money laundering laws. The biggest breach was Westpac's failure to properly report more than 19.5 million instructions to transfer money overseas or bring foreign funds into Australia, totalling more than $11 billion. Just how and why did Australia's oldest bank find itself accused of bankrolling paedophiles and short-changing taxpayers, and unable to say who was behind $11 billion in suspect offshore transactions? ASIC had been also investigating potential breaches. But Westpac told the market late on Wednesday that ASIC had informed it the investigation is over. ""It has concluded the investigation,"" a statement said. ""And it does not intend to take any enforcement action against Westpac or any individuals in connection with the investigation."" ASIC confirmed Westpac's statement was accurate, but would not comment further. Westpac's share price ended the day in neutral territory. The other three banks had a mixed Christmas Eve, with Commonwealth also neutral, ANZ slightly down (-0.3pc) and NAB slightly gaining (+0.1pc). US shareholders were also feeling festive enough to have a little tipple, with all three of its major indexes trading higher at one stage. That came with  a stimulus deal for the COVID-struck economy in the works and economic data showing there are fewer people claiming unemployment benefits. Notable movers include BigPharma stock Pfizer, which gained 1.9 per cent on news it will supply the US with 100 million extra doses of its COVID-19 vaccine by July. American Airlines and United Airlines both rose almost 3 per cent after revealing plans to bring back stood-down employees. The airline industry is hoping to receive about $15 billion in payroll support as part of the pending fiscal relief package. After it was all said and done, the blue-chip Dow Jones closed higher (+0.4pc), while the S&P 500 broke even. However, there is always a family member that sours the festive mood. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed lower (-0.3pc) as investors moved towards stocks hit by the pandemic instead. Meanwhile, European shares logged yet another day of strong gains on Wednesday, making up almost all of the losses at the start of the week. Some markets across the continent experienced their worst trade in months earlier in the week, with the region rocked by another outbreak of COVID-19 in England that saw its borders closed off. But markets are now being cheered up by signs of an imminent Brexit trade deal. The drawn-out process to split Britain from Europe has been going on for years and it is hoped that current talks between the EU and the nation will finally give some certainty. The pan-European STOXX 600 hit session highs and closed up 1.1 per cent in holiday-thinned trade. London's FTSE 100 reversed losses to pull into the black, but still lagged regional peers as the pound surged. Further cheer came as France lifted its ban on UK travellers and freight. Germany's DAX jumped 1.3 per cent in its last trading day of the week, capping weekly losses at 0.3 per cent only. The travel and leisure sector gained the most on the day, followed by banks, while oil and gas stocks tracked a rise in crude prices.

290,Sharemarket rebounds as Sydneysiders find out how they'll spend COVID Christmas,markets,"  Sharemarket rebounds as Sydneysiders find out how they'll spend COVID Christmas The Australian sharemarket rebounded to close higher on Wednesday, with broad gains across the market ahead of Christmas. The S&P/ASX 200 Index climbed 43.5 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 6643.1. The top performing stocks were Mesoblast and up 9.22 per cent and Smartgroup up 7.62 per cent. The index has lost 0.54 per cent over the past five days. It had been trading down since Friday, when travel restrictions were starting to be mandated on Sydney travellers due to COVID, just a week out from Christmas. Travel and financial stocks had been especially hit by that unwanted news. But fears about a worsening outbreak had so far not been realised. The number of cases being diagnosed in NSW had been tracking down, from 30 on Sunday to just eight yesterday and then again today. This morning, the NSW Premier announced that people in some parts of Sydney's northern beaches would unfortunately be in lockdown for Christmas. However, Greater Sydney residents will be allowed to have up to 10 people in their homes for festivities, along with children under 12 as they wish. With a rocky few days on the ASX and an ongoing lockdown for some Sydney residents, the traditionally cheerful Christmas trade could be in doubt. However, stocks analyst Hina Chowdhary expects that Santa could still deliver. ""Shares are edging up the ASX ladder in the early trade hours today, and much-anticipated Christmas rally is under the scanner,"" Ms Chowdhary said. ""The iron ore space that was driving the market momentum in the past few days over global demand-supply dynamics, seems to be easing down now and the financial sector is also losing some steam. ""Despite the scenario, a Santa rally might come true for certain stocks and the focus can shift from iron ore miners and banks, back again to technology and healthcare or more defensive plays, as we are seeing today. ""Amid pockets of lockdowns, the travel sector might also take a backseat. ""We expect to see positive momentum in the market with select stocks performing against the grain while the market might still demonstrate signs of volatility given the wave around COVID restrictions."" European stocks also had an especially tumultuous day during Monday trade (local time) after a reportedly new strain of the virus shook England. But they have now largely recovered ground, with European shares posting their best day in six weeks during Tuesday (local time) trade. The pan-European STOXX 600 finished up 1.2 per cent up, recovering from a more than 2 per cent slide in the previous session. London's blue-chip FTSE also reversed early losses, as data showed Britain's economic recovery from its coronavirus crash was quicker than previously thought in the third quarter. The index closed 0.6 per cent higher, breaking a three-day losing streak. As well as the implications from COVID-19, the European markets' recovery comes as the continent tries to finally resolve uncertainty around Brexit. The EU is giving a ""final push"" in a bid to strike a Brexit trade deal with Britain, its chief negotiator said on Tuesday. Meanwhile, US stocks offered up mixed results. The S&P 500 had a rocky day and eventually closed lower. That comes as US Congress passes a $US892 billion economic relief package that includes unemployment benefit and support for people struck by the pandemic. The Dow also closed lower. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq ended in positive territory, as Apple announced it plans to sell an electric passenger vehicle by 2024.

291,"China's demand for steel may boost Aussie dollar to 80 US cents, analysts predict",markets,"  Australian dollar tipped to hit 80 US cents on back of coronavirus recovery and China's demand for steel The Australian dollar is expected to keep rising as long as China's hunger for steel remains insatiable and the US struggles to control its COVID-19 outbreak. That is essentially why the local currency has risen to a 2.5-year high (about 76 US cents) — despite a ""once-in-a-century"" pandemic — according to currency experts from the nation's major banks. Although there are big differences in their forecasts, the common thread is their expectation of a much stronger Australian dollar. Generally, it is great for online shoppers, especially if they are buying from US online stores. But it is not as positive for Australian exporters, who prefer a lower currency to boost foreign demand for their goods. Nor would the predictions be greeted enthusiastically by the nation's tourism industry (in pre-COVID times) — which relies on a weaker dollar to attract hordes of overseas tourists. However, AMP Capital's chief economist Shane Oliver said: ""It doesn't matter as much as it used to."" ""As the Aussie dollar goes up, it normally would encourage Australians to go on an overseas holiday. At the moment you can't really do that, so that's not really an issue,"" he said, noting Australia's international borders were closed to the entire world (except for New Zealand). Here is what some of Australia's biggest financial institutions are predicting: Last week, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg gave an upbeat budget update and said the economy would recover faster than he had previously thought. It was largely because the price of Australia's key export, iron ore, had skyrocketed thanks to strong Chinese demand and production issues in Brazil (a major iron ore exporter). Chinese businesses need to buy Australian dollars to purchase Australian iron ore, so the greater the demand for it, the higher the currency goes. Iron ore climbed above $US176 a tonne on Tuesday, the highest it has been in nine years. The surge in iron ore sales to China has occurred despite Beijing's worsening relationship with Australia. Beef, wine, coal, lobster, cotton and timber exports have all fallen victim to Chinese import tariffs this year, introduced in the wake of Australia calling for an investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Although the Australian dollar is vulnerable to bouts of uncertainty about coronavirus and China tensions, the Reserve Bank's bond buying will keep it lower than otherwise,"" Dr Oliver told ABC News. In November, the RBA cut interest rates to a fresh record low of 0.1 per cent to weaken the currency and stimulate the economy. The central bank also pledged to buy $100 billion of longer-term government bonds (which mature in five to 10 years) to pump more cash into the system. It is a stimulus measure called quantitative easing (QE), or ""money printing"" (figuratively speaking). Despite its best efforts, the Aussie dollar has continued to strengthen. ""When there's more confidence that there's light at the end of the tunnel — in terms of coronavirus coming under control with vaccines — that in turn is feeding optimism about commodity prices, and also pushing the US dollar down,"" Dr Oliver said. ""And those things are all coming together to push the Aussie dollar up."" ""The RBA may try to slow down that process, but it won't be able to stop it."" Those sentiments were also shared by ANZ's senior economist Felicity Emmett. As trade and political tensions simmer, speculation swirls about what's really going on between the two nations — and what's next on a Chinese sanctions ""hit list"". ""The Aussie dollar is often seen as a proxy for risk and global growth and, on that front, the outlook is quite positive,"" she said. ""Nearly all economies have had a difficult year in 2020 with the shutdowns associated with COVID-19. ""We've got the vaccine already rolling out in the UK and US, and it's likely to roll out here in the first half of next year. ""As the vaccine rolls out, the economy can open up, we'll get a growth rebound, and that will help support the Australian dollar through 2021."" Another factor boosting the ""risk on"" demand for Australian currency, Ms Emmett said, was the upcoming departure of Donald Trump from the White House. She noted it would result in ""more stability in trade and geopolitics"", and a lower chance of trade wars flaring up. While US president-elect Joe Biden may not necessarily adopt a softer stance on China, he is generally viewed as a more ""reliable"" negotiating partner. Australia's stronger dollar is also linked to the United States' rampant COVID-19 outbreak, and the unprecedented stimulus injected into the US economy. The recession may technically be ending but it will take much longer for Australia's economy to get back to where it was before the pandemic, as wages stagnate, unemployment remains high and cuts to Government subsidies loom, Stephen Long writes. The US Government approved a record $US2 trillion package, in March, to aid workers, businesses and a healthcare system strained by the pandemic. However, with the US consistently breaking new records for COVID-19 infections and deaths — and with unemployment at its highest level in decades — the US Government had little choice but to pump even more cash into its economy. After months of failed negotiations and hyper-partisan wrangling over how much to spend, Congress finally passed another relief package, valued at $US892 billion. Trillions of dollars of COVID-19 stimulus funding have taken a toll on the US greenback, which is trading near its lowest level in 2.5 years. ""Driving our forecasts for a stronger Australian dollar is our expectation for more US dollar weakness, as the US current account deficit widens further,"" CBA currency strategist Kim Mundy said. She acknowledged high commodity prices, especially iron ore, are a ""more important driver"" of the Aussie dollar rally. But as more countries (effectively) print money to limit the damage that COVID-19 has wreaked on their economies, Australia's central bank will be under increasing pressure to up its stimulus game. Dr Oliver predicts the RBA may be forced to conjure an extra $140 billion by the end of next year (on top of the $100 billion cash it already pledged to create). ""The sheer scale of bond buying could end up greater than the total size of the budget deficit this financial year,"" he said. The Federal Treasurer, in last week's budget update, said Australia's deficit would be $197.7 billion. Although it was a $16 billion improvement over the Government's previous estimate, the new figure will still be a record deficit. It is a new experience for the ""lucky country"", which has been fixated on surpluses and getting ""back in black"" for many years.

292,ASX finishes lower as COVID hits Christmas in both Australia and abroad,markets,"  ASX finishes lower as COVID hits Christmas in both Sydney and Europe Losses from miners and major banks caused Australia's stock market to finish lower on Tuesday, after a reportedly new strain of COVID-19 in the UK hit European stocks and Sydney battles with its own resurgence of the virus. The S&P/ASX200 finished 1.05 per cent lower on Tuesday at 6599.6. BHP Group was down 1.8 per cent to $42.89, Rio Tinto fell 2.7 per cent to $115.41 and Fortescue Metals Group dropped 2.3 per cent to $23.48. The bottom performing stocks at close were Silver Lake Resources down 6.79 per cent and Ramelius Resources down 5.97 per cent. The ASX 200 also closed flat on Monday in the face of a fresh outbreak of the pandemic in Sydney. That followed a fall on Friday. Bio-tech company Mesoblast closed 5.7 per cent lower at $2.17, off the back of the company's announcement last week that its COVID-19 treatment trial was not living up to expectations. Meanwhile, oil prices plunged as tighter restrictions and fresh travel curbs sparked worries about a slower recovery in fuel demand. As a result, the Australian energy index tumbled more than 2 per cent to hit its lowest since November 23. A2 Milk company was the market's best performer, closing almost 5 per cent higher. And superannuation management company Netwealth closed the second-best performer, adding 2.9 per cent to its share price on Tuesday. Preliminary retail data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for November has shown a massive surge in sales of 7 per cent. That data shows the surge in shopping as Melbourne was released from its second lockdown and Victoria's borders started to reopen with other states. Black Friday sales were another sweetener. Overall, Victoria saw a large rise of 21 per cent. Excluding Victoria, retail sales rose 2.7 per cent. Overall, turnover increased 13.2 per cent when compared to November 2020. However, the data is old news compared to the developing situation in Greater Sydney as it battles another outbreak of the virus. Research from ANZ and Roy Morgan Australia out today said consumer confidence was ending the year on a ""downbeat note"". It rallied as border restrictions were eased nationally in November but the research found consumer confidence lost 2 per cent in the weekend before Christmas as Sydney's outbreak developed. ""The emergence of a major COVID-19 cluster in Sydney has dampened consumers' otherwise positive sentiment,"" ANZ head of Australian economics, David Plank, said. ""In Sydney, confidence was down 5.3 per cent in its sharpest weekly drop since July. In the rest of New South Wales, it moderated by 1.9 per cent. ""Confidence weakened in Victoria, down 2.9 per cent, along with Queensland and Northern Territory. ""The lockdown of the suburbs around Sydney's northern beaches and the state border closures have reminded people that material downside risks remain."" The Australian dollar is currently 0.1 per cent down to 75.75 US cents. On Monday, European stocks took a hit in the face of the new strain of COVID-19. Rapidly spreading infections in southern England are being blamed on a new, highly-infectious coronavirus variant. Countries across the world have halted air travel to the UK, while France has banned trucks from entering for 48 hours. European shares fell on Monday in their worst session in almost two months. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 2.3 per cent, its lowest close since mid-November, after the UK imposed an effective lockdown and reversed plans to ease curbs over Christmas. Main indexes in Germany, France, Spain, and Italy all dived close to three per cent. Spain's IBEX posted its worst day in six-months. Over in the US, at one point during Monday trade, the Dow took a sharp fall, but financials have helped the blue-chip benchmark recover to finish just above its open (+0.1pc) at 30,216 points. The S&P 500 shed 0.4 per cent after a rocky trade and the Nasdaq was down 0.1 per cent. That comes as US Congress worked out a pandemic relief agreement after months of partisan wrangling. The $900 billion package is expected to pass on Monday (US time) and includes unemployment aid and steers money to small businesses, airlines, transit systems and vaccine distribution. During trade, electric car maker Telsa also became the most valuable company ever added to the S&P 500 and will account for about 1.69 per cent of the index. They have since dropped off this high by more than four per cent. Tesla's shares had surged some 70 per cent since mid-November, when its debut in the S&P 500 was announced.

293,analysis: 2020: the year we created money from thin air,markets,"  Over a two-month period between March and April, shares on the Australian stock exchange went into free fall. If you've ever jumped from a great height into a pool or lake, you'll know that unnatural, uneasy feeling you experience when, about halfway down, every fibre in your body is yearning to hit the water. I felt something akin to that on Monday morning of March 16. On the way to the ASX to cover the story, the news hit that ASIC — the corporate cop — had directed several trading firms to cut their order volumes by up to 25 per cent. Why? It was so the ASX could handle the avalanche of trading (mainly sell orders) going through the exchange. The previous Friday had been one of the most volatile trading days in the history of the S&P/ASX 200 index. The Australian stock market was ""crashing"", and to limit the damage, the financial market's police force was directing traffic around the accident. For several hours, Australia no longer had a perfectly ""free"" stock market. This action was the start of several norms or practices in 2020 that were turned on their head. In business and finance, it's been a year of realising that many ""givens"" in our world are no longer givens. Perhaps the most dramatic financial development of 2020 was the Reserve Bank's foray into money printing and quantitative easing. The Reserve Bank is renowned for its conservatism, so it was taken kicking and screaming into this realm of monetary policy. In April, it was confirmed the bank was creating money out of thin air — adding extra digits to its own accounts on computer terminals within the bank's headquarters in Martin Place in Sydney. This created money for the Reserve Bank to buy bonds from the Australian government in the secondary market. That is, buying the bonds off the banks, after the banks had purchased them from the government via its debt auctions. Welcome to quantitative easing. The idea of this ""unconventional"" monetary policy, as the RBA likes to call it, is to drive down interest rates ""along the curve"" (lowering short, medium, and long-term interest rates). On Melbourne Cup Day, the central bank pulled out the bazooka and announced it would buy up to $100 billion worth of government bonds. If you'd said to anyone following business and finance this time last year that the government would be printing money, buying tens of billions in government debt, and offering loans en masse to the business community at 0.1 of a per cent, they'd have been shocked. Record low interest rates have arguably been the biggest influence on financial markets and the economy this year. No one would argue that record low interest rates are not necessary to support this unsteady economy. They are. However, it's the Reserve Bank's forward guidance on its cash rate target that has upended what we've come to know and expect from the RBA now for decades. In its financial Monetary Policy Decision for the year, Governor Philip Lowe repeated a line he'd been using in recent months: ""Given the outlook, the Board is not expecting to increase the cash rate for at least three years"". A sentence like this in the Reserve Bank's interest rate announcement is highly unusual, but its inclusion in the December policy announcement didn't even make news headlines. The highly unusual had become the usual. For many years, with different governments and multiple treasurers, achieving a budget ""surplus"" was the big fiscal goal. Surpluses were good and deficits were bad. Why? Because achieving a budget surplus sent a message to the electorate, the pollies thought, that your party could manage money, and in uncertain times, that's an important skill for a government to have. As the Federal Budget inched closer to balance in 2019, you could sense Treasurer Josh Frydenberg rubbing his hands in anticipation of announcing a surplus. Then coronavirus hit, and, as former Liberal Party leader John Hewson says, the Government had a legitimate excuse to drop its surplus ambition and rack up an enormous deficit with a forecast $1 trillion dollars in debt. All that has changed is that the Government now has a reason to spend big that the electorate will easily swallow. It has, however, potentially tossed the ""deficit is bad"" notion out the window forever, especially if Australian taxpayers get used to the idea of paying off government debt. The endless pursuit of a surplus for political point scoring may be gone forever, and from an economic management point of view, that is a sound development. That's because, as the economics textbooks suggest, it frees up governments to spend more when the economy turns down, and conversely they can save taxpayers' money when economic times are better. The private sector was also sent into shock this year. Most companies took a massive earnings hit as a result of pandemic-related shutdowns and restrictions. The JobKeeper income subsidy helped support businesses that would have otherwise failed. Millions of Australians will be taking an indirect pay cut from COVID-19, through their shareholdings and super funds, explains David Taylor. The sad reality though is that thousands of businesses did hit the wall, and when we've fully emerged from the downturn, the toll could reach tens of thousands. At the top end of town, the priority was to keep trading and to preserve cash. For the really big players, like the banks, that meant holding onto dividends. Some companies slashed their payment by 30 to 50 per cent, while others didn't pay a dividend at all. Investors who rely on this income were blindsided, the Australian Investors Association told the ABC at the time. Why? Because this was something that has never happened in the nation's history. Dividend income, for example, is seen a little like rent: it may come down from time to time but it's basically considered pretty stable. That notion of the dividend being broadly untouchable and stable has now gone. For years, retailers have been struggling. A perfect storm of insecure employment, low wage growth, and high levels of personal debt lead to what was dubbed a ""retail recession"" in 2019. The coronavirus pandemic and associated lockdowns shut retailers' doors across the country. In many ways it couldn't have come at a worse time for many businesses. To save hundreds of thousands of businesses from going bust, the federal government allowed restaurants and cafes to trade in takeaway food. I know that policy saved my local Greek restaurant from closing shop after 40 years of being in business. Even restaurants at the top end of town — the kind you'd never have imagined ordering a Friday night takeaway from — had to pivot, offering innovative ""cook at home"" options and produce deliveries. But many businesses also had to scramble to introduce a digital side to their business for online shoppers. For some businesses, a huge surge in online trade, combined with government income support, actually left them better off. The restaurant industry says the pandemic has produced clear winners and losers. The winners are retail and hospitality businesses in the suburbs, and the losers are their counterparts in central business districts — suffering from plummeting demand as a result of empty city offices and side streets. Those businesses in central business districts are hoping government income subsidies remain in place well into next year. Overall, the resilience shown by hundreds of thousands of small businesses in the face of so much uncertainty has been impressive to watch. And, of course, for employees, working life may never be the same again — even for orchestras. From Zoom meetings in your pyjama bottoms to video-link AGMs, social distancing and working from home created an almost surreal experience for millions of Australians this year. A colleague of mine during the federal budget lock-up (which was held here in Sydney this year) noted that ""this might give Treasury the idea to permanently move the lockup for journalists outside Canberra Parliament House"". And more broadly that's the change COVID-19 may bring: workers may continue to work from home at least one or two days a week; company annual general meetings may be via video-link; and more first-round job interviews may be conducted online. I'll never forget turning a blind corner on an ABC field assignment in Sydney's Darlinghurst  in late March and being confronted with a queue of between 300 to 400 people — all waiting in silence to apply for government benefits. The economy is picking up, and hundreds of thousand of workers in those queues are now back in work. However, there are plenty more that will continue to struggle. It's feared that the legacy of the coronavirus recession may be fewer workers in ongoing full-time work, with the kind of security that makes buying a house, for example, achievable. The jobless rate is not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024. Roughly $1 trillion in government debt, some government bonds actually selling with negative interest rates attached, quantitative easing and mass sackings pushed Australia through its worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Until a coronavirus vaccine becomes widely available across the globe, and here in Australia, businesses will be reluctant to do what policy makers desperate want to see: that is, hiring full-time workers. In the meantime, it is encouraging see several respected surveys showing business conditions and consumer confidence improving significantly. The year 2020 saw the unusual became usual and the extraordinary turn ordinary. Many aspects of economics, business and finance were turned on their head, and policy settings may never be quite the same again. We were though reminded about one thing that never changes: our propensity as a human race to overcome adversity — no matter the odds. That will, hopefully, see us to a full coronavirus recovery.

294,ASX has a rocky day as Sydney grapples with COVID nightmare before Christmas,markets,"  ASX has a rocky day as Sydney grapples with COVID nightmare before Christmas After a strong rally last month, the Australian share market has ended the day flat, as the country grapples with the resurgence of COVID-19 in Australia's biggest city just a few days before Christmas. Travel restrictions on Greater Sydney residents into other Australian states have thrown travel plans into chaos and put Christmas party plans on ice. After a weekend marked by increasing restrictions on Sydney travellers, the ASX 200 opened down on Monday and at one point during the day was down 0.6 per cent. It recovered some ground towards close but still ended Monday very slightly in the red (-0.1pc) at 6,670 points. The All Ordinaries also finished slightly down (-0.1pc) at 6,920 points. Flight Centre stocks took a big hit when trading opened, with a decline of 5.9 per cent to $14.93 before lunchtime. By close, the stock had slightly recovered but was still 1.7 per cent down. Travel companies had been gearing up for a busy Christmas season after social distancing curbs were gradually eased in November. Shares in the company that owns Auckland airport closed down 2.2 per cent. A travel bubble had been floated between New Zealand and Australia last week, before the COVID-19 case numbers in Sydney started to rise again. Shares in the company that runs Sydney airport are also down 1 per cent. Other losers on Monday included Virgin Money (-7.1pc), WiseTech Global (-6.5pc) and AGL Energy (-5.1pc). The heavyweight financial index fell more than 1 per cent to hit a near-three-week low during Monday. NAB, Commonwealth Bank and Westpac all finished down on Monday, however all less than 1 per cent decline. ANZ, however, finished slightly up (+0.5pc). On the flip side, ASX 200 stocks with an investment in home entertainment performed well on early trade on Monday. Online retailer Kogan finished the day 4.5 per cent higher, while JB Hi-Fi gained 0.9 per cent. Supermarket chain Coles, which saw a boost early in the pandemic due to panic buying, also finished 1.8 per cent higher. Buy-now, pay-later service Afterpay also experienced its fifth day straight of gains. It finished 0.3 per cent higher off the back of its $25.78 billion valuation. Miners including Fortescue Metals, BHP and gold miners Ramelius and OZ Minerals also finished the day in the green. Overall, basic materials and healthcare stocks performed the best. At 4:30pm, the Australian dollar was trading 0.8 per cent down to 75.61 US cents. The ASX 200's downcast performance on Monday comes just days after it hit its highest point since the pandemic began. It hit this point on Thursday but that afternoon cases in Sydney's northern beaches started to rise. The benchmark then closed 1.2 per cent down on Friday as states started putting travel restrictions on people from hotspot regions. Despite the dampener, Citi economist Josh Williamson said the impact of the outbreak on the economy should not be significant. ""Assuming NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian does not choose to extend or increase restrictions on Greater Sydney, we expect no significant impact on GDP growth,"" Mr Williamson said in a market forecast. ""As it stands, the restrictions will be in place for just 3 per cent of Q4 with only 1.1 per cent of Australia's population ordered to stay at home during this time. ""There will likely be some impact on hospitality venues across Greater Sydney due to the return of [the] one person per four square metre rule. ""But microeconomic impacts could extend into the New Year. Hospitality and tourism operators in Greater Sydney affected by the newly announced restrictions may not have fully recovered from earlier pandemic-induced weakness. ""The obvious risk is that the NSW Premier extends the time period of the latest Greater Sydney restrictions or widens the stay-at-home order from the northern beaches to include Greater Sydney."" The NSW Premier is not due to make a decision about Christmas restrictions until Wednesday. The Transport Workers Union has lodged a dispute with the Fair Work Commission over Qantas' decision to outsource 2,000 airport workers' jobs. The Australian airline announced last month that it was outsourcing many roles such as baggage handlers across 10 airports in a bid to lower costs as it faces a financial hit from the coronavirus pandemic. The outsourcing cuts come on top of 6,000 already announced redundancies across Qantas's workforce, revealed in June. Sydney Airport is usually Australia's busiest international gateway, but during the coronavirus pandemic it stands empty and desolate. Take a rare look behind the scenes. The union alleges Qantas is rushing through the redundancy process just before Christmas. The Qantas share price finished the day lower (-0.6pc) in line with other hits being taken by the travel industry as COVID-19 hits Sydney. Meanwhile, the consumer watchdog is taking activewear brand Lorna Jane to court for trying to sell clothes they said could protect against coronavirus. The private company came under fire at the start of the pandemic after it claimed on its website that its ""anti-virus activewear"" prevented and protected against infectious diseases. Advertisements over a wide range of media including Instagram, its website and in stores included statements such as: ""Cure for the Spread of COVID-19? Lorna Jane Thinks So."" The private Australian company was already fined almost $40,000 in July by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for making the claims. Now, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is taking Lorna Jane to the Federal Court over a potential breach of Australian consumer law.

295,Australian shares drop as fears grow and border close over NSW COVID-19 cluster,markets,"  Australian share market drop, travel and casinos feel pinch as fears grow over NSW COVID-19 cluster Australian shares fell on Friday as a COVID-19 cluster in NSW grew to 28 cases and other states began to reimpose border restrictions. The ASX 200 closed 1.2 per cent lower at 6,675 points, while the All Ordinaries index lost 1.1 per cent to 6,924. Despite the fall, the benchmark index still notched up its seventh-straight weekly gain. Travel and casino stocks came under pressure, including Qantas (-3.5pc), REX (-5.4pc), Star Entertainment (-2.1pc) and Crown Resorts (-0.8pc). Victoria announced a permit system would be imposed on anyone traveling into the state from NSW and anyone from the hotspot cannot enter Victoria from midnight on Friday, on top of restrictions imposed by other states. Energy stocks dipped despite an uptick in oil prices, with Ampol (-4.7pc) and Worley (-3.5pc) among the biggest drags. The big four banks fell, led by NAB (-2pc), while the miners were mixed, with Fortescue shares rising (+2.2pc) while BHP shares fell (-0.4pc). Shares in medicine company Mesoblast tumbled 36.1 per cent, after a trial of its heart failure treatment remestemcel-L did not reach its intended target. A2 Milk shares plunged, losing 23.6 per cent after the company lowered its revenue forecast, due to weaker Chinese demand for its products, through the lucrative 'daigou' resale channel. The local currency rose above 76.2 US cents overnight, largely due to a weaker greenback, but pulled back through the local session. By 5:05pm (AEDT), it was buying around 75.9 US cents. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones gained 147 points (or 0.5 per cent) to close at its highest lever ever, 30,302 points. The benchmark S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent to 3,722 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 0.8 per cent to 12,764 points. Both indices also closed at record highs. US markets lifted as investors bet the US Government would need to pass a stimulus bill to bolster the economy in the face of rising unemployment and surging COVID-19 infections. Last week, the number of people filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits in the US rose to a three-month high (885,000), according to official US data released overnight. Data also shows manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region cooled this month, with factories reporting a sharp slowdown in new orders and job growth. Jakob Stausholm has been named Rio Tinto's next chief executive, defying expectations it would pick an external candidate to repair its image after the destruction of sacred Aboriginal rock shelters in Western Australia. Shares in Rio Tinto rose 0.9 per cent to $117.53. Earlier this year, the mining company blasted the 46,000-year-old rock shelters in WA's Pilbara region, despite warnings of the site's cultural significance. While the destruction was legal, it sparked outrage in the public and investors that ultimately led to the resignation of incumbent Jean-Sebastien Jacques and two deputies. The appointment of Mr Stausholm, who is Danish, after Frenchman Mr Jacques may come as a surprise to Australian investors, who have argued a new chief executive should have local experience and be based in the country that provides 85 per cent of the company's profits. Mr Stausholm joined Rio Tinto as its chief financial officer in 2018 and will take on the tough job of repairing strained relationships with investors and Australia's Indigenous and Aboriginal communities. Bankers and investors had expected the company to choose an outsider as its new head. ""Some may perceive Mr Stausholm's appointment as potentially indicating little change in overall strategy,"" analysts at Morgan Stanley told Reuters, adding the internal appointment should cut down on the disruption period caused by management transitions. Some investors said the appointment was unlikely to go down well with markets as a more radical change had been expected, though Stausholm's knowledge of the company could mean a smoother transition. As well as navigating Australia's trade tensions with China, potential aluminium plant closures and job losses, he will have to manage cost overruns at Rio's biggest growth project in Mongolia, a new iron ore mine in Guinea and legacy issues in Bougainville. A parliamentary inquiry report, which said Rio Tinto's role in the destruction of the Juukan Gorge caves was ""inexcusable"", has called on the company to pay compensation to Indigenous Australians affected by the destruction of the caves and commit to reconstructing the sacred site. Mr Stausholm will take over on January 1, 2021, and Peter Cunningham will be appointed as chief financial officer on an interim basis. Bitcoin has once again hit a new record, surging 10 per cent to $US23,655 ($AU31,031.7) overnight. The cryptocurrency has more than tripled in value this year. Smaller coin ethereum, which often moves in tandem with bitcoin, was trading 1.6 per cent higher. With bitcoin's supply capped at 21 million, investors see in the cryptocurrency a hedge against the risk of inflation as governments and central banks turn on the stimulus taps in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""There will be a search for alternative currencies due to constant fiat money debasement,"" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note. ""It does feel that bitcoin will continue to be in high demand."" Brent crude oil rose (+0.7pc) to $US51.45 a barrel, its highest level in nine months. Spot gold and iron ore also saw big jumps, with the precious metal hitting $1,886 an ounce (+1.2pc) and the steel-making ingredient up 1.3 per cent to $US158.5 a tonne.

296,ASX200 ends on 10-month high after Government updates it s recovery forecast,markets,"  Australian share market ends on a high after Treasurer says recovery will be faster than forecast Australian shares jumped to their highest close in almost 10 months, as projection of a faster economic recovery next year was announced by the Treasurer and unemployment figures were better than expected. The ASX200 settled at 6,757 points at the close (+1.2pc), its highest close since February, and the All Ords rose by the same margin to 7,000 points. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the economy would grow 4.5 per cent next year, up from a previous forecast of 4.3 per cent made in October. November employment figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics beat expectations with the unemployment dropping to 6.8 per cent last month. Economists had predicted the rate would remain at October's 7 per cent level. Mr Frydenberg said employment would reach pre-pandemic levels by mid-2024. On the back of the positive sentiment, Aussie banks and miners all ended on a high with Northern Star rising by 3.1 per cent, Fortescue Metals by 2 per cent and Lynas Rare Earth by 3.2 per cent. The big four grew modestly by about 1 per cent each while Macquarie Group gained 2.3 per cent to $141.6. Iron ore prices have continued to soar (+0.9pc) to $US156.45 a tonne, leading to miners performing well on Thursday morning. The top movers were Netwealth Group (+6.8pc), Westgold Resources (6.3pc), and Perseus Mining and Perenti Group, which were both up 6.2 per cent. Service Stream carried its loss through the day (-12pc) after it announced a long-term contract with NBN under a unified field operations agreement. The contract will see the company provide service activations, operations and maintenance activities to the NBN, including working with fibre to the node, premise, basement and kerb. The Australian dollar has risen again after yesterday's 2.5-month high to 75.7 US cents. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones closed down 45 points (0.2pc) while the S&P500 and Nasdaq rose by the same margin, 0.2 per cent and 0.5 per cent, respectively. Freedom Foods Group, which was investigated by ASIC earlier this month for a series of ""significant"" accounting problems, has announced a $20 million sale of its cereal and snacks operations to Tim Tam owner The Arnott's Group. Its shares have been suspended from trading since June. At the beginning of December, Freedom corrected its reporting from October 2019, from earning a full-year profit of $11.6 million, to a loss of $145.8 million. The cereal business also confessed its losses had since widened to $174.5 million in the last financial year (ending June 30, 2020). In an announcement to the ASX on Thursday, Freedom said: ""While actively pursuing a 'fix and retain' strategy, the group has also been exploring a potential divestment."" Arnott's will gain Freedom's manufacturing facilities in Dandenong, Victoria and Leeton and Darlington Point in NSW. It will also take on Freedom's brands which include: Freedom Foods, Messy Monkeys, Heritage Mill and Arnold's Farm. Crankt Protein will remain under Freedom Foods. Nine Entertainment (+3.4pc) lifted its first-half underlying earnings guidance as trading conditions improve across its television network. In a trading update on Thursday morning, Nine forecast more than 40 per cent growth in underlying earnings for the six months to December, compared to last month's guidance of 30 per cent growth. For the three months to December, Nine forecasts its metro free-to-air TV advertising revenue to be up ""almost 20 per cent"", 5 per cent higher than what it forecast last month. ""Nine continues to believe that, given limited visibility of the second-half advertising market, it is not in a position to provide guidance on earnings for the full year."" Bitcoin has hit an all-time peak of $29,095, buoyed by demand from larger investors attracted to its potential for quick gains, purported resistance to inflation and expectations it will become a mainstream payment method. Smaller cryptocurrencies ethereum and XRP, which often move in tandem with bitcoin, gained 5.4 per cent and 8.1 per cent, respectively. ""Many of our clients have been expecting bitcoin to surpass its all-time high of $20,000 given the recent news from major institutional players like SGX and MassMutual openly endorsing bitcoin,"" Scott Freeman, co-founder and partner at trading firm JST Capital told Reuters. ""While this is a major milestone for this nascent asset class, as retail, institutional, and blue-chip investors alike allocate more capital to this space, it would not be surprising to see other coins follow in BTC's footsteps and for this upward trajectory to be sustained into 2021."" Bitcoin's blistering rally has seen a massive flow of coin to North America from East Asia, fuelled by hunger for bitcoin among bigger and compliance-wary US investors. The performance of buy-now, pay-later platforms Zip Co and Afterpay have continued to climb. Zip Co hit a two-week high this morning after raising $120 million from institutional investors with a further $30 million expected next month from retail investors, before dropping to $5.6. The payment platform is expected to use the funds to enter into the European and Middle Eastern markets. And Afterpay didn't slow down, with another 5 per cent rise on Thursday to $120, marking a record closing level for the fourth session in a row. Toll road operator Transurban (+1.2pc) says it will sell 50 per cent of its stake in Transurban Chesapeake assets, including three express lanes and other projects in the Greater Washington Area, to three pension funds for $2.8 billion. Under the deal, AustralianSuper will own 25 per cent of the assets, while Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and UniSuper will hold stakes of 15 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively. In a statement, Transurban chief executive Scott Charlton said the deal would enable ""accelerated growth in North America and Australia, where we see a number of opportunities starting to materialise"".

297,"There's a type of investment popular with younger people, and it's not a fad",markets," Updated 
    
      December 14, 2020 07:47:59 For some, a new year (and new resolutions) means finally getting around to investing in the stock market. A popular choice for many first-time investors is a type of investment called exchange traded funds (or ETFs). But all the jargon can be confusing. So, many readers have written to us asking us to explain exactly what ETFs are. Investing in ETFs is a bit like buying a basket of shares, rather than stock picking, which is where you invest directly in particular companies. ETFs cover all sorts of investment types, but they're usually passively managed, which means they don't aim to outperform a specific benchmark. Instead, they usually track an index like the ASX200, commodities like gold, or sectors like IT.  And that means the value of the ETF goes up or down with the index or asset they're tracking. Jasmine, 26, who lives with her parents in Sydney's northern suburbs, plans to invest about $2,000 in ETFs to help build up a deposit to buy her own place. As a first-time investor, Jasmine says it feels less daunting than picking individual stocks. ""Nobody in my family has invested at all. It's completely new,"" she explained. ""I work as a speech pathologist so I have a health background, nothing to do with finance."" Nope. The ASX says it's seen market cap growth of about 34 per cent annually for the past three years. It has more than 200 ETFs listed on the stock exchange worth about $70 billion in total.  They're proving most popular with younger investors between the ages of 18-24 years old, many who are just starting out with trading. ""ETFs are very accessible,"" said ASX product manager Fabiana Candiano. ""So, you can trade small amounts of ETFs as low as $500."" And they're just bought like other shares. For most people that means using an online broker. Well, because they track an index, commodity or industry, they tend to be less risky than trying to pick winners, says Fiona Clark, investor relations at Merricks Capital. She says they can give investors exposure to markets (like international ones) that can be difficult to access. ""It gives them access to a broad range of investments with just one share purchase, so a diversified portfolio,"" Ms Clark said. ""And the fees and charges for ETFs tend to be quite attractive, they tend to be passive investments for the most part so the fee structures are quite low."" Despite the perception that ETFs are safe, there are the usual market risks. If the market goes down, the value of your investment will also go down. And if you're buying global ETFs, there are some currency risks, says Fabiana Candiano. ""If you decide to invest in an ETF which has global equities in its portfolio you'd be exposed to exchange rate fluctuations."" ""Related to that market risk is the fact that sometimes those industry or sector ETFs will offer more volatility,"" Ms Clark said. And sometimes ETFs can suffer more heavily in flash crashes, such as the events that happened in the US in 2010 and 2015. ""Underneath each ETF is the underlying stock that the counterparty has to buy and sell in line with the purchases and sales of the ETF,"" explained Ms Clark. ""So, if there's a run on the market, for example, and everybody wants to sell their ETF at the same time, that counterparty has to go and sell those shares in the underlying markets. So in those sorts of circumstances liquidity can potentially be a problem."" DISCLAIMER: This is just general information. If you need individual advice please see a professional.

In a statement to the ASX, CSL said the vaccine candidate, which was being developed with the University of Queensland, had caused some trial participants to return false positives in HIV tests. In agreement with the Federal Government, CSL said vaccine development would therefore not proceed to phase 2 and 3 trials. Westpac shares were 0.2 per cent higher, despite falls for the other major bank stocks, as it held its annual general meeting. Westpac chairman John McFarlane said he hoped the bank would be able to pay more ""consistent"" dividends in future, after payouts were cut due to a record fine over anti-money laundering breaches and the COVID-19 pandemic. ""I am conscious how important dividends are to individual shareholders and know how unhappy you have been about the decision not to pay a first-half dividend as well as the lower dividend for the year,"" Mr McFarlane said. Despite Friday's losses, the Australian market has surged 12 per cent in the past six weeks. It was mainly driven by optimism that vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca will help drive a rebound from the coronavirus economic slump. Mining stocks received a boost after iron ore prices continued a stellar run, at fresh seven-year highs. The steelmaking material jumped (+4.3pc) to $US156.58 a tonne. Shares in BHP (+0.8pc) and Rio Tinto (+0.5pc) posted solid gains. Fortescue Metals jumped (+2pc) to $22.95, its highest ever closing price. ""The China stimulus-led rally is nowhere better reflected than in the iron ore market, which is up 70 per cent this year amid strong demand,"" ANZ economist Adelaide Timbrell wrote. ""The rally received an additional boost recently from supply side issues. Vale reduced its guidance on output for 2021, as it struggles to overcome issues relating to the reopening of dams associated with their operations."" And in a risk to Australian supply, on Thursday, the Pilbara Ports Authority issued a cyclone warning and said it was clearing large vessels out of the Port Hedland export hub. ""A La Nina weather system is likely to increase the number of cyclones that hit the West Australian coast. In the past this has resulted in higher than normal levels of disruptions to iron ore exports,"" Ms Timbrell said. However, the China Iron and Steel Association said BHP had assured it that the adverse weather conditions would not affect its monthly shipment volumes. Shares in nickel and gold miner IGO surged, up 24 per cent, in its best one-day gain in more than a decade. It rally was sparked by confirmation IGO would purchase a stake in a lithium mine, a deal that has been favourably received by analysts. Energy was the best-performing sector on the local market midway through the session, after crude oil prices lifted overnight. The price of Brent crude reached more than $US50 a barrel for the first time since oil prices slumped in March. Woodside (+2.6pc), Santos (+2.8pc) and Beach Energy (+0.8c) were among the energy stocks making gains. Shares in Airbnb have soared on debut, in the biggest US stock market listing of 2020. After a tumultuous year for the global travel market, the holiday rental platform listed on the Nasdaq, with its share price more than doubling on open. The broader Nasdaq index closed higher, while the Dow Jones and S&P 500 lost ground. Shares in Airbnb's initial public offering were priced at $US68 and the stock soared past that during its first session of trade, closing at $US144.71. However, the company has not turned an annual profit since its launch in 2008 and it is not expected to do so this year either, despite a better-than-expected third quarter. Airbnb posted a quarterly net profit of $US219 million ahead of its listing, as it cut its costs, but it expects a decline in bookings and a rise in cancellations during the fourth quarter. ""I do think the company will benefit from the pent-up travel demand once the vaccine is widely distributed, but why would someone want to buy into a travel-related, unprofitable business with slowing growth?"" Training the Street chief executive Scott Rostan told AP. It follows a year of investors flocking to technology stocks as equity markets recovered from the pandemic plunge. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up 38 per cent this year and 80 per cent since its March low. On Wednesday, food delivery company DoorDash listed in the US, with its shares also jumping on its first day of trade, after a big year for delivery services. The Australian dollar jumped above 75 US cents overnight, its highest value in two-and-a-half years. Its six-week rally was mainly driven by surging commodity prices and a weaker US greenback. By 5:00pm AEDT, the local currency was buying 75.55 US cents. The euro also jumped after the European Central Bank (ECB) expanded its stimulus, but not by as much as some investors had expected. ING global head of macro Carsten Brzeski said the ECB did not present ""a big new bazooka"", and rather offered ""a well-engineered extension of all well-known instruments to ensure that the current level of monetary accommodation is extended until at least the spring of 2022."" The British pound fell as post-Brexit trade talks were extended to the weekend. The US dollar also weakened after data showed that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits for the first time rose last week, as COVID-19 cases continued to climb, leading to more restrictions.

299,"Criminal cartel case against ANZ, investment banks heading to trial",markets,"  Criminal cartel case against ANZ, investment banks heading to trial Some of Australia's top bankers from ANZ, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup Global Markets have been committed for trial on criminal cartel charges. The banks and executives John McLean, Rick Moscati, Michael Ormaechea, Michael Richardson, Stephen Roberts and Itay Tuchman were committed from the NSW Local Court on Tuesday. The upcoming trial will be heard in the Federal Court and will relate to criminal breaches of Australian consumer law. This case has a long, complex history — starting with a two-year investigation by the competition watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), and resulting in criminal charges brought by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. The corporate regulator ASIC also sued ANZ in relation to the alleged cartel conduct, as part of a separate lawsuit. Those proceedings have been halted pending the outcome of the case brought by the ACCC. The criminal charges relate to ANZ issuing an extra $2.5 billion worth of shares, in August 2015, which it sold to institutional investors. The banks and executives have denied the allegations and have been defending the proceedings since 2018. The sale was organised and underwritten by Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and a third major global bank, JP Morgan, to boost ANZ's balance sheet in accordance with demands from the bank regulator APRA. As is normal in these so-called share placements, the underwriters agreed to buy any shares that other investors did not want. Often, there aren't any left over — but this time almost a third of the shares, worth about $790 million, didn't sell. That left the three big investment banks with a chunk of ANZ shares they would eventually need to offload. The world of underwriting share sales generally goes on unnoticed in the boardrooms of big investment banks — at least until the ACCC gets involved with a criminal cartel court case. But what do underwriters do? The allegation made by the ACCC is that the three investment banks and ANZ, through some of their most senior executives, came to an understanding about how these shares were to be dealt with. JP Morgan is not facing charges because it blew the whistle and was granted immunity. For companies, the maximum fine for each criminal cartel offence is either $10 million, or three times the total benefits that have been earned and are ""reasonably attributable"" to the commission of the offence (whichever is greater). If the total value of the benefits cannot be determined, then the maximum penalty is 10 per cent of the company's annual turnover connected with Australia. For individuals, the maximum sentence is 10 years' imprisonment, a fine of up to $420,000, or both.

300,ASX edges up as insurance industry appeals shock COVID payout ruling,markets,"  Global markets stumble as US coronavirus restrictions ramp up, ASX edges higher The Australian share market has ended the day slightly higher, reversing its initial falls, while business confidence has continued to rebound. The ASX 200 ended Tuesday up 0.2 per cent to 6,688 points. The best-performing stock on the benchmark index was superannuation services provider Link Administration (+13.3pc), which hit a nine-month high after the company received a new takeover offer. The rising price of gold (+0.4pc) also pushed Australian resource companies with links to the precious metal upwards, including Perseus Mining (+6.1pc), Silver Lake Resources (+6.4pc) and Ramelius Resources (+5.2pc). On the flipside, Tuesday's worst performers were G8 Education (-6.6pc), Zip Co (-4.3pc) and Whitehaven Coal (-6.2pc). Shares in Woodside were down 0.2 per cent, outperforming the broader energy sector, after chief executive Peter Coleman announced that he would retire in the second half of next year. The company said it had commenced a search for the next chief executive. The major bank stocks were mixed, with ANZ and NAB both up 0.3 per cent, Commonwealth Bank (+1.3pc) rising, and Westpac shares were lower (-0.6pc). ANZ, along with Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and six executives, have been committed to stand trial on criminal cartel charges. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) first brought the case against the banks in 2018, over allegations of cartel behaviour during a $2.5 billion share placement in 2015. Shares in Insurance Australian Group rose very slightly (0.4pc) on news the insurance industry is set to appeal a court decision that has shocked the sector. The case in the NSW Court of Appeal involved a Melbourne heath food store and a caravan park in Tamworth that lost money during COVID-19 shutdowns and were then both denied payouts by their insurers. The Insurance Council of Australia and the financial regulator, AFCA, took the case to court to test the law. In a surprise decision, the Court unanimously ruled in the favour of the two small businesses on the grounds that their insurers' policies referred to the now redundant Quarantine Act, which was replaced by another act a few years ago. That sent shockwaves through the industry and had some companies setting aside provisions for unexpected payouts. The Insurance Council of Australia has now confirmed it will appeal the ruling in the High Court of Australia. Its chief executive, Andrew Hall, said polices that were intending to cover pandemics have already been paid out in Australia. ""If the industry is forced to pay out for risks it has not collected premiums for, or sought reinsurance for, it would compromise our ability to provide the Australian business market with protection against other risks."" Lawyers for the businesses at the centre of the action have not received the grounds for appeal. The ICA is also set to lodge another test case involving insurer QBE. NAB's monthly business survey showed both confidence and conditions rose last month, as restrictions eased and state borders reopened. It was the fourth-straight month of rising business confidence, with the index lifting to +12 from +3 in October, and it was evident across all industries except construction and mining. ""Encouragingly, business confidence saw another large rise, driven by an improvement in Victoria. Conditions also saw gains and, importantly, this was evident across most states,"" NAB chief economist Alan Oster said. Trading and profitability drove the improvement in conditions, to +9 from +2 in October, but employment continued to lag. ""While activity is picking up as the economy reopens, businesses are yet to move back into hiring mode,"" Mr Oster said. ""This is not completely surprising with the labour market often lagging developments in activity — so we will keep closely watching this measure."" The recession may technically be ending but it will take much longer for Australia's economy to get back to where it was before the pandemic, as wages stagnate, unemployment remains high and cuts to Government subsidies loom, Stephen Long writes. Meantime, the weekly ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence survey rose to its highest level this year. Views on current and future economic conditions rose, as did the indicator of whether people think it's a good time to buy a major household item. It followed the better-than-expected return to economic growth in the September quarter, reported last week. ""This is the first time in 18 months that confidence is higher than it was a year prior. We believe that this bodes well for year-end spending,"" ANZ's head of Australian economics David Plank said. The Australian dollar was slightly stronger against the greenback, buying around 74.25 US cents. Ahead of its annual general meeting, Bank of Queensland released an update on coronavirus loan deferrals. At the end of November, 3 per cent of the bank's total home loan portfolio and small business loans remained deferred. National house prices continue to withstand the otherwise devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but how long will this last asks Nassim Khadem. That's 2,500 home loans and 3,300 business loans with a total balance of $1.3 billion. It's down from the peak in June, when $7.2 billion worth of Bank of Queensland loans were deferred. ""It is really pleasing to see the vast majority of our customers who accessed the banking relief package resuming repayments,"" chief executive George Franzis said. As of October 31, the banking regulator APRA said $87.6 billion, or 3.3 per cent of total loans, remained deferred across the banking system. Shares in Bank of Queensland closed down by 1 per cent at $7.80. New Zealand's central bank wants to reinstate tighter mortgage lending restrictions from March next year, due to concerns about an increase in highly-leveraged borrowing. The Reserve Bank has launched a $100 billion bond buying program as it wrestles with the hit from COVID-19 to the economy, so what does it involve and how does it work? The Reserve Bank of New Zealand said it will accept submissions on the reintroduction of loan-to-value ratio (LVR) restrictions, which were removed in April to free up the credit during the pandemic. ""Since then, the economy has performed better than expected, and the housing market has proved resilient,"" RBNZ deputy governor Geoff Bascand said. ""In addition, lending at higher LVRs has risen, particularly for investors, and there are signs that this trend is accelerating."" The restrictions set a ceiling on the percentage of new lending banks can offer at high LVRs. If the pre-coronavirus limits are reintroduced, banks would be able to make up to 20 per cent of new loans with an LVR above 80 per cent for owner-occupiers, and 5 per cent with LVRs of above 70 per cent for investors. During the US session overnight, the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 closed lower but the Nasdaq made gains as technology stocks including Apple, Facebook and Tesla rose. California introduced sweeping measures, with stay-at-home orders and business trading restrictions in place in some of its most densely populated regions. Meanwhile, investors were closely watching US Congress, where negotiations are taking place between Republicans and Democrats over a further coronavirus relief package. ""I think what you are seeing today is a focus on the short term with the shutdown,"" MAI Capital Management chief equity strategist Christopher Grisanti told Reuters. The rise in coronavirus cases globally put pressure on oil prices and sent energy stocks lower. Energy was the worst performing sector on the S&P 500, down more than 2 per cent. In Europe, the German and French stock markets ended in the red overnight, while London's FTSE edged higher. The British pound fell, down 0.5 per cent against the US dollar at 8:50am AEDT, as UK and European Union leaders failed to reach an agreement during last-ditch trade talks. Negotiators have been trying to strike a post-Brexit trade deal, ahead of the transition period for the UK to leave the EU ending on December 31. At one point overnight, the pound fell by more than 1.5 per cent against the greenback but later trimmed those losses. In a statement, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said ""significant difference"" remained on several critical issues, and a face-to-face meeting would be held in Brussels in coming days. ""The true deadline (for a deal) will likely be at some point at the end of this week, which could mean a week full of drama,"" OANDA senior market analyst Edward Moya said. Commonwealth Bank currency strategist Kim Mundy expects the pound to fall further in the short-term if no post-Brexit trade agreement is reached.

301,ASX continues to rise; Victoria and NSW lose AAA credit ratings,markets,"  Australian shares start Monday on a high, as iron ore price continues to surge Australians shares have closed the day on another high, as iron ore prices hit an almost eight-year record. The benchmark ASX 200 closed Monday up 0.6 per cent to 6,675 points. At one point during the day, the benchmark even hit its highest level since late February, when the economic impacts of the pandemic began. In context, the market has surged by more than 12 per cent in the past five weeks, driven by COVID vaccine optimism. It closed last Friday on a high for the fifth week in a row. The All Ordinaries also finished the day 0.6 per cent higher at 6,908. The rise came as iron ore prices continued to surge (+5.8pc) above $US145 a tonne, driven by strong demand from China and supply concerns fuelled by disappointing forecasts by Brazilian miner Vale SA. Prices for one of Australia's biggest exports are now at the highest level since March 2013. CBA analyst Vivek Dhar said the rise was linked to another decline in China's iron ore port stockpiles. ""China's iron ore port stocks have now contracted for three consecutive weeks to December 4, indicating growing deficit conditions. The last time that happened was mid-June 2020,"" he said. China is overwhelmingly the world's biggest buyer of the commodity, at roughly 70 per cent of demand. Some of Monday's best-performing stocks include one of Australia's biggest iron ore miners, Fortescue Metals. It was up 3.8 per cent. Nickel miner Western Areas is also up (+4.1pc) along with coal miner Whitehaven (+5pc). Supermarket, liquor and hardware retailer Metcash was the day's top performer after it surged 10.3 per cent cent to $3.55. That is the stock's highest level since May 2018. The leap came as Metcash announced a 43 per cent rise in underlying profit expectations for the first half of 2021. It told shareholders its supermarket division has done especially well due to people staying home during the pandemic. On the flip side, international education provider IDP was Monday's worst performer. The company has been hit badly by the loss of international students during the pandemic, but its stocks had been rising again in recent weeks as COVID-19 restrictions eased. It lost 4.9 per cent on Monday to $21.37, which still leaves it well above its crash down to near $10 back in March. As of 4:30pm AEST, the Australian dollar was slightly higher (+0.1pc) at 74.30 US cents. Wall Street closed last week on new record highs as well. The Dow Jones was up 0.8 per cent to 30,218 points while the S&P 500 had risen even more (+0.9pc) to 4,699. The Nasdaq was also up 0.7 per cent to 12,464. Global ratings agency S&P has downgraded Victoria's rating from the highest level AAA down two ratings to AA. Victoria had held the agency's highest credit score since February 2003 but S&P said it is downgrading it after COVID-19 dealt it ""a severe economic and fiscal shock"". ""Although we see some prospect of fiscal repair, this is unlikely to occur within the next three years and unlikely to substantially improve key financial metrics to support a higher rating,"" the agency said. ""This could ease pressure on the state's growing debt burden."" S&P has also downgraded NSW from AAA down one step to AA+. NSW had also held that rating since 2003. Last week, Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe told a Parliamentary Hearing that agency ratings were more important for bragging rights than economic kudos. ""A downgrade of credit ratings doesn't concern me,"" he said. ""The AAA credit rating had more political symbolism than economic importance. It was important that we have disciplined fiscal policy and a credible medium-term plan, but a downgrading of the credit ratings from AAA to one notch below that is not of economic concern. ""What is of more concern is that people don't have jobs."" Meanwhile, ANZ data has found job listings are rising in Victoria as the state continues to emerge from lockdown. Adverts nationally were up 13.9 per cent in November, which the bank's analysts put down to Melbourne re-opening. However, job listings for November were still down 3.3 per cent, year on year. ""[Jobs listings] are on track to match or even exceed pre-COVID levels by year end,"" senior economist, Catherine Birch, said. ""This suggests that the rebound in national employment could continue into early-2021 at least, although the lagged recovery in full-time employment remains a concern. ""There are other challenges to face in 2021, not least the end of JobKeeper. Even if employment gains persist, it will be a lot longer before underutilisation can be brought back down to a satisfactory rate."" The major bank has continued selling off assets to boost its cash position. Westpac needs to cover potential bad debts as COVID-19 continues and it has been hit with fines for breaching money laundering laws. On Monday, the bank announced plans to sell its Pacific businesses in Fiji and PNG for up to $420m to Port Moresby-based Kina Bank. Westpac expects to incur a $230 million accounting loss from this deal. The announcement comes days after Westpac sold its general insurance division to German company Allianz for more than $700 million. This all comes after the financial regulator started forcing Westpac to boost the amount of cash it holds by 10 per cent. That means it can't lend out that money and make a profit off it. The bank finished Monday flat at $20.27. Financial services company iSignthis has acknowledged a case lodged by the corporate regulator. ASIC announced on Monday that it is commencing proceedings against the listed company and its managing director Nickolas John Karantzis. The proceedings allege breaches by iSignthis of its continuous disclosure obligations and allege false and misleading representations under the Corporations Act. The ASX had already suspended the company from trade earlier this year. Meanwhile, the share price of e-commerce retailer Kogan rose 3.8 per cent, after it was ordered to pay just $350,000 in fines for dodgy tax-time sales offers. The Federal Court found the retailer misled customers by advertising 10 per cent discounts at tax time in 2018, when at the same time it had actually increased prices of more than 600 products by 10 per cent at the same time. ""In many cases, consumers who used the promotional code to purchase these products paid the same as, or more than, they would have paid before or after the promotion,"" the ACCC's chair Rod Sims said. As well as the fine, Kogan has been ordered to pay the consumer watchdog's costs for prosecuting the case. Breaches of consumer law can attract fines of up to $10 million. The retailer was also fined in 2016 for raising prices on computer monitors just before it put them on sale during a Father's Day special.

303,"Freedom Foods accounting scandal worsens, with ASIC now investigating",markets,"  Freedom Foods accounting scandal worsens, as ASIC begins its investigation Cereal and snack-maker Freedom Foods is being investigated by the corporate regulator ASIC for a series of ""significant"" accounting problems. The beleaguered company also said that its earnings would be hurt by $590 million in write-downs. In a flurry of announcements made after the ASX had closed on Monday, the company revealed that its past financial results were inaccurate, among other revelations. Freedom reported, in October last year, that it earned a full-year profit of $11.6 million. But that figure has now been ""restated"" as a $145.8 million loss. The cereal business also confessed its losses had since widened to $174.5 million in the last financial year (ending June 30, 2020). Also, two of Freedom's board members — chairman Perry Gunner and non-executive director Trevor Allen — will retire in late January, close to its next annual general meeting. The announcement of their departure comes just five months after former chief executive Rory Macleod, and then-chief financial officer Campbell Nicholas, were forced to quit. In the wake of their removal, Michael Perich was appointed interim CEO; the Perich family are Australia's largest dairy farming family, and own 54 per cent of Freedom Foods. Freedom shares have been suspended from trading since June. The company's shares last traded at about $3, having peaked at $7 in September 2018. Freedom's board received a frosty reception from shareholders at a hastily convened webcast on Monday evening, following the news. Callers questioned company oversight and the scope of the $590 million write-down, of which $372.8 million is linked to asset values being slashed. It was explained that Freedom has incurred enormous costs building machinery to handle its new product lines, but did not put it down as an ""expense"" in its books. The company also wrote down its goodwill and brands by $75.9 million. It also had to write down $60.1 million due to ""out-of-date, unsaleable and obsolete inventory"". ""These accounting treatments contributed to decisions on new products and expansions that were based on unrealistic assessments of market opportunities and margin assumptions that were not realised,"" Freedom said in a statement. ""As a result, too many group products were sold at prices that did not fully recover their costs."" Mr Perich said it was a deeply disappointing set of results for Freedom Food Group, its people and its shareholders. ""The results reflect the significant costs of past accounting and operational matters — matters we have identified with the assistance of independent experts and are taking steps to remedy,"" he said. To turn around the fix its balance sheet, the company needs to raise an extra $280 million. Freedom said it was in ""exclusive, advanced discussions with a new investor"", but it also planned to give existing shareholders ""an opportunity to participate"" in the turnaround. Basically, shareholders were being asked to stump up more cash. The request didn't go down well during Monday's webcast. ""Why should I throw good money after bad?"" asked one frustrated shareholder. Mr Gunner said Freedom's problems were due to its ""fast"" pace of growth, and the board was keen to address those issues by simplifying the business. Curiously, the company also decided to publish its updated ""Securities Trading Policy"" to the public on Monday. The policy contained a section that bans insider trading, which is already illegal under Australian law. Under its policy, ""Restricted persons"" (defined as employees) cannot deal in shares of the company if they have ""inside information"". Nor can they buy or sell shares of Freedom during ""closed trading periods"". Basically, they have to wait for at least one day after the company's results are announced to the ASX. Alarm bells rang in March when it was discovered that payments had been made to some employees, including senior management, without permission from the board. Mr Gunner said the company did not find out until after this had occurred. ""During the year ended 30 June 2020, the board identified matters regarding the operation and administration of the group's equity incentive plan (EIP),"" the company's external auditor Deloitte wrote in its report. ""The matters included the granting of previously undisclosed employee share options and/or extension of the expiry date of share options by management between September 2014 and September 2019."" ""Certain of these employee share options granted and/or extensions were not authorised ... by the board."" An audit by Deloitte and a forensic accounting investigation by PwC have discovered some ""significant"" accounting problems for the company, dating back a few years. In addition to the internal probe, Freedom now has to contend with an external regulator in ASIC, which can wield its power in punitive ways. Freedom said that ASIC had formally requested documents from the company as part of its investigation, and that it was cooperating with the regulator.

304,"Cattle are fetching record prices, but don't expect to pay more for your beef",markets," ABC Rural Cattle producers enjoy record prices, but it could impact international competition Cattle producers are enjoying record prices, but experts say the short-term gain could prove to be a double-edged sword for industry as it looks to rebuild from all-time low national herd numbers. Industry experts say low herd numbers could undermine Australia's competitiveness as an exporter The Western Young Cattle Market Indicator this week reached 813 cents per kilo carcass weight, while Eastern Indicator hit highs of 805.25c/kg carcass weight. Industry players say the high prices are being driven by a ""perfect storm"" of factors including strong competition from domestic processors and the live export sector. But improved conditions on the east coast, on the back of widespread rainfall after a prolonged period of drought, has been tipped as the key driver. Pastoralist Darren Cousens is based at Hillview Station, about 70 kilometres south east of Meekatharra in Western Australia's remote Midwest-Gascoyne region. Mr Cousens has sold of the majority of his herd this year in a bid to take advantage of the healthy prices, with some lines of his pastoral cattle fetching around 100 per cent more for his Droughtmaster X Shorthorn than in 2019. ""The prices have trebled our income, so now we can have some expendable income to keep improving infrastructure around the station,"" he said. ""Last year cattle prices were so low we only mustered half the station, but this year we're getting price premiums that are up to 100 per cent higher. ""In 2019 we sent out four decks of cattle at about $10,000 a deck, this year we sent out six decks of cattle for about $28,000 a deck."" Figures released by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development show almost 70,000 head have moved east to-date in 2020 — a stark contrast to the 7,500 that were transported along the Nullarbor via Ceduna in 2019. Mr Cousens said the majority of his young cattle have been sent east, where producers are now rebuilding their herds amid favourable conditions. While the significant returns have been welcomed by producers, attention has now turned to how those producers who have sold off significant numbers can rebuild next season. Mr Cousens said his herd numbers were now critically low at around 600 head and he feared the challenging conditions and high cattle prices would impact, if and how, the business would re-stock. ""We're at breaking point with the number of breeders that we have on the ground now, if we go any lower we're not going to be viable,"" he said. ""Its hard when you've spent nine years trying to build a herd and then you've got to sell off because you can't feed them … the other side of the sword is what it's going to take to restock if the season changes."" Current market conditions have also presented significant challenges for other players in the market. One of WA's largest meat processors, V&V Walsh, based in Bunbury in the state's south west, has temporarily scaled back beef processing due to increasingly thin margins. While the business is dramatically expanding its sheep slaughter capacity, a sign of its confidence in the future of the lamb market, chief financial officer Brent Dancer said the ""unforeseen"" cattle prices were a major hurdle for processors. ""These are crazy prices and I think there has to be a balancing point at some stage,"" he said. ""As a processor we're really starting to see that ceiling regarding cost of production. ""With reduced channels being opened due to COVID we're getting to a point where we're really going to struggle to grow our numbers or even continue to do the same numbers. ""Beef will always be a part of our business, but with prices where they are the moment we're seeing a real breaking point."" Michael Noonan is a stock agent with clients across New South Wales and Queensland and has worked in the sector for more than four decades. Mr Noonan said he had not seen such a strong appetite for WA livestock out of the east since the last major east coast drought in 2010. He said herd numbers had become so low across Australia, there would be lasting implications for the industry. ""The dry situation was unique in the sense that livestock were still making pretty good money, we had never seen a drought situation where livestock have been making so much money,"" Mr Noonan said. ""When you add up the totals of the national sheep flock and the cattle herd for the whole of Australia, we're at the lowest levels in 100 years. ""Our population has grown and we're feeding a lot more people with a lot fewer animals. ""The number of breeders coming from WA — and they're coming in big numbers, and it will rain there one day — and all of a sudden the maths will dictate that they're too dear to handle."" Nutrien auctioneer Chris Waddingham said competition from the east coast was particularly hot for light weight cattle. ""From an economies-of-scale point of view, the east coast will be able to put more light cattle in a truck,"" he said. ""From the domestic purchases point of view, many come to a sale with a specific amount of money they want to spend and with high prices they've been pushed down in their weights."" Mecardo analyst Adrian Ladaniwskyj said the high prices could be undermining the industry's competitiveness as an international exporter if the current market continued over the medium to long term. ""The prices for Australian cattle are currently the highest in the world, particularly among exporting nations,"" he said. ""Prices are higher in Australia than in the US and they are historically the highest cost producer. ""What that means for Australia is that because we're the most expensive it means our competitiveness in the medium term could be eroded by this. ""Domestic cattle prices need to come down to allow processors to start making significant profits again, and to be competitive again into international markets. ""Or international prices for beef need to rise and the latter I think is not going to happen, there's a lot of supply from much lower cost countries such as South America."" Mr Ladaniwskyj said the prices would not necessarily correlate with higher prices at the supermarket checkout. ""Supermarkets, wholesalers and retail butchers will adjust their prices in order to maximise total profit, or maintain market share, which won't necessarily mean the total price rise for cattle will be translated to the shop shelf,"" he said.

305,"ASX falls on China wine tariffs, COVID-19 vaccine rally subsides",markets,"  Australian shares fall on China wine tariffs, COVID-19 vaccine rally subsides Australian shares ended their day lower after China announced it would impose crippling tariffs on Australian wine imports from tomorrow. The benchmark ASX 200 lost 35 points (-0.5pc) to close at 6,601, its second consecutive day of losses. Despite that, the market has notched a four-week winning streak, and has surged 11.4 per cent since the month began. Earlier this week, the ASX hit a nine-month high as border restrictions eased nationally. The market optimism was driven by the Reserve Bank's decision to cut interest rates to almost zero earlier this month, and several announcements from pharmaceutical companies Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca about the positive results of their COVID vaccine results. Wall Street was closed for the Thanksgiving public holiday on Thursday (local time). Earlier this week, its industrial-skewed index, the Dow Jones, hit a milestone when it pushed above 30,000 for the first time, on the vaccine developments and US President Donald Trump (effectively) conceding the election. But the optimism has since been tempered by concerns about rising COVID-19 cases in Europe and the US, and worries that some vaccines may not live up to the hype. By 5:45pm AEDT, the Australian dollar had risen to 73.78 US cents. Spot gold has slipped (-0.1pc) to $US1,808.50 an ounce, while Brent crude oil was flat at $US47.84 a barrel. Several of today's best performers were gold miners like Perseus Mining (+3.1pc), Gold Road Resources (+2pc) and Evolution Mining (+2pc). Meanwhile, Bega Cheese surged (+8.9pc), after emerging from a four-day trading halt. The company raised $284 million from an institutional capital raising to fund its takeover of Lion Dairy & Drinks — a deal worth $560 million. Travel and energy stocks suffered heavy losses, like Webjet (-3.2pc), Flight Centre (-2.9pc), Oil Search (-3.7pc) and Beach Energy (-3.8pc). Banks and miners were the biggest drag on the market, including Westpac (-0.9pc), ANZ (-0.7pc), BHP (-1.3pc) and Rio Tinto (-0.8pc). Shares in Australia's biggest wine company, Treasury Wine Estates (TWE), have gone into a sudden trading halt, after a staggering 11.3 per cent plunge. The company is perhaps better known for its brands Penfolds, Wolf Blass and Lindeman's. China has announced preliminary findings of an anti-dumping investigation into Australia's billion-dollar annual export industry, and has declared that dumping exists and has caused Chinese winemakers ""substantial harm"". The investigation isn't due to conclude until next year, but China's Commerce Ministry has announced from tomorrow, importers of all Australian wine entering China will need to need to pay temporary ""anti-dumping security deposits"". The deposits, which effectively work like tariffs, will range from between 107 per cent to more than 200 per cent. The move comes after China's Commerce Ministry gave informal instructions to importers to suspend orders of wine and six other types of Australian exports earlier this month. TWE plans to lift its trading halt on Tuesday — or earlier, depending on when it updates the market on the impact of the tariffs. The company that owns Radio Rentals shops and services that lease products and loan money to largely low-income clients has reported yet another half-yearly loss. Thorn Group posted a net loss of $1.1 million. That followed a $25.6 million loss in the same period last year. Its share price fell (-3.2pc) to 15 cents. Five years ago, its shares were fetching a much higher amount ($1.96). The company told the ASX that the latest losses were linked to it restricting credit, losses generally from COVID-19 and its decision to permanently close some stores. It has been closing bricks-and-mortar stores to focus on digital sales. It said its provisions to do this had increased from $39.4 million to $50.9 million. The company has been hit by a slew of fines in recent years for irresponsible sales and lending practices. Most recently, it settled a class action for its 'Rent, Try, $1 Buy' scheme for $20 million.

306,"ASX drops from nine-month high, as COVID-19 vaccine rally stumbles",markets,"  Australian shares drop from nine-month high, as COVID-19 vaccine rally stumbles Australian shares have snapped a three-day winning streak, with investors cashing out after an unusually strong November rally — boosted by COVID-19 vaccine euphoria. The ASX 200 index closed 50 points (-0.7pc) lower at 6,636. For the past three days, the benchmark index had posted solid gains, and climbed to its highest level since late February. The broader All Ordinaries dropped (-0.6pc) to 6849 points, also down from a nine-month high. Despite today's falls, the Australian market has surged 12 per cent since the month began. It helped that the Reserve Bank has cut interest rates to almost zero and ramped up its quantitative easing program, by pledging to buy $100 billion worth of government bonds. But it was the announcements from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca about the effectiveness of their coronavirus vaccines which provided the biggest boost to the ASX in recent weeks. Technology, consumer and gold stocks were today's best performers, including Harvey Norman (+5.5pc), Resolute Mining (+4.6pc), Zip Co (+3.6pc) and Kogan (+5.2pc). On the flip side, energy and financial stocks suffered the heaviest falls, like Virgin Money UK (-11.5pc), Worley (-5.7pc) and Whitehaven Coal (-3.6pc). Banks and mining giants were the biggest drag, including Commonwealth Bank (-1.5pc), Westpac (-1.3pc), ANZ (-1.7pc), NAB (-2.4pc), BHP (-0.6pc) and Rio Tinto (-1.4pc). Travel stocks like Qantas (-2.3pc), Flight Centre (-0.8pc) and Webjet (-2.2pc) were sold down, after rising sharply in the past few days. Earlier this week, travel stocks received a massive boost when border restrictions between all the major states except Western Australia were lifted. By 5:10pm AEDT, the Australian dollar was slightly lower (-0.1pc) at 73.6 US cents. Gold had recovered (+0.2pc) to $US1,809.16 an ounce, while Brent crude had risen (+0.5pc) to $US48.83 a barrel. Investors shrugged off the latest data from the Bureau of Statistics, which showed a bigger-than-expected fall in business spending. Private capital expenditure fell (-3pc) to $25.85 billion in the September quarter compared with the June quarter. This was much steeper than the 1.5 per cent drop economists were expecting. Compared to the same time last year, private capital expenditure is down by a steep 13.8 per cent. Senior economist at BIS Oxford Economics, Sean Langcake, said private investment was already ""undershooting expectations"" before the pandemic. ""The pandemic has only exacerbated this weakness by increasing uncertainty around the outlook and straining business profitability,"" he said. Bega Cheese has confirmed it will buy the drinks and dairy arm owned by Japanese conglomerate Kirin Holdings & Lion for $560 million. The sale is expected to take place in early 2021. Lion has been trying to sell its dairy portfolio since October 2018, when it decided to concentrate on expanding its beer business including James Squire, Little Creatures, Tooheys and XXXX. It had tried to sell the Australian drinks arm to the Chinese company Mengniu for $600m, but that sale was blocked by the Australian Government as it became ensnared in geopolitical tensions. The deal with Bega Cheese includes several iconic brands sold in Australian supermarkets including Dairy Farmers, Big M, Vitasoy, Yoplait, and Pura Milk. Bega Cheese has been in a trading halt since last week when the sale was rumoured heavily in the media. It is set to resume trade next week. Back in Australia, Telstra has admitted to unconscionable conduct during its sales of mobile phone plans to Indigenous consumers. The announcement comes after an 18-month investigation by the consumer watchdog. In a statement, the corporation's chief executive Andrew Penn apologised again for the failings. At 11:00am AEDT, its share price had opened very slightly higher at $3.10 or 0.2 per cent up. Overnight, there was also muted news out of the United States. A Labor Department report there found more people were signing up for unemployment benefits as the country continues to grapple with the pandemic. And that comes as welfare programs there are set to expire the day after Christmas. ""The economic data is not good, and we know it won't be good for some time given this new wave of the virus,"" New York investment strategist, Tim Ghriskey, said. ""There's a reality setting in that while the vaccine will start being distributed fairly quickly, the virus isn't going away quickly and therefore the timeline for economic improvement is getting pushed out."" The Dow Jones index closed down 0.6 per cent at 29,872. The S&P 500 finished 0.2 per cent down to 3,630. Both indices hit record highs yesterday due to COVID-19 vaccine euphoria and the removal of political uncertainty after US President Donald Trump authorised a transition of power to Joe Biden (without explicitly conceding the election). However, tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.5 per to close at 12,094 as pandemic-resilient technology stocks continued to buoy the US market.

307,ASX on a high as border restrictions between NSW and Victoria drop,markets,"  ASX on a high as border restrictions between NSW and Victoria drop and investors feel optimistic The Australian share market has closed at a nine-month high, with the lifting of border restrictions between New South Wales and Victoria creating a renewed sense of optimism. The country's two biggest states have been officially reunited after four months apart. Qantas started Monday's trading by announcing plans to boost passenger capacity and add more flights between Sydney and Melbourne. The airline said its capacity would rise from 30 per cent of pre-COVID levels, to 40 per cent. Qantas said further easing of restrictions between other states could see its domestic capacity rise to as high as 60 per cent by Christmas. It closed trade 1.7 per cent higher at $5.36. That was its highest price since its shares crashed to just $2.03 in March, when the Federal Government shut down the entire country and closed borders due to COVID-19. The company that owns Sydney airport also rose 1.2 per cent to $6.89. The benchmark ASX 200 overall rose quickly on open and finished 0.3 per cent higher at 6,562. That upwards rise follows overall steady growth in recent weeks and takes the benchmark to its highest price since late February, when COVID-19 restrictions started slamming the country. Energy and technology stocks were trading up on the news of easing restrictions. Resources companies BHP and Fortescue Metals jumped 2.5 per cent and 3.9 per cent respectively. Iron ore futures also pushed higher as mills in China reported shrinking steel inventories. The Australian dollar had an unremarkable day and finished steady at 73.13 US cents. Meanwhile, Village Roadshow surged 16.3 per cent after the theme park operator received a sweetened takeover bid from suitor, BGH Capital. Regenerative drug-maker Mesoblast was the best performing stock of the day after it announced it was working with Novartis. The $50m deal involves the development of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is the main cause of death for COVID-19 patients. Mesoblast's shares soared 17.9 per cent to finish at $4.28. Meanwhile, its competitor Avita Therapeutics dropped 3.5pc. Insurance Australia Group was the hardest hit of the ASX 200 companies on Monday. Its stock fell 5.9 per cent to $5.14. The company went into a trading halt last Wednesday after a test case about COVID-19 payouts by insurance companies returned a surprise result in favour of small businesses who've lost revenue due to lockdowns. That result has rocked the insurance industry and could mean insurers face hundreds of millions of dollars in extra payouts. Following the court ruling, IAG said it expected to take a $805 million hit to its 2021 earnings. It resumed trade today, after raising $650m by issuing new shares to the market at a discount. It sold 128.7m new shares at a price of $5.05, a 7.5 per cent discount to its closing share price, before it went into a trading halt. The corporate regulator has confirmed that it is investigating an outage that brought trade to a halt last week. Last Monday the ASX was open for just 24 minutes before its systems froze. That meant people could not buy or sell any shares for the entire day. The outage came after the nation's stock exchange operator updated its software, and came as an embarrassing blow to a platform that prides itself on sophisticated technology. Corporate regulator ASIC has now announced it will investigate the outage. In a statement, the ASX said it would ""cooperate fully"". ""ASX acknowledges that this is appropriate given ASIC's regulatory oversight,"" it said. The ASX also confirmed that the issues with its Centre Point had been fixed and that the platform, that allows investors to make anonymous transactions, would be back operational on Tuesday. The ASX, which is itself a listed entity, is down 0.6 per cent on the news. US stocks closed lower on Friday as investors wrestled with fiscal stimulus developments, concerns over a lengthy rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, and a growing number of shutdowns there. Technology companies in demand during lockdowns, such as video conferencing platform Zoom and streaming platform Netflix, helped curb the Nasdaq's losses and had it settling a bit higher. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and the Dow posted marginal losses for the week.

308,ASX drops with energy stocks leading the fall,markets,"  ASX loses ground despite early signs of COVID-19 vaccine hopes boosting the index Australian shares closed lower after the US Treasury Secretary pulled the plug on more coronavirus stimulus for companies. The local market fell slightly in early trade before picking on conflicting signs of more US pandemic relief. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said pandemic lending programs for business would expire at the end of the year. However, the benchmark index lost ground in afternoon trade and closed down 0.1 per cent to 6,539. Energy stocks led the fall but education, healthcare and banking stocks rose. Insurance Australia Group intends to raise up to $750 million after a New South Wales court decision which found businesses could make insurance claims for lockdown losses. It said it will set aside $865 million before tax to cover potential payouts. IAG remains in a trading halt. Miner BHP fell (-1pc) while Rio Tinto rose (+0.5pc). Iron ore prices fell to $US122.84 a tonne. The banking regulator announced it would reduce the amount of money that the Commonwealth Bank was ordered to keep on its book after it broke anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism laws. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority ordered the CBA to hold an extra $1 billion in capital reserves after a damning report in May, 2018. The report found the CBA had a ""widespread sense of complacency, a reactive stance in dealing with risks, being insular and not learning from experience and mistakes. APRA said the bank had made improvements in governance, accountability and managing risks after the regulator forced it to fix up the problems. ""In recognition of the work undertaken by CBA to date, APRA has reduced the add-on to its operational risk capital requirement to $500 million, effective immediately,"" it said. CBD shares closed 1.4 per cent higher. Mesoblast has signed a potentially lucrative deal with global pharmaceutical firm Novartis for the development, manufacture and commercialisation of its remestemcel-L medicine with the initial focus on the treatment of acute respiratory illness including COVID-19. The biotech company made a loss of $US24.5 million over the September quarter as revenue slumped by more than 90 per cent while research and development costs increased. It was the top performer in the ASX 200, up 11.3 per cent. Regis Healthcare has rebuffed a more than half a billion dollar takeover bid from conglomerate Washington H. Soul Pattinson. The aged care operator said the sweetened $1.85 a share offer was still too low. And Sydney Airport saw passenger numbers slump 94 per cent last month because of the international travel ban and state and territory border restrictions. The Australian dollar steadied at 72.92 US cents at 4:35pm (AEDT). Brent crude, the international benchmark, picked up in futures trade. Spot gold dropped by 0.2 per cent to $US1,865 an ounce on a stronger greenback. Preliminary retail turnover increased by 1.6 per cent, seasonally adjusted, in October according to the Bureau of Statistics (ABS) thanks to lifting of Melbourne's coronavirus lockdown. People returned to cafes, restaurants and takeaway food stores. They also bought more clothes, shoes, and accessories, and other retail goods. Consumer spending rose 7.3 per cent when compared to October, 2019. Ben James, ABS Director of Quarterly Economy Wide Surveys, said the figures were good news. ""The reopening of retail stores in Victoria at the end of October led to a boost to all industries, with the exception of food retailing,"" he said. ""Victoria rose 5.2 per cent from September 2020 but remains 5.7 per cent below the levels of October 2019."" Sales increased by 1.6 per cent in New South Wales. CBA economist Kristina Clifton said the figures boded well for the future. ""We expect consumer spending to continue its recovery over the rest of this year and into 2021 underpinned by an improving labour market and a large pool of savings accumulated over the coronavirus pandemic."" ""The six-day shutdown currently underway in SA will impact on spending in this state in late November and perhaps early December,"" Ms Clifton said. Other ABS figures saw improved business confidence with more companies expecting revenue to pick up next month. That's after almost one quarter of firms reported an increase in their monthly income this month compared to 16 per cent in October. One in five businesses had capital spending plans for the next three months. US stocks came off their lows on optimism about another round of coronavirus relief would get through Congress after the Democrats and Republicans agreed to revive talks. That offset news that hospitalisations for COVID-19 jumped by almost 50 per cent over the past fortnight and the US death toll surpassed a quarter of a million. Schools and businesses have been closed to slow the spread of the virus with New York shutting its public schools, the biggest public school system in the country. The Dow Jones index reversed course in late trade and ended higher. It rose 0.15 per cent to 29,483. The S&P 500 index retreated from Monday's record closing high following positive data on a coronavirus vaccine, but recovered losses in late trade and rose 0.4 per cent to 3,582. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9 per cent to 11,905 with tech giants Tesla (+2.6pc), Alphabet (+1pc) and Amazon (+0.4pc) rising. Upmarket department store Macy's dropped after posting lower comparable sales. But it recovered ground in late trade to end up 2.1 per cent at $US9.18. Investors were also dismayed by new figures showing that the number of new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose as new stimulus measures remained stalled in Congress. Initial claims for state jobless benefits rose by 31,000 to 742,000, seasonally adjusted last week. Economists had predicted a little more than 700,000 new applications. The report from the US Labor Department also showed at least 20.3 million people on unemployment benefits at the end of October, seven months after the pandemic hit the United States. ANZ economist Kishti Sen said the rise in initial claims was the first in five weeks and made a sustained rebound in consumption difficult. ""The employment data isn't likely to get better in the short term, with an increasing number of restrictions placed on households,"" Mr Sen said. Other economic numbers showed that existing home sales rose 4.3 per cent to nearly 6.9 homes last month, the highest level since November 2005. In Europe, Brexit talks with the European Union were suspended after a negotiator tested positive to coronavirus. Construction in the euro area fell 2.9 per cent in September with an expansion in Germany not enough to offset a big fall in building in France and Italy. Home building and commercial construction slowed while civil engineering held up. The FTSE 100 in London put on 0.8 per cent to 6,334, the DAX in Germany rose 0.9 per cent to 13,086, and the CAC 40 in Paris gained 0.7 per cent to 5,475. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said the global economy is recovering from the depths of the depths of the coronavirus crisis, but there are signs of slowing momentum in countries with resurging infection rates. The IMF said in a new report for G20 major economies said the global recovery was uneven and warned the crisis would likely leave deep, unequal scars. In a separate blog post, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva hailed what she called significant progress in the development of vaccines to vanquish a virus that has claimed more than a million lives around the globe and resulted in tens of millions of job losses. But she cautioned that the economic path ahead remains ""difficult and prone to setbacks"". The IMF last month forecast a 2020 global contraction of 4.4 per cent, with the global economy expected to rebound to growth of 5.2 per cent in 2021, but said the outlook for many less developed economies had worsened.

309,The jobless rate increased last month as more people looked for work,markets,"  Unemployment rate rises to 7 per cent as more people look for work, but employment jumps by 179,000 Australia's unemployment rate edged higher last month as more people looked for work, but there was a strong surge in the number of people hired as Victoria's coronavirus lockdown eased. The Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said the unemployment rate rose by 0.1 per cent from 6.9 per cent in September to 7 per cent in October on a seasonally adjusted basis. The number of people out of work increased by nearly 26,000 over the month and the participation rate — the proportion of those people looking for work — lifted from 64.9 per cent to 65.8 per cent in October. That is mainly because people on the JobKeeper wage subsidy program now have to look for work and so are counted as part of the workforce. But to the surprise of economists, 178,800 jobs were created in October as employers put on more people in both full- and part-time roles. Full-time jobs increased by 97,000 and part-time jobs lifted by 81,800. The underemployment rate — people who want more hours — dropped from 11.4 per cent to 10.4 per cent. Economists surveyed by Reuters had expected the unemployment rate to rise to 7.2 per cent, and for 30,000 jobs to be lost. Around 42,500 jobs were lost in September because of Victoria's lockdown. Bjorn Jarvis, head of labour statistics at the ABS, said there was a robust gain in employment and hours worked in October. ""This strong increase means that employment in October was only 1.7 per cent below March, and reflects a large flow of people from outside the labour force back into employment,"" he said. ""Encouragingly, the rise in employment was also accompanied by a strong rise in hours worked, particularly in Victoria, where hours increased by 5.6 per cent."" Hours worked rose 1.2 per cent from 1.69 million hours to 1.71 million hours, but they were down 3.4 per cent over the year. Across the states and territories, Tasmania had the highest jobless rate. Its unemployment rate increased from 7.6 per cent in September to 8.2 per cent in October. The employment landscape may be improving, but landing a job is not easy with nearly 1 million people out of work. Two months after being stood down from her bar-tending job in Melbourne, Grace Dowling secured a casual job at a call centre, working from home. ""I consider myself incredibly fortunate, I've probably had a lot of luck and good timing,"" she told The Business program. She said it took 'squillions' of hours and job applications after she lost her hospitality job in late March, to secure the new role. ""I don't know where I would be if I hadn't managed to lock that down,"" she said. Ms Dowling did not qualify for JobKeeper because she'd been in her hospitality role less than a year and her partner earnt too much for her to get JobSeeker. ""I went from feeling relatively safe and relatively secure in my life to being unemployed with $700 in my savings account."" Single mum Suzanne Fahie is one of the 1.4 million Australians on the JobSeeker unemployment benefit. While she has work, the part-time hours as a medical receptionist are not enough to support her and her two children. ""It's not nearly enough to cover my expenses,"" she told The Business. ""It doesn't even come close to being enough and the extra $550 COVID payment was so handy, but now that they've reduced that, it's a real struggle."" The Coronavirus Supplement, announced by the Government at the start of the pandemic for welfare recipients, is being lowered as the Federal Government tapers down support measures. As the Government help winds back, Ms Fahie has slipped behind again on her bills. The number of jobs being advertised has climbed but remains significantly lower than the same time a year ago. Online job advertising platform Seek's October employment report shows an 8.5 per cent increase in the number of jobs advertised, compared to September's numbers. But the number of ads on its website remains 11.7 per cent lower than this time last year. The monthly growth was driven by a 16.4 per cent increase in Victoria as the state starts to reopen. But ads in the state are still down by one-third from a year ago. Sarah Hunter, chief economist at BIS Oxford Economics, said the easing of restrictions in Victoria drove the big surge in employment in October, with the state accounting for 81,600 of the overall increase in jobs. ""Although the headline figure hides some of the ongoing losses in the labour market ... the data clearly indicate that the positive health outcomes and fiscal and monetary support are all helping to propel a rebound in activity,"" she said. ""Assuming the pandemic remains under control, most particularly that the current lockdown in South Australia snuffs out the outbreak there, the recovery should continue going into 2021."" CommSec's chief economist Craig James said the outlook for the jobs market continued to improve and no state or territory saw a fall in the number of people employed. ""The complication in the latest data is that self-employed workers or owner-managers are flooding back to work from 'outside the labour force'. But employees are taking longer to resume work,"" he said. Employment for non-employees was 1.2 per cent higher than in March, but workers saw their employment fall by 2.4 per cent from March. Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary Sally McManus has called for more investment in job creation instead of the scaling back of employment support. ""This data shows just how hard it is to find a job for the huge numbers of working people who have fallen into unemployment during this crisis,"" she said. The official figures understate the real unemployment rate as people who have dropped out of the workforce are not included because they are not counted as unemployed. However, Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the effective unemployment rate had dropped from 9.3 per cent to 7.4 per cent. While Christmas decorations start to come out for many households, Ms Fahie is dreading the next few months. ""I don't know how we're going to get through this Christmas, things are really tough and the new school year — it's such an expensive time, it's so hard,"" the single mum said.

310,Insurance companies take a hit on the ASX as COVID test case rattles the market,markets,"  ASX lifts off lows after surprise surge in jobs in October, and insurers prepare for hit over COVID revenue losses One of Australia's biggest insurers has gone into a trading halt and others have slumped, after a surprise court ruling that has major implications for the industry's ability to deny COVID-19 payouts. The case in the NSW Court of Appeal involved a Melbourne heath food store and a caravan park in Tamworth that lost money during COVID-19 shutdowns and were then both denied payouts by their insurers. The Insurance Council of Australia and the financial regulator, AFCA, took the case to court to test the law. In a surprise decision, the Court unanimously ruled in the favour of the two small businesses on the grounds that their insurers' policies referred to a now redundant Act. The ruling follows a UK court case in September that ruled in favour of policyholders. The decision means insurers could face hundreds of millions of dollars in claims if the ruling is not successfully appealed to a higher court. On Thursday morning, Insurance Australia Group requested a trading halt until Monday so it can consider the ruling. Rival insurer QBE kept trading and said the net cost of any business interruption claims in Australia was likely to be limited to $5 million per case. By close, its shares had slumped 3.9 per cent to $10. QBE also announced that it is pursuing a second test case through AFCA. In a statement, the Insurance Council of Australia also confirmed it is in discussions for a second test case. It did not clarify if the outcome of the first case will be appealed by industry within the 28-day deadline. Meanwhile, another insurer, Suncorp, said the court ruling was not expected to affect the provisions it had set aside for business interruption claims. But it also lost 3 per cent by close. The Australian share market fell in early trade after new lockdowns in the US and South Australia weighed on confidence. But after the better-than-expected employment data was released, the market recovered lost ground. It finished the day marginally higher (0.25pc) at 6,547. The All Ordinaries index also raised by a quarter of a percent to finish at 6,742. Casino operator Crown Resorts fell as much as 6 per cent to $9.08 after it admitted money laundering likely occurred at some of its venues, and it was banned by the NSW gaming regulator from opening its new casino in Barangaroo in Sydney next month. By close, it was down 1.9 per cent to $9.46. Employment website Seek climbed to a record high of $26.45 after it predicted it would make a $50 million profit for the 2021 financial year on forecast revenue of $1.6 billion. But it declined after its peak and finished down one per cent at $25.43. Bluescope Steel rose 5.3 per cent on a trading update. Lab firm ALS (+7.9pc) did the best in the ASX 200 while farm firm Elders (-4.5pc) did the worst. By 5:00pm, the Australian dollar also came off today's lows after the employment numbers and was buying around 72.92 US cents, down 0.18 per cent. The competition watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), has granted interim authorisation to Virgin Australia and Alliance Airlines, allowing them to cooperate on 41 regional routes and two short-haul international routes. Virgin Australia currently operates services on 37 domestic routes from 28 ports, while ASX-listed Alliance Airlines provides contract, charter and regular public transport services. Earlier this year, the ACCC was directed by Treasurer Josh Frydenberg to monitor prices in the domestic airline industry and provide quarterly reports. The ACCC said there was a public benefit in promoting greater competition in airline services, and this would be achieved by assisting in the re-establishment of Virgin Australia's national network of routes. ""The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the aviation industry in Australia,"" ACCC Commissioner Stephen Ridgeway said. ""This interim authorisation will help facilitate a more competitive aviation landscape as Australian consumers resume travelling and demand for flights increases."" The cooperation would mean that Virgin Australia and Alliance Airlines would not compete with each other on the routes covered by the agreement. ""We consider that other airlines, including Qantas Airways and Qantas-owned Jetstar, are likely to compete strongly with Alliance Airlines and Virgin Australia on many of the routes covered by the agreement,"" he said. US stocks were sold off sharply in late trade, as rising coronavirus cases offset optimism about the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. There was a subdued response to pharmaceutical firm Pfizer's announcement that its experimental coronavirus vaccine was 95 per cent effective. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech said they could secure emergency US and European funding for the vaccine next month, after final trial results showed there were no serious side effects. That raised hopes that deliveries of the vaccine could begin before Christmas if emergency use approval was granted. Pfizer shares came off their highs and rose 0.8 per cent to $US36.32. BioNTech shares jumped 4 per cent to $90.44. Shares in rival Moderna, which reported a similar success rate last week, fell 4.6 per cent. The Dow Jones index fell for a second day but it still traded around a record high. It was sold off in late trade and closed down 1.2 per cent or 345 to 29,438. The S&P 500 dropped nearly 1.2 per cent to 3,568 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.8 per cent to 11,802. Shares in airline Boeing rose after the US Federal Aviation Commission approved the plane-maker's grounded 737 MAX aircraft to resume flights. However it ended lower down 3.2 per cent. Target Corp beat quarterly profit and sales estimates, boosted by a 155 per cent jump in comparable digital sales. The retailer's stock rose 2.3 per cent. Lowe's Companies dropped 8.2 per cent after the home improvement retailer forecast lower-than-expected holiday quarter earnings as it beefs up its online business and pays out employee bonuses to ease pandemic-related hardship. In Europe, major indexes gained ground. The FTSE 100 increased 0.3 per cent to 6,385, the DAX rose 0.5 per cent to 13,202, and the CAC 40 put on 0.5 per cent to 5,511.

311,ASX makes modest gains and Amazon takes on 'bricks and mortar' pharmacies,markets,"  ASX higher despite more tech issues and fall on Wall Street, Amazon opens online pharmacy Australian shares have lifted for the third consecutive day, despite the ASX being plagued by more technical problems. Meanwhile, as another sign of the economy's recovery from COVID-19, the banks have seen a big drop in the number of struggling customers deferring their loans. But the Reserve Bank governor has warned that slowing population growth is a threat to any any economic rebound. In the end, The ASX 200 index closed slightly higher (+0.5pc) at 6,531 points. The broader All Ordinaries index rose (+0.4pc) to 6,727. Vaccine optimism and post-US election relief have led to the market surging 9.7 per cent since the month began. Banks were today's best performers, including Bendigo & Adelaide Bank (+4.4pc), Commonwealth Bank (+2.9pc) and Bank of Queensland (+2.8pc). On the flip side, Crown Resorts shares had slipped (-0.6pc) before they were put in a trading halt. The NSW Independent Liquor & Gaming Authority said it was suspending Crown's gaming licence, citing money laundering concerns, delaying the firm's plan to open a $1.6 billion resort in Sydney next month. The regulator, which was to give a ruling on Crown's new casino next February, said it made the unscheduled move after an inquiry into the company received new evidence late on Tuesday. Mining, oil and gas stocks like Cooper Energy (-4.2pc), Viva Energy (-3.3pc), OZ Minerals (-3.6pc) and Oil Search (-2.6pc) were the weakest performers. Shares in A2 Milk slumped (-4.8pc) after the milk producer said it was being hurt by the lockdown in Victoria, which affected demand from daigou customers, who buy for individuals in China. The Australian dollar slipped (-0.1pc) to 72.93 US cents. Spot gold fell (-0.3pc) to $US1,879.20 an ounce, while Brent crude oil slipped (-0.1pc) to $US43.69 per barrel. The RBA governor says the economy is on the road back to recovery but he has warned that fewer migrants will mean slower economic growth. Dr Philip Lowe emphasised the nation has benefited from high levels of immigration, at the Strategic Forum event organised by The Australian. ""If we don't go back to previous rates of immigration then we will have to get used to slower growth in our economy,"" he said. ""That might be a trade-off we're prepared to make."" The virus outbreak saw Australia close its international borders in March, virtually shutting the door to international arrivals. But Dr Lowe said whether or not immigration returned to pre COVID levels was up to the Federal Government. ""I think we're better off staying on the track we're on, but that's an issue for the government."" The RBA governor also brushed off concerns that house prices were set for another bubble because of the emergency measures taken to respond to COVID, including record low interest rates. ""The lower interest rates do support housing prices, and in the current environment that's what we need,"" Dr Lowe said. ""It's certainly possible that lower interest rates cause housing prices to rise at an unsustainable rate,"" he said. ""But I think it's unlikely. The population dynamics have changed a lot. The population this year is going to grow at its slowest rate since 1916."" Share trading resumed on the Australian market yesterday after the meltdown on Monday. However, technical glitches have continued today on the Australian Securities Exchange's anonymous trading platform, Centre Point, with orders suspended because of problems with price data. ""ASX will suspend the use of Centre Point and Centre Point Block orders from today until further notice,"" the ASX said. The ASX's headache from ongoing problems with Centre Point were compounded yesterday by issues with the settlement of share transactions through the market operator's CHESS system. The tech woes have prompted another serve from the corporate watchdog, the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC), over concerns about ASX's IT systems and resources. ASIC advised traders to remove their reliance on Centre Point ""swiftly and safely"". ""ASIC is concerned that there have been further issues with infrastructure at ASX and are working with stakeholders to ensure that any impact on the fair, orderly and transparent operation of the markets is minimised,"" ASIC said in a statement. ""ASIC is actively assessing ASX's compliance with its market licence obligations and is considering further actions to ensure the adequacy of ASX's human, financial and technological resources to operate its markets in an orderly manner."" The Australian Banking Association said almost 70 per cent of bank customers have started to repay their deferred bank loans. The measures were put in place because of the economic devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The ABA said at the height of the pandemic, 900,000 Australians deferred their loans. More than 800,000 of those were at the seven largest banks. By the first week of November, more than two thirds of borrowers had started to make full repayment of their loans. The ABA said fewer than 145,000 people were still deferring their mortgages and the number of business loan referrals had dropped to fewer than 73,000. The value of deferred loans at the seven biggest banks has fallen from $250 billion in June to $86 billion. National Australia Bank chief executive Ross McEwan said the vast majority of its customers would get through the coronavirus recession, but about 6 to7 per cent were ""doing it tough"". ""Of the 130,000 customers we have assisted, with $60 billion in deferred loans, more than 90 per cent are getting back on their feet or have told us they will not need the deferral in the future,"" he said. NAB also said it would continue to make sure customers could afford to pay back their loans despite the Federal Government axing responsible lending laws. Consumer advocates and victims of financial scandals have slammed the changes but ANZ's head of retail and commercial banking, Mark Hand, said the changes would provide ""clarity on how we are meant to operate"". Online behemoth Amazon has moved into medicines by launching an online pharmacy in its latest step to take on the chemist market. The pharmacy will deliver prescription medications in the United States, increasing competition for drug retailers like Walgreens, Walmart and CVS Health. Amazon Pharmacy will allow customers to compare prices as they buy medicines on the Amazon website or app. The expansion follows the online retailer's 2018 acquisition of PillPack, which Amazon said would remain separate for customers needing pre-sorted doses of multiple drugs. The company said members of Amazon's loyalty scheme Prime would save up to 80 per cent off generic and 40 per cent off brand-name medications for prescriptions without insurance. Over the past two years, Amazon has worked to secure more state licences for shipping prescriptions across the US. These licences had been an obstacle to its expansion into the medicine supply chain, according to Jefferies Equity Research. Amazon, which was founded as an online bookseller, has disrupted industries including retail, computing and now potentially pharmaceuticals, drawing criticism of its size and power from unions and politicians. TJ Parker, PillPack's chief executive and vice-president of Amazon Pharmacy, said in a statement that the retailer aimed to bring ""customer obsession to an industry that can be inconvenient and confusing"". Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management professor Craig Garthwaite said Amazon's move would challenge big retailers. ""Amazon's launch of an online pharmacy is a meaningful threat to brick and mortar pharmacies,"" he said. ""These retail pharmacies must now offer more than just easy access to a prescription."" Shares in pharmaceutical retailers slumped on the news. Walgreens Boots Alliance slumped 9.6 per cent, CVS Health Group lost 8.6 per cent and Rite Aid Corporation fell 16.3 per cent. Amazon shares came off its highs and put on 0.1 per cent to $3,136. Global share markets retreated from their record highs as hopes about a coronavirus vaccine gave way to concern about rising infections and new lockdowns. US stocks fell as several states imposed new restrictions on gatherings and COVID-19 cases rose as the weather got colder. The Dow Jones index closed down 0.6 per cent or 167 points to 29,783, a day after reaching a new record high on the news that pharmaceutical firm Moderna had developed an experimental coronavirus vaccine with nearly 95 per cent effectiveness. The Nasdaq lost its gains in late trade and fell by 0.2 per cent to 11,899. It had been boosted by electric car maker Tesla, which surged 8.2 per cent to $US441.61 on the news it will be added to the S&P 500 index, the top 500 stocks, next month. The S&P 500 fell nearly 0.5 per cent to 3,610. Small stocks index the Russell 2000 reached a record closing high. US economic data showed that retail sales rose 0.3 per cent last month, less than forecast, restrained by rising coronavirus infections and falling household income as millions of people lost unemployment support. They dropped sharply from a 1.6 per cent gain in September. European shares were also lower, as the STOXX 600 dipped after hitting its highest level in more than eight months on Monday, as Sweden moved to restrict the size of public gatherings and a British medical adviser suggested strengthening restrictions when the full lockdown in England ends. In London, the FTSE 100 index fell 0.9 per cent to 6,365, the DAX in Germany was steady at 13,133, and the CAC 40 in Paris rose 0.2 per cent to 5,483.

312,ASIC and investors want answers after ASX shutdown,markets,"  Why did the ASX melt down on Monday and can I get compensation? The Australian stock exchange had a technical meltdown on Monday after a major software upgrade over the weekend, forcing it to suspend share trading for most of the day, which meant no buying or selling could take place. Share trading lasted just 24 minutes, possibly the shortest trading day ever, as share prices stopped updating. It was a major embarrassment for the market operator, the Australian Securities Exchange, coming just a month after its much maligned new website crashed. Investors are fuming and the corporate watchdog has put the ASX on notice. The ASX halted trade at 10:24am AEDT because of what it called ""market data issues,"" which meant that share prices weren't updating so investors could not buy and sell because they did not know what the prices were. After 10 updates to investors, the ASX said the market would remain closed for the rest of the day. By late afternoon, it said it had worked out what the problem was and promised things would be sorted in time for the market to reopen on Tuesday at 10:00am AEDT, which it did. The ASX said a major software update of its Nasdaq-supplied trading platform caused a problem with combination trades, which are trades in multiple securities in one single order. These trades have been suspended for the time being. The software issues came despite extensive testing for more than a year, including four dress rehearsals before the new platform went live on Monday. ASX boss Dominic Stevens said the market operator was ""very disappointed"" and sorry for the outage. ""Notwithstanding the extensive testing and rehearsals, and the involvement of our technology provider, ASX accepts responsibility,"" he said. Late on Monday afternoon, the corporate watchdog put out a terse statement on the market meltdown asking the ASX to please explain. It said it was focussed on making sure the ASX reopened in an orderly manner and it wanted to make sure that ""market integrity"" was not compromised. In other words, that there was no funny business. ""ASIC will also monitor for any impacts resulting from the failure of ASX Trade to open for most of the day,"" it said. It is an understatement to say that some investors were not happy, with Twitter full of complaints. Twitter user Mo wrote, ""Just admit it. You've been hacked."" Mo and another user also had some advice for the ASX: ""Turn it off & on again."" Trading on the share market has become more popular as people search for better returns because of low interest rates. The coronavirus market crash and the subsequent rebound have also seen small investors flood into shares hoping to make a killing. The value of average daily trades on the ASX is $6.5 billion and there are an average of 1.5 million trades per day. Fiona Balzer from the Australian Shareholders Association said the trading shutdown was a bad look for the market operator. ""We were surprised by the ASX outage, not so much that it was related to software, but that it wasn't identified before market open or that there wasn't a rollback of software updates earlier in the day or implementation of other contingency plans,"" she said. The sort answer is yes. The last major outage occurred on September 19, 2016, because of faulty hardware in the ASX main database. The market opened later than usual that day, at 11:30am, and closed early at 2:05pm. The faulty hardware was replaced that evening and the ASX opened as usual at 10:00am the next day. In a report on that shutdown, the ASX said, ""It is very unusual for ASX to close the market."" ""The ASX has been closed on only three previous occasions in the last 10 years,"" it said Fund manager Julia Lee from Burman Invest said another major outage would probably happen again in the future because stock exchanges are so dependant on new technology. ""If you are on the Australian share market, it's a four-year glitch,"" Ms Lee said. ""The last time we saw it was in 2016, before that it was 2012, I guess the question is, are we going to see one in 2024? That's a hard one. Trading only lasted for 24 minutes on Monday before all share trading was frozen. Some people on Twitter have demanded compensation. But fund manager Roger Montgomery said a trade can go either way and it would impossible for an investor to prove they lost money if a share transaction was not completed. ""Money might have been lost but money might have also been gained,"" he said. ""Because those trades weren't able to occur, in some instances it was the buyer who would have been better off, and in some instances it would have been the seller."" So essentially, you can't get compensation for something that hasn't happened. Policy and advocacy manager at the Australian Shareholders Association, Fiona Balzer, said investors who needed to buy or sell were inconvenienced and that may have been very stressful and included costs. ""We haven't had any reporting of exact nature of losses — it might be hard to quantify without prices being known during the day and it would only be considered a deferral of trade or lost opportunity for day traders,"" she said. ""With the market falling over at the start of day, I would think day traders were unable to get set, so hopefully weren't facing losses by carrying open positions over the weekend."" Also, investors could have also duplicated their trades on the alternative index, Chi-X, and cancelled their original order when the ASX reopened. An ASX spokesman told the ABC that the ASX was co-operating with ASIC as it looked into the market meltdown. ""We will provide a full incident report,"" he said. ""We are very confident throughout that we have continued to meet our obligations to the market."" The ASX said since the 2016 outage, it has significantly increased staffing, spending and training. CMC Markets chief market strategist Michael McCarthy said investors were relieved when the share market opened without a hitch. ""It's always good news when we have a fully functioning market and especially when there's important news around, in particular the news over vaccines over the past week,"" he said.

313,Australian market rallies after trading outage as COVID-19 positivity continues,markets,"  ASX rises in cautious trade after trading glitch and Wall Street hits new records off the back of Moderna coronavirus vaccine The Australian share market has made modest gains, a day after trading spectacularly crashed due to software issues. The stock market operator has apologised for Monday's market outage, which came after a major software upgrade to its trading platform over the weekend. The benchmark ASX 200 rose on opening and was up 0.4 per cent to 6,512 by lunchtime. However, it tapered off during the afternoon to close 0.2 per cent up at 6,498. The market is still trading near an eight-month high after the US election result and positivity about the potential of COVID-19 vaccines. Overnight in the US, another pharmaceutical company, Moderna, announced early success with its experimental vaccine. ""The ASX glitch [on Monday] meant we had to sit out on the global rally,"" AMP equities manager Dermot Ryan said. ""The ASX reopened this morning, opening the doors to pent-up demand from the crowd."" Energy, financial and some real estate stocks performed well on Tuesday. The very top performing stock on the ASX 200 was shopping centre owner Unibail Rodamco, which gained 17 per cent, followed by Whitehaven Coal (+9pc) and Viva Energy (+7pc). Australian wine company Treasury was the day's fifth top highest performing stock, despite ongoing concerns about possible trade bans by China. It is believed TWE's stock rose 5.5 per cent off the back of Australia signing the The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership with various Asian trading partners. Technology, healthcare and some property stocks fell. Going down was property investment company Charter Hall, which lost 6.4 per cent on news that it had invested in six Bunnings outlets. Buy now, pay later platform Afterpay also fell 5.8 per cent a day after the corporate regulator found the sector was allowing people to get themselves into financial strife. By the close of trade, the All Ordinaries index was also up, rising 0.2 per cent to 6,698. The Australian dollar rose on vaccine optimism during the day but was slightly down by 4:30pm AEDT to 73.19 US cents. Under-fire casino operator Crown Resorts told the market it would permanently stop dealing with gaming tour operators linked to organised crime. Financial crimes regulator AUSTRAC is investigating Crown for turning a blind eye to money laundering at its Melbourne and Perth casinos. NSW authorities are also considering taking away Crown's licence for its new casino at Barangaroo in Sydney. Crown has started a consultation process with gaming regulators in Victoria, Western Australia and New South Wales. ""Crown will only recommence dealing with a junket operator if that junket operator is licensed or otherwise approved or sanctioned by all gaming regulators in the states in which Crown operates,"" it said. Crown Resorts shares finished the day 1.6 per cent higher on $9.70. On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank released the minutes of its historic November meeting, where it cut interest rates to a new record low of 0.1 per cent and ramped up its government bond buying program to help the coronavirus stricken economy. The minutes reveal the RBA warned about rising coronavirus cases globally, which it said ""posed a downside risk to the outlook, particularly in Europe"". ""The board concluded it was the appropriate time to implement the package, as it had become clearer that unemployment would remain high and inflation subdued for an extended period, and that further information in coming months was unlikely to change that assessment,"" it said. On Monday night, Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe told a function that investors and consumers should be taking more risks to help the economy. Those comments came as the Housing Industry Association released data that shows demand for the construction of new homes across Australia has been steeply rising since June. ""New home sales fell marginally by 1.3 per cent in the month of October to remain 31.6 per cent higher for the three months to October compared with the same time last year,"" its chief economist Tim Reardon said. Mr Reardon credited several stimulus measures with this, including low interest rates, Federal Government schemes and some households having extra savings due to COVID-19 shutdowns. ""Households have redirected their expenditure from travel and entertainment towards housing, including renovating their home. Expenditure on small scale renovation projects is now around 25 per cent higher than this time last year,"" he said. ""An unexpected reversal to the urbanisation trends of the past century has seen an increase in demand for detached housing. ""There has been a sudden shift in Australia’s population away from central Sydney and Melbourne to all other regions."" But it wasn't all positivity. Data out of the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that while payrolls lifted in October, the gains were being found in larger corporates, while small business is actually going backwards. ""While it is tempting to conclude the tapering of JobKeeper has not had a continuing negative impact on the labour market, there appears to have been a significant impact for small business employment,"" NAB economist Tapas Strickland said. ""Larger businesses have driven the re-hiring, while small businesses have recently shed workers. ""It is unclear what has driven the divergence, though the concentration of small-to-medium businesses in inner city CBDs may be a factor as well as in industries such as accommodation/food and tourism."" US stocks have ended at new record highs after another potential coronavirus vaccine being developed by pharmaceutical firm Moderna boosted hopes of stemming COVID-19. However, rising infections and new shutdowns threaten to hinder a global recovery from the pandemic recession. Shares which stand to benefit from a COVID-19 vaccine, including aviation and travel stocks, gained on Wall Street. Moderna said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was 94.5 per cent effective in preventing infection based on interim late-state data. Its shares jumped 9.6 per cent to $US97.95. It is the second pharmaceutical firm in two weeks to announce promising trial data in the development of a vaccine. Last week, rival Pfizer said its potential vaccine was 90 per cent effective against coronavirus. While Pfizer's shares surged last week, the news about Moderna saw Pfizer shares drop 3.3 per cent to $US37.33 because Moderna's vaccine is more easily transportable and can be stored at normal fridge temperatures. Peter Tuz from Chase Investment Counsel in the US said the Moderna trials were good news. ""We have another vaccine that down the road that will enable us to get back to life as we used to live it,"" he said. ""We're seeing the end of the tunnel getting closer."" Aviation, travel and cruise ship companies were among those who gained. That's despite US infections surging past 11 million with record infections in 40 states, prompting states to toughen social distancing rules. The optimism saw both the Dow Jones index and the S&P 500 index reach new record closing highs. The Dow Jones index also reached a new record high during the session and closed in on the 30,000-point mark. It rose 1.6 per cent or 471 points to 29,950. The S&P 500 put on 1.2 per cent to 3,627 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.8 per cent to 11,924. The three major US indexes have now reclaimed the heights last seen in February before the coronavirus pandemic took hold. European stocks also rose on the Moderna news. In London, the FTSE 100 increased 1.7 per cent or 6,422, the DAX in Germany rose 0.5 per cent to 13,139, and the CAC 40 put on 1.7 per cent to 5,472. The prospect of an end to coronavirus lockdowns boosted oil prices by around 3 per cent overnight. Brent crude continued to gain in Asian trade, rising by 0.7 per cent to $US44.13 a barrel. Spot gold came off its overnight lows. At 12:20pm AEDT, it was steady at $US1,889 an ounce.

314,'Turn it off and on again?': Frustration as ASX trading shut down due to 'data issues',markets,"  ASX shut down for the day after software upgrade, ASIC says watching 'market integrity' The Australian share market operator says it expects the local market will reopen on Tuesday morning at the normal time of 10:00am AEDT after a technical problem shut down trade for most of Monday. The Australian Securities Exchange halted trade at 10:24am AEDT, soon after opening, because of what it said were ""market data issues"" and by late afternoon it said that share trading would remain closed for the rest of the day. In a statement, the ASX said a software issue limited to the trading of multiple securities in a single order created ""inaccurate market data"", which led to share prices not being updated. The company said it and its technology provider Nasdaq had identified the cause of the problem and the issue would be resolved overnight. Over the weekend, the share market trading platform ASX Trade was updated with the latest generation of Nasdaq trading systems, which are used around the world. The ASX said there had been ""extensive testing for over a year, including four dress rehearsals, in preparation for Monday's go-live"". ASX managing director Dominic Stevens said the company was very disappointed with the market outage and sorry for the disruption caused to investors, customers and other market users. ""The outage falls short of the high standards we set ourselves and the standards others expect of us,"" he said. ""Notwithstanding the extensive testing and rehearsals, and the involvement of our technology provider, ASX accepts responsibility."" Some users were not happy, responding with sarcasm, with the market outage coming soon after the ASX revamped its website amid complaints about the new format and functionality. Twitter user Mo wrote, ""Just admit it. You've been hacked."" Another user helpfully suggested, ""Turn it off & on again."" The corporate regulator said it was in regulator communication with the ASX, traders, investors and other regulators and it would be watching to see if trading reopened on time on Tuesday. ""We are focused on ensuring that ASX reopens in an orderly manner on Tuesday 17 November, and that market integrity is not compromised,"" the regulator said. ""ASIC will also monitor for any impacts resulting from the failure of ASX Trade to open for most of the day."" Burman Invest chief investment officer Julia Lee said reliance on technology was making share market outages more common with the Japanese bourse shut down last month. ""If you are on the Australian share market, it's a four-year glitch,"" Ms Lee said. ""The last time we saw it was in 2016, before that it was 2012, I guess the question is are we going to see one in 2024?"" Tribeca Investment Partners portfolio manager Jun Bei Liu said the outage was unexpected, especially after the software upgrade. ""It's a little bit surprising given a refresh like this has probably been tested numerous times,"" she said. She said it was embarrassing for the ASX after the problems with its new website. ""It certainly looks like a setback,"" Ms Liu said. ""Knowing they have invested quite a lot into this technology and hopefully once you smoothed out the initial teething issues, it will be much better from here on."" In early trade, the ASX 200 index rose 1.2 per cent or 79 points to 6,484, an eight-month high before trading was paused. The All Ordinaries also rose 1.2 per cent to 6,687. The big banks increased with the Commonwealth Bank up 1.9 per cent, Westpac up 1.4 per cent, ANZ up 2.7 per cent and NAB up 1.8 per cent. Big miners BHP and Rio gained 2 per cent. Buy now, pay later firms lost ground after a new report by the corporate regulator found that one in five consumers who use the services are behind on their repayments. ASIC found that in the 2018-2019 financial year, firms like Afterpay and Zip made $43 million from customers who were not able to repay on time. Afterpay shares fell 0.4 per cent to $101.40, Zip shares fell 0.8 per cent to $6.00 and Sezzle shares were down 1.4 per cent to $6.60. At 5:30pm AEDT, the Australian dollar rose 0.2 per cent to 72.81 US cents. Spot gold was steady at $US1,888.40 an ounce. Brent crude oil rose 1.2 per cent to $US43.27 a barrel. Markets rallied in Asia with the Nikkei 225 index putting on 2 per cent to 25,907 and the Shanghai Composite 0.9 per cent to 3,341 on renewed hopes of a coronavirus vaccine and good economic data. China's industrial output rose by a faster-than-expected 6.9 in October from a year earlier, expanding for the seventh month in a row as the economy quickly recovers from the coronavirus slump and global demand picks up. Retail sales rose 4.3 per cent last month from a year earlier compared with 3.3 per cent in September. Fixed asset investment increased 1.8 per cent in the first 10 months of 2020, compared to 0.8 per cent growth in the first nine months of the year. Japan's economy expanded at the fastest pace on record in the third quarter as it rebounded from its biggest post-war slump because of the coronavirus. A rise in exports and consumption helped the economy grow but analysts warned that the sharp bounce back was from a recession caused by the pandemic. The Japanese economy expanded by an annualised 21.4 per cent from July to September, the first increase in four quarters. The economy contracted by nearly one-third on an annual basis over the second quarter amid a coronavirus lockdown. On Friday on Wall Street, the Dow Jones index put on 1.4 per cent to 29,480 on upbeat earnings reports and hopes for a successful COVID-19 vaccine. The S&P 500 index closed at a record high, up 1.4 per cent to 3,585, and the Nasdaq gained 1 per cent to 11,829. Shares in media firm Nine Entertainment have dropped nearly 2 per cent after it told the stock exchange that chief executive Hugh Marks will resign during the second half of the current financial year. On Saturday, Mr Marks told Nine's Sydney Morning Herald that he was in a relationship with former Nine executive Alexi Baker, a former subordinate. The news came ahead of an email to staff where he announced he was stepping down. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, Mr Marks said intense gossip about his new relationship had pushed him to announce his resignation over the weekend. He admitted the board was only told about his new relationship last week and said any conflicts of interest were handled appropriately. In a statement, Nine said Mr Marks would ""actively continue as group CEO"" while the board looked for a new boss to take the company through the next stage of its development. Nine's businesses include the Nine television network, the Australian Financial Review, the Sydney Morning Herald, streaming service Stan and real estate website Domain. Mr Marks said with almost half of the company's earnings from digital assets, he was confident it was the right time to announce his retirement. ""When I was appointed CEO five years ago, my brief was to lead the transformation of what was then a television business, to a digitally based media company,"" he said. ""We have achieved so much in that time frame. Bringing together three legacy media businesses, each with their own structural challenges, and investing in the assets that will ensure our position at the forefront of Australia's media future."" Nine chairman Peter Costello said Mr Marks had been an extremely successful chief executive for Nine. ""The transformation of Nine to a multimedia and digital business has been all-encompassing and we now have an unreplicable suite of assets, fit to lead us through the digital age,"" he said. ""We respect Hugh's decision, allowing us plenty of notice to work through the next few months, and enable an orderly transition. We wish him well in all his future endeavours. Since taking the top job five years ago, Mr Marks has overseen the transformation of Nine from a declining free-to-air broadcaster into a multimedia behemoth. Simon Longstaff from The Ethics Centre said the difficulty in determining whether people working together — but with vastly different levels of power — could ethically be in a relationship was found in determining ""where the mischief lies"". ""If you're in a relationship with someone who's capable of preferring your interests or harming your interests, on criteria that are unrelated to your performance, and are instead to do with the relationship, then this becomes problematic,"" he said. At 10:20am AEDT, Nine shares were down 1.6 per cent to $2.40. Rival News Corporation shares rose 3.9 per cent to $23.58.

315,ASX hits highest point since March on COVID-19 vaccine hopes,markets,"  ASX rallies and Wall Street reaches new record highs on hopes of coronavirus vaccine Australian shares have risen to their highest level since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bouyed by pharmaceutical company Pfizer announcing early success in a vaccine trial. The pharmaceutical firm, along with partner BioNTech, said initial results from tests of their experimental COVID-19 vaccine found it could be more than 90 per cent effective (although there is some fine print). Investment firm Morgan Stanley said in a note that the effectiveness of the potential vaccine was better than expected. ""We look forward to tolerability and safety details, which have not yet been disclosed,"" it said. In early trade on Tuesday, the ASX 200 index rose nearly 2.2 per to 6,438. That was its highest point since March 5, weeks before the Federal Government implemented national lockdowns. The benchmark index later came off its morning highs and closed at 6,341. Sectors that have been hard hit by the coronavirus shutdown surged, while pandemic winners such as tech stocks and gold miners slumped. The best performing stocks of the day were in the education sector, with education firm IDP Education up 10 per cent. Another pandemic-hit sector, real estate, also performed well. Westfield shopping centre owner Unibail Rodamco rose by almost 44 per cent. Meanwhile, Corporate Travel jumped 16 per cent, Virgin Money added 16 per cent,  and Oil Search jumped 16.6 per cent. Energy stocks also led the gains, as prices rose on optimism that economies could reopen further and increase demand for fuel. Technology firms, miners and consumer stocks were sold off. The biggest loser of the day was NEXTDC, a technology company that specialises in outsourcing and connectivity. It was down 13.9 per cent. Gold mining company Ramelius Resources was also down (-13.3pc) and healthcare firm Fisher & Paykel was down 12.8pc. The All Ordinaries index also pared its early 2 per cent gain. By close, it was up 0.4 per cent to 6,544. The Australian dollar came off its overnight high of 73.40 US cents. By 4:45pm, the local currency was buying 72.80. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 climbed to a three-decade high, up 1 per cent to 25,112. Building material maker James Hardie shares lost 5.6 per cent to $36.21 after it saw its net profit fall by 49 per cent to $US96.2 million (132.1 million) for the first half of the financial year. The firm said quarterly sales rose by 12 per cent thanks to a sharp recovery in the US as homebuilding rebounded strongly. It reaffirmed its operating profit forecast for 2021 at up to $420 million and said it expects to resume paying dividends this financial year. Fertiliser and explosives maker Incitec Pivot saw annual net profit fall by 19 per cent to $123 million for the year to the end of September. Its shares lost 2.3 per cent as it did not pay a final dividend. Real estate firm Domain said business has improved over the past few months from the last quarter of the 2020 financial year. Its shares lost 6.7 per cent. The National Australia Bank said business confidence rose to its highest level since mid-2019, led by a large gain in Victoria as coronavirus infections fell and the lockdown was eased. Business confidence rose 9 points to 5 index points, but business conditions only rose 1 point over the month. NAB said while the survey results were encouraging, there were notable declines in South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia. The survey showed the economy has rebounded from the sharp fall in activity over the first half of the year amid government lockdowns and business shutdowns. NAB chief economist Alan Oster said the improvement in confidence was encouraging, but remained fragile, and was likely to stay that way until there was a vaccine. ""Business conditions saw a marginal improvement in the month. Trading conditions and profitability continue to improve as the economy opens up."" ""But employment continues to lag and is still negative, suggesting at face value there has been ongoing job-shedding,"" he said. The vaccine news raised hopes of a quick recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, which has shut down the global economy and killed more than 1.2 million people,  including more than 230,000 Americans. Companies hit hardest by months of travel bans and lockdowns — like airlines and cruise operators — soared. Banks and oil firms also gained. Stocks were also boosted by the victory of Democrat Joe Biden in the US presidential election, which investors see as positive for global trade. In contrast, shares in technology and other companies seen as ""stay-at-home"" winners in the pandemic were lower or made limited gains. Zoom Video fell 17 per cent, Netflix lost 8.5 per cent and Amazon dropped 5 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished off its highs but still rose by nearly 3 per cent or 835 points to 29,158. It climbed to a record high during the session, up nearly 6 per cent, or more than 1600 points. American Express jumped 21.4 per cent to $117.37 a share and Boeing rose 13.7 per cent. The S&P 500 surged more than 3 per cent. It closed up 1.2 per cent or 41 points to 3,551. The Nasdaq Composite rose by a much smaller amount during the session and slumped in late trade, after US Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said Congress should pass a limited coronavirus stimulus bill by the end of the year, rather than the $2 trillion relief bill that the Democrats want. It fell 1.5 per cent or 181 points to 11,714. Pfizer shares jumped 7.7 per cent to $39.20. BioNTech shares rose 13.9 per cent to $104.80 on the Nasdaq. Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners, said the vaccine news was positive. ""There are questions left in terms of how quickly Pfizer can get their vaccine to markets all around the world,"" he said. ""But today's market move suggests … we checked a box in terms of reducing some risk as we look ahead in terms of economy."" The US dollar remained weak as expectations of better global trade ties and more monetary stimulus under president-elect Joe Biden lifted demand for risky assets. Global leaders welcomed the US election results, congratulating Mr Biden even as incumbent Donald Trump refused to concede and vowed to challenge the result. The US Federal Reserve warned in its latest Financial Stability Report that the North American economy may face a wave of debt defaults and ""significant declines"" in asset prices because of the coronavirus recession. ""As many households continue to struggle, loan defaults may rise, leading to material losses"", the US central bank said. Pfizer's announcement also saw shares soar in Europe, adding to hopes of more stable trade policies under Mr Biden. In London, the FTSE 100 index jumped 4.7 per cent to 6,186, the DAX in German put on 4.9 per cent to 13,096, and the CAC 40 in Paris soared 7.6 per cent to 5,336. Oil prices jumped nearly 10 per cent on the vaccine news and after an OPEC output deal fuelled optimism about rising demand. At 10:20am AEDT, Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, was up 6.5 per cent to $US42.20 a barrel. By 2:00pm AEDT, it had dropped by 0.6 per cent to $42.13. Gold prices fell as investors turned away from safe havens to riskier assets. This morning, spot gold was down 4.3 per cent to $US1868.26 an ounce. At 2:00pm AEDT, it had come off its lows and was trading around $US1879.26, up 0.9 per cent.

317,ASX has its best week in a month after trade dominated by US election and rates cut,markets,"  ASX ends the week positive after five days dominated by US election and rates cut In a vote of confidence after a huge five days dominated by the US election and a rate cut by the Reserve Bank, Australian stocks have just marked its best week in a month. The benchmark ASX 200 finished Friday up 0.8 per cent, despite unsubstantiated claims by US President Donald Trump about the election, which raised the chance of a contested result. Most sectors closed higher, except for slight losses by healthcare and utilities stocks. Overall, the ASX 200 gained 4.4 per cent over the week. That was its best week since October 9. Global equities have gained this week despite uncertainty around the US presidential race, and the growing potential of a Biden presidency that could bring in Democratic policy changes that could impact business. The All Ordinaries index put on 0.8 per cent to 6,395. Leading the gains among the top 200 companies were gaming firm Tabcorp (+15.8), News Corporation (+13.7pc) and Resolute Mining (+9pc). Australian wine company Treasury Wines gained almost 10 per cent over the day, despite further reports about China imposing trade barriers on Australian products such as wine, lobsters and barley. News Corp increased as investors liked its 21 per cent increase in first earnings and Tabcorp disputed claims of a private equity takeover offer. Leading the falls on the ASX 200 were media network Nine Entertainment (-3pc), building materials firm CSR (-3pc), payment platform Afterpay (2.7pc) and Cromwell Property (-2.6pc). Investment firm Macquarie Group saw its half-year profit hit by the coronavirus pandemic. The company said interim profit fell by nearly one third to $985 million because of delayed deals and a rise in loan writedowns, which caused the first ever loss for its investment banking unit. The financial company cut its interim dividend to $1.35 a share from $2.50 for the same time last year. Despite the numbers, Macquarie shares surged by 2.3 per cent to $135.45. The Reserve Bank optimistically upgraded its key economic forecasts and signalled that a slow recovery from the pandemic-induced recession was underway in its latest report card on the economy, the Statement on Monetary Policy. Economic growth or gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to bounce to 6 per cent by June 2021 — up from a previous 4 per cent — after contracting earlier this year by a massive 7 per cent as fallout from the coronavirus ravaged output. The slight upgrade to GDP from the previous statement reflects stronger-than-expected household consumption and additional government support through programs such as the JobKeeper wage subsidy. ""The less negative outcome stemmed largely from Australia's early success in bringing new infection rates down, which allowed restrictions on activity to be eased sooner than thought,"" the RBA said. But the central bank warned the severity of the downturn this year means economic growth is not expected to return to its pre-pandemic level until the end of 2021. It also warned that the drastic fall in population growth because of the closure of international borders meant the economy would be ""noticeably smaller"" than before the pandemic. Deputy RBA government Guy Debelle told a parliamentary hearing last week that September quarter GDP was expected to show positive growth, which would confirm the end to a ""technical"" recession defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction. Unemployment is now forecast to peak at just below 8 per cent in December this year after initial estimates it would surge beyond 10 per cent. But the jobless rate is expected to remain stubbornly high and decline only gradually to 7.5 per cent in June 2021 and 6 per cent in December 2022 However, consumer inflation has been downgraded slightly with both headline and trimmed mean measures forecast to bottom out at 1 per cent before reaching 1.5 per cent by the end of 2022. The RBA said the COVID-19 outbreak in Victoria and associated restrictions slowed the initial phase of the recovery. The upgraded forecasts come after a historic week in which the Reserve Bank cut the cash rate to a new record low of 0.1 per cent and unleashed a program of quantitative easing to buy $100 billion of government debt over the next six months. During the day on Friday, the greenback slipped and most commodity prices rose causing the Australian dollar to surge to 72.84 US cents, up one US cent overnight from 71.82, the highest level since September. That's as the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, again pledged to do whatever it takes to keep the North American economy afloat, including more bond buying. The US dollar also fell as a Joe Biden win looked more likely according to CBA currency analysts. The Australian dollar lost some of its overnight gain after the RBA's latest forecasts came out. At 4:50pm AEDT, it was at 72.57 US cents, down 0.3 per cent from open. US stocks have jumped with investors hoping an election stalemate in Congress with put a stop to law reforms that could hurt corporate America. Democratic Party contender Joe Biden has edged closer to winning although incumbent Donald Trump has taken to the courts to contest the election. Tech stocks rallied on the prospect of a stalemate in Congress. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 2 per cent or 543 to 28,390, with resources, industrials and banks leading the gains in a volatile trading session. All but two stocks on the 30-stock Dow Jones index were higher. United Health and pharmaceutical firm Merck both fell nearly 0.2 per cent, but finished well off their lows. The S&P 500 index increased 1.9 per cent to 3,510. The tech heavy Nasdaq, with its ""stay at home"" big tech giants, surged 2.6 per cent to 11,890. Fund manager Michele Pedroni from Decalia Asset Management in Geneva said the likely Senate outcome meant Silicon Valley would avoid greater oversight. ""The big bad wolf of regulation and taxes is further away from the door and many who have de-risked into the event will be forced to re-risk,"" he said. As expected the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, kept official interest rates on hold near zero and again pledged to do whatever it takes to keep the US economy recovering in the face of rising coronavirus infections and uncertainty over the undecided presidential election. In a statement, the Federal Reserve repeated its pledge to use its ""full range of tools"" to support the economy. ""Economic activity and employment have continued to recover but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year,"" the Fed said. ""The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world."" The US central bank said it would continue buying at least $US120 billion of government bonds every month. New claims for unemployment benefits fell slightly to the lowest level since the pandemic started in March. Weekly claims fell 7,000 to 751,000 last week, adding to signs that the economy recovery may have stalled. However, there are still millions of Americans out of work with nearly 7.3 million continuing claims. The latest US employment numbers will be out tonight. The Bank of England became the latest central bank to increase stimulus. It is expanding its large bond buying program by another 150 billion pounds. That saw European stocks hit two-week highs, also helped by strong earnings reports. In London, the FTSE 100 rose 0.4 per cent to 5,906, the DAX in Germany put on 2 per cent to 12,568, and the CAC 40 in Paris rose 1.2 per cent to 4,984. Spot gold surged more than 2 per cent to a six week high as the greenback slipped. At 12:00pm AEDT, the precious metal had dropped from its overnight high and was buying $1939 an ounce, down 0.4 per cent. Brent crude oil fell 1.4 per cent to $US40.34 a barrel.

318,Why markets have cheered the prospect of a divided US Congress,markets,"  Markets cheer prospect of divided US Congress after election 2020 If there's one thing markets hate, it's uncertainty, but over the past 24 hours, global markets have warmed to the potential political scenario in the US. That is, Joe Biden leading the tight presidential race, but the Republicans looking like they might maintain control of the Senate. ""This means certain changes will be harder to put into place then if there was, say, a clean sweep by the Democrats,"" CommSec market analyst Steven Daghlian. The changes that could be blocked include Biden's plan to increase corporate and income taxes, as well as a tougher crackdown on the big technology players. In response, US stocks rallied, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index leading the gains on Wall Street. ""The reason the Nasdaq really took off, and even more so as Biden looked like getting up, is the Senate,"" InvestSmart head of strategy Evan Lucas said. Biden's regulation and reform agenda had threatened the major tech companies with potential break up, but the prospect of the Republicans blocking those reforms in the Senate put a rocket under stocks, led by an 8 per cent gain for Facebook shares. Visit our US Politics page for all the latest news on Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Separately, US Senate Majority Leader, Republican Mitch McConnell, said Congress would need to approve a new coronavirus relief bill by the end of the year. The relief package, which would provide further stimulus to the US economy, had faced a deadlock between Democrats and Republicans, and Mr Lucas said this could be a sign there would now be some give and take. ""It is a bit of best of both worlds, you might get a decent amount of stimulus into the market … but you might not get some of the tax law changes or the regulatory changes he [Mr Biden] was campaigning on,"" he said. Despite the prospect of a divided Congress, Mr Biden would still have avenues for implementing his regulatory agenda if confirmed as president. ""The president has a lot of executive power and a lot of things that President Trump has done have been through executive order or through changing the stance of regulatory bodies,"" Professor Saumitra Jha from the Stanford Graduate School of Business said. ""The stance of the Government on terms of regulation will be quite different … on taxes it's going to come down to the Senate."" Read our full coverage of the US election and its aftermath. ""The President can make them at least act on existing rules or even tweak them,"" economics professor Anat Admati said. Professor Admati said the other big change under Mr Biden would be a greater sense of stability. ""There's some sanity that will come back to the whole idea that Government is needed to coordinate things and provide for people."" While greater stability would likely flow through to markets, Evan Lucas warned there could be a bumpy ride ahead if the final vote count goes Mr Biden's way but Mr Trump persists to contest the result through to December. ""If it does go down that angle … the volatility in the short term, for the next four to five weeks, will probably be there.""

319,ASX closes higher as Joe Biden moves closer to victory in US presidential election,markets,"  ASX boosted by US-linked stocks as election counting continues, Treasury Wines slumps on tariff threat On a day of trade dominated by the US election, Australian shares have closed with positive gains, on news that Democratic contender Joe Biden is inching closer to winning the Presidency. The Australian market rose on the open after Wall Street surged on hopes the tight race for the White House would lead to a stalemate in Congress, reducing the likelihood of major policy changes. It gained ground after Mr Biden edged closer to victory and Sportsbet called a Biden victory. ""We're paying out early on Joe Biden to be elected President of the United States of America,"" the bookmaker tweeted. It added it would still pay out on Mr Trump if he won the official result. At close of trade on Thursday, the key ASX 200 index was up almost 1.3 per cent or 78 points to 6140, with most sectors higher. The All Ordinaries index was up 1.3 per cent as well, to 6,344. The gains were led by healthcare firms that have business in the US, real estate, technology, consumer stocks and banks. Hearing implant maker Cochlear rose 2.1 per cent and biotech company CSL put on 3.2 per cent. Miners and energy stocks were lower. The top risers in the ASX 200 included chicken producer Inghams (+15.8 pc) on a quarterly update, as poultry volumes rose by 6.3 per cent over the year. It said it expected feed costs to fall in the second half of the 2021 financial year. Travel agency Flight Centre jumped (+6.7pc) as it told investors at its annual general meeting that it was hopeful its corporate business would return to profit late in the 2021 financial year, and the leisure business could follow suit in 2022. Financial information firm Iress rose 6.7 per cent. National Australia Bank gained three per cent over the day to $19.26 despite seeing annual net profit fall by half because of the coronavirus recession. Investment firm UBS said the result was solid, with margins and income coming in better than expected. The other big banks also helped drive the market, with the Commonwealth Bank up 1.6 per cent, Westpac up 1.9 per cent and ANZ up 0.9 per cent. The local currency was at 71.65 US cents in late afternoon trade. It saw wild swings yesterday as vote counting began in the US election. The trade surplus nearly doubled from August to September to $5.6 billion according to the Bureau of Statistics. Treasury Wines Estates was the worst performer of Australia's top 200 listed companies as it got caught up in the trade tensions between Australia and China over exports. Yesterday the winemaker said a Chinese alcohol industry group had called for retrospective tariffs on Australian wine imports. China began an anti-dumping investigation into Australian wine imports in August. Stockbroker Jefferies said the tariff threat could temporarily halt wine exports to China.""The potential for retrospective tariffs is a bad sign for the pending anti-dumping investigation,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note. ""Importers may be unwilling to bear the risk of retrospective tariffs and could stop importing Australian wine until the investigation is over."" TWE Chairman Paul Rayner told shareholders at its annual general meeting today it was prepared for duties on its wine exports to China in a worst-case scenario. ""We're preparing for a potential range of outcomes from mild to severe tariffs,"" he said. The winemaker also said it would suspend a planned spin-off of its prized Penfolds business as it focused on overhauling its US unit. Treasury shares ended the day 8.2 per cent down. Investors prepared for extended uncertainty as results from the US presidential election came back far closer than expected. Doubts the Democrats can take the Senate from Republicans will complicate the passage of another big coronavirus relief bill and other Democratic policy reforms. Healthcare and technology stocks led the gains as the chance of more antitrust scrutiny of the tech giants and capital gains taxes receded. The Dow Jones index soared more than 700 points at its height. It finished off those highs, but still rose 1.3 per cent or 367 points to 27,848. Apple put on 4.5 per cent and Microsoft jumped almost 10 per cent. Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar slumped 12.5 per cent. The S&P 500 rose 2.2 per cent to 3,443 and the Nasdaq soared by 3.9 per cent to 11,591. The prospect of political uncertainty sent investors to US treasury bonds, sparking the biggest one-day drop in 10 and 30-year bond yields since June. Peter Kraus from investment firm Aperture Investments said not much would change as a result of the election. ""The Senate is unlikely to flip,"" he said. Brain Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management, agreed. ""While we still don't have full results, it looks like instead of a red wave or blue wave scenario — with all respect to Prince — we have more of a 'purple rain' scenario, with gridlock being the most likely outcome."" ""That could mean less likelihood of fiscal stimulus, but it could also mean a lower likelihood of big changes to tax policy or regulatory policies."" ""Regardless, we believe the economy is more important than the election to the markets."" Across the Atlantic, European stocks also gained. The FTSE 100 in London rose 1.7 per cent to 5,883, the DAX in Germany increased 2 per cent to 12,324, and the CAC 40 in Paris added 2.4 per cent to 4,923. Spot gold was slightly higher at $US1904.58 an ounce. Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, jumped 3.8 per cent to $US41.20 a barrel. But by 1:10 pm AEDT, it had dropped to $US40.73 a barrel.

320,"Aussie dollar and ASX volatile, as US election uncertainty mounts",markets,"  Australian dollar and ASX volatile, as US election uncertainty mounts The Australian dollar and share market have endured a volatile session on growing signs the US election result may be tighter than expected. The benchmark ASX 200 slipped (-0.1pc) to close at 6,062 points. The broader All Ords index was flat at 6,265. Throughout the day, the market swung between gains and losses — as cautious optimism gave way to the prospect of an uncertain, drawn-out vote count. At midday, its lowest point, the market had dropped by as much as 1.3 per cent. That was when the first signs emerged that Democratic contender Joe Biden would not take Florida, a crucial swing state, away from US President Donald Trump. Some of the best performing stocks were Flight Centre (+6.1pc), Webjet (+5pc), CSR (+4.8pc), Domain Holdings (+4.8pc) and NextDC (+4.9pc). On the flip side, the worst performers include Fortescue Metals (-4.6pc), Whitehaven Coal (-3.7pc), Treasury Wine Estates (-3.1pc), Bank of Queensland (-2.8pc). The biggest drags on the market were the ""big four bank"" and mining giants Commonwealth Bank (-2pc), Westpac (-2pc), ANZ (-0.9pc), NAB (-1.1pc), BHP (-1.2pc) and Rio Tinto (-2.2pc). The Australian dollar jumped to a high of 72.21 US cents this morning as investors dumped the greenback. But as the news about the US election became more uncertain, the dollar sank (as low as 70.5 US cents) within hours as bookmakers placed Mr Trump as the favourite to win the election. By 4:45pm AEDT, the Australian dollar had recovered slightly to 71.1 US cents. That is despite rising trade tension between China and Australia amid confirmation by the ABC that multiple Chinese importers have been told to stop buying Australian coal, barley, copper, sugar, timber, wine and lobsters. The local currency was sold off yesterday and the market jumped 1.9 per cent after the Reserve Bank cut interest rates to near zero and announced a $100 billion government bond buying program. The latest data from the Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed retail sales declined by 1.1 per cent, seasonally adjusted, in September, with people buying less food and household goods. And while weekly payroll figures from the ABS showed that the number of people employed rose 0.1 per cent in the week to October 17, payroll jobs were down 1.7 per cent over the past month, and down 0.8 across the fortnight to October 17. Wages dropped by 2.1 per cent with the biggest drop in Western Australia. National Australia Bank economist Tapas Strickland said it was hard to draw conclusions because the figures are seasonally adjusted. ""While it is tempting to draw the conclusion that the decline in payrolls over the past month is due entirely to the tapering of government support, this is not clear given September and October are typically seasonally weak months for hiring,"" he said. ""Looking ahead, we will be watching how quickly the Victorian labour market can bounce back as restrictions ease."" CommSec said the data showed that small businesses had shed the most jobs and the biggest job losses were in New South Wales. The Commonwealth Bank and Westpac have moved to pass on the Reserve Bank's rate cuts to fixed home loan and business customers. The banks have heeded the warning from Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and have decreased fixed, and business loan rates to a variety of customers. The CBA said fixed rates on new home loans for some owner-occupiers would be cut by one percentage point to 1.99 per cent, its lowest fixed term rate in its history. Westpac has followed suit by also cutting fixed rates for four year terms for some owner occupiers to 1.99 percent. Some rates on business loans have been reduced by around half a percentage point. The big banks did not cut their variable rate mortgages although some smaller lenders have already done so. The big banks were heavily sold off today on worries about their future earnings because of less income from lower interest rates. By 2:30pm AEDT they had mainly come off theirs lows with CBA (-1pc), National Australia Bank (-0.3pc), Westpac (-1.8pc) and ANZ (-0.3pc). An inquiry into Crown Resorts has been told the company is not suitable to hold the licence for the soon-to-be-opened casino in Sydney's Barangaroo. The Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority has been examining the conduct of Crown in its current casinos in Melbourne and Perth, including its international VIP gaming operations. In his summary, Counsel Assisting the inquiry Adam Bell today told the hearing he believed Crown was not suitable to hold the licence. Commissioner Patricia Bergin is expected to give her final decision early next year. Crown shares lost 0.5 per cent. Hotel booking website Trivago has failed to overturn a Federal Court decision that found it had misled consumers into thinking they were getting the best prices. On Wednesday, the company's appeal was dismissed by the Full Federal Court, comprising three appeal judges. Previously, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) argued that Trivago deceived consumers, through its advertising, into believing it was an ""impartial and objective"" search aggregator. ""Trivago's hotel room rate rankings were based primarily on which online hotel booking sites were willing to pay Trivago the most,"" ACCC chair Rod Sims said. ""By prominently displaying a hotel offer in 'top position' on its website, Trivago represented that the offer was either the cheapest available offer or had some other extra feature that made it the best offer when this was often not the case."" The Full Court also ordered Trivago to pay the ACCC's legal costs, and will determine penalties at a later date. US stocks rallied, with the Dow Jones index jumping more than 700 points in late trade as Americans go the polls in the US presidential election. Investors are betting the divisive presidential race could end with a clear victory for Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden. The Dow Jones index rose nearly 2.1 per cent or 555 points to 27,480. Stocks rallied to their sessions in the last few minutes of trade before settling off their highs. The benchmark S&P 500 was boosted by banks, healthcare and industrial stocks. It closed up nearly 1.8 per cent or 59 points to 3,369. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.9 per cent to 11,161. ANZ economist Rahul Khare said investors were hoping for another round of coronavirus relief to be passed quickly if there was a quick and decisive result. ""A clear outcome from [this] is likely to result in the delivery of the much-awaited fiscal stimulus package,"" he said. In economic news, factory orders in the US rose 1.1 per cent in September. ANZ said demand for goods such as electronic products, computers and vehicles was robust. But orders for machinery, furniture and appliances dropped. Major European share indexes surged despite no sign of a Brexit deal on trade between the UK and the European Union. In London, the FTSE 100 index gained 2.3 per cent to 5,787, the DAX in Germany rose 2.6 per cent to 12,089, and the CAC 40 in Paris jumped 2.4 per cent to 4,806. Oil and gold prices rose.

321,ASX jumps after Reserve Bank slashes interest rates ahead of US election,markets,"  Australian shares jump after Reserve Bank slashes interest rates ahead of US election Australian shares received a boost after the Reserve Bank lowered the cash rate to almost zero. It was the third rate cut from the RBA this year, which also ramped up its quantitative easing program by pledging to buy $100 billion worth of longer-term Government debt. The Australian dollar had slipped (-0.1pc) to 70.4 US cents by 4:45pm AEDT. Meanwhile, the ASX 200 rose 115 points (or 1.9 per cent) to finish at 6,066. At its peak, the benchmark index climbed as high as 2.4 per cent, shortly after the RBA decision Many of today's best performing stocks were the ones that have been hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic. They include travel companies Webjet (+8.7pc) and Flight Centre (+7pc), and casino operator Star Entertainment (+6.5pc). A surge in oil prices lifted energy stocks like Oil Search (+7.5pc), Origin Energy (+6.7pc) and Santos (+6.5pc). Beach Energy shares jumped (+7pc) after the company announced it would buy Senex Energy's Cooper Basin projects in South Australia for $87.5 million. Only 17 out of 200 stocks posted losses, including Sandfire Resource s(-7pc), Treasury Wine Estates (-3.1pc) and Unibail Rodamco Westfield (-2.4pc). The market was also boosted by banks and mining giants like Commonwealth Bank (+1.4pc), NAB (+0.4pc), ANZ (+1.1pc), BHP (+2.6pc) and Rio Tinto (+2.5pc). Westpac was the only bank to end its day with a slight loss, down 0.5 per cent. Copper miner Sandfire Resources has told the market it is looking into reports that China is considering widening its trade restrictions on Australian exports with a potential ban on copper exports. ""Sandfire is not aware of the reasons for the reported potential ban or the reliability of the media reports,"" it told the ASX. ""Should it be required, Sandfire is confident in its ability to increase sales contract volumes to existing and also new copper concentrate customers in non-Chinese markets."" Its shares fell 9 per cent in early trade. Last financial year, more than 90 per cent of the copper from its DeGrussa mine in Western Australia was shipped to China. Pallet and container maker Brambles said sales revenue from continuing operations was $US1.19 billion for the first quarter of the 2021 financial year thanks to stronger than expected demand for groceries. Pallet demand remained high in the US as consumers restocked their cupboards ahead of the holiday season and more COVID-19 lockdowns. It predicted a higher than previously forecast annual profit for 2021, which boosted its share price by 6.2 per cent. Investor sentiment on global markets was bolstered by strong factory production data from the US, China and the Eurozone, which offset issues surrounding rising COVID-19 infections. US manufacturing activity accelerated more than expected last month, with new orders jumping to their highest level in nearly 17 years. The US ISM Manufacturing Index rose 3.9 points in October to 59.3, its highest reading since September 2018. ANZ economist Felicity Emmett said the numbers pointed to strong momentum for the US economy at the start of the last quarter of the year. Employment and production both gained. Chinese factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in a decade and manufacturing in the Eurozone also picked up, with the October Performance of Manufacturing Index rising to 54.8 points, according to IHS Markit. Germany drove rises in regional output and new orders. However, firms laid off workers and services are expected to be hit in Europe amid new lockdowns. The greenback and gold rose on investor jitters over the election. Investors are expecting volatile trade in the short term and major changes to policy related to tax, government spending, trade and regulation depending on who wins their place in the White House. Rick Meckler from Cherry Lane Investments in the US said there were concerns there would be no outright winner after the polls close on Wednesday local time. ""Traders are trying to position themselves to the idea that just having a result will be good for the market,"" he said. Investors are also watching this week's policy meeting of the US Federal Reserve, and official US unemployment figures out at the end of the week. US interest rates are expected to stay on hold. US stocks regained some lost ground as investors focus on the US presidential election after Wall Street suffered its worst week since March. Democrat Party candidate Joe Biden is ahead in the opinion polls, but the race with President Donald Trump is tight in battleground states. The Dow Jones index rose 1.6 per cent or 423 points to 26,925, off its highs. All sectors gained led by miners and oil stocks. Industrial firms Honeywell (+8.7pc) and pharmaceutical firm Walgreen Boots (+5.1pc) were the biggest gainers on the index. Walt Disney was the biggest loser (-0.9pc) and Apple ended lower (0.1pc) after losing more than 1 per cent earlier in the session. The S&P 500 rose 1.2 per cent to 3,310. Airlines and cruise companies lost ground as coronavirus cases increased. Shares in cleaning products firm Clorox jumped after it reported its strongest quarterly sales growth in more than two decades because of the coronavirus pandemic. Market research company Nielson gained on plans to sell its consumer goods data unit for $US2.7 billion to a private equity firm. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq came off its lows, gaining 0.4 per cent to 10,958.

New lockdowns in Europe and the United States have reduced demand for fuel but oil prices rebounded from last week's sell-off. Brent crude gained 3.2 per cent to $US39.15 a barrel overnight but fell back in Asian trade to $US38.80 a barrel. Spot gold was steady at $US1,894 an ounce.

322,ASX makes gains after China data and ahead of US presidential election,markets,"  ASX ends higher amid cautious trade ahead of expected interest rate cut and US presidential election The Australian share market has ended the day higher helped by good housing data and Chinese factory figures, but investors remain worried about rising coronavirus cases and the risk of a contested US presidential election. The ASX 200 index rose 0.4 per cent to 5,951 in a big week for markets. The All Ordinaries index put on 0.2 per cent to 6,147. It was the second gain in just eight trading sessions for the Australian market. The market reversed an early fall after the Caixin/Markit survey of China's factory industry found it expanded by the fastest pace in a decade last month to 53.6 points. Most sectors rose with gold miners and property stocks among the gainers. Energy stocks led the falls on a steep drop in oil prices. Big banks recovered some lost ground thanks to a rise in national home prices last month. Banks shares were also bolstered after Bureau of Statistics data showed a 6 per cent seasonally adjusted increase in home loans in September thanks to record low interest rates and government subsidies to construct new dwellings, and a 15.4 per cent jump in approvals, seasonally adjusted, to build new homes in September. Westpac saw a plunge in annual profit but came off its early lows. It fell as much as 2 per cent early on, but ended the day down 0.6 per cent. Commonwealth Bank dropped 0.2 per cent to $68.85, NAB rose 1.2 per cent to $18.93 and ANZ put on 2.4 per cent. The chairman of its Colonial First State arm, Anne Ward, will step down from the board at the end of 2020 ahead of the planned sale of 55 per cent of the unit to private equity firm KKR. AMP was the best performer on the ASX 200 index. It surged 9.8 per cent to $1.68 after it said a takeover bid from US private equity firm Ares Management had an implied value of $1.85 a share or $6.4 billion. Building materials maker CSR said its net profit for the half year to the end of September fell 15 per cent to $58.7 million after revenue slipped by 6 per cent. CSR managing director Julie Coates said earnings at its building products business had held up despite a ""challenging half on many fronts."" Investors will get an interim dividend payout of 8.5 cents a share and a special dividend of 4 cents a share. That saw CSR shares jump 5.7 per cent to $4.81 as it paid no final dividend for the last six months of 2020. Seek fell 1.2 per cent despite saying hedge fund Blue Orca's research alleging that its Chinese unit Zhaopin listed fake job ads was inaccurate and unsubstantiated. Blue Orca rebuffed Seek's rebuttal saying that Zhaopin had ""toxic debt"" and it had removed 64 out of 66 employers from its platforms after the hedge fund's report. Health firm Avita Therapeutics (-5.1pc) was the biggest loser in the ASX 200. Jewellery firm Lovisa will temporarily shut down 64 stores in France and the United Kingdom amid new lockdowns to contain the coronavirus. Lovisa closed its 24 stores in France as its new lockdown started on Friday and the stores will remain shut until at least December 1. Its UK stores will close from this week to at least December 2. Its shares fell 3.2 per cent to $7.26. All its Melbourne metropolitan stores have reopened after the lifting of government restrictions. Westfield shopping centre owner Unibail Rodamco saw rental income fall 17 per cent for the nine months to September to $2.5 billion because of the coronavirus pandemic. Rental income from shopping centres in Austria and the United Kingdom were hardest hit. Its shares rose 1.4 per cent to $2.94. The Australian dollar also had a volatile day because of the uncertainty surrounding the US election and dropped to just below 70 US cents, its lowest since late July. At 4:50pm AEDT, it was down 0.3 per cent to 70.1 US cents. The Reserve Bank plans to partner with the Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank, Perpetual and ConsenSys Software, a blockchain technology company, to explore the potential use of a wholesale form of central bank digital currency. Most economists surveyed by Reuters expect the RBA to cut official interest rates tomorrow and ramp up its bond buying program. Spot gold rose 0.2 per cent to $US1,882.26 an ounce. Brent crude fell 3.4 per cent to $US36.66 a barrel. US stocks ended lower on Friday in Wall Street's biggest weekly sell-off since March. A record rise in coronavirus cases, falls among tech stocks and uncertainty over the upcoming US presidential election weighed on investor confidence. However, the Dow Jones index came off its lows to end down 158 points or 0.6 per cent to 26,502, the S&P 500 fell 1.2 per cent to 3,270 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.5 per cent to 10,912.

323,"'Without China in the market, we don't have one': Wool's fresh bid to woo its biggest buyer",markets," ABC Rural Three sheep are helping round up a retail revival for Australian wool in China. So far, 230 million people have seen the quirky commercial of 'the Merino Sisters' spruiking the prestigious and versatile fibre. The marketing campaign is the work of woolgrower-funded Australian Wool Innovation's (AWI) The Woolmark Company. AWI chief executive officer Stuart McCullough said it was providing the certainty the industry needed given the recent trade tensions Australia's beef, barley, wine and cotton sectors have been caught up in with China. ""We're working closely with the government and our industry partners in China to make sure our contacts are being well engaged,"" Mr McCullough said. ""There are things that are in our control, and industry relationships are well within our control, but government-to-government relationships are not within our control. ""There are not many other alternatives for China in terms of their purchasing of wool, we are the biggest supplier of apparel wool to the world and they are the biggest buyer of apparel wool, so it's not as if there's another alternative that they can go to."" Australian Wool Innovation made the call in mid March to pull out of its global marketing campaigns as the pandemic heightened, lockdowns continued, and retail spending plummeted. Both India and Italy are buying very little Australian wool at auction back to 3 per cent and 2 per cent respectively — in 2018/19 they were taking about 5 per cent of the clip. ""The clubhouse leader, by a long way at the moment, is China and in April we started working on a marketing strategy as we felt that they would be the first to come out of this,"" Mr McCullough said. As a result it launched the Merino Sisters campaign in China, which is aimed at making ""prestigious Merino wool the most coveted winter fibre"". ""The China campaign is about communicating Australian wool's natural benefits to a digitally savvy, highly sophisticated Chinese audience,"" Mr McCullough said. The advertisement features three humorous interviews by Chinese celebrity Loura Lou with three Merino ewes. ""It allows consumers to learn about the superiority of Merino sheep genes and the unparalleled benefits of 'Merino: the Treasure Wool',"" Mr McCullough said. The Merino Sisters campaign featured on China's leading e-commerce site Tmall. AWI reported the campaign has generated more than 230 million impressions and 9.9 million video views, with the teaser post by Loura Lou achieving 2 million views in less than 24 hours on Weibo. Elsewhere, Mr McCullough said South Korea, Japan and Germany were starting to look more positive and AWI was considering starting some test marketing campaigns in those countries. ""We'll have to be very nimble this winter to deploy marketing projects quickly in the market at the right time, bearing in mind seasonality,"" Mr McCullough said. ""We're still particularly concerned about Italy, the UK and the US. ""They're big, important customers to us."" Mr McCullough said China was the perfect partner for Australian wool. ""They take more than 80 per cent of our wool clip and they have the perfect climate and affluence for the consumption of wool, and they have a high population,"" he said. ""They're a very unique partner from a manufacturing point of view, but also from a consumption point of view as they are now consuming half of the Australian wool clip they buy domestically now."" AWI is hoping to capitalise on China's population of 1.4 billion people with its economic recovery during the pandemic. ""It's the only economy in the world that we can see with any GDP [gross domestic product] growth at the moment,"" Mr McCullough said. ""Every other macro economy of the world that consumes our product is in negative GDP growth. ""And China seems to be coming out of COVID [well] with a V curve."" At wool auctions in Australia the increased demand from China is being noticed by brokers, despite the market in a seesaw pattern at the moment. Last week the Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX) Eastern Market Indicator (EMI) lifted a massive 102 cents to 1,219c/kg, however, this week it landed back at 1,138c/kg after 81c/kg was swiped from the EMI. Southern NSW wool broker Marty Moses said while the wool pipeline had been sitting idle for a while there was finally some pull through as demand in the knitwear market — particularly online — was rising. ""In China they are now cutting full lengths of wool in half to meet the requirements of the knitwear sector, which uses what's called an open top — a shorter fibre length,"" Mr Moses said. While he saw this as a positive sign for retail recovery, Mr Moses said he was still wary of any potential trade tension. ""Our politicians have got to be really careful of the actions they instigate as we can't really have any political taint going in there,"" he said. ""China is heavily invested in top making and processing, and Australian wool makes up a big part of what they do — one would think that if we tread the line and keep our mouths shut, we should be right."" Mr Moses said, in the past, China promptly locked South Africa out of the market when it was claimed it had a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. ""We need to be really careful, because without China in the market, we don't have one at this point in time,"" he said. ""They're critical to our industry as they move out of this crisis that we're in with the COVID shutdowns around the world.""

324,'A second-hand shop': Myer shareholders vent anger as chair quits department store,markets,"  Myer chair Garry Hounsell quits department store hours before AGM vote on his role The chair of embattled department store Myer has quit, just hours before an annual general meeting where major shareholders including retail veteran Solomon Lew would have voted against his re-election. Garry Hounsell has been facing intense pressure from the chain's two biggest shareholders, one of which is Mr Lew's Premier Investments. During his three years on the board, Myer has struggled to deal with the threat of online retail, stumbled through turnaround strategies, and most recently closed its doors nationally because of COVID-19. ""It has become apparent that Myer's two largest shareholders are not supporting my re-election,"" Mr Hounsell said in a statement released to the ASX just hours before the company's AGM on Thursday afternoon. ""And I will not allow my ongoing tenure as chairman to be a distraction to the hard work of the executive team."" The pandemic has been especially brutal for traditional bricks and mortar retailers such as Myer that do not have a booming online presence in the market. Earlier this year, the ABC revealed Australia's largest provider of trade credit insurance had such severe doubts about the future of the department chain, it had stopped providing insurance for suppliers trying to cover the risk of not getting paid by Myer or David Jones. The retailer's financial year 2019-20 results showed it had grown online sales by almost 100 per cent over the half of the year covering the pandemic. However, that online sales growth was nowhere near enough to offset losses from closing stores, with its sales down overall 15 per cent or $472 million. In his statement, Mr Hounsell defended his navigation of the retailer's woes. ""In my three years as chairman, we have pursued a clear strategy that has strengthened the Myer business, allowing it to come through the severe disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns to be well-positioned as we head into the crucial end-of-year trading period,"" he said. ""Our online business is going from strength to strength, with growth of almost 100 per cent in the second half of FY20 to become one of the biggest and fastest-growing online retail stores in Australia."" Mr Hounsell is also currently the chair of Helloworld Travel, another company that is battling the ongoing impacts of the pandemic. A decade ago, while the threat of online retail was still only building, Myer's shares were going for around $3.50. Premier Investments bought just over 10 per cent of Myer in 2015, when its shares had already dropped to around $1.20. In mid-March 2020, as city centres emptied due to COVID-19 and the nation began strict controls on movement, Myer's shares went as low as 10 cents. Premier Investments is itself a listed company, and in its annual report, it described the investment in Myer as disappointing. In 2019, its stake was worth $46.9 million. ""At the end of the 2020 financial year, the fair value of this listed equity investment is reflected as $18.1 million,"" its annual report noted glumly. In a statement, Premier Investments described Mr Hounsell's resignation as a ""green shoot"". ""Mr Garry Hounsell’s resignation ahead of today's Myer AGM is the 'green shoot' that Myer shareholders have long been waiting for,"" it said. ""Mr Hounsell's ousting signals to the entire board that their time is up. ""For the sake of all of Myer's dedicated employees, its many hard-working suppliers, its loyal but frustrated customers, and of course its long-suffering shareholders, the company needs to be restored to health by installing a new, independent board."" Myer's second-biggest investor is Wilson Asset Management, with a 7.8 per cent stake. Myer has announced that its acting chair will be independent director JoAnne Stephenson. Thrust into the role just hours before Myer's AGM on Thursday afternoon, Ms Stephenson blamed an ""untenable situation"" for the departure of Mr Hounsell. Echoing Mr Hounsell's statement, Ms Stephenson said a ""war of words in the media"" was not helpful for the company. ""What Myer needs, more than ever, is stability,"" she said. In a swipe at Premier Investments, she said Myer was ""open to constructive conversations with our largest shareholders"" but it had to take into account the views of smaller shareholders about the direction of the business. The company's AGM was held virtually this year due to COVID-19 and at it seven shareholders submitted the same question: when will the share price recover? Reflecting the concerns of small shareholders, eight shareholders asked when the company would pay a dividend, which is something it has not done since 2017. Another simply asked: ""When will this company start to make money like other retailers?"" One angry investor said they had mentally written off their shares in Myer and were expecting the business to flop. Another was brutal about the chain's fashion credentials. ""Myer has the worst selection of ladies' clothing. Overpriced. I used to get all of my clothes at Myer. I haven't purchased anything of any real value for a long time. ""Get rid of the clearance items. It looks like a second-hand shop."" Myer's chief executive said they had been clearing up its clearance sections but said womenswear had been ""a work in progress"". The chain has pursued a strategy in the last decade of buying up fashion labels, including Sass & Bide and Marcs. Ms Stephenson said Myer would continue to close stores and push for lower rents as it traded through ""a year like no other"". The acting chair said the company was focused on ""deleveraging"" (reducing debt). ""We are committed to reinstating the dividend when it is appropriate to do so,"" Ms Stephenson added.

326,Michael sold leather belts from his market stall for 40 years. This is what it took to close him down,markets,"  For 11 years Jess Pisanelli has been selling vintage fashion at one of Australia's most famous outdoor markets. ""I fell in love with vintage fashion when I was in early high school. I would often hit every op shop I could find and hunt for anything unique. Back then, we were into anything 70s retro,"" she says. Pisanelli's love of vintage fashion morphed into a career and a well-known weekly market stall — Marlow Vintage — that she sets up early every Saturday morning on the playground of Glebe Public School in Sydney's bohemian inner-west. But on March 16, coronavirus abruptly changed everything. The Glebe Markets, which has been held almost every Saturday since 1992, attracting 200 stallholders and up to 10,000 visitors — fell silent. Pisanelli says she was ""devastated"". Over the years her market stall had become so much more than a way to make money. The community and social connection, as well as the relationships she built with customers, had become a fundamental part of her life. ""Susie is in the stall next to me, Peter has the stall behind me,"" she says. ""You see the same people every week for years. You get to know everyone. You know their story."" Pisanelli moved her business online during the market's closure, but it wasn't the same. Vintage clothing is a different game to large-scale online retail, she says. There's only one of each item and while a market stall can be stocked with hundreds of items, online selling requires each item to be photographed on a model, edited, measured, described, then uploaded. ""It's incredibly time-consuming and not scalable,"" she says. ""At the markets, I get to meet my customers, understand what they're looking for, and help them find the perfect piece. It's an important aspect of my business and it's just not possible online."" In late September, Glebe Market reopened after its enforced six-month closure. ""It was such a relief to be back,"" says Pisanelli. ""It was so lovely to catch up with all the stallholders, locals and regulars. It felt like we never left."" I wanted to understand more about the cultural significance of markets and their makers, so I spoke with Dr Fabio Mattioli, an anthropologist at the University of Melbourne. For over a decade, Mattioli has been exploring the social and economic dynamics of cities, including the role of urban markets. They are indeed a space of economic exchange but overlapping this is ""a whole relational world"", he says, his voice lifting with enthusiasm. Historically, markets were places fundamental for democracy: a place to meet and discuss important issues as well as buy and trade things. These days, the cultural relevance of markets depends on the type of market it is, and its relationship to the city. But Mattioli believes they maintain an important social role. ""For many people, markets are a way of life. There can be tight-knit connections with some and even conflict and competition with others,"" he says. ""It is not uncommon to find a sense of the market functioning as one unit, creating a feeling of community. So being unable to function within markets during the pandemic would have significant personal and social impacts for stallholders."" For Mattioli, the closure of markets during COVID-19 restrictions has not only shown what the community has lost but ""who will be the community today?"". ""Markets will not only be different because some of their sections are closed,"" he says. ""There are entire populations who won't be there."" This is something the Matezic family understands well. Michael Matezic has been selling handmade leather belts at Melbourne's Queen Victoria Market for four decades. Yet with Melbourne still in lockdown, more than half the market has closed as a result of coronavirus restrictions. Only the food and drink sections are currently open. Like Jess at Glebe, the Matezics are frustrated that shopping centres have been allowed to trade while markets remain closed. Matezic — a Montanegran farmer who came to Australia in 1979 after his hometown experienced a catastrophic earthquake — took a chance on leather belts, setting up a business called Raw Hide at Queen Vic in 1981. His son Sam, who grew up in and around the market, is now 38 and has taken over the business. They sit together to chat with me over the phone. Sam tells me he fell in love with the market: ""It gave me the opportunity to work with my Dad, who I highly admire for his hard work and enthusiasm. I look up to him and I just want to continue his success. I believe the only way I can do that is at the Vic Markets. ""When I got 'the email' [advising of the market's closure], I felt like four decades went down the drain,"" he says. ""It was very heartbreaking. There were tears. A lot of them. It took me a long time to process, 'Okay, this is how it is now'."" But Michael, now 75, has been assuring the family that the market will return. ""You can't keep Michael away from the market,"" laughs Sam, who has continued to make belts in his workshop almost every day during the pandemic. ""My hands are used to it,"" he says. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Before the pandemic hit, Michael would drive 20 kilometres from home to the markets a few times a week to visit friends, chat with customers and help where he could. ""He meets people from all around the world and people from 20 or 30 years ago still remember him,"" says Sam. ""If it was up to him, he'd be there every day."" While they have dabbled with online selling, the Matezics maintain that the market is their focus: ""Always was. From the beginning. I'm determined to put in the hard work to get it up and running to the way it once was even if it takes one to two years,"" says Sam. But for some market sellers, lifted restrictions will not mean an immediate return to business. The Sunshine Coast's Eumundi Markets has reopened, but Ali Adams — 27-year stallholder of Kin Kin Leather — has not felt confident enough to return yet. She fears that if she contracted coronavirus at work she may transfer it to her vulnerable daughter, who has pre-existing health conditions. For others, coronavirus has been a strange blessing. Despite an initial ""blind panic"", for Jacki Pateman — Jacky LeStrange Vintage Clothing, 28-year vintage-wear stallholder at the Glebe Markets — the six month break has allowed her to shift her business strategy. Pateman has used the time wholesaling vintage-wear in bulk to online stores and has discovered her livelihood doesn't need to depend on the physical space at Glebe. But the role of the market as a community and social space can't be replaced. ""I'm gonna wanna be there every week! It's a family in Glebe. It's hard to recreate that — possible but difficult and takes time."" During the pandemic, Bruce Pham — whose family has made and sold socks at the Queen Vic Market for 33 years — has been able to build an online business that he says is ""doing very well"". Pham tells me he never had time for his kids, but now he does. ""Financially, I'm not happy, but I'm happy in other ways."" Asking what his future has in store, he says, ""The Queen Victoria Market is our home."" Residents who live close to markets have also felt the impact of closure. A Facebook group for Glebe locals offers a clue. Many insist the markets are ""a big part of Glebe's identity"" and essential to the area's community feeling. Katrina Drake, who has visited the markets since the 1990s, missed the neighbourhood buzz during the months of closure; the Nag Champa incense drifting through stalls, eating satay chicken rolls. ""The Glebe Markets was my lodestone — somewhere I knew I could come on a Saturday to lift my mood and brighten my day,"" she writes. Others preferred Glebe without the weekly influx of visitors and traffic but fear for the impact on local businesses. Reopening the markets with COVID-safe rules is the responsibility of Glebe Markets manager David McCumstie. ""How do we retain the Glebe Markets that everyone wants? That's tricky,"" he says. ""You can't make the aisle-way too wide and stores so scarce that it's uninteresting. It removes character. Lacks intimacy. You need the feeling of looking for treasures. But we also need a sense of space in this new world. There's a balance to be had."" McCumstie says he spent weeks hiring and training new staff, informing COVID-safety measures including visitor number checks, replanning the market map, hand sanitisation, and developing a new QR-code food ordering system to avoid long queues. After publicly announcing their first-day return, stallholder bookings sold out within two days. ""It's quite a humbling experience to hear this outpour of enthusiasm,"" says McCumstie. It is a testament to Glebe's unique identity, he says, that keeps people coming back. ""It's probably the most alive and organic market in Sydney. By organic, I mean it's got a life of its own. It's dictated by the people and characters who make this market. It's not dictated by management."" As stallholders and market-goers gather with gusto, they bring with them enlivened personal stories of a time like no other. Here's to a new time, a new market. For those not yet able to return — hang in there. Dr Mattioli reminds me that markets have survived historical plagues and pandemics. ""It might take a while to adjust,"" he says. ""But cities require spaces of economy and relations. Once we find some normality, many of us will get back out there to feel immersed in a city again.""

327,"ASX treads water as investors focus on US presidential debate, Qantas takes border closure hit",markets,"  ASX treads water as investors focus on US presidential debate, Qantas takes border closure hit Australia's share market has ended its day with minimal losses and shrugged off the final US presidential debate between US President Donald Trump and Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden. The ASX 200 index finished just 0.1 per cent down to 6,167, after falling by around 0.4 per cent during the debate. Miners, technology and healthcare stocks weighed on the market with oil stocks and banks among the gainers. Many of today's worst-performing stocks were gold miners, after the precious metal's spot price fell sharply overnight to just over $US1,900 an ounce. As of 4:30pm, AEDT the Australian dollar slipped slightly to 71.07 US cents. The All Ordinaries fell by nearly 0.2 per cent to 6,374. Brent crude oil fell 0.3 per cent at $US42.34 a barrel. Spot gold lifted by just 0.1 per cent to $US1,905.30 an ounce. Qantas shares ended the day up, despite the company stating that it is still being stung by COVID-19. Chief executive Alan Joyce told the company's AGM on Friday that delays in reopening state borders cost it $100 million over the first quarter of the financial year, with fewer domestic flights operating than expected. ""This delay resulted in a $100 million negative impact on earnings for the first quarter of FY21 and will have an impact on Q2 as well,"" Mr Joyce said. He said he expects flight capacity to rise to 50 per cent by Christmas if Queensland opens its border to New South Wales in coming weeks. Qantas plans to cut business costs by $15 billion over the next three years, mainly by reduced flights and job cuts. It is also eyeing new markets that may open up with travel bubbles with parts of Asia such as South Korea, Taiwan and the Pacific. Qantas shares gained 2.7 per cent to $4.55. Mining companies BHP (-1.3pc) and Rio Tinto (-0.9pc) fell after a drop in iron ore prices. The National Australia Bank will pay another $380 million before tax in compensation for customers for bank and investment advice and fees, $128 million in backpay for staff because of underpayments, and $134 million on expected property writedowns as the bank consolidates office space in Melbourne. The provisions and impairment will take around $640 million before tax off second-half profit. Its shares rose 0.6 per cent, ANZ shares rose 1.4 per cent, Commonwealth Bank gained 0.8 per cent, and Westpac shares rose 1 per cent. Insurance Australia Group said insurance profit for the first quarter had recorded low growth because of fewer natural disasters and motor accident claims. Its shares initially fell 2.6 per cent to $4.78 but had almost recovered by close. BlueScope Steel shares had a spike during the day, after it forecast that first-half earnings would rise by one-third compared to the second half of last financial year. It expects before-tax earnings for the first half of 2021 to come it at $340 million. It closed 10.9 per cent to $15.90. Beach Energy shares increased 1.1 per cent after it saw a rise in quarterly revenue. Online travel firm Webjet rose 3.6 per cent after it said it saw pent-up demand for travel services and products increasing. Iluka Resources plunged nearly 49 per cent amid the listing of iron ore royalties spin-off Deterra Royalties as it debuted with a market value of $2.6 billion. Mask manufacturer CleanSpace Holdings surged by more than 68 per cent to $7.42 as it made its debut on the ASX. Shares in the biggest-ever female-led Australian share market float hit the boards of the ASX today. Online store Adore Beauty closed 2.5 per cent higher at $6.92, bringing its market value to $651 million. The valuation of the stock has raised a few eyebrows given it's trading at more than 250 times current earnings of $2.5million. The company sold a 60 per cent stake to Quadrant Private Equity just over a year ago. Founder Kate Morris told Alicia Barry on The Business that the recent boom in ecommerce stocks pushed her listing plans forward. ""We expected to grow slowly and carefully as we have done for the last 20 years and then COVID came along and hit the fast-forward button"" she said. ""So here we were and the IPO window was open and we thought maybe now's the time, maybe we should go for it."" Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs has agreed to pay $US2.9 billion ($4.1 billion) over its role in Malaysia's 1MDB corruption scandal while US stocks have increased despite little signs of progress in stimulus negotiations. The settlement with the US Department of Justice and other US and overseas regulators resolved an investigation into the role played by Goldman in helping to steal cash from the Malaysian state fund. The bank underwrote three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013 that raised $US6.5 billion for Malaysia's government. The US Department of Justice said the deal was the largest penalty ever levied on a US company for breaching the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and involved an unprecedented number of regulators across the globe. Acting head of the Justice Department's criminal division Brian Rabbitt said the settlement reflected the bank's central role ""in a massive global scheme to loot billions of dollars"". Prosecutors said that between around 2009 and 2014, Goldman paid more than $US1.6 billion in bribes to foreign officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to win 1MDB business. The move follows a $US3.9 billion settlement the bank reached with Malaysia in July to settle all charges against the bank related to the matter. The scandal relates to the government of former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak, which set up the 1MDB fund in 2009. The Justice Department estimated $US4.5 billion was misappropriated by fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014 to pay for real estate, art and other luxury items. Goldman Sachs shares rose 1.2 per cent to $US205.40. US stocks have gained in another day of volatile trade on optimism that new coronavirus assistance would be approved by Congress. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said there had been progress in talks with the Trump administration for another round of financial aid and said legislation could be ""hammered out"" soon. Ms Pelosi and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have been in discussions on a $US2 trillion economic rescue package but Senate Republicans oppose such a large bill. However, uncertainty remained after US President Donald Trump yesterday accused the Democrats of being unwilling to compromise. And Senate Appropriations Committee chairman Richard Shelby told reporters that he thought the negotiations were ""not going anywhere."" ""A lot of talk, no action,"" he said. As coronavirus assistance runs out, the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped 55,000 to 787,000 last week, which was better than forecast by economists. The figure is still high with the labour market recovery apparently stalling, although new claims are far lower than the record 6.9 million applications filed in March. Continuing unemployment claims fell from 9.4 million to nearly 8.4 million last week. Other data showed that home sales had jumped 9.4 per cent to a 14-week high. The Dow Jones index rose 0.5 per cent to 28,367, the S&P 500 index added 0.5 per cent to 3,453, and the Nasdaq Composite increased by 0.2 per cent to 11,506. Oil stocks and banks boosted the S&P 500. Electric car maker Tesla jumped after it reported its fifth quarterly profit in a row. It made a revenue record of $US8.8 billion, boosted by a rise in vehicle deliveries and sales of environmental regulatory credits to other carmakers. Tesla said it was on target to deliver half a million vehicles by the end of this year. That goal will require it to significantly increase car sales over the fourth quarter. Tesla shares rose 0.7 per cent to $US425.79. New stimulus measures in the UK saw European stocks come off their lows. The UK Finance Minister Rishi Sunak announced billions of pounds in financial aid for pandemic hit firms. However rising coronavirus cases worried investors with Spain becoming the first Western European nation to surpass 1 million infections. The FT100 index rose 0.2 per cent to 5,786, the DAX in Germany fell 0.1 per cent to 12,543 and the CAC 40 in Paris was little change, down 3 points to 4,851.

328,"ASX recovers from heavy losses, as Crown rebounds from 'first strike'",markets,"  ASX recovers from heavy losses, as Crown shares rebound after 'first strike' The Australian share market has managed to recoup most of its heavy losses, while Crown Resorts investors have shrugged off allegations of money laundering breaches. By close, the ASX 200 had come off its early falls and was down 0.3 per cent to 6,134 points. The broader All Ordinaries index also largely recovered from its early falls to end 0.3 per cent lower at 6,384. Crown chairman Helen Coonan told the company's annual general meeting on Thursday that the casino firm would form a new compliance and financial crimes department, and expected to have a number of significant and wide-ranging reforms in place by February next year. More than one third of investors voted against the company's executive pay plans, a ""first strike"" against the board which could trigger a board spill next year. Ms Coonan said there had been a significant protest vote against the re-election of three directors — Jane Halton, John Horvath, and Guy Jalland — at today's annual general meeting. Mr Horvath said he would leave the board. Crown is facing three separate inquiries into the allegations and financial crimes regulator AUSTRAC accuses the company of breaking anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. By mid-morning, Crown Resort shares were down 1.4 per cent to $8.26. But by close, its shares had reversed course and were up 2.03 per cent to $8.55. Talks between US Democrats and the White House faced a setback after US President Donald Trump accused them of being unwilling to compromise on a new US stimulus package. Mr Trump blasted US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a tweet after she pushed for a $US2 trillion package with US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The news, which came after US markets closed, saw the ASX 200 index slump more than 1 per cent in early trade. Australian shares fell to their lowest in nearly a fortnight as a decline in oil prices and banks weighed on the market. Overnight, Brent crude oil lost 3.3 per cent to $US41.72 a barrel as US crude stockpiles dipped and petrol stocks rose amid weak demand for fuel. By 1:30pm AEDT, it was down a further 0.5 per cent to $US41.51 US cents. Oil producers Woodside Petroleum (-1.6pc) and Santos (-1.9pc) slipped as they reported lower quarterly sales with the coronavirus pandemic sapping demand for oil. Banks rallied off morning lows but ended in the red, with the big four all down 0.5 per cent. Shares in financial firm AMP dived 5.6 per cent, after investors withdrew nearly $2 billion over the three months to the end of September. The firm expects a further $450 million in outflows over the current December quarter. Pathology firm Healius rose 9.3 per cent after a positive first quarter update and X-ray firm Pro Medicus rose 2.3 per cent. Rio Tinto and BHP both added 1 per cent, after a rise in iron ore prices. Shares in miner Oz Minerals ended 5.3 per cent higher. It was the company's highest gain since June and was off the back of positive third quarter projections for copper production. The biggest losers in the ASX 200 were shopping centre owner Unibail Rodamco (-9.3pc) and gold miner Resolute Mining (-6.4pc) after it announced production had dropped by 19 per cent from the June to September quarter. Buy now, pay later firm Zip ended the day 5.1 per cent lower, after news broke late yesterday that Westpac had sold out of the firm, after announcing a deal with its rival Afterpay. The Australian dollar jumped by more than 1 per cent overnight as the greenback hit a seven-week low as negotiations over new US coronavirus relief dragged on. However, by 5.00pm, it was down 0.3 per cent to 70.96 US cents. The local currency also fell 5.8 per cent to 4.73 Chinese yuan. ""The Chinese yuan has outperformed because of the unexpected strength of China's trade and current account surpluses,"" said Commonwealth Bank currency strategist Joseph Capurso. ""The counterpart to China's large trade surplus is the sharp widening in the US's trade deficit to around 4 per cent of GDP."" Spot gold fell 0.5 per cent to $US1914.28 an ounce. US stocks lost ground in late trade after a volatile session as investors worried whether difficult negotiations in Washington would produce agreement on a new stimulus package before the US presidential elections on November 3. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said while there were some differences between the White House and congressional Democrats, Republican President Donald Trump was ""willing to lean into"" working on an agreement. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi continued negotiations with US Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin and said there was still a chance for a deal despite resistance from Senate Republicans, although she acknowledged it might not pass until after the election. Wedbush Securities managing director Michael James said investors were still hopeful that a deal could be reached this week. ""As long as she keeps dangling the carrot out there that there's still a chance that something could get done investors continue to remain optimistic,"" he said. ""Everybody's going to be sitting on pins and needles waiting for the next headline between now and the end of tomorrow's trading day."" However, stocks lost their gains as other investors remained sceptical that a deal would be reached before next month's elections. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 98 points or 0.4 per cent to 28,211, the S&P 500 lost 8 points or 0.2 per cent to 3,436 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 32 points or 0.3 per cent to 11,485. Investors are also concerned about rising coronavirus cases in the US and Europe. Most of the sectors on the S&P 500 were lower with oil stocks leading the falls. But communications firms rose after the owner of the Snapchat messaging app Snap jumped by nearly one-third to $US36.50 after it posted record sales for the third quarter. That was after it posted better than expected user growth and revenue forecasts as more people signed up to chat with friends and family during COVID-19. Snap now has 249 million daily active users, up 18 per cent over the year. Snap's rise boosted the shares of social media companies with Facebook increasing by 4.2 per cent. Twitter was the top performer in the S&P 500 with its shares up 8.4 per cent and social media firm Pinterest rose nearly 9 per cent. Netflix shares fell 6.9 per cent after it saw a pullback in subscribers over the quarter. European stocks finished in the red. The FTSE 100 in London lost 1.9 per cent to 5,777, the DAX in Germany fell 1.4 per cent to 12,558, and the CAC 40 in Paris declined 1.5 per cent to 4,854. The pound sterling vaulted to a six-week high against the US dollar after Britain's chief Brexit negotiator David Frost said negotiations with the European Union would resume today.

329,Australian stocks run out of steam as retail spending falls,markets,"  ASX follows Wall Street's cautious rise on US stimulus hopes The Australian share market lost most of its gains after retail sales dropped in September, despite a good start on renewed hopes of a COVID-19 stimulus deal in the United States. US President Donald Trump backed a new deal on Tuesday and the House Speaker's deputy chief of staff said an agreement was closer. The ASX 200 was largely unchanged, closing 0.1 per cent higher at 6,192 points. Oil stocks, financial firms and resources were among the gainers and healthcare, consumer and technology were among the losers. The All Ordinaries index also lifted by a similar level to 6,403. Packaging company Orora jumped 8 per cent after saying its first quarter was tracking well, and its Australasian beverage business was in line with the same time last year. Whitehaven Coal put on 5.3 per cent, and nickel miner Western Areas increased 3.9 per cent, while gaming firm Tabcorp rose 3.2 per cent despite a fall in first quarter revenue. It told investors at its annual general meeting that it was close to finding a replacement for chief executive David Attenborough. Rare earths miner Lynas rose 4.2 per cent after an increase in first quarter production. Data centre operator Megaport led the falls on the ASX 200, down 13.2 per cent to $14.58. That's despite the firm seeing record quarterly growth in customers and ports, and signing a strategic collaboration with IT firm Cisco earlier in the year. EML Payments dropped 2.4 per cent despite seeing a record first quarter, and biotech company Mesoblast lost 4.4 per cent. Online retailer Temple & Webster made a bigger before-tax profit over the September quarter than it did last financial year as COVID-19 saw more people stay home, shop online and spend more on furniture and homewares. Revenue so far this year jumped 138 per cent and the firm said customer satisfaction remained at record levels. Customers rose by 77 per cent to almost half a million over the year. However, its shares plunged 17.2 per cent. Australians cut their spending on food and household goods last month as the JobKeeper wage subsidy and unemployment benefits were both reduced. The Bureau of Statistics said preliminary retail sales fell by 1.5 per cent or $448 million in September on a seasonally adjusted basis after a 4 per cent drop in August. Spending was also lower on clothing, shoes and personal accessories, but that was offset by rises at department stores, cafes, restaurants and takeaway food outlets. EY chief economist Jo Masters said the figures added to growing evidence that the economic recovery was likely to be ""slow and bumpy"". ""The easing of income support and the slowdown in the jobs recovery, as indicated by payroll jobs and wages data yesterday, is likely to lead to further declines in retail turnover in the coming months,"" she said. Sales fell everywhere except the Northern Territory, but they were still better than in September last year. The drop in sales in Victoria in September was not as bad as the 12.6 per cent slump in August when tough coronavirus lockdowns were introduced. Over the September quarter, preliminary retail trade jumped 6.8 per cent following a 2.3 per cent fall in the June quarter. Australian Retailers Association boss Paul Zahra was more optimistic about the data. ""This is a strong trend that we believe is setting us up for a cautiously optimistic Christmas shopping season,"" he said. The Australian dollar fell as low as 70.22 US cents overnight on increased bets the Reserve Bank would cut interest rates or ramp up its purchase of government bonds when it met in two weeks. However, the local currency recovered throughout the Australian trading session. By 4:45pm AEDT, it had lifted 0.4 per cent to 70.7 US cents. Brent crude oil fell in Asian trade after a rise overnight on the US stimulus hopes.  It was down 0.6 per cent to $US42.90 a barrel. Spot gold rose 0.6 per cent to $US1,918.41 an ounce as the greenback fell on the prospect of the new coronavirus stimulus. Asian markets were mixed, with the Shanghai Composite down 0.6 per cent However, Tokyo's Nikkei and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.4 and 0.8 per cent respectively. Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific announced it would lay off 8,500 workers, nearly one quarter of its staff, amid the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier, US stocks had increased on renewed optimism that Congress could reach a deal with the Trump administration over a new coronavirus relief package. Mr Trump said he would accept a deal worth more than $US2.2 trillion despite opposition from Republicans in the Senate. The Democratic Party Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi wants a $US2.2 trillion package, but the White House had pushed for $US1.8 trillion in economic aid. However, Mr Trump appears to have changed his tune, telling Fox News: ""I want to do it even bigger than the Democrats."" Ms Pelosi's spokesman Drew Hamill said she and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had moved closer to agreement on new stimulus before next month's presidential election during a 45 minute discussion. Ms Pelosi had set today as the deadline for a deal and the pair will resume talks tomorrow. Earlier Ms Pelosi told Bloomberg TV that she was confident that agreement could be reached. ""I'm optimistic, because I do think we have … a shared value that finally they want to crush the virus,"" she said. Republican senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said if a deal is reached and passed by the House of Representatives, then the Senate would consider it. ""I'm aware that discussions continue between the President and the speaker about a larger package,"" he told reporters. ""Obviously, if that were to come over, we'd have to consider it. And would consider it."" The news saw US stocks rally but they came off their highs in late trade with some analysts sceptical about the prospect of a deal. The Dow Jones index rose 0.4 per cent to 28,309, the S&P 500 put on 0.5 per cent to 3,443 and the Nasdaq gained 0.3 per cent to 11,517. Shares in Google parent Alphabet put on 1.4 per cent to $US1551.08 despite the US Department of Justice launching a case against the internet giant for allegedly using its market power to unlawfully dominate web searches and search advertising. But Neil Campling from Mirabaud Securities in London said it was too late to take action to limit Google's market position. ""It's like locking the proverbial door after the horse has bolted,"" he said. ""Google has already got the monopolistic position, has invested billions in infrastructure, AI, technologies, software, engineering and talent. ""You can't simply unwind a decade of significant progress, or create new alternative powerhouses or tech ecosystems out of thin air."" More companies have released their third quarter earnings results, with Netflix reporting after the closing bell. The streaming company posted its weakest rise in new subscribers in four years amid more competition in the streaming market, the easing of pandemic restrictions and as live sports returned to television. Netflix gained 2.2 million paid subscribers globally during the September quarter, missing analyst estimates of 3.4 million. Its shares dropped 6 per cent in after-hours trading. From January to March, Netflix saw 15.8 million new subscribers as people stayed home at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. It said the results reflected the big surge in customers earlier in the year. ""Competition for consumers’ time and engagement remains vibrant,"" Netflix said in a letter to shareholders. Revenue rose by more than one fifth to $US6.44 billion in the third quarter and net profit increased to $US790 million. Property and accident insurer Travelers Companies gained 5.6 per cent as it beat quarterly profit expectations. International Business Machines (IBM) posted double digit quarterly growth from cloud revenue. But it said customers had deferred some projects because of the uncertain economic outlook. Revenue from the cloud business rose 19 per cent to $US6 billion in the third quarter. Its shares fell 6.5 per cent after it said total revenue fell nearly 3 per cent to $US17.56 billion over the quarter. Consumer firm Procter & Gamble said sales of home cleaning products jumped by one third because of coronavirus. Its shares rose 0.4 per cent. European stocks fell as worries about coronavirus restrictions and Brexit offset optimism from strong earnings, including from Swiss bank UBS. Italy, Spain and Britain imposed curbs to limit the spread of new coronavirus cases that threaten to derail a budding economic recovery. And the European Union and the UK struggled to make progress on a trade deal to avoid a disruptive departure for Britain from the EU.

330,Afterpay shares jump but Zip slips after banking deals,markets,"  Afterpay shares surge as buy now, pay later firms join forces with banking and credit giants Shares in buy now, pay later firm Afterpay have reached a record high following a banking deal with Westpac, while the Australian share market has been pulled down by rising coronavirus infections and stalled stimulus talks in the US. Westpac will partner with Afterpay to offer services on the bank's new digital platform as the big banks seek to counter the popularity of digital disrupters with younger customers. The agreement will allow Afterpay to provide Westpac transaction and savings accounts and budgeting tools to its 3.3 million customers in Australia from mid next year. The popularity of buy now, pay later services, which allow users to pay in instalments, have surged during the coronavirus pandemic. Westpac chief executive Peter King said the bank looked forward to working with Afterpay. ""Fintech innovation is changing banking in important ways and our new digital banking platform is part of our long-term strategy to support this trend and better respond to changing customer needs,"" he said. The deal means Afterpay will get new revenue streams and gain more information on the finances of users. RBC Capital Markets said processing payments through Westpac could reduce costs for Afterpay and more customer information could lower loss rates. Westpac invested $40 million in Afterpay rival Zip in 2017 and owns 10.7 per cent of Zip. Afterpay shares closed 4.5 per cent higher at $101.94 on the news. They reached a record high of $105.80 earlier in the day, valuing the firm at about $30 billion. Westpac shares lost 1.4 per cent and the other banks gave up their gains, with ANZ closing 1 per cent lower, CBA falling 1.2 per cent and NAB off 1.1 per cent. Meanwhile, Zip has teamed up with credit card giant Visa to create a new product that allows Zip Pay users to shop anywhere that accepts Visa payments. It's also announced partnerships with Apple Pay and Google Pay, allowing users to make payments on their smart phones and Apple Watch. Zip chief executive Larry Diamond said the new Tap & Zip product followed a review of Zip's instore payments, which were based on barcode and QR technology and took longer to process at the check-out. Only 13 per cent of stores can to process buy now, pay later services, according to research commissioned by Zip. He said Zip customers preferred to use contactless payments or tap-and-go technology to pay for everyday purchases. ""BNPL (buy now, pay later) has seen phenomenal growth over the last few years as customers switched traditional forms of credit for flexible, digital alternatives,"" Mr Diamond said. ""However, until now that growth has been restricted by a clunky instore check-out experience and limited acceptance."" Zip shares rose by more than 3 per cent initially, but by the end of the session the stock had reversed course and closed 1.4 per cent lower at $7.07. The initial surge in buy now, pay later stocks boosted the ASX technology index by more than 2 per cent to a record high mid-session, before it slipped into the red by the close. Big miner BHP said iron ore production rose 7 per cent to 74 million tonnes over the September quarter from the same time a year ago supported by demand from China. However, it said December quarter production would be affected by work at mining projects in the Pilbara in Western Australia. BHP said it would not go ahead with a $US2.5 billion expansion of the Olympic Dam gold, copper and uranium mine in South Australia because of the cost of the project. It will invest around $500 million as part of planned maintenance work on the Olympic Dam smelter, with up to 1,500 people to be employed during the peak of the works. BHP shares fell 1.6 per cent and Rio Tinto dropped 1.5 per cent on weaker metals prices. The Australian share market was up and down in volatile trade after a fall on Wall Street. The ASX 200 fell at the start, recovered its losses, but then the sell-off resumed. The benchmark index closed down by 0.7 per cent, or 44 points, at 6,184 points. The All Ordinaries index declined 0.6 per cent to 6,396. Most sectors ended in the red, with only industrials and real estate managing to make gains. Education firm IDP Education dropped 7.2 per cent to $18.57 after a fall in student placements Gold miners also lost ground, with Perseus Mining down 5.4 per cent. Spot gold dipped 0.2 per cent to $US1,899 an ounce. Brent crude oil fell 0.8 per cent to $US42.28 a barrel. Asian stock markets were also in the red, with the Nikkei 225 in Japan losing 0.6 per cent and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong down 0.2 per cent. Reserve Bank assistant governor Christopher Kent told an online business conference that the central bank has provided more stimulus to the Australian economy because of the coronavirus recession than during the global financial crisis in 2008. The RBA has cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25 per cent and embarked on a government bond-buying program Mr Kent said there was the need for additional assistance for some time because of high unemployment and the economic outlook. He also said that the cheap loans offered to banks by the RBA had lowered interest rates and boosted lending. Economists are tipping an RBA rate cut at the central bank's meeting in November on Melbourne Cup day to 0.1 per cent. The minutes from the RBA meeting earlier this month said that financial markets prices implied that investors now expected the official cash rate to decline to below 0.1 per cent. Commonwealth Bank economist Belinda Allen said the minutes gave the ""green light to easing in November"". ""With further restrictions eased in both NSW and Victoria in recent days, and more expected, the timing is ripe for the RBA to provide more assistance,"" she said. Capital Economics economist Ben Udy also saw a rate cut as ""all but confirmed"". The Australian dollar fell further against the greenback after the speech by Mr Kent and the RBA minutes. By 4:40pm AEST, it had fallen 0.4 per cent to 70.36 US cents, the lowest level this month. Global ratings agency S&P reaffirmed Australia's AAA credit rating but maintained its negative outlook because of the record budget deficit. That means that the country's top investment ranking could be reduced, theoretically increasing borrowing costs. S&P said Australia's budget deficits will persist and ""debt levels will be elevated for years to come"" although it said the large economic stimulus will support an economic recovery. The latest employment figures from the Bureau of Statistics showed that payrolls fell by 0.9 per cent between September 19 and October 3, indicating the lower JobKeeper wage subsidy was is having an impact and the continued restrictions in Victoria. Companies with more than 200 staff saw the biggest fall in jobs with power firms, gas, water and waste services suffering the biggest fall in payrolls over the fortnight. Stocks on Wall Street dropped amid rising coronavirus cases and little progress on a new stimulus package for the US. US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi set tonight as the deadline for an agreement to be reached before next month's presidential election. The White House has proposed a $US1.8 trillion stimulus package, but Ms Pelosi is seeking $US2.2 trillion in aid. Global coronavirus cases reached 40 million, with the virus spreading rapidly in the US and Europe, which saw record daily infections. US stocks opened higher on hopes for a COVID-19 vaccine on the 33rd anniversary of the Black Monday stock market crash, where the Dow Jones index lost nearly 23 per cent of its value in one day. Hopes for a vaccine rose after Pfizer indicated on Friday it could have a vaccine ready to go in the US by the end of the year. Investors also liked the latest GDP figures from China, with the Chinese economy expanding by 4.9 per cent over the year to the September quarter. But then stocks slipped into the red. The Dow Jones index lost 1.4 per cent or 411 to 28,195, the S&P 500 fell 1.6 per cent to 3,427 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.7 per cent to 11,479. Healthcare stocks and communication services led the falls on the S&P 500. Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft all lost ground. Oilfield services provider Halliburton saw its fourth quarterly loss in a row as this year's slump in oil prices due to COVID-19 hurt demand for its services. ConocoPhillips slipped 3.2 per cent as it agreed to buy US shale oil producer Concho Resources for $US9.7 billion as the energy sector continued to consolidate. Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi's personal wealth management business, said investors were looking for clarity on when a stimulus deal would happen. ""People are coming around to the idea that it's a really short timeframe and it's probably not going to happen before the election,"" he said. In Europe, the United Kingdom and the European Union agreed to step up their trade talks and work on legal texts. It was a partial breakthrough after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to quit the deadlocked negotiations. Trading volumes in Europe were sharply lower due to a technical glitch at exchange operator Euronext, which led to trading being temporarily halted at the Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris bourses. The FTSE 100 fell 0.6 per cent to 5,885, the DAX in Germany dropped 0.4 per cent to 12,855, and the CAC 40 fell 0.1 per cent to 4,929 as pandemic restrictions weighed on shares.

331,Crown Casino shares plunge but ASX gains as coronavirus restriction ease,markets,"  ASX climbs to new seven-month high on eased coronavirus restrictions but Crown plunges amid AUSTRAC investigation Shares in casino operator Crown Resorts have plunged as much as 10 per cent after the financial crimes regulator AUSTRAC launched an investigation into compliance with anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing laws. New South Wales authorities are also probing allegations of money laundering at Crown's casinos by criminals with links to junket operators in Asia. Victorian gaming authorities have asked Crown to show cause as to why it shouldn't face penalties over the allegations. Crown shares fell to $8.06, the lowest since April. They closed down 8.2 per cent to $8.25. National Australia Bank was fined just $15 million by the Federal Court for its home loan introducer program, which saw unlicensed third parties paid commissions by the bank to introduce borrowers. Justice Michael Lee delivered a lower penalty than the bank potentially faced because of what he said was NAB's co-operation in self reporting the conduct and after it admitted it broke the law 260 times. ""There was no uniform processes for the selection of the introducers, no requirement that they have any particular training and no minimum level of due diligence,"" the judge said. ""NAB profited handsomely from the loans generated."" The bank wrote $24 billion in loans from the program from 2013 to 2016. The judge also criticised the corporate regulator, ASIC, for probing ""only a small segment of the program"", instead relying significantly on the investigation done by NAB. ""I have a nagging feeling of disquiet that the true picture of the extent of the problems with the program is not being revealed because there was not a real regulatory desire to pursue a thorough investigation as to what in truth occurred,"" he said. It was the first major case to come out of the banking royal commission, with hundreds to thousands of untrained ""introducers"", including a tailor and a gym instructor, paid millions of dollars to refer customers. The scandal included falsified documents and the payment of cash bribes to get loans approved, with both a former NAB branch manager and a Ferrari-driving home loan banker jailed for fraud. NAB axed the program in October last year amid the fallout from the royal commission. In a statement, ASIC deputy chairman Daniel Crennan said the penalty reflected the serious contraventions of the National Credit Act. The NAB executive in charge of legal services, Sharon Cook, said the bank had paid back around $5 million to affected customers. ""NAB has acknowledged that the introducer payments program had inherent risks and ultimately fell short of customer and community expectations,"" she said. NAB was also forced to apologise to customers today after outages on the bank's mobile banking app, desktop online banking, NAB's share trading platform and NAB merchant terminals lasted for hours. Services were gradually restored in the afternoon. ATMs, NAB cards and Apple Pay were not affected. NAB shares rose 0.9 per cent to $19.40. The other big banks also gained, with the Commonwealth Bank up 1.1 per cent, ANZ up 1 per cent and Westpac putting on 0.6 per cent. The Australian share market rose to the highest level since early March as Victoria eased its coronavirus lockdown. There were also renewed hopes of a new US stimulus package ahead of next month's presidential election and a coronavirus vaccine by year's end. The ASX 200 index gained more than 1 per cent during today's trade, but disappointing economic data from China saw the benchmark index finish off its highs. It closed up nearly 0.9 per cent or 53-points to 6,229, its highest since March 6. The All Ordinaries index put on 0.8 per cent to 6,436. Nearly all sectors gained on the ASX 200 index with education stocks, healthcare, technology firms and miners leading the way.  Only the real estate sector dropped. Miner Rio Tinto rose 0.1 per cent, BHP put on 0.7 per cent and Fortescue Metals gained 1.1 per cent. Iron ore firm Flinders Mines lost 17.8 per cent to $0.04. Rare earths miner Lynas Corporation increased 6.3 per cent to $2.85 after China passed a law that could restrict exports of rare earths. Construction firm CIMIC was the best peformer on the ASX 200, up 8.2 per cent to $22.59, after it said it would sell half of its mining services business, Thiess, to activist hedge fund Elliott Advisors. Oil refiner Ampol said its Lytton refinery in Brisbane had made a quarterly loss of $82 million because of the impact of coronavirus. The company is reviewing the plant and considering closing it down. Its shares came off their lows and rose 1.3 per cent to $25.42. Shares in fashion chain owner Mosiac Brands jumped by one-fifth to $0.69. Shares in computer hardware distributor Dicker Data rose 6.9 per cent to $9.05 after it said working from home had seen its revenue rise by 15 per cent to $1.5 billion for the first nine months of the year, pushing profit by up by more than one-quarter to almost $61 million. The Australian dollar remains under pressure amid expectations the Reserve Bank will cut official interest rates next month but the China data helped the local currency trade above 71 US cents. At 4:30pm AEDT, it was buying about 70.9 US cents, up 0.1 per cent. Spot gold increased 0.4 per cent to $US1906.61 an ounce. Brent crude oil futures fell 0.1 per cent to $US42.89 a barrel. Asian markets also rose, with the Nikkei in Japan up 1.2 per cent to 23,693 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rising by 0.7 per cent to 24,556 at 4:50pm AEDT. The Shanghai Composite fell 0.6 per cent to 3,317. New Zealand's benchmark index fell 0.4 per cent to 12,385 after a landslide victory by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in Saturday's election. China's economy expanded by 4.9 per cent on an annual basis over the September quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. However, the numbers disappointed economists who had predicted a faster recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Over the first nine months of the year, the Chinese economy grew by 0.7 per cent. It contracted by 6.8 per cent in the first three months of the year. From July to September, the Chinese economy expanded by 2.7 per cent, amid more government spending, tax relief and lower borrowing rates. China's statistics agency said the country's economy was still in the process of recovery and the international environment remained complex and severe with considerable instability and uncertainties. Retail sales rose 3.3 per cent over the year to September, compared to a 0.5 per cent annual rise in August. However, sales fell 7.2 per cent for the first nine months of the year. Unemployment fell from 5.6 per cent in August to 5.4 per cent in September. Industrial production expanded by just 1.2 per cent the first nine months of 2020, but grew by 6.9 per cent over the year to September. Dai-ichi Life Research Institute chief economist Yoshikiyo Shimamine said while the GDP data was below expectations, the monthly figures showed there was no reason to be overly pessimistic. ""China's economy remains on the recovery path, driven by a rebound in exports. ""Consumer spending is also headed in the right direction, but we cannot say it has completely shaken off the drag caused by the coronavirus,"" he said. On Wall Street on Friday, the major market indexes ended mixed. The Dow Jones index rose 0.4 per cent to 28,606, the S&P 500 was flat at 3,484 and the Nasdaq fell 0.4 per cent to 11,672. Some investor confidence returned after pharmaceutical firm Pfizer said it could apply for US authorisation for the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with German partner BioNTech in November. There were hopeful comments from US officials about new stimulus for the North American economy. US retail sales were much better than expected in September. Sales rose 1.9 per cent as people bought cars and clothing, ate out and spent more on hobbies. Sales fell 1 per cent in August.

333,Dry September robs millions of tonnes from West Australian grain harvest,markets,"  Grain forecast to fall millions of tonnes short as West Australian farmers start harvest A dry finish to the grain growing season in Western Australia has wiped millions of tonnes from the state's expected harvest. The Grains Industry Association of WA's total production estimate is expected to fall from more than 14 million tonnes forecast last month to under 12 million tonnes. Crop report author Michael Lamond said well over a million hectares of crop had suffered damage due to a dry September across much of the state. ""With no rain, crops just can't finish properly and that's exactly what's happened,"" he said. ""There has been a massive slide in potential tonnage. ""What's shocked me a bit is, even in western areas, it's really slid a lot. There is a lot of potential gone. ""We'll be looking at less grain this year than last year."" The GIWA crop report figures will be released on Friday. In the north, agronomist Simon Teakle is more optimistic about the plight of farmers in the Geraldton port zone. ""It's been a challenging year for growers with a later than optimal start, "" he said. ""It's definitely been below average rainfall, but all in all I'd say most growers are reasonably happy with how the season's gone, given the amount of rain we've had."" ""I think if it wasn't for . . . really good rain for August, we may have had a fairly ordinary year, but August has been the saving grace this year. ""I think that most (growers' harvests) will  be about average. I think that canola and lupins will be better than expected, wheat and barley will be average or slightly below."" Gutha farmer Katrina Sasse made a slightly earlier than usual start to her program when she began harvesting barley this week. She said the crop was performing well given it had received 180 millimetres of rain this calendar year — well below average. ""Some soils have done really well, others have fallen in a heap come September but it was a cool finish, so we're pretty happy with the result,"" she said. ""It seems like we're starting earlier and earlier every year. Canola usually starts first but canola is hanging on at the moment due to that cool finish. ""I love it. This is my favourite time of year. It's my favourite job on the farm."" Ms Sasse said feed barley also grew very well on her farm, but when China imposed a tariff on Australian barley, she abandoned plans for a barley program next year. ""We haven't grown barley for a fair while on our farm. It does grow very good biomass. It helps your soils,"" she said. However, the China tariff had removed the potential for profit.

334,analysis: The markets have turned on Donald Trump — and they now predict he'll lose,markets,"  The markets now predict that Donald Trump will lose the US election. Here's how we know US President Donald Trump was raring to get back to work, just days after contracting coronavirus. Some of his enthusiasm may be driven by an uncomfortable realisation that he may be heading for a decisive election defeat. Currency markets are now pointing to precisely that outcome — a turnaround in just a few weeks. Last month the price of derivatives (insurance traders take out to protect themselves from sharp moves in the market) shot up, as investors believed the US election result would be contested for weeks or months. Two events have since taken place: the first US presidential debate, and Donald Trump contracting coronavirus. Westpac senior currency strategist Sean Callow has been following the currency markets and traders' views on who will win the election. He says since those two events, financial markets are now pricing in (predicting) a comfortable Joe Biden election victory. ""It seems pretty clear since the debate last week that there's been a swing in the polls and a general consensus among market participants is that we are likely to see a clear win for Biden."" Joe Biden was ahead in the polls leading into the first president debate. Currency markets, says Callow, were looking for Trump to say or do something during the debate to change that. However, nothing eventuated. Over the following days currency markets began pricing in a Biden victory. How do we know this? The central purpose of financial markets is to help work out what assets are worth. In that process the market can reveal the beliefs, or thinking, of millions of people — investors who have money on the line. As a general rule, currency markets view a contested election as creating enormous uncertainty. In times of uncertainty, the US dollar rises because it is seen as a very safe currency to hold in times of crisis. In the days that followed the US presidential debate, the US dollar fell and the Australian dollar rose — along with a whole bunch of other ""riskier"" currencies — which currency strategists say signal a Biden win. You may also notice the Mexican peso is number one on the chart as the biggest gainer so far this month. In the lead up to the 2016 election it fell to all-time lows against the US dollar. Traders in the peso were worried about Trump ending the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Along with the promised border wall, a Trump presidency was seen as a big negative for Mexico and so the currency plummeted. Unlike most of the pollsters, it correctly predicted a Trump victory. Now, the Mexican peso is rallying, or rising strongly. Traders believe Biden will win and relations between the two countries, as well as business flows, will improve significantly. The stock market is also pricing in a comfortable Biden election victory. The chart below shows a clear broad upward trend in US stocks since the first presidential debate. Throughout September Wall Street suffered steep falls. A big drop in the values of big US tech firms was partly to blame, but the market was also seriously concerned about a contested election. Now, with a perceived comfortable Biden victory, the market has pushed more than 3 per cent higher since then. Tim Anderson works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. He says shares and currencies are now singing to the same Biden tune. ""You're seeing the same thing in stocks right now in terms of the risk-on trade,"" Anderson says. ""The reason the market is rallying right now is because three weeks ago the market was very nervous about a contested election and that would be unsettling for the market. ""Now that it looks like Biden is going to win decisively, the market has: a) breathed a sigh of relief that we won't be in a state of limbo; and b) that you would have massive amounts of stimulus. ""Of course that would also be predicated on the Democrats also winning the Senate [which means picking up three more seats]."" If any of this is confusing, the central point remains that financial markets simply want to know what's around the corner. Right or wrong, investors across the globe, and trillions of dollars in investments, are now anticipating a Biden win.

335,Experts warn Australia's canola trade is 'dangerously exposed' to global disruptions,markets,"  Australia's canola trade is 'dangerously exposed' to global disruptions and must diversify, experts warn A grains industry expert says Australia's canola industry will be ""dangerously exposed"" if it does not urgently diversify export markets and embrace value adding. The Australian canola industry is being urged to find alternate markets and embrace value adding to limit risk The warning comes after the grains industry was blindsided in May when China suddenly imposed an 80.5 per cent tariff on Australian barley amid ongoing political tensions between Beijing and Canberra. Australian Export Grains Innovation Centre chief economist Professor Ross Kingwell said the canola sector is at the mercy of European Union trade policy. ""We are very exposed to whatever happens in the European Union and the demand for canola that is used for bio-diesel is predicated on the Renewable Energy Directive policy,"" he said. ""Fortunately in Australia, we've been able to prove and verify that the way in which we produce canola and the way it's delivered into the EU has a small emissions footprint and that gives us lucrative access to that market. ""But if there is ever a change in that policy, if they tighten regulations or raise the environmental bar and we can no longer satisfy that, then immediately we lose access to that market."" The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) predicts Australian canola exports will rise by 42 per cent to 2.4 million tonnes next financial year. ABARES' latest data also predicts the Australian canola industry will face increased competition, because price premiums will be an incentive for producers of other feedstocks, such as sunflower, to achieve necessary greenhouse gas emission thresholds. Professor Kingwell said a trend towards electric vehicles and away from liquid fuels such as bio-diesel could also devastate the trade. ""We need to find alternate uses for the canola that we produce, be that in the feed industry or differentiated markets, so I think it's wise to try to examine alternative markets early on,"" he said. Alba Edible Oils produces value-added canola oil products in Western Australia and Victoria for use in the food service industry. Managing director, John Slee, said despite the challenges, the threat of market access disruptions could also be seen as an opportunity for Australian canola growers. ""Because the industry has been very focused on supplying that European market, we have been ensuring our production systems are sustainable,"" he said. ""We've had fantastic segregation of GM and non-GM product, so the bar has been set pretty high, and Australian and WA farmers have stepped up and put systems in place to be able to meet those requirements. Subscribe for the national headlines of the day. ""I think we're really well positioned to get our product into other markets, and it's probably those markets that are looking for sustainable production of the food supply chain, and is prepared to pay a few extra dollars for that. ""We've already got our systems in place so I believe we're going to be at the top of the list when it comes to switching and going to other markets.""

336,RBA warns of 'substantial' business failures as support phases out; ASX ends flat,markets,"  RBA warns of' 'substantial' business failures and borrower defaults as stimulus is wound back, ASX runs out of steam The Reserve Bank has warned that Australian home prices are likely to fall further, borrower defaults will increase and business failures will rise substantially as coronavirus stimulus comes to an end. The warnings come in the central bank's twice-yearly Financial Stability Review, which looks at the health of banks and the financial system. The coronavirus pandemic has shut down parts of the Australian economy, plunging the country into the first recession in nearly three decades. Mortgage loan repayment holidays granted by banks have started to expire and income support measures like the JobKeeper wage subsidy are being wound back The RBA said government assistance, loan repayment holidays and temporary insolvency relief for companies have seen increased cash buffers and lower rates of business failure in 2020. ""However, business failures will rise substantially when loan repayment deferrals and income support come to an end,"" the RBA said. ""Business failures have flow-on effects to their creditors, both financial institutions and other businesses, and their employees."" It said commercial property investors would see losses if prices for office and retail properties fell sharply. ""The outlook for commercial property means banks' impairment rates are likely to increase from their current low levels,"" the report said. However, the RBA said that banks were better placed than in the downturns of the 1990s and the global financial crisis in 2007-2008 to handle a rise in borrowers not be able to make repayments. It said the Australian financial system was in a strong position even though the risks were ""elevated."" The RBA said that with unemployment having increased and many people working reduced hours, the number of households experiencing financial stress had risen ""and will increase further."" While noting that demand for housing had held up, it said that national home prices were 1.5 per cent below their April peak. And the central bank warned that home prices could keep falling, which would put pressure on banks if more borrowers are forced to sell their properties. ""While credit is available at very low interest rates, reduced housing demand from very low immigration and the rise in unemployment contribute to the risk of further falls in housing prices,"" the RBA said. The RBA estimated that the share of borrowers in arrears could reach around 2 per cent if the unemployment rate rises to 10 per cent, double the current rate of housing arrears. Meanwhile, record low interest rates and an easing of coronavirus restrictions saw demand for home loans rise by 12.6 per cent in August according to the Bureau of Statistics. They were up 19.3 per cent over the year. Australian shares opened higher but ran out of steam amid mixed messages from the Trump Administration, Republicans and Democrats over extra aid to help the North American economy through the coronavirus. The US President Donald Trump said overnight that stalled talks had restarted on targeted economic stimulus. By the close, the benchmark ASX 200 index was flat at 6,102. The All Ordinaries index was up 0.1 per cent at 6,313. The market rose for four days in a row this week, helped by a business friendly Federal Budget. A majority of sectors on the ASX 200 ended in the red, with losses led by education and healthcare firms, as CSL traded ex-dividend. Harvey Norman fell 3.5 per cent as it also went ex-dividend. Buy now, pay later firm Zip lost 4.7 per cent after yesterday's large rise, leading declines on the ASX 200. The big banks were mixed, with Westpac and ANZ higher but CBA and NAB lower. Gold miner Newcrest Mining announced plans to spend $236 million to expand its Cadia gold mine in New South Wales and on a project to increase gold production at its Lihir mine in Papua New Guinea. The miner said it expected more than 1,000 new jobs would be created by the projects at their peak, including 860 in Australia. Newcrest Mining shares rose 3.2 per cent. Big miners BHP (-0.2pc) and Rio Tinto (-0.5pc) fell. Construction firm CIMIC saw revenue drop because of the recession caused by COVID-19. But it said revenue picked up in the third quarter after the COVID-19 slowdown hurt projects in Australia and overseas. It made a net profit of $474 million for the first nine months of 2020, down 17.4 per cent from the $573 million it made for the same time last year. The firm also announced that negotiations to sell part of its Thiess contracting arm were ""well progressed"". CIMIC shares jumped 9.2 per cent to $21.70. At 5:08pm AEDT, the Australian dollar was up 0.1 per cent to 71.76 US cents after a rise in commodity prices including iron ore, which rose one per cent to $US118.50 a tonne. Brent crude oil prices rose to $US43.41 a barrel, up 3.4 per cent, because of hurricane-related shutdowns in the Gulf of Mexico and a strike by oil and gas workers in Norway. However they slipped in Asian trade. The US election uncertainty and optimism about pandemic relief also boosted gold. The precious metal rose 0.7 per cent to $US1,905.43 an ounce today. The US President told Fox Business that talks were ""starting to work out"" with some discussions over aid for airlines and $1,200 stimulus cheques for Americans going on. Mr Trump's comments come just two days after he halted negotiations on new spending until after the November 3 presidential election. He later called for ""standalone"" stimulus aid for airlines, small businesses and direct payments for Americans to be approved by Congress. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg TV that emergency assistance for airlines was a matter of national security and could only pass through Congress with guarantees that discussions would continue on a more comprehensive stimulus package worth more than $US2 trillion ($2.8 trillion). ""They don't have to happen at the same moment but they have to be happening with the assurance that we will go beyond the assistance to the airlines,"" she said. Ms Pelosi said she was hopeful that she and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin could reach agreement on the amount of new aid to ""crush"" coronavirus cases. The Democrats and Republicans differ widely on the amount of new assistance that should be on offer. Mr Trump is behind Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in the polls. Chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York Tom Ghriskey said the market was anticipating a fresh stimulus package. ""Overall, the market seems very accepting of a potential Biden win and Democratic gains in the Senate,"" he said. ""The market usually tends to prefer gridlock where change happens slowly, but in the short-term you'd get a stimulus bill if there's a clean sweep by either party."" New claims for unemployment benefits edged lower but remain high and well above the levels seen during the Great Recession in 2008. The US Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits were a seasonally adjusted 840,000 last week, compared with an upwardly revised 849,000 in the week before. Last week's claims were the lowest since March but they have stalled at historically high levels which suggests there is little improvement in the employment market after millions of people were thrown out of work because of the coronavirus pandemic. New claims reached a record 6.8 million in March. The number of people continuing to draw benefits fell to 10.9 million in late September. ANZ economist Adelaide Timbrell said the fall in claims was because the 26 week limit on benefits is expiring for many people. US stocks fluctuated but ended higher for a second day on hopes about new stimulus. The Dow Jones index rose 0.4 per cent to 28,426, the S&P 500 put on 0.8 per cent to 3,447 and the Nasdaq Composite increased 11,421 to 0.5 per cent. Energy stocks led the market after. Airlines extended their gains and computer giant IBM jumped 6 per cent on plans to split into two public companies by spinning off its infrastructure services unit. WarnerMedia is planning a corporate overhaul which could see thousands of people laid off as the coronavirus pandemic hurts the film and television industry. This comes after the firm axed more than 500 jobs at Warner Bros in August. Eaton Vance surged 48 per cent after Morgan Stanley agreed to buy the asset manager for about $US7 billion in a cash-and-stock deal. European stocks joined the rally and reached near-three-week highs on hopes about the US stimulus talks. The FTSE 100 added 0.5 per cent to 5,978, the DAX rose 0.9 per cent to 13,042 and the CAC 40 gained 0.6 per cent to 4,912.

337,Australian stocks end higher after Donald Trump calls for partial coronavirus stimulus deal,markets,"  Australian stocks rise for a fourth day on US stimulus hopes, iSelect fined for misleading consumers about power plans The Australian share market has made strong gains for the fourth day in a row, after Wall Street rallied as Donald Trump called for some coronavirus stimulus to be approved. The benchmark ASX 200 index finished 1.1 per cent higher at 6,102 points. Nearly all sectors were higher, with healthcare stocks, miners, banks and technology stocks leading the way, and only utilities and real estate stocks weaker. The All Ordinaries index also rose 1.1 per cent to 6,306. The ASX 200 had jumped by 1.3 per cent yesterday, boosted by the Budget. Buy now, pay later firm Sezzle climbed 3.3 per cent to $8.26 after reporting that underlying merchant sales jumped by 231 per cent to $341 million over the year to the September quarter. Rival Splitit initially rose, then fell 5 per cent after it said merchant sales jumped 214 per cent to nearly $US71 million over the year to September. The strong result from Sezzle saw other buy now, pay later firms like Zip (+8.8pc) also jump. Investment firm Netwealth Group rose (+8.3pc) on an increase in funds under management in the September quarter, and health firm Avita Therapeutics also gained (+5.9pc) Going down on the ASX 200 were property firm Mirvac (-1.7pc), plumbing group Reliance Worldwide (2.5pc) and Growthpoint Properties (-2pc). BHP rose 2.2 per cent and Rio Tinto put on 2 per cent. All the big banks were higher, with Westpac doing the best (+1.5pc). The Australian dollar was buying around 71.5 US cents at 5:23pm AEDT. Approvals to build new homes fell 1.6 per cent, seasonally adjusted, in August according to the Bureau of Statistics, although they were up slightly over the year. Permits to build apartments slumped by 11 per cent over the month. Oil refiner Ampol said it will consider closing its Lytton oil refinery in Brisbane as part of a review into the plant, which has been hit hard by the slump in demand for fuel caused by the coronavirus. Ampol, formerly known as Caltex Australia, restarted the Lytton refinery in September after a four-month shut-down. It said the refinery had lost $141 million so far this year. The company will look at closing or converting Lytton into an import terminal. It will also consider continuing existing operations and other alternatives and the cost of each option. The move comes despite $2.3 billion in incentives for refiners from the Federal Government to keep Australia's four remaining oil refineries open on national security grounds. Ampol said the review is expected to be finished by the second quarter of 2021. Last month, rival Viva Energy warned about the future of its refinery in Geelong in Victoria amid the state's tough coronavirus lockdown. Ampol shares were up 1.2 per cent at $24.60. Viva Energy shares were down 2.1 per cent to $1.66. Vaccine maker CSL said a large-scale clinical study for the potential coronavirus vaccine being made by the Queensland University is almost ready to start. It said enrolments will start in December, with recruitment expected to be finished by March next year. The trial will be a randomised, observer-blinded, placebo controlled study across a number of countries at more than 100 sites for adults aged 18 and older. CSL also said its subsidiary Seqirus had signed a final agreement with the Federal Government to supply 51 million doses of the vaccine candidate, known as V451, if the clinical trials are successful. CSL shares rose 2.4 per cent to $298.94. Consumer comparison firm iSelect has been fined $8.5 million for misleading thousands of people about power plans. The Federal Court ordered the company pay the penalties for making false or misleading representations about its electricity comparison service. iSelect admitted that between November 2016 and December 2018 it misled consumers after its said on its website that it would compare all electricity plans offered by its partners and recommend the most competitive plan. However, it admitted it did not give consumers the best offer. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said the firm's commercial arrangements with electricity retailers restricted the number of power plans the retailers could upload on the website, making the recommended plans not necessarily the most suitable. ACCC chairman Rod Sims said iSelect received commissions from retailers when consumers selected a plan through the iSelect website or call centre. ""iSelect was not upfront with consumers that it wasn't comparing all plans offered by its partner retailers,"" he said. ""iSelect's misleading conduct may have caused some consumers to switch electricity providers or plans on the basis of a price that was understated or without being aware that a cheaper plan was available."" iSelect also failed to adequately tell consumers that cheaper plans were only available through its call centre. It also admitted that between early 2017 and late 2019, it told almost 5,000 people the wrong price for some plans because of an error which underestimated the cost by up to $140 a quarter. Mr Sims said nearly 40 per cent of people who compared power plans with iSelect may have found a cheaper plan if they had shopped around or used the Government's comparison site. iSelect chief executive Brodie Arnhold welcomed the settlement and said, since becoming CEO in late 2018, he and his team had worked to fix the problems, including increasing disclaimers on the website and putting in place additional checks. ""The court today acknowledged that there is no evidence that iSelect intended to mislead consumers or deliberately contravene the law,"" he said. US stocks rebounded after Donald Trump called for more aid for the airline industry a day after putting stimulus talks on hold until after next month's US presidential election. Mr Trump wrote on Twitter that Congress should pass a $US25 billion ($35 billion) airline bailout, which was also supported by US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The US President also called on Congress to approve a $US135 billion payroll protection program for small business and stimulus cheques of $US1,200 for individuals. Investors were heartened that some coronavirus relief measures remained on the table. However, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said he was ""not optimistic for a comprehensive deal"". And White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow played the prospects of a deal on CNBC. ""Right now in terms of the probability curve, this would probably be low, low-probability stuff,"" he said. Ms Pelosi and US Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin have been unable to compromise on the $US2.2 trillion in aid wanted by the Democratic Party and the $US1.6 trillion that the White House will accept. Chase Investment Counsel president Peter Tuz said measures that could be agreed on should be approved by Congress. ""Two elements that are needed are some kind of bailout for the airline industry, and additional aid to allow people to pay bills and buy groceries."" ""Those are things that are unequivocal and agreed on by both sides,"" he said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.9 per cent or 531 points to 28,303, the S&P500 index rose 1.7 per cent to 3,419 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.9 per cent to 11,365. Airline shares jumped on the call by Mr Trump for aviation aid. Eli Lilly rose 3.4 per cent after it said it had applied to the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use of its experimental coronavirus antibody treatment. Minutes from the latest meeting of the US Federal Reserve showed that many members of the policy-making committee said their economic outlook included additional stimulus spending. They said if an aid package from Congress was too small or came later than expected, the economic recovery would be slower than anticipated. This echoed the warning from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell that the US economy would slip into a downward spiral if Congress failed to provide additional aid and lead to ""recessionary dynamics."" The Fed officials were divided over how to apply their new monetary policy approach amid the uncertainty over how to fight the coronavirus recession. ""Most participants supported providing more explicit outcome-based forward guidance for the federal funds rate,"" the minutes said. European shares failed to join the rally in global equities, weighed down by healthcare and blue-chip stocks. The FTSE 100 index fell nearly 0.1 per cent to 4,882, the DAX rose 0.2 per cent to 12,929, and the CAC 40 fell 0.3 per cent to 4,882. The uncertainty around coronavirus relief measures and a bigger than expected rise in US inventories saw crude oil prices fall. Brent crude oil dropped 1.3 per cent to $US42.11 a barrel. While spot gold rose on the uncertainty around new aid from Congress. Spot gold rose 0.5 per cent to $US1886.68 an ounce.

338,"ASX jumps on Budget sweeteners, Aussie dollar sinks as Trump ends stimulus talks",markets,"  ASX jumps on Budget sweeteners, Australian dollar sinks after Trump ends stimulus talks Australian shares have been bolstered by the Budget's tens of billions of dollars' worth of incentives for business and tax cuts for workers. Despite a weak start to the trading day, the ASX 200 managed to rebound quickly and closed at a one-month high. The benchmark index jumped 74 points (or 1.3 per cent) to close at 6,036 points, notching its third consecutive day of gains. The broader All Ordinaries index also lifted sharply (+1.2pc) to 6,240 points. Australian businesses are being offered investment tax breaks, loss carry-back tax provisions and wage subsidies to hire more workers. Consumer firms led the gains on the market, as they stand to benefit if people spend rather than save their tax cuts. Nearly all sectors were higher, with banks and oil stocks helping to drive the market's increase, although miners remained in the red. Gold stocks like Newcrest Mining (-2.1pc) and Resolute Mining (-1.6pc) were some of the worst performers, after the price of the precious metal declined. Shares in iron ore miner BHP (-1.1pc) also fell sharply. Meanwhile, Virgin Money UK's share price jumped (+6.3pc), after the lender said it would cut up to 400 jobs after abandoning restructuring plans. Some of the other best performing stocks were Eagers Automotive (+5.3pc), Cleanaway Waste Management (+4.8pc) and Zip Co (+4.7pc). The Australian dollar tumbled (-1pc) as low as 70.97 US cents overnight. But the local currency later managed to claw back some losses, rising to 71.2 US cents by 4:35pm (AEST). The overnight fall happened after US President Donald Trump decided to abandon negotiations on coronavirus emergency measures, and on expectations of a cut to Australia's official interest rates next month. A day after he returned to the White House following a hospital stay for COVID-19 treatment, Mr Trump wrote on Twitter that he was halting talks on coronavirus relief legislation until after the November 3 presidential election. In a tweet, Mr Trump accused House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi of not negotiating in good faith on new stimulus measures by calling for $US2.4 trillion ($3.4 trillion) in economic relief. ""I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business,"" he wrote. New figures from the Reserve Bank show Australians have eliminated $6.3 billion worth of debt from their credit cards since the pandemic began. In August, consumers owed $27 billion to credit card providers, down 23.5 per cent in five months. It was also the lowest level of credit card debt since December 2004. The COVID recession led to a lot more Australians cutting up their cards, with the number of credit card accounts down by around 583,699 (or 4.3 per cent) since late March. There were also 1.4 million fewer credit card accounts compared to the same period last year (August 2019). This was also the lowest number of accounts since April 2008. ""Providers know the glory days are over for credit cards. They’re frantically trying to create new options to challenge the buy now, pay later industry, but it could be too little too late,"" said Sally Tindall, research director at comparison site RateCity. ""While we're unlikely to see credit cards disappear altogether, they're no longer the kingpin of credit."" National Australia Bank analysts, led by chief economist Alan Oster, declared the budget as ""one of the most stimulatory budgets we have ever seen"", with $17.8 billion worth of personal income tax cuts and the $26.7 billion full instant asset write-off for firms with turnover of less than $5 billion. But NAB said it was surprised that the next round of personal income tax cuts for high income earners, which are opposed by the Opposition, were not brought forward and the JobSeeker unemployment benefit was not permanently increased. The bank said it was more pessimistic about the economic outlook than the Treasury Department. NAB is forecasting GDP will fall by around 2 per cent in the current financial year, while Treasury expects a 1.5 per cent drop. But in the 2021-22 financial year, NAB expects a 3.8 per cent drop, which is more optimistic than the Treasury's prediction of a 4.7 per cent tumble. Former Treasury official Stephen Anthony, now chief economist at Industry Super Australia, told The World Today that there was a risk that optimistic forecasts could be derailed. Mr Anthony said that would be the case if there were further waves of coronavirus or if the international border took longer to reopen, forcing the Government into even deeper debt. ""There is a big bet on the table here, that we are going to snap back into something like normal rates of growth in the short term,"" he said. The Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Kate Carnell said the budget would ""help lift small businesses out of the COVID crisis and provide a much-needed boost to economic confidence."" But the Brotherhood of St Laurence said the Federal Government had missed an ""historic opportunity"" to include all Australians in the recovery from COVID-19. The welfare group's executive director Conny Lenneberg said she was happy to see a focus on youth employment and training but there was very little support for others in need. ""This budget falls drastically short for Australians doing it tough."" Major credit ratings agencies, Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's reaffirmed Australia's AAA credit rating. However S&P warned the risk of a downgrade to the rating remained, especially if borrowing costs rise sooner than expected. ""The negative outlook on our sovereign ratings reflects a substantial deterioration of fiscal headroom at the 'AAA' rating level and, given the nature of COVID-19, risks remain tilted toward the downside,"" it said. Stocks on Wall Street reversed course and fell more than 1 per cent in late trade after the US President put negotiations over new stimulus measures on hold. All three major indexes on Wall Street were sharply sold off on the news. The Dow Jones index lost 1.3per cent or 376 points to 27,773, the S&P500 lost 1.4 per cent to 3,361 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6 per cent to 11,155. Adding to the gloom, the head of the US central bank called for more economic stimulus amid the fallout from COVID-19. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell warned of ""recessionary dynamics"" for the North American economy if Congress failed to pass the additional spending. In an online speech to the National Association for Business Economics, Mr Powell said the US economy could slip into a downward spiral if the coronavirus is not contained, leading to ""tragic"" outcomes for the less well-off and a situation where ""weakness feeds on weakness"". ""Too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardship for households and businesses,"" he said. ""The risks of overdoing it seem, for now, to be smaller. Even if policy actions ultimately prove to be greater than needed they will not go to waste. The recovery will be stronger and move faster."" European stocks rose after Mr Trump left hospital yesterday and returned to the White House. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.1 per cent to 5,950, the DAX increased 0.6 per cent to 12,906, and the CAC 40 in Paris put on 0.5 per cent to 4,895. Oil prices rose further because of supply disruptions from approaching storms in the Gulf of Mexico and amid a strike by oil workers in Norway. Brent crude rose 2 per cent to $US42.11 a barrel. Spot gold fell 1.4 per cent to $US1886.08 an ounce. At 11:30am (AEDT), it picked up to $US1877.60 an ounce.

339,ASX lifts as RBA keeps rates on hold ahead of Budget,markets,"  Australian shares lift as RBA keeps rates on hold ahead of Federal Budget After spending most of its day in the red, the Australian share market closed slightly higher as investors await more coronavirus stimulus spending in tonight's Federal Budget. The ASX 200 gained 21 points (or 0.4 per cent) to finish at 5,962. The broader All Ordinaries index did slightly better, up 0.5 per cent to 6,164 points. It was a more subdued gain compared to yesterday, when the benchmark ASX index jumped 2.6 per cent (its best day in four months) on the prospect of new stimulus in the Budget and hopes about a quick recovery for Mr Trump. US President Donald Trump has left hospital and returned to the White House to continue treatment after testing positive for coronavirus but that failed to boost local stocks despite a surge on Wall Street. Education firms, oil stocks, miners and industrials led the gains while real estate stocks, healthcare and financials were among the losers. The major banks posted modest gains, including Commonwealth Bank (+0.2pc), Westpac (+0.7pc), ANZ (+0.5pc) and NAB (+0.3pc). Meanwhile, a big jump in oil prices boosted energy stocks. Oil Search put on 3 per cent to $2.79 and Cooper Energy rose 4.6 per cent to $0.34. Going down on the ASX 200 index were Nanosonics (-4.7pc), lab firm ALS (-3.5pc) and property firm Mirvac (-2.6pc). BHP rose 0.4 per cent after increasing its stake in the Shenzi oil project off the Gulf of Mexico. Australia's trade surplus narrowed by nearly half in August to $2.6 billion to a two-year low, down from $4.7 billion in July, according to the Bureau of Statistics after a rise in imports and a fall in exports. The Australian dollar briefly jumped above 72 US cents after the Reserve Bank decided to keep official interest rates on hold. However, by 4:55pm (AEDT), the Australian dollar slipped (-0.1pc) to 71.7 US cents. Gold producers Northern Star and Saracen Minerals plan to merge to form a $16 billion company. The Reserve Bank is trying to stop the financial system melting down and telling us to brace for impact amid fallout from coronavirus, writes Gareth Hutchens. The merged company will be called Northern Star and will continue to trade on the ASX. Northern Star executive chairman Bill Beament will be chairman of the new firm. Saracen managing director Raleigh Finlayson will become managing director. He said the benefits to shareholders would be significant despite Northern Star effectively taking over Saracen. ""This is one of the most logical and strategic M&A transactions the mining industry has seen."" ""The savings, the synergies and the growth opportunities it will generate, make the transaction extremely compelling,"" he said. Saracen investors will receive 0.3763 Northern Star shares for each Saracen share they own. Saracen shareholders will own 36 per cent of the merged group and they will be paid a special dividend of 3.8 cents per Saracen share. Northern Star was the best performer in the ASX 200 index, up 10.6 per cent to $15.29. Saracen Mineral rose 9.6 per cent to $5.72. Big insurer Insurance Australia Group has agreed to pay $138 million to settle a case involving add on insurance products sold through car and motorcycle dealers. The class action settlement is much less than the $600 million to $1 billion that IAG previously expected. The case was brought against its Swann Insurance and Insurance Australia Limited subsidiaries. IAG said it was no longer involved in these business areas. Its share price lifted slightly (+0.2pc) to $4.64. Casino operator Star Entertainment said its lenders have given it more breathing space in relation to its debts. It also intends to apply for the second phase of the JobKeeper wage subsidy for 3,000 staff at its Sydney casino, after receiving JobKeeper for 7,000 staff in the initial phase of the program. Star's share price rose (+2.5pc) to $3.24. Job advertisements online and in newspapers rose 7.8 per cent in September from August, according to ANZ. However, they are still down by 21 per cent since February before the coronavirus recession. ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch said the data was positive news given the ongoing restrictions in Victoria but there was still a ""long way to go."" ""We need to get a huge volume of people — who were until recently employed — back into the workforce, along with new entrants and those wanting to re-enter the workforce,"" she said. ""This suggests that job ads and vacancies may need to sustain materially higher levels for some time."" US stocks surged after the US President said he would be discharged from hospital and on hopes of more stimulus for the US economy. Australia has just recorded its worst economic contraction on record, so why are we still talking about a recession not a depression? Michael Janda explains. Donald Trump went to hospital on Friday after testing positive to coronavirus, which rattled share markets in the run up to next month's US presidential election. Mr Trump's doctor, Sean Conley, said while the President was ""not yet out of the woods"" he was able to go home to receive around the clock medical care. Shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals jumped 7.1 per cent to $US605.08 after Dr Conley said Mr Trump had been treated with Regeneron's dual antibody treatment. A new stimulus package has yet to be agreed on by the President and Congress, but White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said there was still potential to reach an agreement with US legislators on more coronavirus relief and that Mr Trump was committed to getting the deal done. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin spoke by phone for about an hour about new stimulus. The Dow Jones index rose 466 points, or 1.7 per cent, to 28,149, the S&P 500 put on 1.8 per cent to 3,409 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.3 per cent to 11,323. Investor sentiment was also helped by good economic figures. The US services industry expanded in September, thanks to increases in new orders and employment. The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing activity index rose to 57.8 last month from 56.9 in August. That is back to levels last seen in February before COVID-19 struck the US. The ISM said last week that manufacturing had slowed last month as new orders fell back from the highest level in more than 16 years. Shares also gained in Europe. The FTSE 100 index increased 0.7 per cent to 5,943, the DAX rose 1.1 per cent to 12,828 and the CAC 40 in Paris added 1 per cent to 4,872.et.

340,ASX jumps ahead of Federal Budget and on hopes of quick recovery for Trump,markets,"  ASX surges ahead of Federal Budget and amid optimism around US President Donald Trump's health The Australian share market has surged in light trade amid more stimulus announcements ahead of tomorrow's Federal Budget, including a $7.5 billion investment in transport infrastructure and personal tax cuts brought forward to encourage spending. S&P 500 down 0.5 per cent but Nasdaq falls 2.2 per cent on Friday Investors are also optimistic about the health of US President Donald Trump as he made a public appearance, despite suffering from COVID-19 and conflicting reports about his condition. The ASX 200 index rallied 2.6 per cent or 150 points to 5,942 for its best day since June. All sectors rose, led by oil stocks on a rebound in the oil price, banks, utilities, real estate, miners and consumer firms. 189 stocks rose, eight fell and three were steady. Trading volumes were light today because of public holidays in New South Wales, ACT, South Australia and Queensland. The benchmark index fell 1.4 per cent on Friday with most of those losses in the last hour of trade after Mr Trump confirmed that both he and the First Lady had tested positive for COVID-19. The best performing stocks on the ASX 200 index were biotech company Mesoblast (+11.6pc), Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals (+7.8pc) and Oil Search (+7.5pc). Going down were data centre operator Megaport (-2.1pc), four-wheel drive accessories maker ARB (-0.5pc) and gold miners including Evolution Mining (-0.5pc) and Newcrest Mining (-0.5pc). The All Ordinaries rose 2.5 per cent to 6,135. Big banks including Westpac, ANZ and NAB rose by 4 per cent or more, the Bank of Queensland increased by 5.2 per cent and Bendigo Bank gained 5.5 per cent. The big miners were also higher: BHP rose 2.9 per cent and Rio Tinto increased 2.2 per cent. Software firm Altium came off its highs despite announcing a company restructure towards cloud services which the chief executive Aram Mirkazemi called the firm's ""Netflix Moment"" or ""a hard pivot to the cloud."" Its shares rose 0.4 per cent to $35.23. Investors are watching tomorrow's Reserve Bank meeting, but 70 per cent of economists surveyed by Reuters expect interest rates to stay at a record low of 0.25 per cent.  The majority expect rates to be cut in November. At 4:45pm (AEDT),  the Australian dollar had risen almost 0.3 per cent to 71.82 US cents as the greenback slipped while investors await clarity over President Trump's health. Sumitomo Mitsui Bank chief strategist Daisuke Uno said the focus was on Mr Trump with less economic news out this week. ""There is a welter of information about the severity of his condition, and that is making it difficult for market participants to make a move."" Asian share markets also rose. The Nikkei put on 1.3 per cent to 23,324 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was up 1.5 per cent to 23,822 at 4:45pm (AEDT). The S&P500 futures were up 0.7 per cent, indicating a rise on Wall Street tonight. The National Australia Bank said business conditions and confidence picked up in September, although they remain well below average, especially in Victoria after its tough coronavirus lockdown. The conditions index rose 6 points to 0 index points, back to levels seen early this year and the confidence index put on 4 points to -4 index points. Trading and profitability were positive but employment and forward orders were weak. Conditions were the worst in Victoria, New South Wales remained negative but had improved, and business conditions picked up in Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland. NAB chief economist Alan Oster said the economy was likely to need ongoing stimulus to ""ensure the fastest possible bounce back. ""As Victoria gains control over the virus, and state borders begin to reopen we expect that activity nationwide will continue to recover. ""While confidence and conditions have come off their lows seen in March and April, activity...is yet to fully recover."" The services sector expanded from August to September according to IHS Markit, although employment contracted further. ""The rebound in activity was driven by services business activity returning to growth, supported also by a sustained expansion in manufacturing output."" The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries said that new car sales fell by nearly 22 per cent in September from September last year to 68,985 new vehicles.  Sales plunged by nearly 60 per cent in Victoria, and also fell in New South Wales (-6pc), Queensland (-7.9pc), Tasmania (-34.2pc) and South Australia (-22.1pc). Sales rose in Western Australia (+1.5pc), Northern Territory (+10.6pc) and the ACT (+3.4pc).  Car sales were the hardest by the coronavirus recession while commercial vehicles saw less steep declines.  Toyota sold the most cars, followed by Mazda and Hyundai. US stocks pared their losses on Friday as prospects increased on the Trump Administration and Democratic Party agreeing to a new round of economic stimulus, a sentiment that Mr Trump supported with a tweet. The Dow Jones index fell 0.5 per cent to 27,683 and the S&P 500 index lost 1 per cent to 3,348. However, the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 2.2 per cent at 11,075. National Australia Bank head of foreign exchange strategy Ray Attrill said the underperformance of the Nasdaq reflected markets pricing in a win for Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden in the November 3 election, with Mr Biden expected to raise corporate taxes and tighten regulation. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll has Mr Biden holding a 14 percentage point lead over Mr Trump, with Mr Biden ahead of Mr Trump in every swing state. The US employment figures were completely overshadowed on markets by Mr Trump's diagnosis. The US jobless rate dropped 0.5 per cent to 7.9 per cent after a drop in the participation rate, with only 661,000 jobs created in August, lower than the 859,000 jobs expected. Mr Attrill said the numbers confirmed a ""significant slowdown in the pace of labour market improvement and so further highlighted the imperative of fiscal support sooner rather than later."" Major markets were little changed in Europe, with the FTSE up 0.4 per cent, the DAX down 0.3 per cent and France's CAC 40 flat.

341,ASX tumbles alongside US futures as Donald Trump tests positive for COVID-19,markets,"  ASX tumbles alongside US stock market futures as Donald Trump tests positive for COVID-19 The Australian share market has closed sharply lower, tumbling following news US President Donald Trump has tested positive for COVID-19. The benchmark ASX 200 index had been posting just modest falls, but dropped on the news out of the US, closing down by 1.4 per cent at 5,791 points. The local falls came as Dow Jones futures plunged as much as 500 points in the afternoon. By 5.30pm AEST, US stock market futures had recovered somewhat, to be down by around 1 per cent. The Australian dollar had also fallen sharply late in the session, but clawed back some ground, to around 71.7 US cents. ""The Trump COVID-19 diagnosis is a strong negative for financial markets and will lead to a rotation into defensive positioning,"" OAND senior market analyst Jeffrey Halley said. Energy and mining stocks extended their steep losses, including Santos (-5.5pc), Woodside (-4.3pc), BHP (-3.2pc) and Fortescue (-3.6pc). The worst-performing stock on the ASX 200 was Mesoblast — the biotech firm lost 37.2 per cent to $3.19 after the US Food and Drug Administration ordered an additional trial into one of the company's key treatments that is seeking US approval. On the up were funds manager Janus Henderson (+9.4pc), payments system company EML Payments (+3pc) and Fletcher Building (+1.7pc). Technology stocks had risen earlier in the session, following their US counterparts higher, but ended mostly lower as investors turned to safe havens such as gold instead. Prior to the President's COVID-19 diagnosis, the focus for US markets was the Democrats and Republicans trying to reach common ground on another multi-trillion-dollar stimulus package. Last night, Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that negotiations were continuing, but serious disagreements remained over both the size and structure of a package. The Democrats are pushing for a $US2.2 trillion stimulus program, while the White House has countered with a $US1.5 trillion plan. However, the majority of investors clearly believe some agreement will be reached before next month's election, with US shares continuing to edge higher. ""It's all about fiscal stimulus and the ball is in Congress' court,"" Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial, told Reuters. ""We continue to believe they're inching closer and approaching the final inning, but the last stretch is often the hardest. ""We believe we'll have a deal before the election and both sides will claim victory."" NAB's head of FX strategy Ray Attrill said the passage of more stimulus is becoming more imperative as new figures showed that Americans drew down on their savings in August to maintain consumption, something that is ultimately unsustainable. ""The data highlights the imperative of a new fiscal support package if consumption is not to derail the economic recovery in Q4 [fourth quarter], yet overnight we have no sign of progress towards reconciliation between the Democrats and the White House even though both sides continue to express optimism on the ability to reach a compromise,"" he wrote. ""One amongst other sticking points remains the Democrat's proposals for $436 billion in local and state government aid, which the Republicans see as a bailout for poorly run (Democrat-controlled) states and local authorities."" Hopes for a deal saw the benchmark S&P 500 index climb 0.5 per cent to 3,381, although the gains were concentrated in tech stocks and online retail. Online marketplace Etsy, which specialises in providing a global platform for art, craft and homeware sellers, saw the biggest gain of 8.3 per cent. Sports fashion label Under Armour jumped 5.6 per cent and clothing retailer Gap rose 4.9 per cent. Netflix had one of the strongest gains, rising 5.5 per cent, as one of the tech stocks seen as benefiting most from people spending more time stuck at home during the pandemic, while Twitter also rose 4.9 per cent. Outside the top 500 stocks, shares for retailer Bed Bath & Beyond jumped 25.1 per cent after posting a surprise quarterly profit due to booming online sales. Australia's final retail sales figures for August are due out today and expected to confirm a 4.2 per cent decline for the month, despite growth in online retail. The huge tech stocks also rose, with Amazon, Microsoft and Apple contributing most to gains on the S&P 500 index. With tech leading the charge, the Nasdaq outperformed with a 1.4 per cent rise, while the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained only 0.1 per cent. ""With the disappointment out of Washington we see this move back to the safety trade of big tech,"" Mr Detrick told Reuters. Tech stocks in Australia and the US have not only recovered to pre-COVID highs, they have surpassed them. But some say the rally is reminiscent of the dot-com boom and bust. ""Today is a microcosm of last six months."" Oil prices were hammered overnight, with the global benchmark Brent price diving 3.7 per cent to $US40.75, before falling even further in today's trade to $US40.48 by 1:50pm. That saw many of the major players in the sector post losses, with Halliburton, which is a major provider of services to the oil industry, suffering the biggest 7.3 per cent drop, followed by Valero Energy (-7pc) and Marathon Petroleum also losing 5.6 per cent. European markets were fairly flat overall, mostly posting either very modest gains or small losses.

342,analysis: Stockmarket analysts are worried about the US election — but one scenario stands out,markets,"  US election is now the biggest risk ever faced by financial markets, analysts warn Analysts say the upcoming US presidential election is now the single biggest risk ever faced by financial markets. Brokerage firm CommSec is behind the bold statement and the associated research. It's basing its view on the demand for derivatives in the lead-up to the November election. Derivatives are financial products that serious or professional investors use to hedge or protect their share market portfolios. Think of derivatives as a type of insurance to protect whatever position you take in the market. The price of this insurance is now higher than it has ever been. ""So what it basically means is that investors are turning their attention towards November's presidential election as a source of risk,"" CommSec economist Ryan Felsman says. ""Hedging against potential volatility doesn't come that cheaply, and what we're seeing at the moment is the most expensive event risk on record."" Investors are fearful of the unknown. And there are some particularly large ""unknowns"" on the horizon. If Trump wins, the markets will assume more of the same, but there is anxiety he will re-engage China in an all-out trade war with renewed political confidence. The US-China trade war has been dominating headlines, but Beijing is not the only trading partner in President Donald Trump's crosshairs. AMP Capital's head of investment strategy Shane Oliver helps manage tens of billions of dollars of clients' funds, so he's following market developments in the lead-up to the election closely. ""We do know that if President Trump wins [the election] he's going to ramp-up the conflict with China again, and that of course does have a negative impact as we saw back in 2018."" On the other hand, a Biden victory would take the world's biggest economy into a completely different direction. For example, Biden is keen to redistribute income through the taxation system and rescind the Trump tax cuts (which fuelled a huge stock market rally when they were legislated). He wants corporations and high net worth individuals to pay ""their fair share"" and has proposed increasing top income tax rates, along with ""tax base broadeners"", such as eliminating or limiting various incentives currently available to these taxpayers. Tim Anderson is the managing director of New York-based TJM Investments. He agrees there's an enormous amount riding on the outcome of the election because Republicans and Democrats are promising to take the world's biggest economy in opposite directions. ""It's a monumental risk event,"" he says. But the worst-case scenario, he says, is a contested election where the result isn't known for weeks. CommSec believes a contested election outcome could result in US shares falling 5 to 10 per cent, or even more. The last contested election was in 2000 when US President George W. Bush competed with Al Gore for the White House. Bush declared victory a month after election-day following US Supreme Court intervention after a vote recount in Florida. The benchmark S&P stock market index suffered a technical correction throughout this period. With the threat of coronavirus, and trillions of dollars in economic stimulus still held up in Congress, Mr Anderson says this is the worst time in history to have a government without a confirmed leader. ""Yes, I'm very concerned about that."" ""It would be a terrible thing for the country to go through. ""Even if they passed another stimulus package before the end of the week, and they're not going to, I don't even know if the money would get in the hands of the people it needs to get in the hands of, before the elections."" America is currently digging itself out of the deepest US recession since the 1930s and 1940s, as well as high unemployment, civil unrest and the biggest health crisis in a century. CommSec research shows while it is incredibly rare for an incumbent to lose a re-election campaign, it typically happens when an economic downturn hits in the lead up to an election. It's no surprise then that Trump  is moving quickly to nominate a successor to liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died earlier this month. If successful, that would seal a 6-3 conservative majority on the court — safer for Trump if the election ends up at the US Supreme Court. The implications for Australians are immediate and longer term. In the short term, analysts warn investors are in for a bumpy ride. Shane Oliver says there's potential for a big financial markets storm and says Australians most at risk are those in or approaching retirement. ""It's obviously more of an issue for those in or approaching retirement."" This is because the Australian share market follows Wall Street market moves closely, and if the US share market suffers a ""correction"", or worse, older Australians will face similar investment decision they did at the onset of the coronavirus stock market crash. For younger Australians, analysts say, share market gyrations are less of an issue. While the world is not at war, the global economy is grappling with the biggest economic shock since the Great Depression. Global financial giants are not known for their timidity, and yet ""playing it safe"" is exactly what some of the biggest titans are doing right now. That's an obvious sign an extraordinarily large threat looms on the horizon.

343,Big bank surge drives ASX rise on plans to water down responsible lending laws,markets,"  Big bank surge drives ASX rise on plans to water down responsible lending laws Big banks have led the gains on the Australian share market after the Federal Government said it planned to relax responsible lending laws to make it easier for Australians to get a home loan and boost the coronavirus stricken economy. The plan would remove some of the legal responsibility of banks to make sure that people can afford to pay back their loans and instead put the onus on the borrower. Three of the major banks made up three of the top four performers on the ASX 200 index. By the close, Westpac was up 7.4 per cent to $17.58, National Australia Bank rose 6.9 per cent to $18.37 and ANZ put on 6.3 per cent to $17.93, while CBA increased a more modest 3 per cent to $66.13. The ASX 200 index closed up 1.5 per cent at 5,965 as all sectors except healthcare made gains. The All Ordinaries index rose 1.4 per cent to 6,141. Higher iron ore prices boosted miners, with Rio Tinto up 0.8 per cent and BHP gaining 1.9 per cent. Retail firm Premier Investment warned it could close up to 350 stores in Australia and New Zealand because of the impact of the coronavirus if retail rents are not reduced. The firm, which is led by retail mogul Solomon Lew, has been in a battle with shopping centre companies over the cost of commercial rents during the coronavirus recession. Premier owns Just Jeans, Jay Jays, Peter Alexander and Smiggle and did not pay any rent in April when its stores were shut down. It stood down thousands of workers and received the JobKeeper wage subsidy. The company has warned that landlords need to make more concessions or more store closures will follow. ""While it is not Premier Retail's objective to close any stores, should landlords not accept the major shift in consumer shopping behaviour and adjust their rents according to consumer shopping preferences, then store closures will be inevitable,"" the company said. Premier will also close up to 55 of its 131 Smiggle stationery and office stores in the United Kingdom during the current financial year as the coronavirus pandemic hurts the retail industry. The company will also write down the entire value of all its UK stores. It will also write down the value of Smiggle stores in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Ireland, and close its four remaining stores in Hong Kong by the end of October. Premier said COVID-19 had a particularly severe impact on Smiggle as schools were closed for an extended period and as international borders were shut. The retail firm saw a 29 per cent rise in net profit for the 2020 financial year to nearly $138 million. That is despite a small fall in overall retail sales to $1.2 billion. The coronavirus pandemic saw online sales rise by nearly half to a record $220 million for the year. Premier shares fell 0.7 per cent to $19.00. Village Roadshow said it will postpone the release of three films until the 2022 financial year. Its shares closed flat. The Australian dollar has come off its overnight lows and at 6:00pm (AEST) was up 0.5 per cent at 70.8 US cents. The Bureau of Statistics said exports fell 2 per cent from July to August, while imports dropped by 7 per cent over the month. Other data from the ABS showed that the decrease in tourism jobs in June was the largest on record. Wall Street has ended higher after a volatile trading session as hopes for new US stimulus and an increase in new home sales offset a rise in new claims for unemployment benefits. CNBC reported that the Democrats in the US House of Representatives are preparing a new $US2.4 trillion aid plan which would include unemployment benefits, small business loans and help for airlines. US Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin said he hopes to restart negotiations on another fiscal relief bill with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ""I'm willing to sit down anytime for bipartisan legislation, let's pass something quickly,"" he said. New claims for unemployment benefits in the US last week increased to 870,000, more than expected, and a rise from the previous week. New home sales came in at around 1 million in August, near a 14-year high, which boosted construction firms. A rally by technology stocks including Apple, Nvidia and Facebook, boosted the market despite the mixed economic data. Microsoft said it had extended a strategic partnership with Telstra as its preferred cloud provider for its internal digital transformation. Amazon announced new TV streaming products that compete with Apple TV as people stay at home because of the pandemic. Its Fire TV devices will give users access to apps like Disney, Netflix and Hulu. Accenture fell 7 per cent after the IT consulting firm forecast revenue in the current quarter would be less than expected. The Dow Jones index rose 0.2 per cent to 26,815, the S&P 500 put on 0.3 per cent to 3,247 and the Nasdaq rose 0.4 per cent to 10,673. Dennis Dick from Bright Trading said the wild swings on the market showed it was time for investors to be cautious. ""Fear of missing out has turned into to fear of losing actual money,"" he said. ""This is a shakeout of all the Robinhood traders, a shakeout of retail investors. ""They're getting punished, and rightfully so, because you can't just buy stocks out of a hat thinking stocks only go up."" The S&P 500 has fallen by around 7 per cent so far this month, the Dow has lost nearly 6 per cent and the Nasdaq has dropped by 9.4 per cent European stocks fell as investors worried about the global economy, despite a new jobs plan from the UK Government. The FTSE 100 index fell 1.3 per cent to 5,823, the DAX in Germany fell 0.3 per cent to 12,607 and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 0.8 per cent to 4,763. Spot gold is up 0.2 per cent to $US1,868 an ounce.

345,"Australian shares slip on Wall St plunge, Westpac shrugs off $1.3b fine",markets,"  ASX slips on Wall Street plunge, Westpac shrugs off money laundering fine The Australian share market has finished in the red after a new sell-off on Wall Street on worries about economic recovery from the coronavirus and after Westpac agreed to pay a record penalty for breaking money laundering laws. By the close, the ASX 200 index had come off its lows and was down just 0.8 per cent at 5,876. It fell as much as 1.7 per cent in early trade. Nearly all sectors fell, as big banks, miners and oil stocks weighed on the market and technology stocks tracked Wall Street lower. Academic and educational services was the only sector to rise. The fall follows the ASX 200's best day in two months, when it jumped by 2.4 per cent yesterday. Westpac initially tumbled nearly 2 per cent after it agreed to pay $1.3 billion to settle allegations that it breached anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing laws more than 23 million times. But it came off its lows to close just 0.1 per cent lower. The bank had set aside around $900 million for a penalty in its first-half results, meaning it will have to stump up an extra $400 million from its full-year profits. However, some bank analysts said the penalty was smaller than they expected. The Commonwealth Bank also had a 0.1 per cent fall, while ANZ (+0.1pc) and NAB (+0.4 per cent) gained. Buy now, pay later firm Afterpay was caught up in the sell off and fell 5.8 per cent to $74.14 after it said chief financial officer Luke Bortelli would leave, to be replaced by Bravura Solutions former chief financial officer Rebecca Lowde. Medical technology firm Avita Therapeutics was the biggest loser on the ASX 200, down 7.2 per cent by the close. Gold miners took a hit after the price of the precious metal fell. Perseus Mining fell 5.6 per cent. Investment firm Washington H Soul Pattinson said net profit had surged to $953 million for the 2020 financial year after a one-off boost in earnings. Net profit after one-offs was $170 million. Investors will get a higher final dividend payout of 35 cents a share, taking full-year dividends to 60 cents a share, up 3.4 per cent. Its investments include telecoms firm TPG, coal miner New Hope and building materials maker Brickworks. The big rise in profit was mainly a result of a revaluation of its investment in TPG, following TPG's merger with Vodafone. Its shares ended 0.9 per cent higher. By 5:55pm (AEST), the Australian dollar had fallen further to 70.5 US cents, down 0.3 per cent. It was trading above 73 US cents earlier this week. The latest survey of businesses by the Australian Bureau of Statistics has found that one-third of firms expect that changes put in place to manage the impact of COVID-19 will be kept long-term. Almost two-thirds of businesses said they have made changes to their operations because of the coronavirus pandemic including changes to operating hours, provision of products and services and changes in staff roles. The majority of hospitality firms had modified the way they worked. Two out of five companies have staff that are teleworking. One in three firms expect working hours to increase when conditions stabilise. Meanwhile, ANZ economists said the fall in economic activity from June has bounced back with consumers travelling more locally and eating out at restaurants. But they noted that activity was unlikely to return to normal ""until Victoria starts to meaningfully ease social distancing restrictions"". The selling has resumed on Wall Street as investors take flight after the head of the US central bank said America's economy needed more stimulus to help it survive the coronavirus pandemic The US Congress has yet to pass a fresh stimulus package, with attention moving to the appointment of a new US Supreme Court justice following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsberg. US President Donald Trump said he thinks the 2020 presidential election will end up before the Supreme Court. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell told Congress that more government spending is needed to help the North American economy recover, but he said that the Fed was not planning any major changes to its Main Street Lending Program. ""We've come a long way pretty quickly, and that's great,"" he said. ""But there's a long way to go. So I just would say we need to stay with it, all of us."" The appearance was the second of three that Mr Powell is making in Congress this week. The speed of the recovery in the US economy slowed in September with new figures from IHS Markit showing that gains at factories were offset by a slowdown in the services industry. The manufacturing PMI rose from 53.1 to 53.5 but the services PMI fell from 55 points to 54.6 and job creation slowed. Glenmede chief investment officer Jason Pride said the US economy will not get back to normal until there was a coronavirus vaccine. ""We're at that phase where it's harder to get that next bit of the recovery, that next bit of the reopening in place,"" he said. ""We're still doing it, but the progress is way slower than it was in the first three months of the reopening."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 525 points, or 1.9 per cent, to 26,763, the S&P 500 lost 2.4 per cent to 3,237 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3 per cent to 10,633. The S&P 500 fell to its lowest since late July and it is close to entering correction territory as the Nasdaq did last week. The plunge came six months after US stocks fell to their low point during the coronavirus sell off on March 23. Oil stocks weighed on the market as did big tech stocks such as Apple, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook. Tesla fell 10.3 per cent after chief executive Elon Musk failed to impress investors with his promise to cut electric vehicle costs at the company's much-awaited ""Battery Day"" event. Tesla has sued the US government to overturn two rounds of Trump administration tariffs on Chinese products. Nike surged 8.8 per cent to a record high after it reported that quarterly digital sales, especially in North America, helped offset a fall in sales at traditional bricks-and-mortar stores. Bloomberg reported that Wall Street giant JP Morgan would pay a nearly $US1 billion fine to resolve government investigations into its trading practices. In Europe, stocks rose despite economic data showing that business growth in the eurozone ground to a halt in September after new government restrictions were imposed to stem a second wave of coronavirus infections. A survey of UK businesses showed the economy had slowed down after the end of a government subsidy to support restaurants. The FTSE 100 put on 1.2 per cent to 5,899, the DAX rose 0.4 per cent to 12,643, and the CAC 40 increased 0.6 per cent to 4,802. The Australian dollar fell further overnight, below 71 US cents after Westpac predicted there could be another cut in official interest rates as early as next month to 0.1 per cent. The currency dropped more than 1 per cent to its lowest since late July as the greenback rose for the fourth day in a row to around the highest in two months as shares fell. Comments from a Federal Reserve official about interest rate rises also boosted the US currency, although another official said the Fed was ""not even going to begin thinking"" about increasing rates until inflation reaches 2 per cent. At 7:30am (AEST) the Australian dollar was buying around 70.71 US cents, down 1.4 per cent. Commodities were also sold off. Spot gold dropped 1.9 per cent to $US1,863.54 an ounce. Brent crude oil fell 0.6 per cent to $US41.49 a barrel. Iron ore prices fell 2 per cent to $US111.90 a tonne as shipments rose from Brazil and Australia.

348,Jack carried shopping bags of cash into city banks until the police came knocking,markets,"  FinCEN Files: The accidental money launderer It's difficult, with certainty, to pinpoint exactly when Jack's career as a money launderer began, but around December 2012 stands out. That month he had moved into an apartment in Sydney's north-west. It was virtually unfurnished except for a simple chair. And one day he sat on it and it shattered. ""I am not very heavy, but that chair crumbled when I sat on it,"" he says. That broken chair began a sequence of events that almost landed Jack in jail. It also led to a job as a cash smuggler involving one of the country's biggest banks and a prominent Sydney money-exchange shop. That same money-exchange shop also appeared this week in a leak of thousands of top-secret suspicious activity reports known as SARS. About $2.7 trillion in suspicious transactions feature in the leak, including hundreds involving Australian banks. Background Briefing shows how terrorists and mobsters smuggle staggering sums of money through some of the world's largest banks — and often get away with it. Back in December 2012, Jack was struggling to scrape together enough money to pay for his chair. When his landlady refused to cough up, Jack turned to an online buy-and-sell website popular in the Chinese community. As he scrolled through the chair listings, something else caught his eye — a job advertisement. ""The advertisement was saying, 'Looking for office assistant to do simple office maintenance, pay you cash,'"" he says. Shortly after, at an office in Sydney's World Square, he met his prospective boss — a balding, middle-aged man in sandals who spoke with a heavy Cantonese accent. His name was William Cai. Jack was hired and at first the job was pretty laid back. When he wasn't photocopying or vacuuming, Jack passed the time playing on his phone. That is until one day, in March 2013, when he was given a new assignment. ""William asked me to deposit money for him. I remember I went to the office and he had bags of cash,"" he says. Jack's new duties involved walking around Sydney's banks depositing shopping bags filled with cash. No system is 100 per cent secure, but ProtonMail can be used to protect your identity by using end-to-end encryption. Please read the terms and conditions to work out if it is the best method of communication for you. Money-laundering experts say what Jack was doing was a textbook money-laundering technique and it should have made the banks he was visiting suspicious. Banks are required to ask questions about the source of funds in high-risk transactions. Instead, Jack said the banks treated the whole thing as a big joke. ""Not only I did not get asked any questions, I remember at NAB there was a guy working behind the counter, chatting to me [saying], 'Wow, that's a lot of money, congratulations.'"" NAB told the ABC it took its anti-money-laundering obligations extremely seriously and worked with law enforcement to identify and report suspicious transactions. Jack was also escorted by his boss, Cai, to money-exchange businesses known as money remitters. These businesses are popular among international students and migrant communities as a cheap way to send money back home. But they also have an attribute that makes them popular with criminals — speed. Criminals need to move money out of a jurisdiction as quickly as possible, so speed is the key to money laundering. The longer it takes, the more opportunity police have to freeze an account and restrain funds. Detective Acting Superintendent Daniel Burnicle was head of the Australian Federal Police's (AFP) money-laundering unit in Sydney at the time Jack was working for Cai and depositing bags of cash. ""Money remitters are able to move cash out of Australia in a matter of hours as opposed to days compared with a bank,"" he says. And Jack was using a particular money remitter, SuperForex, and a particular bank, Westpac, that had both previously been involved in one of the biggest cash seizures in the AFP's history. Two years before Jack walked into the Westpac Haymarket branch laden with bags of cash, there was another curious customer doing the same thing. But instead of shopping bags, a woman was rolling suitcases full of cash into that same Westpac branch and depositing it into a SuperForex account. There were so many suitcases, they began to pile up and become a bit of a nuisance inside Westpac Haymarket. ""There was a small storage area at the back of the bank which was … full of the bags and the bank staff indicated to me that they were happy for us to take the bags to free up the space,"" says Acting Superintendent Burnicle, who was involved in the case. According to the AFP, at the time about $80 million in cash was transferred out of the country by this method and never recovered. Westpac never stopped the transactions. Court documents later showed SuperForex misled Westpac staff, stating the depositor was an employee. Despite the revelation, Westpac continued to bank for SuperForex. Acting Superintendent Burnicle traced the money to a house in Sydney's inner-west suburb of Croyden Park, where the AFP found a further $5 million in cash. The house was stuffed full of cash — it was in cardboard boxes, in shopping bags, in backpacks, under the bed. ""The ensuite was so tight that you wouldn't be able to sit on the toilet properly without having to rest on the [cash] boxes,"" recalls Acting Superintendent Burnicle. SuperForex is a money remitter. It has offices across Sydney and specialises in helping immigrants send money overseas. In October 2015, four years after the cash was found in Croydon Park, SuperForex was still ringing money-laundering alarm bells. But this time it was in New York and referred to in a leak of US Treasury bureau FinCEN's suspicious activity reports. These reports are used by banks to report suspicious money flows to authorities. They are not themselves proof of illegal activity, but indicators of dubious money transfers. In October 2015, an analyst from The Bank Of New York Mellon noticed more than $20 million was heading for SuperForex's account in China. The transactions were flagged as suspicious because the money was travelling between shell companies, and the analyst was worried they were being used to hide the identities of the true recipients. SuperForex did not answer specific questions about these incidents but did say it had improved and upgraded its anti-money-laundering systems over the past five years. It said staff were now better trained to interrogate suspicious transactions. Australia's chief anti-money-laundering agency in Australia is AUSTRAC. Its deputy chief executive of intelligence, Chris Collette, told the ABC Australia's anti-money-laundering system relied on banks and other financial institutions being on their guard. ""Banks and other aspects of the financial system are the front line when it comes to protecting the Australian community from criminals exploiting the financial system,"" he says. If criminals try to transfer illegal money overseas, the odds are overwhelmingly on their side —an estimated 99 per cent of all criminal transfers are successful. A leak of US Government reports offers a rare insight into the secretive world of international finance. It shows how drug smugglers and scammers move dirty money via international banks — including through Australia's financial systems. Banks and other financial institutions are required to report suspicious transactions and often do. But they continue to do business with their suspicious customers, even when the criminality is staring them in the face. The AFP's Acting Superintendent Burnicle says banks need to think hard about the transactions they are waving through. ""It's very easy to tick the boxes of your anti-money-laundering programs, but you need to start looking deeper in terms of the transactions that are taking place and whether further enquiries need to be made before you allow them to go forward or go through,"" he says. ""I think banks make commercial decisions as to whether they allow transactions to go through and I think that the Australian community probably expects more."" Westpac said it was not able to discuss the specifics of the SuperForex cases for legal reasons. But a spokesman said over the past 12 months the bank had employed an additional 200 people to enhance its financial-crime program and made substantial investments to detect and stop suspicious transactions. Jack deposited his last bag of cash for Cai on May 8, 2013. That afternoon he was hanging out the washing when he was approached by two men. At first, he thought they were delivering a parcel. ""My first reaction was, 'How come they do deliveries at this time?' And then they told me they were from federal police and asked me to come to the Goulburn Street police station,"" he says. Jack was told he was now a suspect in a money-laundering investigation. The AFP became suspicious when Jack's boss, Cai, had posed as an employee of several money-remitting agencies. Jack was now facing jail time. ""I had that feeling where you know you did something stupid but you have no-one to blame but yourself,"" he says. During the interview, his old boss called him. ""He called me right in front of the federal police and the federal police asked me, 'Don't answer.'"" Jack made a statement to the federal police, which ended up helping to put his old boss, Cai, whose real name was Jun Yu Huang, away for five years. This week's release of suspicious activity reports is full of people like Jack, who use mainstream banks to help criminals across the world. They often do not realise that what they are doing is suspicious, however the banks they use often do, but permit the transaction regardless. Acting Superintendent Burnicle says it is wrong to think of money laundering as a victimless crime, and that banks should be thinking hard about the transactions they allow to pass through their systems. ""People should care about money laundering because it means that people are able to continue criminal activity,"" he says. ""An organised crime group in Australia is only as good as its ability to launder money.""

349,ASX slips after Wall St falls for third straight week,markets,"  Australian share market slips after Wall St falls for third straight week The Australian share market has closed in the red, after falls on Wall Street on Friday cemented the third straight weekly decline for US markets. At the close, the ASX 200 index was off 0.7 per cent at 5,823 points. Real estate was the worst-performing sector, losing an average of 1.4 per cent, led by large falls for Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (-7.1pc), Dexus (-3.6pc) and Scentre Group (-3.1pc). Mining stocks were weighing on the market, with Australia's three biggest iron ore miners (Rio, BHP and Fortescue) all down 1.2 per cent, with gold miners also off. The major banks were also all lower, falling by between 1.3-1.5 per cent. However, retailer Harvey Norman bucked the trend, jumping 2.1 per cent after reporting a 31 per cent sales surge over the past few months, with founder Gerry Harvey saying it is the best retail conditions he has seen in his six decades in the industry. The Australian dollar was higher (+0.3pc) against the greenback, buying around 73.12 US cents. Economists at the Commonwealth Bank have raised their forecasts for economic growth, and now expect a 2 per cent increase in Australia's gross domestic product in the current quarter. The economy went backwards during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here's what a recession is, and what it means for you. That changes their annual forecast for 2020 to a 3.3 per cent contraction, compared to their previous estimate of a 4.3 per cent slump. CBA senior economist Gareth Aird said the improved forecasts were based on data indicating people are spending more, as well as the better-than-expected jobs report for August. The bank's internal credit and debit card data shows a substantial increase in spending, despite the lockdowns in Victoria. ""What has surprised us is the strength of spending outside of Victoria,"" Mr Aird said. ""Indeed had Victoria not suffered such a large setback, household consumption would have posted a large rebound over the September quarter."" On Friday, the major US indices closed lower, with the S&P 500 losing 1.1 per cent to a six-week low. ""It was a lacklustre end to the week as equity markets again failed to garner support from the super-accommodative guidance of central banks,"" ANZ economist Hayden Dimes wrote. ""Attention is turning back to negotiations on supplementary fiscal stimulus and the forthcoming US election."" In Europe, coronavirus cases and hospitalisations continued to rise, raising concerns about a worsening outbreak. European countries from Denmark to Greece announced new restrictions on Friday to curb surging infections in some of their largest cities, while Britain was reportedly considering a new national lockdown.

351,analysis: 'Quite extraordinary': A quarter of your super is tied up in 'dud assets',markets,"  Could Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook be key to rescuing your super? We've all heard of the gargantuan profits generated by well-known Silicon Valley tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. It may surprise you, then, that they make up only a small fraction of the total asset allocation within most Australian superannuation funds. The main reason for this is the risk they pose to the longer-term return profile of a fund. Stock market investors have been enjoying a once-in-a-generation rally as central banks and governments try to manage the economic damage caused by coronavirus. Recently, though, a wide range of stocks have been battered by a ""correction"" — defined as a 10 per cent fall from its recent peak — in the US technology sector. Tech stocks in Australia and the US have not only recovered to pre-COVID highs, they have surpassed them. But some say the rally is reminiscent of the dot-com boom and bust. High profile Australian stocks like Afterpay have also been hit. Veteran stockbroker Marcus Padley says the big ups and downs in technology stocks are part of a normal price adjustment process after experiencing such a big run-up in prices in recent months. He also points the finger squarely at a Japanese multinational conglomerate, SoftBank, which owns big stakes in many technology companies. He says the company has been actively selling large stakes in the tech giants. Analysts believe this mini ""tech wreck"" will most likely be confined to August and September. However, in the years and decades to come, they say, the US tech giants will only grow bigger and stronger. ""What we've seen in the last five years is an ability for an online business to expand globally, rapidly, with a scalable product,"" Padley says. Sydney University's technology expert Mark Pesce agrees. ""The tech sector has been the shining star of the industrial economy for the past 25 years, and so that has to be part of any [investment] portfolio,"" he said. ""There's no question that you can't really expect gains unless you have tech in your portfolio."" Here's the problem facing super balances. While record low interest rates and government economic support packages are supporting the broader stock market recovery, they're also wiping out returns from cash, term deposits and bonds. Australia's biggest industry fund, AustralianSuper, invests roughly a quarter of all its money into these assets. AMP is Australia's largest manager of retail funds. It has a similar asset allocation in so-called ""defensive"" assets, that are designed to protect, or hold, the value of fund. Padley says it's ""quite extraordinary"" that so much of our super — roughly a quarter — is tied up in such dud assets. He says superannuation funds need to pivot their investments towards Silicon Valley. ""It is only going to get bigger,"" he said. Millions of Australians will be taking an indirect pay cut from COVID-19, through their shareholdings and super funds, explains David Taylor. ""Here we are with 25 per cent of our money buried in low growth banks, you know it really is quite extraordinary. ""I think superannuation funds if they want a low volatility, low cost international exposure, you're probably going to find exchange traded funds [ETFs] are the way to go."" ETFs are investment vehicles, essential ""stocks"" in their own right, which contain multiple stocks within them. For example, a technology ETF might trade on the exchange and its value will shift depending on the change in stock prices of both Microsoft and Amazon. Investment experts says superannuation funds could avoid some of the risk attached to tech stocks by investing in ETFSs instead of individual stocks. It's hard to tell what Australian super fund exposure is to US tech stocks. Australia biggest industry fund Australian Super chose not to comment for this story. And AMP wouldn't disclose how much of its tens of billions of dollars in funds under management are already tied up in Amazon and Microsoft. But its chief investment officer Lakshman Anantakrishnan was asked if, given the poor returns from cash and the bright outlook or US tech, AMP would consider giving its clients more exposure to US technology stocks. ""Chasing returns is important, but certainly our focus is more managing risk and managing risk on the downside,"" he says. ""As markets continue to become more volatile in the period ahead, if you expose yourself to large losses, especially for people who are closer to retirement, that can have quite a substantials impact on your retirement outcome."" As for how super funds, from a practical or logistical perspective, could shift their investment towards US tech, it would need to be done via what's known as their ""mandated structures"". Large super funds usually review their asset allocations yearly. Retailers have been struggling under the weight of high shopping centre rents for years, but now COVID-19 may be the last straw that forces them to break their current leases. If it was decided more money need to be invested in tech, AMP would ask the trustees and they would give AMP permission to change the mandates as part of the Investment Management Agreements. The ABC asked the Assistant Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and Financial Technology Jane Hume if there was scope for public sector super funds to embrace US tech. The Senator said it wouldn't be appropriate to comment on areas of potential investment, because it was up to trustees. It's hard not to empathise with the million-plus Australians out of work right now and not earning any super. It's also hard to watch many younger Australians drawing down up to $20,000 in superannuation in order to get by. The latest data from the banking regulator, APRA, shows applications for early access are still rising in number. And let's not forget the many workers who are underemployed and are not contributing to their super as much as they would like. For millions of Australians, there is likely to be quite a bit of catch-up on their super balance — and once this crisis calms, they'll likely be looking for funds to help make up the difference.

353,"You can use cryptocurrency to pay for a party on the Gold Coast, but it's not 'a world-changer'",markets,"  Qoin cryptocurrency targets cautious 'mum and dad' investors as sector seeks price stability It is a form of money that few use and most probably do not even understand, but cryptocurrency has been slowly edging its way into the mainstream. You can even pay for a night in a Gold Coast party limousine with a form of currency that did not exist this time last year. ""I didn't know much about the cryptocurrency stuff but I wanted to learn because I missed out on that Bitcoin stuff,"" party limo operator Chris McMilan said. He said he began accepting payments via the Australian cryptocurrency Qoin in June and about half a dozen customers used it since then. ""I've put a Qoin sticker on each vehicle so you might be driving along the highway and then go, 'Oh, that hummer takes Qoin,'"" Mr McMilan said. But cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility and while the future looks bright for some, it may still be some time before you will be paying for your morning flat white with a QR code. Qoin has since been expelled from the peak industry body, Blockchain Australia, amid transparency concerns. This decade-old field of finance has typically been the realm 'crypto-nerds' with the computer skills and tools that are foreign to most. But Bitcoin's price surge in 2017 was followed by a slump that wiped 74 per cent off its value in less than 12 months, scaring many potential investors away in the process. Qoin's chief marketing officer Andrew Barker says its target market has been ""mums and dads"" looking for something more stable to invest in, with the mindset, ""I'm not going to make a fortune overnight but I'm not gonna lose a fortune overnight"". He said Qoin's price had grown from $0.15 at its launch in January to about $1.98, with 10,000 transactions so far. The company has attempted to build a client base of almost 8,000 businesses, including jewellers and limousine hire, to give consumers products they can actually buy, rather than just a currency to invest in. Their origins can be traced to a small group of people interested in computers and privacy, who wanted something like electronic money — only less traceable. ""They’re offering their idle products and services for the Qoin economy,"" Mr Barker said. ""So based on each new Qoin merchant who joins the ecosystem, the value of Qoin increases."" Because these businesses have a financial stake, it is hoped they will be less likely to divest suddenly if the price drops slightly. ""If you had more merchants leaving than joining the ecosystem, then sure, the Qoin value could go down,"" Mr Barker said. ""But you won't find that 10,000 [dollar] peak of Bitcoin that then drops down dramatically overnight."" Australia's market is becoming increasing crowded with more than 240 cryptocurrencies registered as the sector tries to find broader legitimacy. ""People were talking about crypto as a way to be anonymous, to be able to do some interesting transactions that weren't looked upon well,"" Mr Barker said. ""That really is changing and regulation is bringing in less of that anonymous element."" Griffith University lecturer in finance Victor Wong says ""the future is really bright"" but a ""stable point"" is needed. ""So if you have $10 today, it will be worth $10 in the future,"" he said. ""Banks or government perhaps might issue their own version of digital currency. ""Once it is regulated and the value is consistent then consumers will feel like: ""Alright, this is a currency just like another cash I'm holding, it is safe, it is regulated by this country and therefore I will use it'."" Dr Wong said the adoption of cryptocurrencies could surpass debit cards within 10 years under the right market conditions. ""You need to have the assurance where you know that currency belongs to you [and] it will still belong to you in the future,"" he said. ""We have got a government that recognises digital currencies as well as a tech-friendly environment — even the post office accepts the exchange of Bitcoin."" But Mr Barker said ""we don't see this as a world-changer"". ""We don't see the crypto-economy taking over the traditional economy — there's definitely a place for both,"" he said. ""You need some things to have digital currency; you need internet connection, you need people to have the facility of mobile devices.""

354,ASX follows Wall Street rally led by tech rebound,markets,"  ASX follows Wall Street rally led by tech rebound The Australian share market has closed off its opening highs but still recouped some of yesterday's big losses following a big tech rebound that led Wall Street higher. The ASX 200 index closed up 0.5 per cent at 5,909, after Wall Street regained some lost ground following a three-session rout of tech giants such as Facebook and Apple. However, the ASX 200 had gained more than 1 per cent in early trade. The All Ordinaries index also finished 0.5 per cent higher. All sectors except financials were higher on the benchmark index, with technology stocks, miners and oil firms among the top gainers today. The big banks turned negative after early rises, with National Australia Bank doing the worst (-0.7pc). Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals has done the best on the ASX 200 index (+9.2pc). Gold miner Resolute Mining led the losses on the ASX 200 (-6.1pc) after it abandoned its production guidance because of a strike notice from workers at its mine in Mali in Africa. The workers were stood down because of the company's coronavirus safety protocols. Big miners made gains, with BHP (+0.5pc) and Rio Tinto (+1.4pc) both higher. Rio Tinto's top brass, including chief executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques, are under pressure from some investors and Indigenous leaders to resign because of the company's destruction of ancient rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara so it could mine iron ore at the site. Meanwhile, shareholder group, the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, has filed a shareholder resolution calling on Fortescue Metals to place a moratorium on the destruction of Indigenous cultural heritage sites and to lift confidentiality provisions that prevent traditional owners from speaking out. Myer shares plunged by nearly 18 per cent after the department store said it made an annual loss because of COVID-19 lockdowns, which hit foot traffic and closed stores during the second half of the financial year. The $172 million net loss was after $159 million worth of one-off costs and impairment charges to brand names and came despite online sales nearly doubling in the second half of the financial year. Total sales fell by almost 16 per cent to $2.5 billion because of widespread store closures, with all 60 stores closed for the majority of April and May and 10,000 workers stood down. Retailers have been struggling under the weight of high shopping centre rents for years, but now COVID-19 may be the last straw that forces them to break their current leases. Investors will again not get a dividend payout for the third year in a row. Myer said it received $93 million from the JobKeeper scheme. It also negotiated payment deferrals, including rent relief with its landlords. Myer said it expects fewer customers at its central business district stores for the foreseeable future. Pharmaceutical company Sigma increased 0.8 per cent after its half-year profit more than doubled to $5.8 million, because of lower costs from restructuring, the sale of businesses and higher sales of personal protective equipment because of the coronavirus. Sigma owns chemist retail chains including Chemist Warehouse. Investment firm AMP has appointed a global diversity consultancy to carry out a comprehensive workplace conduct review after sexual harassment controversies at the firm. AMP's promotion of Boe Pahari raises bigger questions for corporate Australia about how companies treat sexual harassment Last month, AMP chairman David Murray and another director resigned amid a shareholder revolt over the company's handling of sexual harassment allegations. Symmetra will assess conduct at the company and work with AMP to implement the recommendations of its review. It will also conduct an inclusive leadership program for the firm. AMP shares rose 3.3 per cent to $1.57. Asian shares also gained, with the Nikkei in Japan up 0.9 per cent and the Shanghai Composite up 0.1 per cent. But, by 4:40pm (AEST), the Australian dollar had slipped 0.1 per cent from its overnight high to around 72.77 US cents. Spot gold was trading at $US1,943 an ounce and Brent crude oil rose back to $US40.90 a barrel after being caught up in yesterday's sell-off. Bargain hunters moved in to buy overvalued technology stocks, a day after the Nasdaq entered a correction, 10 per cent below last week's record closing high on September 2. Tesla shares rebounded 11 per cent after yesterday suffering their biggest one-day percentage drop of 21 per cent. The biggest companies on the market, Apple (+4pc), Microsoft (+4.3pc) and Amazon (+3.8pc) rebounded, with Microsoft and Apple the top performers in the blue chip Dow Jones index. Facebook (+0.9pc) and Google-parent Alphabet (+1.6pc) also climbed. Tech stocks in Australia and the US have not only recovered to pre-COVID highs, they have surpassed them. But some say the rally is reminiscent of the dot-com boom and bust. The Dow Jones index came off its earlier highs but still closed 1.6 per cent, or 440 points, higher at 27,940 and the S&P 500 index put on 2 per cent to finish at 3,399 — its best one-day performance since June. The recently battered Nasdaq surged 2.7 per cent to 11,142, its best day since April. The tech giants have driven the pandemic rally on Wall Street, benefiting from people turning to online as they stay at home because of the coronavirus. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago, said it was ""a massive, surprising rebound"". ""On one level it looks speculative but, on another, it is almost defensive because we know these companies will survive no matter what COVID throws at us,"" he said. The big sell-off was also partly driven by concerns that holders of call options would sell massive amounts of stock they bought as hedges during the rally. Media reports last week said that Japan's SoftBank Group made big bets on equity derivatives tied to technology firms. European stocks also rose overnight. The FTSE 100 in London climbed 1.4 per cent to 6,013, the DAX in Germany increased 2.1 per cent to 13,237 and the CAC 40 in Paris put on 1.4 per cent to 5,043. The ASX 200 index lost 2.2 per cent yesterday after the third session of losses on Wall Street. The Financial Times reported that AstraZeneca could resume trials for its experimental coronavirus vaccine next week. That is after it paused global trials of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine on a safety concern. Its shares rose in London.

356,Australian shares end higher after yo-yo session,markets,"  ASX ends higher after yo-yo session of share trading The Australian share market has bounced back off its lows and finished higher after a volatile session, although the ASX 200 remains below 6,000 after Friday's rout. The benchmark index fell nearly 1 per cent early on to hit a daily low of 5,870 points. However, it quickly erased those falls and was trading up 0.6 per cent by 12:30pm (AEST). It dipped into the red again in the afternoon but closed higher, up nearly 0.3 per cent to 5,945. The All Ordinaries index rose 21 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 6,130. The yo-yo session follows Friday's massive sell-down, which wiped more than $60 billion off the value of Australian stocks. Industrials, utilities and consumer-related stocks lost ground, but there were strong gains for the big miners and banks, which pulled the major indices into the black. Despite the overall gains, fewer than half of the stocks on the ASX 200 ended higher. ANZ and Westpac lead the banks with increases of nearly 2 per cent, while BHP and Rio Tinto both rose nearly 2.5 per cent. CSL shares rose 1.1 per cent to $282.13 after it announced it has agreed to manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. It has also agreed to make an alternative vaccine being developed by the University of Queensland. Biotech firm Mesoblast, which is trialling a coronavirus treatment in the US, fell 5.5 per cent. Other big losers were financial firm IOOF, which lost 4.7 per cent, and mining contractor Perenti Global, which fell 3.5 per cent. Buy now, pay later firm Afterpay continued its recent falls and declined 2.4 per cent. The latest entrant to the buy now, pay later market, New Zealand's Laybuy, made its share market debut today and surged more than 45 per cent to $2.05. Virgin Money rose 6.3 per cent and travel firm Webjet put on 5 per cent. Fuel supplier Viva Energy warned about the future of its refinery in the regional city of Geelong, south-west of Melbourne, saying that global and local coronavirus restrictions could see it shut down. Viva Energy chief executive Scott Wyatt said the Victorian Government's tough coronavirus lockdown was having a big impact. He said the company is working closely with the Federal Government on the viability of the sector. ""Unfortunately, the impacts of COVID-19 and the restrictions on mobility and the economy are putting extreme pressure on the refining business that we have not experienced before and are not sustainable over the longer term,"" he warned. ""The company is assessing the options to address operating losses, including the possibility of moving to a full shutdown of the facility."" He said if restrictions are relaxed as outlined by Victoria yesterday, and if fuel demand picks up, then the refinery could return to full production by November but he warned the situation was ""very uncertain"". Viva said its service stations continue to show resilience despite the ongoing restrictions in Victoria. Viva Energy shares fell 0.3 per cent to $1.60. At 4:45pm (AEST) the Australian dollar had slipped by 0.05 per cent to around 72.75 US cents. Commonwealth Bank currency strategist Joseph Capurso is expecting only a limited market reaction if US Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden wins the US presidential election in November with a small sell-off in equities, but a strong market rally if US President Donald Trump is victorious with a large rise in the greenback and a fall in the euro and Australian dollar. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.5 per cent to 23,091 in the wake of last week's big sell-off on the Nasdaq as investors worried about sky-high stock valuations. Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group lost 7.2 per cent after media reports that the company has spent billions of dollars buying shares in big US technology firms, including Amazon, Netflix and Tesla, as well as significant options purchases in tech stocks, which has made investors nervous after last week's tech led Wall Street rout. Brent crude oil fell 1.5 per cent to $US42.01 a barrel after Saudi Arabia cut the October price for supply to Asia. Spot gold fell to $US1,930.48 an ounce. ANZ's latest survey showed that job advertisements online and in newspapers rose just 1.6 per cent from July to August, in a sign that the economic recovery has stalled because of Victoria's coronavirus lockdown. That follows a 19.1 per cent increase in employment ads in July and a record gain of 41 per cent in June. Job advertisements remain down by 27 per cent since February when the coronavirus outbreak worsened. They are down by nearly a third over the year to August. ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch said the big rebound in job ads in June and July, which saw more than half the pandemic losses recovered, did not continue into August. ""With Victoria accounting for more than 26 per cent of the nation's pre-pandemic employment, the stage 4 restrictions in Melbourne and stage 3 in regional Victoria have undoubtedly put the brakes on,"" she noted. Ms Birch also said that weekly payroll data from the ABS showed Victorian employment falling and jobs in New South Wales coming to a standstill with ANZ expecting ""outright falls in national employment in August and September"", saying that ""tens of billion dollars"" of additional government stimulus will be needed. CommSec said Reserve Bank data showed that the average credit card balance fell to 14-year lows of $2,768.13 in July and the value of purchases made with credit or charge cards was down by 1 per cent in July and by 14.3 per cent compared to the same time a year ago. Average ATM withdrawals dropped to 20-year lows last month. Chinese exports rose at a faster-than-expected pace in August, increasing by 9.5 per cent from the same time a year ago, although imports fell by 2.1 per cent. But iron ore imports fell nearly 11 per cent in August from a record high in July because of falling shipments from big miners in Australia and port congestion in China due to coronavirus-related restrictions. However, iron ore imports were higher over the year because of strong demand for steel. China's trade surplus dipped to $US58.9 billion last month, down from $US62.3 billion in July. US stocks came off their session lows but the major indices continued their sell-off on Friday, following on from Thursday's rout, as investors took flight on worries about overheated technology stocks. The Dow Jones index fell 159 points, or 0.6 per cent to 28,133, the S&P 500 lost 0.8 per cent to 3,427, and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.3 per cent to 11,313. However, the latest US unemployment figures surprised on the upside. The unemployment rate fell from 10.2 per cent in July to 8.4 per cent in August, much lower than the 9.8 per cent expected. Although August non-farm payrolls rose by 1.37 million, which was less than expected as government stimulus began running out. Brent crude oil fell 2.1 per cent to $US41.75, after Saudi Arabia cut the October price for supply to Asia. Spot gold has increased today to $US1,933.96 after struggling on Friday as the greenback strengthened on the US employment numbers.

357,"Peaches for free? Not quite, but stone fruit growers fear coronavirus glut may spoil prices",markets," ABC Rural Stone fruit growers across Australia are faced with tough decisions, including potentially having to pull out some of their trees, as the coronavirus pandemic bumps up air freight costs and wreaks havoc on export markets. Michael Trautwein grows the full range of stone fruit at his orchards in South Australia's Riverland but fears limited access to air freight and a doubling of costs could put an ""excessive financial burden"" on growers. Mr Trautwein said growers were already severely impacted at the end of the 2019/2020 season when the pandemic first hit, forcing market closures and limiting air services. ""It meant we had to sell a lot more fruit to the domestic market and we saw a very significant drop in price across all of the product types,"" he said. The latest USDA report on Australian stone fruit production is forecasting a 17 per cent decline in exports of peaches and nectarines for the 2020/2021 season. The report highlights the fact that despite the Federal Government's International Freight Assistance Mechanism (IFAM) program supporting exporters to secure air freight space, freight costs for exporters are more than double pre-COVID levels. While growers like Mr Trautwein are already changing their strategies by moving more produce onto high waters this season, some varieties, such as white flesh peaches, are simply not suited for weeks at sea. Typically destined for the lucrative Chinese market, the juicy rounds need to arrive more quickly. ""They have been planted for export which requires air freight,"" he said. Mr Trautwein said it could lead to a severe oversupply of white peaches on the domestic market in the next few years, affecting prices for other products, including plums, nectarines, and yellow peaches. ""As a grower we have to make considerations, because we know the air freight issue is going to be around until about 2025, that's the prediction, so we have to find a way on how we are going to deal with the supply of white peaches for the next three to four years,"" he said. ""Growers will be making the decision of whether they remove trees and plant another product they can export or redevelop parts of their orchards."" CEO of Summerfruit Australia Trevor Ranford said while industry and farmers were closely working with the Government and export partners, they had to look at longer-term options and plans. Besides the air freight challenges, he highlighted labour availability for the upcoming harvest, starting in October, was a major concern for the industry. ""The reality is that if we don't have the labour to pick the crop then we will have limited amount to export or to put onto the domestic market,"" he said. Swan Hill Summer Fruit Development Association president and local producer Michael Tripodi has been working with other growers to try and find a cost-effective solution. ""We spoke about getting charter flights in but it's very expensive and you have to pay for them upfront,"" he said. ""The problem is, if there's a weather event and you can't fill that charter flight…you still get stung for the freight costs. ""Maybe there will be times when the stone fruit associations around Australia can charter a full plane of stone fruit to get it overseas — that would be fantastic."" Mr Tripodi said he would send produce by sea if it got to market quick enough. ""I'm working with a couple of people from South Australia in the shipping industry,"" he said. ""I'll be definitely trying it, if the fruit gets there in sound condition then the freight costs will probably be a third compared to air freight."" Peter Wahlquist, chairman of Adelaide shipping and tuna fishing company Pelamis Group, said he had been talking to industry about quick transport. ""We have ships running out of South Australia through to Singapore and Asia every second week starting in December,"" he said. ""Our ships are quite fast, so it's an eight-day voyage from Victoria to Singapore, and we have the capacity for around one-and-a-half to two thousand tonnes per voyage. ""Each hull has four different layers in it and each layer can be refrigerated to match whatever the cargo is."" The COVID-19 pandemic won't be a problem for the company to transport the highly sought-after stone fruit. ""All of our operations are on the high seas and we don't generally come into port,"" Mr Wahlquist said. ""If we do, it's the port limit... so we don't actually have any contamination or COVID problems in that respect. ""However, for this we'd come into Portland (VIC), but the ruling is if your ship has been at sea for 14 days then... you're classed as being clear."" Once the fruit arrives in Singapore it would easily be transported to its final destination. ""Because we come into a bonded wharf, it's still classed as technically outside of Singapore,"" he said. ""There it will be transferred through to airports to then join existing air freight services to other ports, such as Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong."" Mr Wahlquist said he could see a future with the fruit sector. ""We're looking to rebuild the broken supply chain,"" he said. ""We're looking at doing this in the long term, not just 'let's make a buck out of it because we've got a virus problem'. ""We believe.. it'll help the industry to reconnect to their markets at a fair and honest price.""

359,Australian shares listless as traders weigh up conflicting coronavirus economic information,markets,"  Australian shares listless as traders weigh up conflicting coronavirus economic information Mixed economic numbers saw a listless day of trade on the Australian share market, with the Reserve Bank expected to keep interest rates at a record low tomorrow and the economy expected to record its first recession in nearly 30 years later this week. The market was helped this morning by ABS figures which showed a surge company profits over the June quarter as well as good economic data out of China. But figures from the Reserve Bank showed a fall in the demand for credit in July, especially personal lending. The All Ordinaries index swung between gains and losses and rose by around a third of a per cent after the surprise jump in company profits. But it ended down by nearly a quarter of a per cent, or 15 points, to 6,246. The ASX 200 index closed down 0.2 per cent at 6,061. Energy stocks led the gains, while healthcare stocks led the falls. The big banks also helped pull the index lower, with the Commonwealth Bank falling by 1.2 per cent and ANZ losing 0.7 per cent. Iron ore miner Fortescue Metals lost 7.7 per cent to $17.42 per cent as it traded ex-dividend. Lithium miner Orocobre dropped 10.3 per cent to $2.60 after it returned to trade following a capital raising. Buy now, pay later firm Sezzle dropped by 9.4 per cent to $10.27 after its half-year loss widened from $4.8 million a year ago to $8.2 million. But income surged almost five-fold and it saw active consumers jumped by more than 200 per cent to 1.5 million. Online furniture and homewares firm Temple and Webster rose 18 per cent after it saw annual profit surge by nearly 270 per cent to $13.9 million because of COVID-19 lockdown purchases. Payments provider EML Payments rose 6.6 per cent to $3.41. The Australian dollar fell 0.3 per cent to 73.45 US cents this afternoon after reaching 73.81 US cents earlier this morning, the highest level since December 2018. It was also boosted earlier in the day by positive economic data from China. While factory production expanded at a slower pace in August because of floods in south-west China, the services industry index rose from 54 points in July to 55.2 in August according to China's National Bureau of Statistics. At 4:40pm (AEST) spot gold had lost its gains and was steady at $US1,963.67 an ounce. Brent crude oil had risen 1.2 per cent to $US46.36 a barrel. Asian shares were boosted by hopes of more central bank largesse and the Chinese economic figures. The Nikkei 225 index rose 1.1 per cent to 23,140 and the Shanghai Composite index was up 0.5 per cent to 3,420. Financial firm IOOF extended its trading halt as it looked to raise $1 billion to buy National Australia Bank's superannuation and wealth division, MLC Group, for $1.4 billion. The move came as the big banks offloaded their investment businesses in the wake of financial scandals. IOOF said statutory net profit for the year jumped more than 400 per cent to $147 million, but underlying net profit fell by a third to $129 million. National Australia Bank shares ended flat at $17.93, having traded higher for much of the session. Fashion retailer Mosaic Brands has resolved its rental dispute with landlord Scentre Group, with all non-Victorian stores in Westfield shopping centres reopening. The firm owns retail chains including Noni B, Rivers and Katies. Nearly two weeks ago, Scentre Group locked Mosaic out of 129 Westfield shopping centres which it owns and operates. But Mosaic has now come to a confidential agreement with Scentre, and reopened its stores over the weekend. Several major retailers have been paying reduced rent or have gone on a rent strike after being forced to close during coronavirus lockdowns. Mosaic said it wanted to minimise future store closures but still expected to close between 300 and 500 stores over the coming one to two years. Mosaic shares jumped nearly 18 per cent to $0.57. Scentre Group shares increased 5.6 per cent to $2.26. Government subsidies, such as JobKeeper, have boosted company profits over the June quarter. The Bureau of Statistics says company profits rose 15 per cent from the March quarter to the June quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis. Economists had generally predicted that company profits would slump by around 6 per cent over the quarter. However, sales fell 9.4 per cent in the quarter to be down 9.7 per cent over the year. Both inventories and wages fell because of government lockdowns and business shutdowns as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The latest economic growth figures out later this week are certain to confirm the first recession in nearly 30 years. Economists surveyed by ANZ have predicted the economy will contract by nearly 6 per cent over the year to June, mainly due to the coronavirus pandemic. Reserve Bank figures showed that private sector credit, or outstanding loans, fell 0.1 per cent in July but rose 2.4 per cent over the year. It was the third monthly fall in a row. Demand for personal loans fell 1.8 per cent in July and slumped by a record 12.1 per cent over the year. Outstanding home loans rose by 0.2 per cent last month with annual growth steady at 3.1 per cent. Commonwealth Bank senior economist Kristina Clifton said very low mortgage rates were driving a ""significant amount of refinancing"" with CBA data showing an increase in customers opting for fixed rate home loans. Ms Clifton said business credit growth remained weak and fell by 0.6 per cent in July as businesses paid off loans. ""There is a lack of demand for credit, despite low interest rates, driven by concerns over the pace of aggregate demand in the future,"" Ms Clifton said. ""The private sector is deleveraging and both monetary policy and fiscal policy will need to stay loose to help smooth the adjustment."" CommSec said only three-quarters of ASX 200 companies reported statutory profits for the year to June, the weakest outcome for at least 10 years, as the coronavirus pandemic eats into earnings. Nearly 70 per cent of firms issued a dividend, but dividend payouts fell by 36 per cent. On Wall Street on Friday, technology stocks drove the S&P 500 index to another record closing high, its sixth since confirming a bull market on August 18. The S&P 500 rose 24 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 3,508 points. Oil stocks gained after Hurricane Laura passed through the Gulf of Mexico without widespread damage and as oil rigs and refineries restarted operations. The Nasdaq also reached a record closing high, up 0.6 per cent to 11,696. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose 0.6 per cent to 28,654. United Airlines and Coca-Cola rose more than 3 per cent as they prepared to cut costs, including standing down staff. Stocks were also boosted after a top aide to President Donald Trump said the US leader was willing to sign a $US1.3 trillion coronavirus relief bill. Economic data showed that US consumers increased their spending more than expected in July, but they also continued to save more amid the coronavirus uncertainty.

360,Cyber attack crashes New Zealand stock exchange for fourth day in a row,markets,"  Cyber attack crashes New Zealand stock exchange for fourth day in a row New Zealand has asked the country's communications security bureau to help bourse operator NZX Ltd after it crashed for the fourth day in a row on Friday, Finance Minister Grant Robertson said. ""I can't go into much more in terms of specific details other than to say that we as a government are treating this very seriously,"" Mr Robertson said. ""NZX is a private company. We recognise that it is important that the government works with private companies like them, when they are faced with issues like the cyber attack that they are currently experiencing. ""There are limits to what I can say today about the action the government is taking behind the scenes due to significant security considerations."" The market operator said its networks crashed due to connectivity issues relating to two cyberattacks targeted at them this week. Following interruptions earlier on Friday, the NZX said it would resume trading at 1:00pm. New Zealand, a relatively small economy with a population of five million, is not often the target of such attacks but neighbouring Australia ramped up its cyber security this year after a rise in similar incidents.

361,US central bank to tolerate higher inflation in landmark policy shift; ASX falls,markets,"  The Australian share market remains in the red after a mixed finish on Wall Street following a shift in the US central bank's approach to inflation, which means lower interest rates for longer. By the close, the ASX 200 index had lost 0.9 per cent to 6,074 points. Tech, telco and mining stocks continued to lead the falls. The Australian dollar had risen by about 0.5 per cent against the US dollar, to 72.96 US cents around 4:30pm (AEST). New Zealand's stock exchange resumed trading after crashing for the fourth day in a row, in the wake of cyber attacks this week. New Zealand's finance minister said the government was treating the situation very seriously and had called in the national agency targeting cyber crime to help the NZX. Overnight, the Federal Reserve said it would roll out an aggressive new strategy that aims to boost employment and let inflation rise higher for longer than in the past. Chair Jerome Powell laid out an update to the Fed's policy, that would seek to achieve inflation averaging 2 per cent over time, so that periods of lower inflation would likely be followed by an effort to lift inflation ""moderately above 2 per cent for some time"", before the Fed would raise interest rates. The change suggests the US central bank's key interest rate, already near zero, will stay there for potentially years to come even as inflation begins to rise. BIS Oxford Economics chief economist Sarah Hunter does not expect the Fed to raise rates until early 2024. As for interest rates in Australia, they're also likely to remain low for the foreseeable future, with Dr Hunter not forecasting any move higher until at least late 2023. Tech stocks in Australia and the US have not only recovered to pre-COVID highs, they have surpassed them. But some say the rally is reminiscent of the dot-com boom and bust. Record low interest rates and central bank stimulus globally have been supporting a rally on equity markets, and Fiona Clark from Merricks Capital said that's likely continue. ""[The Fed] is saying monetary policy will stay easier for longer … but more importantly, it's using its words as a stimulatory tool, so it's removing any threat of a rate rise going forward, which is giving the markets confidence,"" she said. While the local market has fallen so far this session, it is about 35 per cent above the low point in late March, as the first coronavirus restrictions were introduced, and Ms Clark said ongoing stimulus should continue to lift stocks in the US and in Australia. ""When interest rates are low, the argument is people can borrow money and spend … retail, consumer driven stocks generally do well,"" she said. The price of gold, which has risen to record highs in recent months, is also likely to remain elevated, as the precious metal is seen as a store of value as inflation increases. The Fed's new monetary policy strategy was unveiled at the start of an annual central banking conference, held virtually this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Previously, it had targeted an inflation rate of 2 per cent and aimed to keep it there, but its new approach gives it more scope to allow inflation to rise above that level after a period of low inflation. ""Where once upon a time the Fed may have been pre-emptive and raised interest rates where there was an improvement in the economy and employment, that pre-emptiveness has gone away,"" Ms Clark said. Gold has been a safe haven store of wealth for millennia, and the coronavirus pandemic is proving no different, with everyone from amateurs to professionals piling in to push it to record prices. Overnight, Mr Powell said the ""persistent undershoot of inflation"" in comparison to its 2 per cent objective was a cause for concern, as was longer-term expectations of low inflation. Low inflation expectations can weaken consumer spending, because if people expect prices to remain low or to fall, they may put off purchases. BIS Oxford Economics' Sarah Hunter said, importantly, inflation expectations were linked to wages, which would have been a key motivator for the Fed. ""When you set those inflation expectations, you're really baking them into the wage agreements, and that's really important for inflation, because the single biggest cost of production in the economy is labour,"" she said. Dr Hunter said the hope would be that setting the expectation of an average 2 per cent inflation rate would influence wages, which would in turn help spur higher prices. ""They don't want to end up in a low-inflation or deflation-type environment, which is what we've got in Japan and have had in for quite some time,"" she said. Policymakers, big business leaders and small business owners who lived through the last recession warn that downturns have a nasty habit of lingering. Mr Powell said the approach would be a ""flexible form of average inflation targeting"", rather than being tied to a particular formula to determine the average. ""Of course, if excessive inflationary pressures were to build or inflation expectations were to ratchet above levels consistent with our goal, we would not hesitate to act,"" he said. In its description of the new strategy, the Fed said the changes acknowledged that ""downward risks to employment and inflation have increased"", and include a new promise to use the central bank's ""full range of tools"" to achieve its goals of stable prices and a strong labour market. As low rates and loose monetary policy have been criticised for raising asset prices and making the already-rich richer, Merricks Capital's Fiona Clark said the Fed was careful to address that point. ""Our revised statement reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labour market, particularly for many in low- and moderate-income communities, and that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an unwelcome increase in inflation,"" Mr Powell said. ""There's a recognition that the headline [unemployment] rate may not reflect the real world, and there's a little more flexibility … I thought that was an interesting statement to try and deflect criticism about this being a continuation of a policy that actually benefits those that own assets,"" Ms Clark said. Reporting season continues, with building products maker Boral plunging to a $1.14 billion loss for the past financial year. Got shares but don't know a balance sheet from an income statement? Our profit reporting season guide will help you cut through some common jargon. The steep loss compares to a $251 million profit in the previous year, as the company took a $1.3 billion impairment charge, mostly against the value of its North American business. The company said it was hit by lower sales and production volumes in the second half of the year, as the pandemic hurt demand and stock availability. Revenue fell in its Australian division as bushfires and floods disrupted housing construction, while about 80 per cent of its American plants experienced disruptions due to COVID-19. Boral did not provide guidance for the current financial year, saying the business environment remained uncertain due to the pandemic. Shareholders will not receive a final dividend. Boral shares rose 2.3 per cent to $3.93. Meanwhile, shares in Harvey Norman were 1.6 per cent lower, reversing early gains, after the retailer reported a 19 per cent rise in net profit. Full-year profit came in at $480.5 million, up from $402.3 million the previous year, as sales across the group rose by 7.6 per cent. The retailer said there had been a strong start to the current financial year, with comparable sales across its Australian franchises up 38 per cent so far, compared to the same period last year. US stock markets ended mixed, while the US dollar rebounded after tumbling against a basket of currencies as the Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell spoke. ""Financial markets reacted with some volatility to Powell’s announcement,"" Westpac macro strategist Tim Riddell said. Gold and silver prices had initially risen, as the US dollar fell, before reversing course, while bond yields pushed higher. The comments were widely expected and markets had reacted ahead of the announcement. ""Ultimately, this just means interest rates are going to stay very, very low for even longer than we expected,"" said Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. ""It's lower for even longer and the market was pretty much anticipating this."" On the S&P 500, the financials sector led the gains, while technology stocks lagged, including Facebook and Netflix. Shares of Walmart (+4.5pc) and Microsoft (+2.5pc) rose after announcing a joint bid for TikTok's US assets. The social media company's chief executive will resign, amid the negotiations to sell the video app's US operations. Tesla shares closed 4 per cent higher at a fresh high of $US2,238, taking its rise since the start of the year to 435 per cent.

362,"Flight Centre plunges into the red, Woolworths profit falls, Afterpay halves loss",markets,"  The Australian share market has made gains as reporting season continued, with Flight Centre plunging to a loss as the coronavirus pandemic hits the travel sector. By the close, the ASX 200 was 0.2 per cent higher at 6,126 points, as gains for the miners offset falls for banks and energy stocks. Gold miners were among the best performers, including St Barbara (+3.9pc) and Perseus Mining (+3.7pc) ahead of a hotly anticipated speech by the US Federal Reserve chairman tonight, where Jerome Powell is expected to express an increased tolerance for inflation before any prospect of raising interest rates. Gold is a popular hedge against inflation, and prices for the precious metal jumped as much as $US50 an ounce overnight. An ounce of gold was worth around $US1,940 at 5:00pm (AEST). The Australian dollar was steady around 72.4 US cents having also climbed overnight. Travel giant Flight Centre has posted a $662 million statutory loss after tax — down from last year's $264 million profit — due to the hit from COVID-19. Excluding one-offs, the company's fall in underlying earnings was even bigger, at $853 million, to a pre-tax loss of $510 million. Flight Centre shares swung between modest losses and gains before ending 0.2 per cent lower at $12.58. The company said it had recorded a $150 million underlying profit for the eight months to February, but that evaporated in March as the global coronavirus pandemic was declared, before mounting losses in April, May and June pulled the result deep into the red. In response, the company said it had raised more than $1.1 billion in extra cash and available funds to keep operating, while also slashing its costs. Got shares but don't know a balance sheet from an income statement? Our profit reporting season guide will help you cut through some common jargon. Flight Centre said it had cut about $1.9 billion in annual costs, leaving its expenses at just 30 per cent of pre-COVID levels. However, it reported that July revenue was just 7 per cent of pre-pandemic levels at $17 million (excluding refunds). Last month, the travel agency said $53 million in costs went out the door, but $10 million in JobKeeper payments would reduce that to a monthly loss of $43 million. As at June 30, the company had received $98 million worth of government subsidies globally. The company had just under $1.9 billion in cash and equivalents on hand at June 30, and total current assets of $2.44 billion, versus total current liabilities of $1.86 billion. That suggests it can keep operating at current loss levels for up to a year without raising more funds, depending on its arrangements with lenders. Australian tourism operators are pinning their survival hopes on domestic travellers, but state border closures risk those plans. It also said it could get back to 40 per cent of its pre-COVID business at the current level of staffing and costs, which would enable it to break even as travel gradually resumed, which Flight Centre's managing director Graham Turner said was occurring in some regions. ""Travel is starting to gradually recover in locations like North America, Europe and South Africa, where domestic borders are now open, although we are also seeing heightened restrictions in Australia and New Zealand, after earlier relaxations,"" he said in a statement. Mr Turner said, despite nearly 40 years in operation, nobody at Flight Centre could have imagined the current circumstances where virtually all international travel had ceased. ""We were forced to make some very tough decisions as this crisis unfolded, but we were very fortunate to be able to draw on our strong balance sheet,"" he said. ""We also moved quickly to develop a longer cash and liquidity runway and to lower costs in anticipation of a zero- or very-low-revenue environment for an extended period of time."" Flight Centre has closed around half of its physical stores globally and sought rent reductions for others. The company has also stood down or laid off about 70 per cent of its staff, with a 50 per cent reduction in executive and director pay for the fourth quarter and ongoing reductions this financial year. Air New Zealand reported its first annual loss since 2002, and forecast another potential loss next year as the outlook for international travel remained clouded by the pandemic. The airline posted a net loss of $NZ454 million ($415 million) for the past financial year, as it wrote down the value of its planes. Costs associated with restructuring the airline, including cutting 4,000 employees, or 30 per cent of its workforce, also weighed on the result. The company's Australian-listed shares closed 2.4 per cent higher. Woolworths' net profit has fallen 57 per cent, despite the coronavirus pandemic lifting supermarket sales. The company's full-year profit fell to $1.16 billion, as the closure of its hotels and pubs due to COVID-19 restrictions offset a strong performance at its supermarkets division. Comparable supermarket sales rose 8.9 per cent in the fourth quarter, ahead of the 7.1 per cent rise at rival Coles. S&P Global Ratings said while grocery and liquor sales were likely to moderate from the surge seen in the first six months of the year, the sector was resilient. ""Given that consumers' social movements remain somewhat restricted, we anticipate grocery sales and takeaway liquor demand to remain elevated over the next 12 months,"" the ratings agency said. However, it has also forecast Woolworths' cleaning, security, supply chain and staff safety costs to remain elevated over the same period. ""While we have got off to a strong start to fiscal 2021, the outlook for the remainder of the year is very difficult to predict, as evidenced by recent events in Victoria and New Zealand,"" Woolworths chief executive Brad Banducci said, referring to the second wave of coronavirus outbreaks. As the company flagged in June, the bill for its staff underpayment scandal has blown out to $500 million, with $390 million in salaries owed to staff and $110 million in interest and other expenses. Mr Banducci will not be paid his short-term bonus as a result of the underpayments, and told The World Today he hoped the current cost did not increase further. ""We've done extensive work over the course of eight months … we're very well progressed,"" he said. Mr Banducci said the company expected to be hit with a penalty but hoped to be ""a case study in cooperation and engagement"" with the Fair Work Ombudsman. Shareholders will receive a final dividend of 48 cents per share. Woolworths shares gained 2.8 per cent to $40.38, while Coles shares lost 1.7 per cent. There's never been a corporate reporting season like this, in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic and the sharpest recession in 90 years. There'll be plenty of red ink, but not every company has suffered. Afterpay posted an annual loss of $19.8 million, improving on last year's $42.9 million loss. Its shares closed 0.6 per cent higher at $91.26. The buy-now, pay-later provider said it had more than doubled the number of customers over the year, to 9.9 million, and now had more than 55,000 merchants across its network. Afterpay said it saw rapid expansion in the US and the UK, beating its targets for new customers in those markets. RBC Capital Markets analyst Tim Piper said the result was slightly better than his forecasts and Afterpay's recent capital raising should see the company able to drive increased growth over the medium term. Shares in Afterpay have rocketed higher this year, up 200 per cent since January 1 and more than 900 per cent since its low point in March. Bega Cheese was among the best performers on the benchmark index, with its shares rising 7.8 per cent to $5.24 after its net profit surged to $21.3 million. Shares in data company Appen dived 11.2 per cent as its revenue came in below analysts' estimates. Overnight, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose to fresh highs, while the Dow Jones made a more modest gain. Shares in cloud computing firm Salesforce jumped 26 per cent after raising its revenue forecast. The company's quarterly results beat estimates, due to rising demand for its online business software, as the coronavirus pandemic hastened the shift to remote working. Netflix shares rose strongly, closing 11.6 per cent higher following an upbeat analyst report. Piper Sandler analyst Yung Kim published a survey that found most US Netflix subscribers were willing to accept a price increase, and that more subscribers planned to keep Netflix than other video streaming services after the COVID-19 crisis subsides. Other tech stocks including Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft also made gains. ""Until we really start to see a worry that interest rates are likely to start to move higher, I still see growth in general, tech and consumer discretionary in particular, holding up very well,"" Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA in New York, said. A gauge of global equity markets jumped to an all-time peak — the MSCI index tracking 49 countries rose 0.8 per cent, surpassing the high recorded in February.

364,"ASX closes higher, Fortescue shares rise as dividend increases",markets,"  ASX pushes higher, Fortescue shares rise after miner posts record profit The Australian share market has recouped early losses, while shares in Fortescue have risen after the miner posted a record profit. The ASX 200 closed 0.3 per cent higher at 6,129 points, while the All Ordinaries index gained 29 points or half a per cent. Technology stocks, including Appen (+4.5pc), NextDC (+4.5pc), Afterpay (+4.8pc) and Zip Co (+13.1pc), rose strongly. Zip Co released an update about the performance of QuadPay, a US buy-now, pay-later provider it intended to purchase, with a shareholder vote on the deal scheduled for the end of the month. It said QuadPay added 133,000 customers in July and had now surpassed 2 million customers. Got shares but don't know a balance sheet from an income statement? Our profit reporting season guide will help you cut through some common jargon. Meanwhile, rival Afterpay announced expansion into Europe, after acquiring a payments provider that currently served Spain, France and Italy. Telco stocks were among the best performers on the market, with gains for Telstra (+0.3pc), Vocus (+5.4pc) and TPG (+10pc). Other stocks that made big gains included Reliance Worldwide (+17.8pc), Ooh!Media (+17.5pc) and Nearmap (+13pc). The energy and financials sectors closed in the red, with falls for stocks including Woodside (-1.4pc) and ANZ (-0.9pc), which were trading ""ex-dividend"". It means investors who buy shares from today will not be entitled to receive the latest dividend payment. Shares in Qantas lost 4.4 per cent, after the airline announced it had cut the role of chief executive of Qantas International. The executive currently occupying that position, Tino La Spina, will leave the airline as international flights remain grounded for an extended period. The head of Qantas domestic, Andrew David, will now assume responsibility for the international division, in addition to domestic and freight flights. AMP shares ended 1.1 per cent higher, after the resignation of chairman David Murray, following pressure from major shareholders over the company and the board's handling of sexual harassment complaints. Mr Murray has been replaced by current AMP director Debra Hazelton. Super Retail Group, the company behind Rebel, Super Cheap Auto, Macpac and BCF, reported a 20.9 per cent fall in net profit over the past financial year, to $110.2 million. The retailer cut its final dividend to 19.5 cents per share, after cancelling its interim dividend to preserve cash. Super Retail shares gained 1.6 per cent, while other retail stocks rose, including Kathmandu (+5pc), Myer (+4.8pc), Premier Investments (+2.4pc) and Mosaic (+1.5pc). The Australian dollar was slightly higher at about 71.7 US cents by 4:45pm AEST. Fortescue shares gained 3.2 per cent to $18.56 after reporting a 49 per cent increase in full-year net profit to $US4.7 billion ($6.6 billion). Demand from China, the world's biggest importer of iron ore, recovered as Beijing ramped up infrastructure spending to tackle a coronavirus-induced economic slump, boosting prices of the commodity despite weak demand in much of the rest of the world. The miner said it had shipped a record 178.2 million tonnes of iron ore over the year and expected to ship 175-180 million tonnes during the current financial year. There's never been a corporate reporting season like this, in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic and the sharpest recession in 90 years. There'll be plenty of red ink, but not every company has suffered. ""Iron ore prices remain resilient, underpinned by strong demand in China and ongoing supply concerns from Brazil which we expect will keep the market relatively tight in the near term,"" RBC Capital Markets' mining analysts wrote in a note. Fortescue has lifted its final dividend to $1 per share, ahead of most forecasts. ""Despite materially higher dividends and guidance for a significant increase in capital expenditure over the coming year, Fortescue's balance sheet is in a strong position to manage these cash outflows with net debt around the lowest level in recent years,"" Matthew Moore from Moody's Investors Service said. Meanwhile, shares in Rio Tinto rose 0.2 per cent after the mining giant said it would cut the bonuses of some executives following a review of its destruction of ancient rock shelters in the Pilbara. ""The review found no single root cause or error that directly resulted in the destruction of the rock shelters. It was the result of a series of decisions, actions and omissions over an extended period of time,"" the company said. Rio said chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques and two other senior executives would not receive short-term bonuses for 2020, and Mr Jacques's long-term incentive plan would be reduced by around 1 million pounds ($1.8 million).

365,"ASX down as Webjet shares tumble on loss, Wesfarmers sales rise",markets,"  ASX in the red as reporting season continues with Wesfarmers, Qantas, Santos and Webjet The Australian share market remains in the red, as reporting season continues to drive some big individual share price moves. By the close, the ASX 200 had lost 0.8 per cent to 6,120, retreating from yesterday's five-month high. Energy was the worst-performing sector, followed by health care, as shares in vaccine maker CSL dropped 3.9 per cent. The major banks and mining stocks also weighed on the market, including ANZ (-1.2pc), NAB (-1.1pc) and BHP (-0.9pc). The Australian dollar was buying around 71.7 US cents at 5:45pm (AEST). Santos shares were down 5.3 per cent to $5.57, after reporting a half-year loss of $US289 million ($403 million). Got shares but don't know a balance sheet from an income statement? Our profit reporting season guide will help you cut through some common jargon. The company's underlying profit nearly halved, hurt by weaker oil and gas prices due to weak demand during coronavirus lockdowns. ""Santos remains confident that when prices and demand recover, our projects will be better placed than those in our competitor countries to leverage the opportunities that will inevitably re-emerge,"" Santos boss Kevin Gallagher said. Shares in Origin Energy also dragged, down 6.1 per cent to $5.54. Origin's net profit fell 93 per cent $83 million for the year, while revenue fell 11 per cent. Origin said average electricity and gas demand fell by 5 to 10 per cent in the fourth quarter due to the impact of COVID-19, while bad debt costs increased as customers struggled to pay their bills on time. RBC Capital Markets oil and gas analyst Gordon Ramsay said both the Santos and Origin results were in line with expectations. Wesfarmers shares were down just 0.2 per cent, after the company reported a 69 per cent fall in net profit for the 2020 financial year, to $1.7 billion. The previous year's $5.5 billion net profit was boosted by the proceeds of the demerger of Coles. There's never been a corporate reporting season like this, in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic and the sharpest recession in 90 years. There'll be plenty of red ink, but not every company has suffered. A $525 million impairment charge, relating to slashing the value of the Target brand name, weighed on the conglomerate's bottom line, as did restructuring costs for the overhaul of its department store division, which will include the closure of dozens of Target stores and the conversion of others to Kmart stores. The company said Bunnings and Officeworks experienced increased demand as coronavirus restrictions saw people work from home and take up projects around the house. Bunnings sales lifted nearly 14 per cent, while Officeworks recorded a 20.4 per cent increase, and Kmart's sales rose by 5.4 per cent. Online sales rose 60 per cent over the year to $1.5 billion, excluding online marketplace Catch, which it acquired last year. Shareholders will receive a final dividend of 77 cents per share, and an 18-cent special dividend from the proceeds of selling a 10 per cent stake in Coles. Qantas has recorded a $2 billion loss, with the coronavirus pandemic slashing its full-year revenue by 21 per cent as most of its fleet remains grounded. The airline's shares were flat at $3.76. Airlines have been among the hardest hit by the coronavirus recession, but the swingeing cuts at Qantas carry a warning for the whole economy. Webjet remained the worst performer on the benchmark ASX 200 index, with shares down 12.5 per cent to $3.22. After the close of trade yesterday, the online travel agency reported a loss of $143 million, compared to a $60 million profit the previous year. Webjet managing director John Guscic said COVID-19 had had a ""devastating impact"" on the industry. ""Faced with a significant fall in bookings and nominal revenues in all our business, we focused on what we could control,"" he said. ""We materially reduced our costs and fortified our balance sheet."" Cost-cutting measures included cutting more than 500 jobs and freezing hiring for all vacancies, while the majority of remaining staff have had their work week reduced to four days. The board and executives have taken a 20 per cent pay cut, while Mr Guscic has had his remuneration reduced by 60 per cent. Webjet did not declare a final dividend and further delayed the payment of its interim dividend until next April. The best-performing stock was IDP Education, with shares up 28.5 per cent after reporting a 2 per cent lift in full-year net profit. Afterpay shares also rose strongly, up 6.8 per cent to $79.98, hitting a fresh high after it raised its forecast for annual earnings. The stock was also boosted by news that major Japanese lender Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group had acquired nearly 14 million shares, or around a 5 per cent stake in the buy now, pay later firm. Earlier this year, Chinese gaming and social media giant Tencent became an Afterpay shareholder. Overnight, S&P 500 touched a new high for the second-straight session, while the Nasdaq hit a new record for the third day in a row. However, the major US indices closed lower in the end, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 0.3 per cent, following the release of the Federal Reserve's meeting minutes for July. The US central bank detailed concerns about the economic recovery from the coronavirus downturn. The minutes showed policymakers believed the swift rebound in employment in May and June had likely slowed and a ""broad and sustained"" reopening of business would be required to spur an additional recovery in the jobs market. However, the Federal Reserve ruled out measures such as yield-curve control, which involves buying longer-term government bonds to keep interest rates from rising above its target, for now. ""The Fed was cautious in the minutes and has been over the last month,"" Jones Trading chief market strategist Mike O'Rourke told Reuters. ""I think the fact that the Fed was not too warm on the yield-curve control and some of the extreme measures investors may have liked to see was a concern.""

366,'They want what we've got': International and interstate 'buyer activity enormous' on Gold Coast,markets,"  Gold Coast international, interstate 'buyer activity enormous' in residential real estate despite pandemic International and interstate buyers cannot physically inspect the properties for sale, but a Gold Coast real estate agent says ""activity is enormous"" in its residential market — despite the pandemic. Harcourts Coastal's Vikki Plehan said ""the lure"" of record low interest rates and the Australian dollar had been attracting buyers from as far off as Singapore, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom. ""They're cashed up, so they're trying to secure property so when they can come back to Australia they've got something here,"" Ms Plehan said. ""It's growing every week. From week to week we'd probably increase [buyer interest] by 5 per cent. ""Buyer activity is enormous, we just don't have the stock."" While Queensland's border restrictions mean interstate residents are unable to enter the state without strict exemptions, Ms Plehan said buyer activity from Sydney and Melbourne had also been ""phenomenal"". Ms Plehan said ""a big factor was the international market"" with many expats looking for a lifestyle change. ""They've been gone for 20 years, they're dealing with the pandemic over there, in lockdown, and they're living in a smaller, confined space,"" she said. ""Especially Hong Kong with what's happening over there with the pandemic and the political agendas over there, they're keen to come home."" Ms Plehan said while some in the industry expected coronavirus to cause ""a lull"" in the residential market, the opposite had occurred. ""It's something we haven't seen before and they predicted that we wouldn't get,"" she said. ""It's up and down our coastal shores, people are looking for all sorts of property. ""They're all wanting what we've got."" Managing director of Ray White Surfers Paradise, Gregory Bell, said ""south-east Queensland is looking very attractive at the moment on an affordability scale"". ""[It's] the age bracket of 55, 60-year-olds saying 'We want to buy a lifestyle, we can sell here for $3–4 million and buy up in the Gold Coast for $1.1 million, $1.5 million',"" he said. ""There are a lot of [those] buyers around."" Ms Plehan said most interstate and overseas buyers had been requesting virtual tours from estate agents and using online video and even drone footage to inspect a property. ""They can't get here, so what we're seeing more of is properties being sold unseen,"" she said. ""It's a big thing to trust an agent to purchase something sight unseen, so you've got to give them the whole demographics."" This assessment of the Gold Coast residential market mirrors expectations from the Real Estate Institute of Queensland, which tipped, as early as April, that the city would avoid a ""doom and gloom"" scenario.

367,Gambling giant Crown sees profits plunge 80 per cent after 'challenging year',markets,"  The profits of gambling giant Crown Resorts slumped 80 per cent after an ""extremely challenging year"". Crown Resorts operates casinos in Melbourne, Perth and London, with Sydney's much touted casino set to open in December. Figures announced to the ASX this morning showed that revenue was down almost 26 per cent across its Australian operations to $2.2 billion. Main floor gaming revenue was down 27 per cent to $1.2 billion and VIP play turnover collapsed 47 per cent to $20 billion. The figures showed net profits slumped 80 per cent this year to $79.5 million. The multi-billion-dollar casino in Sydney's almost complete One Barangaroo tower was approved in 2016 on the basis it would largely rely on VIP gamblers. It is expected to employ up to 2,000 people once open. While the resort is on track to open in December, owners and tenants of the residential portion of the tower will not be allowed to move in until March. Crown Chief Executive Ken Barton said this year's figures came after unprecedented shutdowns. ""From late January 2020, Crown began to experience softer trading conditions as a result of travel restrictions and general community uncertainty in response to COVID-19, particularly impacting visitation to Crown Melbourne,"" he said. ""In March 2020, Crown was directed to close its gaming activities and a significant part of its non-gaming operations at Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth for an extended period, with our financial results reflecting the impact of these closures. ""These closures have also had a substantial impact on our people."" He said about 95 per cent of employees had since been stood down but had accessed $68 million in JobKeeper payments. ""In addition, Crown has established a Hardship Fund to provide additional, targeted financial assistance to employees experiencing serious financial hardship as a result of COVID-19,"" he said. ""This program is in addition to the many other programs Crown has established to support employees during this unprecedented time."" While Crown Perth has recommenced operations, Crown Melbourne remains closed. Last year, Crown reported its VIP gambling revenue had dropped 26 per cent.

368,JB Hi-Fi shares jump on increased profit and dividend; ASX in the red,markets,"  JB Hi-Fi shares jump on increased profit and dividend; ASX in the red The Australian share market has closed sharply lower despite gains for some retail stocks, after JB Hi-Fi saw its profit jump by 21 per cent as people stocked up on home office and entertainment supplies. The ASX 200 closed down by 0.8 per cent or 49 points, at 6,076 points, while the All Ordinaries index lost 0.7 per cent to 6,218. Most of the sectors ended the session lower, led by industrials and financials, including the major banks: ANZ (-2.3pc), the Commonwealth Bank (-1.4pc), NAB (-2.6pc) and Westpac (-2.5pc). The worst-performing stocks among the top 200 included GWA Group (-10.5pc), Reliance Worldwide (-5.4pc) and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank (-6.6pc). Bendigo and Adelaide Bank reported a sharp drop in full-year profit, with net profit almost halving to $193 million. The bank did not provide profit guidance for the current financial year, warning market conditions remained challenging, and deferred a decision on whether to pay a final dividend to shareholders. Got shares but don't know a balance sheet from an income statement? Our profit reporting season guide will help you cut through some common jargon. On the flipside, JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman were among the best performers of the session, along with Beach Energy (+7.1pc), Adbri (+5.3pc) and Mesoblast (+4.5pc). JB Hi-Fi shares rose by 4.8 per cent to $49.60 after the company reported a strong lift in profit and increased its final dividend by more than 76 per cent from last year. The electronic retailer's net profit rose by 21 per cent to $302.3 million over the past financial year, as it benefitted from people working from home and seeking home entertainment equipment during coronavirus shutdowns. Underlying profit rose 33 per cent to $332.7 million, ahead of the retailer's forecasts. Overall sales climbed by 11.6 per cent, while online sales jumped 50 per cent, with the fourth quarter (which covered most of the initial COVID-19 lockdowns) seeing a 134 per cent spike. The company said the latest lockdown in Melbourne had seen the closure of 46 JB Hi-Fi stores and 21 The Good Guys stores, but online sales in Victoria had accelerated over the first 11 days of the renewed restrictions. ""Customers are changing their spending priorities, certainly from working and learning from home … but also we have available cash to spend because we're not spending it on travel,"" JB Hi-Fi CEO Richard Murray said. JB Hi-Fi said it did not access any COVID-19 support or subsidies from the Federal Government, but did access the New Zealand Government's wage subsidy scheme to help pay employees' wages while its stores were shut there. It will pay a final dividend of 90 cents per share. Other retail stocks, including Kathmandu (+2.9pc), Super Retail (+1.8pc) and Harvey Norman (+2.9pc), followed JB Hi-Fi higher. However, shares in online retailer Kogan ended down by 6.1 per cent to $20.51. As social distancing rules and fear kept people away from the shops, online sales have taken off and many analysts say a lot of consumers will not return in-store. That is despite the retailer reporting a 40 per cent rise in gross sales and a 56 per cent lift in net profit to $26.8 million. ""We're seeing record numbers of first-time customers, who then go on to make repeat purchases at a 40 per cent faster pace than previously,"" Kogan's chief executive Ruslan Kogan said. Shareholders will receive a final dividend of 13.5 cents per share, up nearly 65 per cent compared to the previous year. Kogan shares had rallied last week, after the company provided an update on its July sales. Both Kogan and JB Hi-Fi said sales were off to a strong start in the current financial year, but did not provide guidance. ""The work-from-home theme has been huge … but the question then comes: Is this just pulling forward a whole lot of sales that otherwise would have happened?"" Bell Asset Management chief investment officer Ned Bell told Reuters. ""What happens from next year onwards?"" The Australian dollar was slightly higher, buying around 71.85 US cents.

369,"ASX rises led by tech and industrials; NAB gains on profit, loan deferral update",markets,"  ASX rises led by tech and industrial stocks; NAB gains on profit, loan deferral update The Australian share market has closed higher, after technology and industrial stocks led the way, while NAB updates on its earnings and deferred loans. Anti-inflammatory treatment developer Mesoblast was almost singlehandedly powering a big rise in the biotech sector, with its share price surging 39 per cent to $4.70 after clearing a major US regulatory hurdle for remestemcel-L to be approved for treating steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease in children. This is an auto-immune condition that can affect patients receiving bone marrow transplants to treat blood cancers and serious cases are often fatal. The company had seen its share price fall significantly earlier in the week after preliminary reports from an FDA subcommittee cast doubt over the treatment's effectiveness. Gold miner Newcrest reported a statutory net profit of $647 million, up 15 per cent on the prior year. and an underlying profit of $750 million, up 34 per cent. Got shares but don't know a balance sheet from an income statement? Our profit reporting season guide will help you cut through some common jargon. However, investors appear to be disappointed it did not post stronger profit growth given a roughly 25 per cent increase in US dollar gold prices between the end of financial year 2019 and June 30 this year. Newcrest's share price ended down by 0.9 per cent to $34.16, despite an overnight rebound in the gold price and gains for many of its rivals. The ASX 200 finished the session 0.6 per cent higher at 6,126 points, while the All Ordinaries index added 37 points to 6,261. The Australian dollar was buying 71.55 US cents by 5:20pm AEST. NAB shares gained 1.2 per cent after the bank revealed an unaudited statutory net profit of $1.5 billion for the third quarter in a trading update to the market. The bank said its preferred measure of cash earnings was down 7 per cent on the same time last year at $1.55 billion. NAB also offered investors a detailed update of its loan deferral program. As at August 5, the bank had 86,000 home loans on repayment deferral with balances totalling $35 billion. It said that is down from a peak of 96,000 in May. The initial six-month home loan repayment deferrals are ending in September. If you're on one, this is what you need to know about how that process should work. It also revealed that customers on loan deferrals were, on average, in a more vulnerable financial position than those who had not asked for a repayment holiday. They typically had lower savings in the transaction accounts and higher use of credit cards prior to the pandemic, about 30 per cent had no offset or redraw balances available to them and 70 per cent were less than three months ahead on their loan repayments. They also had bigger loans, with an average of $402,000 versus $304,000 for the total loan book, and 21 per cent of deferred home loans above $1 million versus 14 per cent for all loans. NAB said 44 per cent of deferrals were for property investment loans and 56 per cent for owner-occupiers. The bank said it started contacting customers in early June to see if they wanted to resume repayments, and has so far been in touch with about 40 per cent. Of those contacted, so far only 16 per cent have elected to resume repayments. At this stage, NAB said it had only received a ""small increase"" in new deferral requests from Victoria amid Melbourne's stage 4 lockdown. NAB said it was too early to see the effect of Melbourne's stage 4 lockdown on business loans, but noted that most of the 41,000 loans deferred at the end of June were still being deferred by the end of July. The bank currently has 38,000 business loans on repayment deferrals, with a total balance of $20 billion. The Bureau of Statistics has highlighted how the coronavirus pandemic has seen an unprecedented fall in tourists for 2019/20. Official figures show 6.7 million tourists visited Australia last financial year, down by more than a quarter from the previous year, after the international border was closed in March. It is also the smallest number of tourists in six years. However, ABS director of migration statistics Jenny Dobak said Australia saw a record 9.5 million people visiting the country over the year to January, before the pandemic. ""Over the last year, there were increases every month until February 2020 when the impact of COVID-19 started,"" she observed. ""Once the tighter restrictions came into effect on March 20, the drop in visitors arriving was dramatic, being close to 100 per cent."" More than a million New Zealanders visited Australia last financial year and 900,000 people from China. Chinese consumers spent less at the shops in July, undermining the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. China's National Bureau of Statistics said retail sales fell by 1.1 per cent in July from a year earlier, the seventh monthly decline in a row even though coronavirus restrictions had eased. Sales dropped 1.8 per cent over the year to June. Industrial output expanded by 4.8 per cent over the year to July, but that was less than the 5.1 per cent forecast by analysts. China returned to growth in the second quarter after the coronavirus shut down the economy in the first few months of the year. Fixed-asset investment fell 1.6 per cent from January to July compared to the same time last year and infrastructure investment dropped 1 per cent over the year, recovering from a 3.1 per cent decline in the first half of 2020. Initial claims for unemployment benefits in the US came in under 1 million for the first time since mid-March. Claims fell by 228,000 to a seasonally adjusted 963,000 last week. That is the lowest level since non-essential businesses were ordered to shut down in many parts of the country to stem the spread of coronavirus. However, the fall in jobless claims may be because people are discouraged from filing claims after a weekly benefit supplement of $US600 expired. US President Donald Trump signed an executive order extending the benefits, but there is confusion over who will pay the bill with US states saying they cannot afford to contribute. Despite the promising numbers, economists say the recovery in the jobs market is slowing because of the spread of coronavirus. The stalemate on the next US fiscal stimulus package continued in Congress, with no progress in negotiations between Republicans and Democrats. The White House wants a $1 trillion stimulus package while Democrats want $3 trillion. Mr Trump said he was blocking efforts by the Democrats to include funds for the US Postal Service and election infrastructure in the new stimulus bill in his attempt to block more Americans from voting by mail during the pandemic. ""If we don't make that deal, that means they can't have the money, that means they can't have universal mail-in voting,"" Mr Trump told Fox News. US stocks ended mixed as negotiations for the new stimulus measures dragged on and after the better-than-expected employment numbers. The Dow Jones index fell nearly a third of a per cent, or 80 points, to 27,897. The Nasdaq rose by a quarter of a per cent to 11,043. The S&P 500 briefly traded above its record closing high for a second day. It rose as high as 3,387, just above its record high close of 3,386 on February 19, but it closed down 7 points to 3,373. Wall Street has recovered most of its losses since the start of the pandemic and the Nasdaq was the first of the three major indexes to hit a record high in June. Ride sharing firm Lyft fell after it saw revenue drop in the second quarter and made a loss. Shares in technology firm Cisco fell 11.2 per cent after the company forecast first quarter revenue and profit below estimates. US Treasury bonds rose for a fifth day after the US Government sold a record amount of 30-year bonds. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds put on 4 points to 0.71 per cent, the highest in nearly two months. European markets were in the red as coronavirus cases rose in Germany, France, Greece and Spain.

Fewer coronavirus cases in Victoria boosted confidence, although the number of daily deaths reached a record number. Hopes of more US stimulus also helped sentiment, with signs that stalled talks on stimulus measures will restart between Democrats and Republicans in the US. The All Ordinaries index rose 1.7 per cent, or 102 points, to 6,247. The ASX 200 index increased 1.8 per cent to 6,110. However, the Australian dollar lost ground late in the day after earlier gains and at 4:50pm (AEST) was steady at 71.5 US cents. The market extended gains in afternoon trade, with all sectors on the ASX 200 ending higher, led by banks and consumer stocks. The Commonwealth Bank rose 3.4 per cent to $73.98, National Australia Bank rose nearly 3 per cent to $17.46, ANZ gained 2.8 per cent and Westpac increased 3.3 per cent. However, embattled wealth manager AMP fell 1.4 per cent to $1.40. Investors were caught off guard late last week with the sudden departure of the company's Australia boss, Alex Wade. Today, former chair Catherine Brenner confirmed to the ABC that the corporate regulator will not take any action against her as part of its investigation into alleged breaches of the corporate law by AMP, which were revealed at the banking royal commission. ""I am delighted to have received a letter from ASIC today advising that there are no further issues to follow up in relation to AMP, enabling me to resume my corporate career knowing that no wrongdoing was found regarding my time at AMP,"" she said. Biotech Mesoblast surged 10.7 per cent to $4.87. Gold miners fell as spot gold slipped on a higher greenback to $US2,031.38 an ounce. Resolute Mining fell 2.6 per cent to $1.33. Online retailer Kogan said gross sales in July more than doubled and gross profit jumped by 160 per cent as consumers did more online shopping because of the coronavirus pandemic. Kogan shares ended up nearly 10 per cent at $20.66, after reaching a record high earlier in the session. Furniture firm Adairs rose 11.3 per cent to $3.05 after annual profit jumped because of strong trading in May. Its dividend payout rose to 11 cents a share. Got shares but don't know a balance sheet from an income statement? Our profit reporting season guide will help you cut through some common jargon. Property firm GPT made a net loss for the first half of the year of $519 million, as shopping centre revenue plunged because of rent relief for COVID-19 and due to $711 million in downwards property revaluations. Its shares still ended up 0.5 per cent to $3.85. Sigma Healthcare rose 2.3 per cent to $0.68 after it sold two distribution centres for $172 million, with plans to lease them back. Outdoor advertising firm oOh!media fell the most on the ASX 200 index, ending down 4.3 per cent to $0.78. Farm Pride Foods slumped nearly 22 per cent to $0.07 after it confirmed an outbreak of H7N7 bird flu at its Lethbridge farm in Victoria. The firm is culling its 340,000 hens at the site, about one third of its productive hen flock, which will cost up to $23 million in annual revenue. The Victorian Department of Health and Human Services said the H7N7 virus poses minimal risk to the public as it rarely affects humans unless there is direct and close contact with sick birds and causes very mild disease. Plans by Qantas to raise $500 million from a share sale for retail investors have fallen short. The airline raised about $71.7 million from the capital raising, with just 5 per cent of 173,343 eligible shareholders taking up the offer and buying an average $8,200 worth of shares. Qantas said tighter border restrictions because of the COVID-19 outbreak in Melbourne had dampened investor appetite. ""While the Qantas Group's recovery plan anticipates some uncertainty associated with the pandemic, the timing of these events and their implications for travel demand had an obvious impact on the Qantas share price and the take up of the SPP (share purchase plan) by eligible shareholders."" Qantas earlier raised nearly $1.4 billion from institutional investors as part of its bid to shore up its cash buffers during the pandemic. By the close, Qantas shares were up 3.3 per cent to $3.43. The competition watchdog has granted an emergency order to allow chicken processors to work with rivals to prevent food shortages during Victoria's COVID-19 lockdown. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has provided conditional interim authorisation to allow chicken producers Ingham's Group, Turosi, Hazeldene's Chicken Farm and industry body, the Australian Chicken Meat Federation, to work together. This includes sharing or coordinating the use of processing plants, essential staff, facilities and products. ACCC deputy chairman Mick Keogh said the move was aimed at ensuring sufficient supply of chickens and chicken meat, reducing job losses and managing the impact of coronavirus restrictions in Victoria on chicken growers and other parts of the supply chain. ""We recognise that these heightened COVID-19 restrictions in Victoria are requiring many businesses and industries to make significant changes to their operations, and this includes the Victorian chicken meat sector,"" he said. ""Chicken is a staple of many consumers' diets. This authorisation should assist the chicken meat sector to implement arrangements that maintain supply and minimise the risk of food shortages during the COVID-19 restrictions."" The authorisation does not extend to agreements about prices and participation is voluntary. Ingham's shares were down 0.3 per cent to $3.23. Wall Street ended mixed on Friday after the US unemployment rate for July was better than expected, while US politicians continued to haggle over the extension of stimulus measures. Nearly 1.8 million jobs were created over the month and the jobless rate dropped from 11.1 per cent in June to 10.2 per cent in July. The Dow Jones index rose nearly 0.2 per cent, or 47 points, to 27,434. The S&P 500 was basically flat at 3,351, up just 2 points. The Nasdaq Composite fell by 0.9 per cent to 11,011 after US President Donald Trump announced that residents would be banned from doing business with the parent companies of Chinese social media firms TikTok and WeChat in 45 days. Over the weekend, Mr Trump also bypassed Congress to extend extra unemployment benefits, defer temporary payroll taxes and provide eviction protection and student loan relief. ANZ chief economist David Plank said the move ""may incur legal challenges as it is based on a generous interpretation of a president's executive powers"". Spot gold was lower as the greenback rose on the better than forecast US jobless figures. It was down 0.3 per cent to $US2,029. Oil prices fell as concerns about the impact of geopolitical tensions, including worsening US-China tensions, would hurt economic growth and demand for fuel. Brent crude fell below $US45.00 a barrel to $US44.40 on Friday. But it has picked up in futures trade today to $US44.75, up 0.8 per cent.

372,Wool market down 40 per cent on last year,markets," ABC Rural The Australian wool industry is going through a tumultuous time with the market now down a massive 40 per cent on this time last year. The Australian Wool Exchange Eastern Market Indicator (EMI) fell 128 cents a kilogram this week to finish at 1006c/kg. It was the highest weekly fall in the EMI since April when it lost 155 cents. However, when viewed in percentage terms the EMI fell by 11.3 per cent, making it the highest weekly fall since 1991 (when the reserve floor price was abolished, and the EMI fell by 39.1 per cent). There were price falls upwards of 140c/kg across all fleece wool, while crossbred wool lost more than 35c/kg. Another shock in the auction room was the bale pass-in rate. There were 42,764 bales offered across wool auctions in Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle, with 30 per cent passed-in at auction. The high pass-in rate comes as many growers are not willing to accept reduced prices for their wool clip. This has led to a growing stockpile of wool, which some brokers estimate around 300,000 bales stored in warehouses and farm sheds. The lacklustre price also comes as many growers kick off their spring shearing and for many, they are weighing up the cost of storing their wool clip or taking what they can get. Elders Wool sales manager Alice Wilsdon, who has clients across WA's South West, Great Southern and South Coast, described this week's sale at the Fremantle Sales Centre as ""horrible"" with 78 per cent of fleece lines passed in on Tuesday. The Western Market Indicator also fell 147c/kg to 1055c/kg with finer lines dropping by up to 195c/kg. ""There was a real lack of interest from buyers and there was obviously some grower resistance to sell. It was a ginormous drop,"" she said. ""We know the retail sector have been hugely impacted by COVID, and the great unknown is how long this is going to go on for. ""Now we're getting blockages down the line. We've got fabric orders and garments sitting in the system. ""We've also got a build up of stocks when it comes to greasy fibres, whether on the farm or on store, and it's a continual blockade. ""Until we can move something on the retail front, we won't see anything at the other end."" Geoff and Helen Litchfield are in the midst of shearing on their property east of Cooma in south east NSW Geoff Litchfield said he could see the impact of COVID-19 on the market but would most likely sell the wool straight away. ""I'm feeling rather nervous, we generally harvest and sell, and we average that out over five or 10 years,"" he said. ""There will be some good years and some ugly ones, and it's looking like this year is not going to help the average. Helen Litchfield said some of the bales of wool could be worth $1,000 less when compared to last year. ""I'm very nervous about the wool market like everybody, and I think it could be a long recovery ahead."" But for Mr Litchfield, there is a hope that the market may have hit bottom and will attract interest from buyers. ""If the market gets to a low enough level, hopefully, that inspires some investment, and hopefully that curve starts to go up."" Southern NSW wool broker Marty Moses said brokers were getting mixed emotions from growers about their plans for marketing their clip. ""Some people want to hold onto their clip until the market improves. ""Some are telling us to sell their first clip (from last shearing) and see what happens and hold their second clip. ""Others are saying they can't see the market improving anytime soon, so they are going to take the cash now for the lot,"" he said. Mr Moses said there was still no clear pattern to what would happen with the wool market. ""There is a lot of wool being offered at auction now that is two years old, and there is a lot of wool in brokers stores that has been there for 12 months or more,"" he said. ""If you are going to hang onto wool, be prepared to be in there for a couple of years with the way the market is, or sell and repent now."" Mercado managing director Robert Herrmann said it had been more than a decade since stockpiles had last reached current levels. ""If we accumulate an extra half a million bales over the next six months, that's got to be somehow absorbed. But now we've got to find new markets for it,"" he said. ""The last ten years we've comfortably traded to the world about 2 million bales. ""If we start hanging onto 2.5 million — we're talking fresh shorn wool plus wool sitting in broker's stores — then it's unlikely we're going to see demand improve enough to absorb that because we're in a terrible economic situation."" With very little buying activity out of Italy and India and the downturn in consumer retail spending in Europe, Mr Moses doesn't foresee prices lifting anytime soon as China is left as the primary buyer of Australian wool. ""Retail is still dead in Europe, and we only have to look to what is happening with Victoria and lockdown due to COVID-19 to see that people aren't going to the shopping malls,"" he said. ""When people lose an income, discretional spending goes, and that is not good for wool as a luxury item."" Wool analyst Eamon Timms also expected it would be some time before wool prices bounced back as there was a lot of wool already in the supply pipeline. ""Given how much indigestion there is in the supply chain, it's going to take a while for that old stock to be digested, but that old stock will eventually be sold but at lower levels,"" Mr Timms. Subscribe for the national headlines of the day. ""But I'm not expecting that we are going to see, as Donald Trump describes a V-curve. We just won't see that with the wool market prices."" However, he does anticipate the reduced wool price will bring more people to merino wool. ""In the next 18 months we will see more people using merino wool as these prices will put wool in a zone for people that may have used it before, or are new to the fibre,"" he said. ""It is going to give us a wonderful basis for the future because once they use it, they are not going to want to let it go as it has wonderful characteristics as a wearable fibre."" The Australian Wool Production Forecasting Committee expects the 2020–21 shorn wool production would be 276 million kilograms greasy (this forecast was made in April and will be updated on August 12). It is expected that 33,413 bales will be offered nationally next week, with Fremantle having a one day sale next Wednesday.

373,ASX ends flat despite Victoria's tough coronavirus lockdown,markets,"  ASX ends flat despite Victoria's tough coronavirus lockdown The Australian share market has come off its lows and ended flat despite the Victorian Government announcing a wide-ranging shutdown of industry in Melbourne for six weeks in an attempt to control a second wave of coronavirus infections. Victorian Premier Dan Andrews said all but essential businesses, including most retail, manufacturing and administration companies, would shut down in metropolitan Melbourne. Businesses that are forced to close will be eligible for a $5,000 grant from the Victorian Government. The ASX 200 index ended down just 2 points to 5,926, after falling by more than 1 per cent in the first hour of trade. The All Ordinaries lost 4 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 6,054. Big banks and financial firms slumped on worries about a flood of business insolvencies from the Victorian shutdown, and the increased risk of home loan defaults if the Victorian economy did not bounce back later this year. The COVID-19 crisis has a long way to run, and the longer it drags on the greater the threat of an Australian house price crash. The Commonwealth Bank fell 1.8 per cent to $69.93, ANZ lost 4.1 per cent to $17.22, NAB also dropped 4.1 per cent to $16.84 and Westpac fell 3.5 per cent to $16.49. Debt collector Credit Corp Group lost 8.7 per cent to $17.33. Construction firms fell, with the Victorian Government announcing most construction sites would close down or dramatically reduce activity, although essential sites could remain open with a scaled-down workforce. NRW lost 7.9 per cent to $1.69. Retailers lost ground as well amid news of the Victorian shutdown. Myer fell 4.9 per cent to 19.5 cents, Harvey Norman was off 2.4 per cent, JB Hi-Fi was down 2.3 per cent and Wesfarmers (the owner of Bunnings and Officeworks) lost 1.4 per cent. But supermarket chain Woolworths rose 0.9 per cent to $39.04. Australia went into the pandemic with a clear suppression strategy, but the effective elimination of COVID-19 in several states and NZ has a growing number of economists advocating elimination. However, a rally by healthcare firms and miners limited the losses, with China's manufacturing industry expanding again last month. Gold miners jumped after gold reached new record highs of nearly $US1,990 an ounce. St Barbara rose 3.6 per cent to $3.47. Hearing implant maker Cochlear rose 4.6 per cent to $198.89. Petrol retailer Viva Energy jumped 5 per cent to $1.69 after saying petrol sales recovered across the country last month, aside from in Victoria, where they slumped by a quarter. Mining contractor Monadelphous was the biggest loser in the ASX 200, down 10.3 per cent to $7.99, after it was sued by Rio Tinto over a fire at an iron ore processing plant last year. The Australian dollar was down 0.3 per cent to 71.21 US cents. The latest survey from ANZ shows that job ads jumped strongly for the second month in a row in July, but the pace of gains slowed down as Melbourne reimposed restrictions because of the second wave of coronavirus infections. One of the Reserve Bank's targets is full employment, but back when that target was set it meant a very different thing to what does today. Job openings increased 16.7 per cent over the month as most of Australia's economy continued reopening, following a 41.4 per cent surge in June. But advertisements are still down a third since February and by a similar amount over the year to July. ANZ economists said the new lockdown in Victoria worsens the outlook. ""We think additional fiscal measures will be needed sooner rather than later to support households, workers and businesses through this very tough period,"" they argued. Job ads fell by a record 53.7 per cent in April amid government restrictions and business shutdowns because of the pandemic. The company-reporting season gets into full swing this week, with expectations that some big companies could see annual earnings plunge by up to 20 per cent because of the coronavirus pandemic. Later this week, Insurance Australia Group and real estate firm REA Group will report their annual profits. The Australian market fell 2 per cent on Friday amid rising coronavirus infections in Victoria and after the US economy saw its worst June quarter on record because of COVID-19. On Friday, Wall Street ended higher in a volatile session, despite no deal in Congress to extend extra unemployment benefits for millions of Americans. The Nasdaq rose after COVID-19 boosted the earnings of tech giants such as Apple and Amazon. Apple shares jumped 10.5 per cent to end at a record high of $US425.04 after the company's quarterly results. It has surpassed Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco as the world's most valuable publicly traded company. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 115 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 26,428, the S&P 500 gained 25 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 3,271 and the Nasdaq Composite added 157 points, or 1.5 per cent, to 10,745.

374,analysis: We're about to find out the biggest corporate winners and losers from COVID-19,markets,"  Australia has just entered corporate confession season, with the vast majority of share market listed companies due to update investors on their results for the financial year just ended on June 30. It's one of two times a year — the other in February — that investors are guaranteed to see some light shed on how their companies are performing. These accounts are externally audited and it's a serious offence to mislead, so shareholders should have reasonable confidence they're getting a true picture of the past six months' performance. And what a six months it's been. There's never been a confession season quite like this — one that coincides with a pandemic, recession and record stimulus to keep entire industries from collapsing. The Australian share market has had one of its most volatile financial years ever, reaching record highs before plunging sharply, and then quickly recovering around half those losses. Since the panicked market sell-off in March, a large number of ASX-listed companies have slashed dividends, raised extra cash to stay afloat and provided scant detail about their outlook. Many have also refrained from disclosing whether their business is being kept alive by JobKeeper wage subsidies, which are due to be scaled back in October before ending in March next year. Morgan Stanley's analysts say that lack of disclosure is a good reason to watch this reporting season closely. ""Despite investor feedback that earnings 'don't matter' amid the COVID-19 crisis, we think FY20 [financial year 2020] earnings are important,"" they wrote. ""In a world where guidance has been withdrawn, earnings estimates are stale and earnings dispersion is very wide, the looming refresh will provide much-needed context and depth to what have typically been updates that have been narrow in focus and scant on detail."" Much of that detail is likely to be brutally negative. Investment bank Citi says the consensus among its peers is for Australian corporate earnings to be down more than 15 per cent over the past financial year — more than half of which was unaffected by the pandemic — with no earnings recovery in the current year. That would match up neatly with share prices, which are around 15 per cent off their pre-pandemic peaks on the ASX. That's despite the quickest rebound in history, from a 36.5 per cent slump at the trough, as investors welcomed unprecedented government and central bank stimulus and bet on a successful vaccine being found in record time. But Citi's analysts are more pessimistic. They expect earnings to have dropped 20 per cent last financial year. With earnings down and the outlook uncertain, dividends are likely to be drastically cut, on average. As efforts to control COVID-19 appear to be gaining traction, many analysts and traders are hoping for a quick return to business as usual. They're likely to be disappointed, writes Ian Verrender. Citi analysts are predicting dividends could fall by 37 per cent (from $72 billion last year, to $45 billion this year), with the biggest declines from banking stocks. (The regulator has already warned banks not to pay out more than half their earnings to shareholders.) Citi is also warning that earnings could remain depressed for some time, forcing many companies back to investors to ask for more cash through discounted share sales. ""Renewed outbreaks in Victoria and NSW mean rolling lockdowns are likely to remain a reality for some time, meaning a healthy balance sheet is key,"" the bank's analysts wrote. ""Net equity raising totalled $28 billion in the June quarter, a similar level to that reached during the 2008 financial crisis. ""We expect more raisings in the coming months."" Morgan Stanley analysts agree that the share price recovery looks too optimistic and that there's scope for great pain this reporting season as companies reveal just how badly they've been battered by the pandemic recession. ""Multiples look stretched,"" Morgan Stanley's equity strategists warn. They believe the Australian market is trading at 19.4 times what earnings will likely be in the next 12 months. ""Earnings are always the best test for price and we expect some digestive discomfort after a period of heightened economic stress and limited company information flow."" But while there will be great losers — and probably a few more high-profile casualties who don't make it to the other side of the pandemic — some companies have capitalised on COVID-19. Mining stocks, for example, are expected to be responsible for a third of dividends in the upcoming reporting season, up from 26 per cent last year, as Chinese iron ore demand recovered rapidly, underpinning the profits of the big three — BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue. And the news has only been getting better for gold miners over the past few months as the precious metal hit record highs. Gold has been a safe haven store of wealth for millennia, and the coronavirus pandemic is proving no different, with everyone from amateurs to professionals piling in to push it to record prices. Another group of COVID beneficiaries, at least in the short term, are some large retailers that sold goods in demand just before and during the lockdown. Supermarket giants Woolworths and Coles benefited from hoarding and a shift from eating out to dining at home. Coles' one-time owner Wesfarmers saw strong sales at its Officeworks and Bunnings stores as customers set themselves up for more work and leisure time at home. Electronics and appliances giants JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman got similar boosts, with Gerry Harvey's outfit also benefiting from rising furniture sales. Other retailers saw a rapid recovery once the lockdowns ended, due to pent up demand. On Friday, Super Retail Group — which operates the Supercheap Auto, Rebel Sport and BCF outdoor chains — reported a 27.7 per cent jump in June sales. But Citi is urging caution before people climb onto the retail bandwagon. ""Trading updates for the reporting season are expected to be positive given government support and the superannuation withdrawal,"" its analysts noted. ""This may prove misleading as there will be a step down in stimulus come the December quarter, which is likely to result in weaker retail sales growth."" Coronavirus fears may have triggered market panic, but it is the rapid escalation of global debt that will cause the worst financial damage from the crisis, argues Ian Verrender. This reporting season may be a case of the tortoise and the hare, with some companies racing ahead now only to jump into a great hole next financial year, while others that have struggled but survived continue to move forward. For other firms, like those in travel, survival is the only game in town until an effective vaccine or treatment is found, the pandemic conquered and borders reopen. The key figure to watch for there is debt and continuing costs — how long can these companies exist on shareholder, bank and government life support before the plug gets pulled?

375,ASX ends deep in the red after biggest US economic plunge on record,markets,"  Coronavirus triggers biggest US economic plunge on record; ASX falls sharply The Australian share market has closed sharply lower, after losses deepened in afternoon trade, while the Australian dollar has strengthened. The ASX 200 ended down by 2 per cent or 123 points at 5,927 points, with nine in every 10 stocks on the benchmark index closing in the red. All sectors lost ground, led by energy (-2.9pc), financials (-2.4pc) and materials (-2.3pc). Shares in major miners and banks weighed on the market, including BHP (-2.9pc), Rio Tinto (-2.4pc), Commonwealth Bank (-2.8pc) and Westpac (-3.3pc). AMP shares fell by 12.8 per cent to $1.47, after the embattled wealth firm flagged its underlying profit for the first six months of the year was expected to have more than halved. AMP refunded former customers charged fees for no service through new superannuation accounts — set up with AMP, and charging high fees for poor performance. AMP was the worst performer among the top 200 stocks. The best was Super Retail Group, which closed 9.5 per cent higher at $8.88, after earlier hitting a more-than-five-month high. The retailer behind Rebel, BCF and Supercheap Auto said it expected to report increased revenue and earnings for the past financial year. Other retail stocks such as Harvey Norman (+3.6pc), JB Hi-Fi (+0.2pc) and Myer (+2.5pc) also rose. Shares in travel companies Helloworld (+2.6pc), Corporate Travel Management (+0.9pc) and Flight Centre (+2.9pc) ended higher. Technology stocks had followed their US counterparts higher in early trade but later retreated. The Australian dollar was 0.4 per cent higher at 72.25 US cents by 4:40pm AEST, after the US dollar fell to a fresh two-year low. The local losses followed a mixed finish on US markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 0.9 per cent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq index made a gain of 0.4 per cent. Figures released overnight showed the US economy contracted by a record amount from April to June because of business shutdowns during the coronavirus pandemic. Gross domestic product shrank by a record 32.9 per cent on an annualised basis, the worst decline in production since records started in 1947, according to the US Commerce Department. The contraction was worse than that seen during the Great Depression the 1930s. However, the figure was slightly better than expected, with economists predicting the economy would contract by 34.7 per cent. Over the June quarter, economic growth contracted by a record 9.5 per cent. The figures wiped out more than five years of economic growth for North America. Activity almost ground to a halt in April after restaurants, bars, factories, and other businesses closed down to slow the spread of the virus. While the economy started to reopen in May, an increase in infections saw some coronavirus restrictions reimposed and business shutdowns again. Personal consumption slumped by more than one third as spending on services fell and consumers spent less on health care, clothing and shoes. There's nothing like a crisis to turn conventional wisdom on its head, and that is precisely what coronavirus is doing to economics. However, personal income jumped, mainly because of extra government payments to households because of the coronavirus. Without multi-trillion-dollar government stimulus, the economic contraction would have been deeper. The pullback was broad based, with exports, business investment, state and local government spending and inventories all falling. Exports fell by two-thirds but imports rose 10 per cent. Private domestic investment fell by half, and equipment spending dropped by nearly 38 per cent. Finance professor Jason Reed from the University of Notre Dame said the figures were ""hard to swallow."" ""Right now, the American economy is speeding toward a fiscal cliff,"" he warned. ""Not only do we need Americans to take serious action preventing the spread of the disease, but we also need Congress to agree on another stimulus package and quickly."" The US economy shrank by 5 per cent over the first quarter and officially entered recession in February. Other data showed claims for unemployment benefits rose last week as new coronavirus cases continued to increase in the US. After the numbers came out, US President Donald Trump raised the prospect of delaying November's presidential election. That was immediately rejected by Democrats and Republicans in Congress. There was also no sign of a deal to extend extra unemployment benefits due to end today. The Dow Jones index fell 226 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 26,314. But stocks came off their lows during the session and the broader S&P 500 index fell just 0.4 per cent to 3,246, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq actually rose 0.4 per cent to 10,587. European stocks fell after the US GDP figures came out. The FTSE 100 fell 2.3 per cent to 5,990, the DAX lost 3.5 per cent to 12,380 and the CAC 40 fell 2.1 per cent to 4,853. Spot gold dropped 0.7 per cent to $US1,957.31 an ounce, but gold was still trading near its record highs. Brent crude oil fell 0.9 per cent to $US43.38 a barrel. The coronavirus pandemic and associated rush to online shopping saw Amazon post the biggest profit in its history. The company said quarterly revenue jumped 40 per cent from a year earlier to $US88.9 billion and it made a net profit of $US5.2 billion for the second quarter, double what it made a year ago. As social distancing rules and fear kept people away from the shops, online sales have taken off and many analysts say a lot of consumers will not return in-store. Shares of the world's largest online retailer rose 5 per cent in after-hours trade. It released its numbers after the closing bell. Australian-founded, New-York-listed software firm Atlassian reported a 33 per cent increase in revenue for the past financial year, to $US1.6 billion. The company posted a net loss of $US350.7 million, narrower than the $US637 million loss in the previous year. ""We now serve over 174,000 customers, including more than 150,000 using our cloud products, and made significant progress in transforming Atlassian into a cloud-first, global software leader,"" co-founder Scott Farquhar said. Atlassian issued guidance for the first quarter of the 2021 financial year, with earnings per share estimates coming in below analysts' forecasts. Apple's quarterly earnings also surged, but it warned there would be delays with the new iPhone models. It saw a record quarterly revenue of $US59.7 billion, with gains across every category and geographic region as people worked and studied at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales jumped 11 per cent, despite production disruptions and store closures because of the coronavirus. Net profit rose to $US11.2 billion in the June quarter compared to $US10 billion for the same time a year ago. Facebook also saw revenue rise over the second quarter, as advertising increased amid a surge in online traffic during the coronavirus pandemic. Expenses rose but net profit doubled over the quarter from the same time last year, coming in at $US5.2 billion. Last year, Facebook paid $US2 billion to settle a privacy case with the Federal Trade Commission, which weighed on profit. Tech stocks in Australia and the US have not only recovered to pre-COVID highs, they have surpassed them. But some say the rally is reminiscent of the dot-com boom and bust. Google parent Alphabet saw sales drop for the first time on the search giant as companies cut back on advertising spending. That saw second-quarter revenue fall 2 per cent to $US38.3 billion — better than expected by analysts. Around two-thirds of Alphabet's revenue came from Google search and YouTube ads. Costs rose and quarterly profit came in at $US6.7 billion.

376,ASX hangs on to early gains despite coronavirus spike,markets,"  ASX hangs on to early gains despite coronavirus spike The Australian share market closes higher, despite the record number of new coronavirus cases and tougher restrictions announced in Victoria and the growing risk of a new outbreak in Queensland. Investors are optimistic after the US central bank again promised to keep official interest rates near zero for as long as needed to offset the damage from the coronavirus pandemic. By the close, the ASX 200 index of the top stocks was three-quarters of a per cent higher at 6,051, while the broader All Ordinaries was up 0.8 per cent at 6,178. Technology stocks led the gains on the ASX after the Nasdaq led Wall Street's gains. Australia's local tech sector rose 2.6 per cent, easily outpacing other parts of the market. Laboratory testing group ALS had the ASX 200's top gain of 6.5 per cent, with Credit Corp up 6 per cent and WiseTech Global up 5.9 per cent to $21.02. While tech stocks were the standouts, old-school resources companies also performed strongly. Iron ore miners were up, with Fortescue Metals climbing 4.2 per cent to a record high of $17.55 after it reported record quarterly and annual iron ore production. Fortescue Metals saw record iron ore shipments of 47.3 million for the June quarter as China's economy rebounded from the coronavirus pandemic. The iron ore miner said the numbers contributed to record shipments of 178.2 million tonnes for 2020, better than it previously predicted. It got paid an average $US81 per dry metric tonne of iron ore over the quarter, although costs rose because of COVID-19. Yesterday evening, after the ASX closed, Rio Tinto reported a 20 per cent fall in profit, however its iron ore division propped up the company's result with strong volumes and a very health profit margin. Its shares rose 1.1 per cent on the ASX today, with rival BHP up 1.4 per cent. Iron ore prices lifted back above $US110 a tonne thanks to stronger demand in China. CBA commodity analyst Vivek Dhar said steel mill margins had recovered as demand recovered in southern China after a particularly bad wet season. But he warned that a price fall was pending. ""While elevated steel mill margins are keeping iron ore prices well supported, the rise in China's iron ore port stocks suggest that oversupply risks are emerging,"" he cautioned. ""We think rising port stocks should eventually weigh on iron ore prices later this year."" Supermarket firm Coles Group also hit a record high, before closing 1.5 per cent up on yesterday at $18.46. Investment firm Macquarie Group has warned of an uncertain economic recovery at its annual general meeting. Chief executive Shemara Wikramanayake said operating net profit for the first quarter of the financial year had dropped from the same time a year ago, with markets remaining volatile and bad loans rising. ""Market conditions are likely to remain challenging, especially given the significant and unprecedented uncertainty caused by the worldwide impact of COVID-19 and the uncertain speed of the global economic recovery,"" she said. Macquarie said lower investment income had hurt its earnings because of the pandemic and coronavirus restrictions. Its shares closed up 0.8 per cent to $126. The full bench of the Federal Court dismissed an appeal by the consumer watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, against telecoms firm TPG in relation to the marketing and sale of some prepaid internet, home telephone and mobile plans. TPG shares were up 0.6 per cent to $8.19. Financial firm IOOF led the stocks in the red, dropping 7.8 per cent to $4.86, while copper miner Sandfire Resources fell 5.8 per cent. Shopping centre owners dominated the losses, with three in the top 10 declines as coronavirus cases remain high in Victoria, while new outbreaks still threaten to get out of control in NSW and Queensland. Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (which owns malls in the US and Europe) fell 5.3 per cent, Vicinity was down 4 per cent and Scentre (which owns Westfields Australian shopping centres) dropped 3.4 per cent to $2.02. The Australian dollar was slightly weaker at 71.44 US cents, having dropped from its highest levels in 15 months after hitting 71.97 US cents overnight. The impact of COVID-19 has seen a big fall in applications for permits to build new homes across the nation, although the value of housing approved rose 0.1 per cent, boosted by renovations. The slump comes as the coronavirus, travel bans and border restrictions sap demand for housing. The Australian Bureau of Statistics said dwelling approvals fell to an eight-year low in June, down 4.9 per cent seasonally adjusted over the month, with the worst declines seen in New South Wales and Western Australia. Residential approvals are down nearly 16 per cent over the year, with Commonwealth Bank economists expecting housing construction to fall by 25 per cent in 2020. Approvals to build new houses dropped 5.7 per cent over the month and permits to build units slid by 5.3 per cent. CBA economist Belinda Allen said the Federal Government's $680 million HomeBuilder scheme ""should help provide some support to renovations and new builds when the system becomes operational."" Separate ABS data showed that two out of every five businesses in Australia are receiving coronavirus stimulus lifelines such as wage subsidies, loan repayment holidays or rental relief. The latest ABS survey found that 53 per cent of medium-sized firms had sought assistance compared to 42 per cent of small businesses. Ten per cent of businesses said they expected to close if support measures stopped and 13 per cent said they would lay off workers. The head of the US central bank says the surge in coronavirus cases in the United States and restrictions to stem the spread have started to hurt the country's economic recovery. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell told a media conference the US had entered a new phase in containing the virus, which is essential to protect both health and the economy. ""We have seen some signs in recent weeks that the increase in virus cases and the renewed measures to control it are starting to weigh on economic activity,"" he warned. The Fed kept official interest rates on hold, as expected, after the conclusion of its two-day meeting. Its policy statement directly tied the economic recovery to a resolution of the health crisis. ""The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus."" The Fed's repeated pledge to use its full range of tools to support the economy and keep interest rates near zero boosted stocks. The major indices were already higher ahead of profit reports from big tech firms such as Amazon and Apple. The world's biggest technology giants have been accused of abusing their market power in a long-awaited congressional hearing in the United States. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 26,540, the S&P 500 gained 1.2 per cent to 3,258 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.4 per cent to 10,543 with the big tech firms boosting the Nasdaq. Oil and financial stocks led the gains on the broader market. Starbucks Corp climbed 3.7 per cent after the coffee chain said business was ""steadily recovering"" worldwide and it would report a profit in the current quarter. Boeing shares slipped after it cut production of its biggest twin-engine jets and reported a bigger-than-expected loss because of the fallout from the pandemic. Eastman Kodak shares jumped more than 300 per cent, a day after the US Government said the company would get a $US765 million loan to produce pharmaceutical ingredients.

377,analysis: A promising coronavirus vaccine and a $200 million profit. Now for the bad news,markets,"  The competition to be first to develop a coronavirus vaccine has sharpened the focus on public statements from the biotech and pharmaceutical companies involved in vaccine development. The more a company's press release points to the successful development of a vaccine, the more its stock price will rise once trading resumes from a trading halt. But imagine if company executives with stock options were taking advantage of this kind of announcement by dumping stock shortly afterwards and pocketing the profit? There's nothing illegal about it, but traders and analysts say that if it damages the integrity of the market, the development of a coronavirus vaccine could be delayed. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic The New York Times recently reported that Vaxart, a small vaccine developer in San Francisco, had been selected to be part of a federal initiative to fast-track the development of COVID-19 drugs. Hanging out for a coronavirus vaccine? Here's your three best hopes — and why they could be dashed. The value of the company's shares soared and staff who had stock options sold them for a 600 per cent increase, equivalent to around $200 million in instant profit. Is that illegal? No, they're trading on publicly available information. Vaxart told the New York Times that it abides by good corporate governance guidelines and policies and makes decisions with the best interests of the company and its shareholders. Indeed none of the ""company insiders"" and ""private investors"" are alleged to have done anything unlawful. But the fear is that as more companies are discovered to be engaging in this kind of behaviour the less investors will be willing to buy or hold onto these stocks. The problem is exacerbated if investors believe the problem won't be policed. The managing director of New York-based TJM Investments, Tim Anderson, says he's not familiar with trading activity involving Vaxart, but he believes such a small stock is unlikely to get any attention from US securities regulators. ""The bigger companies are going to have legal and compliance people crawling all over stuff like this,"" he says. ""Smaller companies, that are 'penny stocks', fly under the radar a little bit,""  Anderson says. Since March 11, several mostly small companies have sold shares worth well over $1 billion dollars, according to figures compiled for The New York Times by research company Equilar. Of course it's impossible to quantify or measure this on an industry-wide scale. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic It is, however, reasonable to say that irregular stock market trading, viewed as unfair, can impede the market's ability to do its job — that is, to raise funds. Anderson told the ABC that a significant increase in this sort of trading activity threatens the integrity of all stocks in the biotech and pharmaceutical sectors. ""A lot of pharmaceutical stocks and a lot of biotech stocks have had big moves in the past three or four months,"" he said. ""To the extent that individuals get burned in them it will be very difficult for companies on the periphery to raise money going forward."" Dean Katselas is a senior lecturer at the Australian National University and has done extensive research on stock exchange trading by company insiders. He agrees with Anderson from TJM Investments that there's a risk advantageous stock market trading around coronavirus vaccine press releases risks threatening the development of a vaccine. ""Anything that potentially tarnishes the credibility of the market, of the information, and certainly the integrity of the insiders with that information, that does have the potential to impede the ability to raise capital down the track,"" he said. Australian researchers are leading several major clinical trials that might help bring an end to the deadly disease. Australian-owned biotechnology company CSL is providing some of the much-needed technology. When asked if CSL was aware of any unusual trading in its stock, and if that risked hampering scientific research, Chief Financial Officer David Lamont responded with a statement: ""It's important to recognise that medical research under development can fail at any stage. CSL can't emphasise enough that development, manufacture and distribution of a vaccine that is safe and effective for millions of people requires time and rigour, and we want the public to be measured with their expectations."" Stock markets exist primarily as a vehicle to raise funds for companies which then provide a service or products to the community. Trading in shares in these companies is vital for the healthy operation of the market. If shareholders believe their investments will be swamped by big players in the market with more knowledge than them, they will hesitate to fund or provide finance to these companies. While the trading to date is not illegal, if a withdrawal of funds impedes a company's ability to develop a vaccine for a deadly pandemic, it's worth the close attention of authorities. The development of a coronavirus vaccine is potentially on the line. A spokesman for market regulator ASIC said both ASX and ASIC had made clear they are, ""on the lookout for any potential misleading of the market to take advantage of the COVID-19 environment"". ""And in particular, ASIC always checks potentially suspicious trading in and around significant announcements or corporate events — such as merger and acquisition activity, research results or regulatory approvals,"" he said.

378,McWilliam's Wines secures rescue deal; ASX closes lower,markets,"  McWilliam's Wines creditors approve private equity rescue; Australian shares close lower One of Australia's oldest winemakers has avoided collapse, with creditors voting in favour of a rescue plan by a private equity firm. McWilliam's Wines entered voluntary administration in January, citing a decline in business performance. The winemaker's creditors have now voted in favour of a recapitalisation proposal put forward by Prcstnt Asset Management. ""Not only will unsecured creditors likely receive full repayment of their debts owed, it preserves ongoing employment for all McWilliam's staff and a possible return to existing shareholders,"" one of the administrators, KPMG's Gayle Dickerson, said. The unlisted company has a history of more than 140 years and has been family-owned across six generations. Prcstnt expected to take over full control of McWilliam's from the administrators by October. ""Whilst it has been a challenging journey over the past six months, from bushfires to voluntary administration and a pandemic, we are now very excited to have our future confirmed,"" McWilliam's Wines chief executive David Pitt said. A number of Australian companies have entered administration during 2020, including Virgin Australia and swimwear brand Seafolly. The Australian share market has closed lower, led by losses for technology stocks, following similar moves on Wall Street overnight. The ASX 200 ended down by 1.2 per cent, or 70 points, at 6,024 points. Technology was the worst-performing sector, losing 1.8 per cent, after Apple led falls for tech stocks on US markets overnight. Shares in Altium (-2.6 per cent), WiseTech Global (-2.2 per cent), NextDC (-2 per cent), Zip Co (-2.6 per cent) and Afterpay (-3 per cent) all lost ground. The financial sector also fell sharply, with the major bank stocks ending lower, led by a 1.8 per cent fall for Westpac shares. Shares in Insurance Australia Group (IAG) fell by 7.8 per cent, the biggest fall for a stock on the benchmark index this session, after the company said it would scrap its final dividend. ""While IAG recognises many shareholders will be disappointed with no final dividend, it believes it is important to adhere to its long-established dividend payout policy and maintain a strong capital position in the current uncertain environment,"" it said. The insurer flagged a more than halving in profit for the financial year just passed, down to $435 million compared to more than $1 billion a year ago, ahead of its final results to be released early next month. Shares in Vicinity Centres fell by 2.5 per cent after the shopping centre manager said the value of its portfolio had fallen by more than 11 per cent over the first six months of the year. Vicinity's chief executive Grant Kelley said a part of the $1.8 billion drop in valuation of its 60 directly owned properties was related to rent waivers provided to retailers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. ""It is important to note that retail property is one of the few industries where partial rent waivers, not just rent deferrals, are being offered to impacted businesses,"" he said. ""Vicinity is undertaking these actions to support the long-term sustainability of the retail industry."" High-profile retailers including Premier Investments, which is behind brands including Smiggle and Peter Alexander, have refused to pay rent for the duration of shutdowns, igniting disputes with some shopping centre landlords. Other real estate stocks including Scentre Group (-2.8 per cent), Unibail-Rodamco Westfield (-4.7 per cent), Dexus (-2.8 per cent) and Stockland (-3.6 per cent) also closed lower. The Australian dollar had fallen to around 70.9 US cents by 4:35pm AEST, amid escalating tensions between the United States and China. China has ordered the US to close its consulate in Chengdu, following the Trump administration demanding the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston. Stocks in China fell sharply, with the Shanghai Composite losing 3.9 per cent. An American technology watchdog group says multiple US states are investigating Apple for potentially misleading customers. The Tech Transparency Project obtained a document from the Texas Attorney-General, which said the state may sue Apple for breaking its deceptive trade practices law as part of an investigation by a number of states. Apple has faced class-action lawsuits from consumers alleging that it deceived customers about slowing the performance of older iPhones. The company agreed to pay up to $US500 million ($699 million) to settle one of the claims earlier this year. The news pulled down technology stocks on Wall Street, with Apple losing 4.6 per cent. Microsoft dropped 4.3 per cent as revenue at its cloud computing business, Azure, slowed down over the quarter. Twitter bucked the trend after reporting a big rise in users thanks in part to the coronavirus lockdowns. Its shares increased by 4.1 per cent after reporting its highest-ever annual growth of daily users. That is despite posting a loss of $US1.2 billion for the second quarter, mainly because of the reversal of a tax benefit. National Australia Bank economist Ray Attrill predicted more bad news for big tech in the run-up to the US presidential election in November. ""In the bigger picture, this news likely represents just a foretaste of what is likely to come post the November US elections by way of stepped-up antitrust/anti-monopoly investigations of 'big tech', including Google and Facebook, as well as EU-orchestrated efforts for a new digital tax regime for global technology behemoths,"" he wrote in a morning note. The Dow Jones index fell 1.3 per cent, or 354 points, to 26,652, the S&P 500 lost 1.2 per cent to 3,236, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.3 per cent to 10,461. Gold prices climbed more than 1 per cent to a nine-year high overnight, boosted by US-China tensions, a weaker greenback, hopes for more coronavirus stimulus measures, a rise in US jobless claims and rising infections. Spot gold rose as high as $US1,898 an ounce, near its record high of $US1,921 an ounce reached in September 2011. European stocks ended flat. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.07 per cent to 6,211, the DAX was flat at 13,103 and the CAC 40 finished at 5,034, down three points. Brent crude lost more than 2 per cent to $US43.34 a barrel. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week for the first time in nearly four months. Initial claims for jobless benefits increased 109,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.4 million last week. The rise is the first since late March when applications reached a record 6.8 million. It comes as coronavirus cases pass 4 million and the US economy stalls amid increased restrictions. The US Congress is negotiating over the extension of a $US600 a week benefit supplement which runs out at the end of the month. Senate Republicans announced they could present their version of the bill to Democrats as early as this week. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC that the Republican coronavirus relief plan will extend enhanced unemployment insurance ""based on approximately 70 per cent wage replacement"". He also said a payroll tax holiday, pushed for by US President Donald Trump, would not be in the bill.

379,ASX ends higher after Government reveals coronavirus budget hit,markets,"  Australian shares swing after Federal Government reveals coronavirus budget hit The Australian share market has closed higher, after swinging between positive and negative territory, following the Federal Government's budget update. The ASX 200 finished 0.3 per cent higher at 6,094 points, while the All Ordinaries index gained a third of a per cent, or 21 points, to 6,213. The local market had initially opened lower, with falls for bank and mining stocks, however it changed course after the budget update, which revealed an $86 billion deficit amid the coronavirus pandemic, and managed to hold onto its gains in late trade The Australian dollar rose through the afternoon, to around 71.5 per cent by 4:35pm AEST. The major bank stocks ended mixed, with ANZ (-0.1 per cent) and the Commonwealth Bank (-0.5 per cent) losing ground, while NAB (+0.7 per cent) and Westpac (+0.4 per cent) pushed higher. The telco sector was the worst performer, with falls for Telstra (-1.2 per cent) and TPG (-2.4 per cent). Shares in Tabcorp rose by 4.9 per cent, after announcing the retirement of its chief executive David Attenborough in the first half of 2021. The company said a global search for Mr Attenborough's replacement is underway. The gaming giant also announced that its chair Paula Dwyer will retire at the end of the year, and will be succeeded by current director Steven Gregg. The changes at Tabcorp follow its integration with Tatts Group after a merger, which Ms Dwyer said is nearing completion. One of the world's major credit ratings agencies said the predicted rise in the budget deficit this financial year would not affect Australia's 'AAA' credit rating. S&P Global Ratings said the extension of the JobKeeper wage subsidy and JobSeeker supplement would not put the rating at risk, given the cost of the JobKeeper program is less than forecast in March. ""The 'AAA' rating on Australia reflects our expectation that the economy will begin to recover from recession during fiscal 2021,"" it said. ""We expect the general government's fiscal balance to improve during the next few years beyond the large deficit being incurred in fiscal 2021, and believe the government remains committed to fiscal discipline."" However, it warned that the credit rating could be downgraded if COVID-19 caused more severe or prolonged economic damage than currently expected, and maintained its negative outlook. The assumptions in the budget update were based on a six-week lockdown in Melbourne followed by a gradual easing in restrictions, with other states are assumed to continue opening up. Meantime, Victorian Treasurer Tim Pallas said the state's budget was projected to run a $7.5 billion deficit for the 2019-20 financial year. National Australia Bank has warned some businesses in the hospitality, tourism and aviation industries may not survive the coronavirus recession. Ana Marinovic, head of NAB's small business bank, said the second lockdown in Victoria has seen some firms delay their plans to start making loan repayments. ""Collectively, I think we need to be open to the fact that some businesses will not be in a strong position coming out of this and may not be able to recover, particularly those in hospitality, tourism and aviation and associated industries and sectors,"" she said. ""From the conversations I've been having with a large plethora of our customers, this is the market that has been hardest hit."" The US Government will pay nearly $US2 billion ($2.79 billion) to buy 100 million doses of a potential COVID-19 vaccine. That is enough doses to inoculate 50 million people if the vaccine proves to be safe and effective. The vaccine is being developed by global pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech. The companies will not get paid by the US Government unless their vaccine succeeds in large clinical trials and can be successfully manufactured. It is the latest deal the US has done with pharmaceutical firms trying to develop potential vaccines to treat coronavirus, as governments race to secure supplies of vaccines and medicines to reduce the spread and severity of the virus. Global markets fell and gold rose after the US ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, Texas, fuelling fears of worsening diplomatic relations between the superpowers. Citing the protection of American intellectual property and private information, the US gave China just three days to close the consulate. China is expected to retaliate. Spot gold jumped to a nine-year high of just above $US1,870 an ounce as investors turned to safe havens because of the tensions. Silver surged to the highest in seven years, up a further 8 per cent to just above $US23 an ounce. Oil prices are weaker, with Brent crude oil at $US44.28 a barrel, down 0.1 per cent after a surprise fall in US inventories. But Wall Street ended higher after a volatile session, as investors weighed quarterly profits results and negotiations in Washington to extend stimulus checks. US Democrats and Republicans remained divided on a new stimulus package expected to cost $US1 trillion or more, less than two weeks before extended benefits are due to expire for millions of unemployed Americans. The Pfizer-BioNTech deal also boosted the market, with Pfizer shares jumping 5.1 per cent. The Dow Jones index rose almost two-thirds of a per cent to 27,006. The S&P 500 reached a five-month high, up 0.6 per cent to 3,276, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2 per cent to 10,706. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York, said investors were looking to shares to boost returns. ""Investors are starving for income and they can't get that in the bond market so they're looking to equities,"" he said. ""But even though the averages are going up, investors seem to be growing more cautious."" National Australia Bank currency strategists warned that ""a US-China cold war remained a key risk for investors."" Snap shares fell 6.2 per cent after it posted a net loss of $US326 million. It also forecast fewer than expected users over the current quarter as the lockdown-induced boost petered out. Electric car maker Tesla saw another rise in quarterly profit, helped by stronger deliveries and cost cutting which offset coronavirus factory shutdowns. Tesla made a net income of $US104 million from April to June, the first time the company has posted a profit for four quarters in a row, making it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500 index. The company's shares have jumped more than 500 per cent over the past year. Tesla will also build a new vehicle factory in Texas, which could create 5,000 new jobs. Microsoft reported better than expected quarterly earnings as the coronavirus pandemic has increased demand for its flagship products. In economic news, sales of existing homes in the US jumped by a record 20.7 per cent in June, according to the National Association of Realtors, but sales are still down by a fifth compared to before the pandemic. European stocks fell on the worsening ties between the US and China. The FTSE 100 index fell 1 per cent to 6,207, the DAX in Germany dropped 0.5 per cent to 13,104 and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 1.3 per cent to 5,037.

381,"Court finds Kogan misled customers, sending its shares tumbling; ASX posts late rally",markets,"  Court finds online retailer Kogan misled customers with 2018 promotion; ASX posts late rally Shares in online retailer Kogan have tumbled after the Federal Court found its ""tax time"" promotion was misleading, while the broader share market has finished higher after a late rally. The ASX 200 closed up by 0.4 per cent or 22 points at 6,033 points, after a choppy session that saw it fall into the red after opening higher. Shares in Kogan lost 4.7 per cent after the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) won its case against the online retailer in the Federal Court. The court found Kogan breached consumer law by making false and misleading representations about an end of financial year promotion in 2018. Kogan advertised that shoppers could get a 10 per cent discount by entering the code ""TAXTIME"" at the online checkout, with email advertising stating ""48 hours left!"" and ""Ends midnight tonight!"" to spur purchases. However, the court found the advertisements were misleading because Kogan had increased the price of more than 600 of its products immediately before the promotion, and decreased the prices after it had ended. ""All businesses must ensure that their advertisements do not mislead consumers about the nature of a promotion, and that any promised savings are genuine,"" ACCC chair Rod Sims said. In a statement, Kogan said the promotion was not intended to mislead any shoppers. ""The profit derived by [Kogan] from the promotion was immaterial and the ruling will not have any adverse impact on the company's promotional activities, as the company updated its promotional activities in 2018,"" it said. A further hearing will be held to determine the penalty. RBC Capital Markets analyst Tim Piper said the impact of the ruling against Kogan was hard to quantify. ""The Federal Court decision is a negative outcome that may influence consumers' views of Kogan as a brand and business, mainly due to the media coverage,"" he said. ""From a financial standpoint, the potential impact is difficult to quantify given the range of possible outcomes and we do not wish to speculate on these. ""A potential risk is [that Kogan's] history with the ACCC might work against it from a penalties perspective."" Elsewhere on the local market, travel stocks fell including Flight Centre (-2.8 per cent), Corporate Travel Management (-0.3 per cent), Helloworld (-2 per cent), Qantas (-2.2 per cent), while Webjet ended flat. After most sectors of the market fell into the red midway through the session, all sectors managed to finish higher. Mining stocks led the charge, with gains for South32 (+4.2 per cent), Fortescue (+1.7 per cent), Rio Tinto (+0.6 per cent) and BHP (+0.4 per cent). A review of Westpac found its approach to managing non-financial risks is ""immature and reactive"", in the wake of allegations that the bank broke anti-money laundering laws more than 23 million times. The bank said it has started a multi-year program to fix the problems, following the report into its governance, accountability and culture. Westpac announced the review in response to the money laundering allegations, which include accusations it did not prevent paedophiles from using its payments network. The so-called reassessment follows a self-assessment completed by Westpac in 2018,  after the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) requested 36 banks, insurers and superannuation trustees run the ruler over their governance practices. Chief executive Peter King said it was clear the bank has to do more to address shortcomings. ""Our reassessment confirms tat our management of non-financial risk is currently not at the standard we set for ourselves,"" Mr King said. Meantime, Westpac has been hit with a class action by law firm Maurice Blackburn, over the use of a now-banned commission structure on car loans issued through dealerships. The bank said it will be defending the claim and noted similar claims may be filed. Earlier this week, Shine Lawyers said it was preparing to launch a class action on the same issue in coming weeks. Shares in Westpac rose (+0.5 per cent), as did NAB shares (+0.2 per cent), while shares in ANZ (-0.1 per cemt) and the Commonwealth Bank (-0.1 per cent) lost ground. US stocks have fallen after investors cashed in recent gains, with Twitter on the slide after suffering a hack on several high-profile accounts yesterday. Yesterday hackers seized control of the Twitter accounts of celebrities and political figures, including US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, celebrity Kim Kardashian-West, former US president Barack Obama, Tesla founder Elon Musk, rapper Kanye West and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, using the accounts to solicit bitcoin payments. The FBI's San Francisco division is leading an inquiry into the Twitter hacking and said the hackers committed cryptocurrency fraud. Twitter said that it was continuing to lock accounts that had changed passwords in the past month, but said: ""We believe only a small subset of these locked accounts were compromised."" The company stepped up the search for a new chief information security officer just weeks before high-profile users were hacked, according to Reuters. Twitter shares fell 1.1 per cent on the news. In after-hours trade, Netflix tumbled 9.5 per cent as investors were disappointed by the streaming video service's quarterly report after it forecast slowing subscriber growth during the coronavirus pandemic. Still, the firm added 10.1 million streaming subscribers from April to June as coronavirus forced people to stay home. Revenue jumped by one quarter to $US6.1 billion. Netflix content chief Ted Sarandos was promoted to co-chief executive, making him a clear successor to co-founder Reed Hastings. US stocks pulled back amid the high number of unemployed and rising coronavirus cases. Tech stocks Apple and Microsoft both weighed on the S&P 500 index, with real estate stocks also pulling the benchmark index lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5 per cent to end at 26,735 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.3 per cent to 3,216. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7 per cent to 10,474. Bank of America lost ground after its second-quarter profit more than halved, while Morgan Stanley rose after posting a record quarterly profit. The FTSE 100 slipped 0.7 per cent to 6,251, the DAX dropped 0.4 per cent to 12,875 and the CAC 40 dipped 0.5 per cent to 5,085. Spot gold slipped to $US1,797 an ounce and Brent crude oil lost 0.9 per cent to $US43.40 a barrel. US retail sales rose last month as the economy reopened, but increasing coronavirus cases kept Americans in the dole queue. Retail sales jumped by 7.5 per cent in June as people bought more cars, clothes and furniture and ate out, with spending boosted by extra government payments for those who have lost their jobs. The extra payments are set to run out at the end of this month. Spending at restaurants and bars jumped by one-fifth, but online and mail-order retail sales fell 2.4 per cent. Sales also dropped at building material and grocery stores. Retail sales had jumped by a record 18.2 per cent in May as businesses initially reopened after shutdowns that had lasted since mid-March to stem the spread of the virus. Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York, said the end of extra stimulus would hurt consumer spending at a time when coronavirus infections have surged forcing some states to reimpose restrictions such as business shutdowns. ""The road ahead for the consumer looks a little foggy and uncertain to say the least,"" he said. ""July spending faces the headwinds of states closing back down due to the second wave of the coronavirus. August spending is in doubt because those extra $US600 a week unemployment checks stop at the end of July."" The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell by 10,000 last week to 1.3 million, according to the US Labor Department. Continuing claims also dropped, but there are still 32 million people on jobless benefits. There were big increases in claims in California, Florida and Washington state, which have rising COVID-19 cases. Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics, said unemployment remained high because of a second wave of layoffs amid a second wave of coronavirus infections. ""The data are likely underestimating the true state of the labour market,"" he said. ""Firms are starting to warn there could be major layoffs in the months to come.""

382,Australian shares in the red; Dow gets a boost from COVID-19 vaccine progress,markets,"  US, European stocks rise on coronavirus vaccine progress but ASX falls The Australian share market has closed in the red after initially opening higher, with healthcare and utilities stocks dragging. The ASX 200 finished 0.7 per cent or 42 points lower at 6,010 points, after falling back below the 6,000 level during the session. The major miners and bank stocks weighed on the market, including BHP (-0.6 per cent), Rio Tinto (-1.4 per cent), ANZ (-0.9 per cent) and Westpac (-1 per cent). Healthcare stocks including CSL (-2.1 per cent), Avita Therapeutics (-5.1 per cent) and Fisher & Paykel Healthcare (-3.3 per cent) lost ground. Technology stocks Zip Co (-9.6 per cent), Afterpay (-1.1 per cent) and Altium (-1.3 per cent) also finished the session weaker. On the flipside, the best performers among the top 200 were Whitehaven Coal (+6.4 per cent), McMillan Shakespeare (+4.4 per cent) and Cooper Energy (+6.3 per cent). The Australian dollar fell to around 69.9 US cents by 4:55pm AEST, after Bureau of Statistics figures showed the unemployment rate had increased to 7.4 per cent in June. US stocks ended higher after promising early data for a potential COVID-19 vaccine and a strong quarterly report from Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs rose 1.4 per cent after it said its trading revenue doubled in the second quarter, driven by big swings in stock and bond markets since March. Moderna rallied 6.9 per cent after a small-scale study showed its experimental COVID-19 vaccine produced high levels of virus-killing antibodies. NAB's senior foreign exchange strategist, Rodrigo Catril, said there was more vaccine optimism out of the UK. ""The positive vaccine vibes were further boosted overnight after ITV's [UK TV Channel] Robert Peston said in a tweet that a University of Oxford’s vaccine trial will report 'positive news', adding that, 'The vaccine is generating the kind of antibody and T-cell (killer cell) response that the researchers would hope to see,'"" Mr Catril wrote in his morning market analysis. ""The tweet triggered a jump in AstraZeneca shares [5.5 per cent] and provided a broad-based boost of optimism across the market."" Travel and airline stocks also surged. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 228 points, or 0.9 per cent to 26,870 and the S&P 500 index gained 0.9 per cent to 3,227. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6 per cent to 10,550, with rises capped by Amazon, Netflix and Microsoft, which slipped from their recent record highs. Confidence was also boosted as the Federal Reserve's Beige Book survey showed an increase in economic activity for US businesses in early July as states eased restrictions to contain the coronavirus pandemic. However, Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker told a webinar the US had failed to control the virus and there remained a high level of uncertainty over the impact on the US economy as infections continued to rise. He predicted the US economy would shrink by 6 per cent in 2020, with real GDP growth slumping by one-fifth in the first half of the year, followed by growth of 13 per cent in the second half. European stocks rose, with the FTSE 100 index putting on 1.8 per cent to 6,293, the DAX in Germany increasing 1.8 per cent to 12,931, and the CAC 40 in Paris adding 2 per cent to 5,109. Brent crude oil rose 1.7 per cent to $US43.62 a barrel because of a sharp drop in US stockpiles. Spot gold rose modestly overnight and steadied at $US1,811 an ounce. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says the US will impose visa restrictions on Chinese firms such as Huawei, accusing them of facilitating human-rights abuses. Mr Pompeo said telecommunications companies around the world were on notice that if they dd business with Huawei, ""they are doing business with human-rights abusers"". The Secretary of State told a media conference the State Department would ""impose visa restrictions on certain employees of Chinese technology companies like Huawei that provide material support to regimes engaging in human-rights violations and abuses globally"". Earlier this week, the UK said Huawei equipment would be stripped from Britain's 5G network by the end of 2027. Huawei denies it spies for China. American Airlines is the latest carrier to warn staff about potential job losses as the coronavirus shuts down the global travel industry. The airline is sending 25,000 notices of potential stand-downs to frontline workers, around one-fifth of its workforce. It has also encouraged employees to take buyouts and early retirement packages so it can reduce the number of forced layoffs. US airlines are not allowed to cut jobs or pay until the start of October under conditions imposed to qualify for $US25 billion in federal payroll support.

383,ASX gains but growing concerns COVID-19 hit won't be short lived see consumer sentiment fall,markets,"  The Australian share market has risen strongly, led by gains for mining stocks, with the benchmark index pushing back above 6,000 points By 1:30pm (AEST), the ASX 200 was 1.2 per cent higher at 6,011 points. The All Ordinaries index had also gained 1.2 per cent, to 6,118. The Australian dollar had risen against the greenback (+0.2pc) and was buying around 69.9 US cents. The monthly survey from Westpac and the Melbourne Institute showed consumer sentiment deteriorated amid the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Melbourne. Sentiment fell back to the weak levels seen in May this month, but remained above the low point recorded in April. The index fell 6.1 per cent in July to 87.9, down from 93.7 in June. ""Victoria's sentiment index plunged 10.4 per cent in July but sentiment across the rest of the nation showed much milder declines,"" Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said. ""While milder, the weakness in other states is also likely to be linked to the outbreak in Victoria, reflecting concerns about the virus spreading interstate and spill-over effects on the wider economy."" People are feeling less confident about the outlook for the economy over the next 12 months, as well as over the next five years, suggesting growing concerns the virus impact will not be short lived. The Treasurer managed to admit Australia was in recession without ever uttering the word. But there are early signs we're already be emerging from the worst of the downturn. ""Certainly, the renewed outbreak points to a slower and more difficult path ahead for the foreign education, hospitality and tourism sectors, all of which may see longer-lasting restrictions even if the latest outbreak is successfully contained,"" Mr Evans said. The survey did not capture the impact of the recent COVID-19 cluster in Sydney. ""Consumer concern around the impact from the virus is dominating decent returns from equities and a higher Australian dollar which normally benefit consumer confidence,"" AMP Capital senior economist Diana Mousina noted. Ms Mousina said activity indicators such as mobility trackers would be important in assessing the broader impact of the Melbourne outbreak from here, and while other Australian cities had not yet seen a large drop in people's movement, there was a slight drop-off emerging in Sydney. ""Consumer confidence is likely to track changes in mobility from here given the concern households have around a second wave of COVID-19 spreading across Australia.  Expect more downside to confidence readings for now,"" she said. The major mining stocks were helping to lift the market, with gains for BHP (+1.9pc), Fortescue (+2.2pc) and Rio Tinto (+2.8pc). Gold mining stocks were also rising strongly after the price of the precious metal rose overnight. Shares in Silver Lake Resources (+4pc), Gold Road Resources (+2.8pc) and Northern Star Resources (+2.1pc) were all higher. Tech stocks in Australia and the US have not only recovered to pre-COVID highs, they have surpassed them. But some say the rally is reminiscent of the dot-com boom and bust. Analysts from Citi have cut their price target on Woodside Petroleum, in the wake of the company flagging impairment charges of $US4.37 billion ($6.3 billion). Woodside said the majority of the impairment related to, ""the significant and immediate reduction in oil and natural gas prices assumed up to 2025"". ""We've taken some tough decision over recent months in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and oversupply in our key markets, but Woodside's focus remains on cash preservation, capital discipline and maintaining the strength of our balance sheet,"" chief executive Peter Coleman said. Today, Woodside reported a 29 per cent fall in revenue for the last quarter, due the collapse in prices. After initially rising, Woodside shares fell 2.4 per cent to $20.90 and was among the worst performing stocks on the top 200. However, other energy stocks were making gains, including Santos (+2.2pc), Oil Search (+4pc) and Worley (+2.1pc) The technology sector was back on the rise, after leading the falls on the local share market yesterday. Afterpay shares rose by 3.1 per cent to $68.70 after it announced partnerships with Apple Pay and Google Pay in the US. Other tech stocks that were making gains included Appen (+2.4pc), Wisetech Global (+3pc) and Altium (+2.2pc). However, shares in Zip Co had fallen by 9.7 per cent, despite the buy now, pay later platform reporting a 72 per cent rise in quarterly revenue, compared to the same time last year. The company said it had increased its customer based to 2.1 million and now had 24,500 merchants on its platform. Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed more than 550 points higher. All 30 stocks on the US blue chip index finished higher, led by machinery manufacturing giant Caterpillar (+4.8pc) and energy companies Chevron (+3.5pc) and Exxon Mobil (+3.3pc). US bank stocks were mixed, after some reported their quarterly earnings to the market. Shares in JP Morgan Chase rose modestly (+0.6pc), after it beat estimates with its profit result but tipped a tough economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. On a teleconference, JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon noted that government and bank assistance is currently propping up borrowers and ""the recessionary part"" will come later. The bank saw revenue surge, driven by its trading business as record volumes went through financial markets during the past few months. Meantime, Wells Fargo shares fell by 4.6 per cent, after posting its first quarterly loss since 2008. Combined with Citigroup (-3.9pc), the banks set aside $US28 billion ($40 billion) to cover potential losses on bad loans due to coronavirus. The spot gold price rose to $US1809 an ounce, as investors bought safe haven assets as well as stocks. ""On days when stocks are up and gold is up, part of the story is the [US Federal Reserve] has made stocks attractive to investors, but there is apprehension that is driving up gold prices as well,"" Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, told Reuters.

384,"Energy stocks drag down ASX, tech rally fades",markets,"  Australian share market follows Wall Street lower, dragged down by energy stocks The Australian share market has closed in the red, after a rally in technology stocks petered out. The ASX 200 lost 0.6 per cent, or 36 points, to finish at 5,919 points. Energy was the worst-performing sector on the benchmark index, losing 1.9 per cent, with falls for Woodside (-2.4pc), Santos (-1.9pc) and Oil Search (-4.2pc). The major mining stocks were mostly lower, including Rio Tinto (-0.7pc), South32 (-2.4pc) and BHP (-0.7pc). Technology stocks had risen strongly in early trade, as Afterpay shares added to yesterday's gain. However, the rally faded in the afternoon, with stocks including Afterpay (-1.6pc), WiseTech Global (-3.5pc) and Doman (-2.2pc) falling. Buy now, pay later firm Zip Co continued to make gains and closed 8.1 per cent higher. The ASX 200 information technology index has still more than doubled, up 104 per cent, since its low on March 23. New Zealand telco Chorus was the worst-performing stock among the top 200, losing 7.5 per cent after announcing a drop in fixed-line connections due to coronavirus restrictions. Meanwhile, Telstra boss Andy Penn has told RN Breakfast the telco will have all its call centres back in Australia within two years. Telstra temporarily shut down its operations in the Philippines and India because of the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, customers have faced long delays in getting through to a customer service officer and have been forced to used the Telstra app. Mr Penn said call centres would be based in Australia by 2022, although with fewer staff. ""What's happened in COVID is we've seen a much more significant move to customers wanting to engage with us digitally, and that's going to enable us to reduce the number of calls coming into our call centres even further, to a point where we can bring that back onshore by the end of 2022,"" Mr Penn said. Telstra shares closed 0.3 per cent lower at $3.50. The Australian dollar fell steadily through the day and was 0.5 per cent weaker against the greenback, buying 69.3 US cents by 4:35pm AEST. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped to a near four-month low last week. Initial claims for state jobless benefits dropped 99,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.3 million for the week ended July 4. That brought new claims to their lowest level since mid-March, when non-essential businesses were shutdown to slow the spread of coronavirus. The number of people on unemployment benefits also dropped, with continuing claims falling to just over 18 million. Despite the better-than-expected numbers, it was the 15th week in a row initial claims were more than 1 million. However, the data could be skewed by the Independence Day holiday. Oil prices have slumped overnight, as the United States recorded its biggest daily increase in COVID-19 cases. The US saw more than 60,000 new COVID-19 infections ,setting a single-day global record, while Florida and Texas reported a record one-day increase in deaths. The restart of Libya's Messla oil field and a related refinery after technical problems also weighed on oil prices. West Texas crude oil fell 3.1 per cent to $US39.62 a barrel, while Brent crude slipped 2.2 per cent to $US42.38 a barrel. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Dow dropped as investors worried about another round of business shutdowns. However, the Nasdaq reached another record closing high, helped by gains in Amazon, Microsoft and Apple. It's the Nasdaq's fifth record closing high in six days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 361 points or 1.4 per cent to 25,706, the S&P 500 lost 18 points or 0.6 per cent to 3,152, while the Nasdaq Composite added 55 points or 0.5 per cent to 10,548. The benchmark S&P 500 is still up more than 40 per cent from its closing low on March 23. Investors have also started to focus on the second-quarter earnings season, which kicks off in force next week, with S&P 500 companies forecast to see a more than 40 per cent fall in earnings over the year. That would be the biggest quarterly profit drop since the 2008 financial crisis, according to financial services firm Refinitiv. Bank stocks fell after the news Wells Fargo was planning to cut thousands of jobs starting later this year. Shares in pharmaceutical firm Walgreens Boots Alliance dropped after it swung from a quarterly profit a year ago to a quarterly loss. The company wrote down $US2 billion at its UK chemist chain Boots due to coronavirus and also said it would sack 4,000 people. Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in the US, said expectations of a V-shaped recovery (a deep recession followed by a sharp recovery) could be pushed out. ""We're heading into earnings season, and you're seeing some troubling trends,"" he said. ""I expect a lot of confusing numbers and guidance. COVID is certainly not behind us in any way, shape or form, so maybe the V gets elongated some.""

385,"ASX rises as Afterpay hits fresh record, Treasury Wine shares fall on COVID-19 hit",markets,"  ASX rises as Afterpay shares hit a fresh record, Treasury Wine shares fall as COVID-19 hits earnings The Australian share market has closed higher, after shares in Afterpay led a rally among tech stocks, while mining and energy stocks also boosted the market. The ASX 200 index finished 0.6 per cent, or 35 points higher, at 5,955 points, coming off the highs of the session after approaching 6,000 points in afternoon trade. Mining and energy stocks led the broad-based rally, with shares in BHP (+2pc), Rio Tinto (+3.3pc), Woodside (+3.5pc) and Santos (+4.1pc) posting strong gains. Rio Tinto said more than 2,000 jobs would go in New Zealand, as it announced plans to close its aluminium smelter in the country because of high power prices. Technology stocks surged, led by buy-now, pay-later operators Afterpay (+11.4pc) and Zip Co (+10.4pc). Afterpay shares hit a fresh record high above $75 following an upgrade from Morgan Stanley, before closing at $73.50. Morgan Stanley analysts raised their price target on the stock to $101, saying the company's latest earnings were much stronger than expected. Shares in Treasury Wine Estates fell by 2.9 per cent to $10.95, after another profit warning from the winemaker. Treasury Wine said its core earnings for the 2020 financial year had fallen by 21 per cent, compared to the prior year, amid the coronavirus pandemic and travel restrictions. The company now expects earnings to come in between $530 million and $540 million, with a decline of 14 per cent in Asia, 37 per cent in the Americas and 16 per cent in Australia and New Zealand. Due to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, Treasury did not provide guidance for the 2021 financial year. Shares in ANZ, NAB and Westpac all rose by around 0.4 per cent, while Commonwealth Bank shares lost 0.2 per cent, after yesterday announcing loan repayment deferrals would be extended beyond September for some customers. The Australian dollar was slightly stronger against the greenback, buying around 69.9 US cents at 4:40pm AEST. New home loan commitments have tumbled during the coronavirus pandemic, but more people have refinanced their existing mortgages. Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) show the value of new home loan commitments fell by 11.6 per cent in May, its largest fall on record. However, a record number of existing borrowers refinanced their loans with different banks. NAB economist Tapas Strickland said people had taken the opportunity to switch to a lower interest rate. ""Fixed-rate home loans in Australia at the moment are at very low levels, in fact at record low levels,"" Mr Strickland said. ""Also, there is heightened competition in the home loan market at the moment, new loan approvals have fallen quite sharply, the banks are competing amongst themselves in the existing loan market as well."" The value of new loans to owner-occupiers declined by 10.2 per cent, including a 10.5 per cent drop in loans to first-home buyers. The fall in the value of loans to property investors was even steeper, down 15.6 per cent to its lowest level since November 2002. ""The decline in investor loan approvals took the market share of investor loans down to 25 per cent and that's below the lows seen during the [global financial crisis],"" Mr Strickland said. ""A key reason there is rental growth in Australia has come to a standstill … so the appeal for investors to get back into the market is not there."" The UK government has unveiled a multi-billion-dollar plan to help young people find jobs as part of a 54 billion pound mini-budget to counter the economic shock from the coronavirus pandemic. It announced a 2 billion pound ($3.6 billion) employment program and additional money for investment in training and apprenticeship schemes. UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said the plan will help young people aged between 16 and 24 on social security payments to find a six-month job placement. He also announced a short-term cut in sales tax for hospitality and tourism and an August ""eat out to help out"" discount scheme with the Government trying to encourage people to leave their homes and spend money. There was also an immediate cut in stamp duty on house purchases of up to £500,000, which will stay in place until the end of March next year and a 2 billion pound grant for ""green homes"". Shares in major UK construction firms jumped. Overall, the FTSE 100 came off its early lows and gained slightly as Mr Sunak announced the mini-budget, although it ended down 0.5 per cent at 6,156 points in a volatile session. In the US, stocks rose and the Nasdaq hit a record closing high as technology shares rallied amid signs of an economic rebound offsetting concerns about further coronavirus lockdowns. Apple hit a new record high and Microsoft provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 26,067, the S&P 500 gained 0.8 per cent to 3,169 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.4 per cent to 10,493. Biogen jumped after the company said it submitted the marketing application for its experimental Alzheimer's disease therapy. The market surge came despite the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US surpassing three million, affecting nearly one out of every 100 Americans. California, Hawaii, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma and Texas broke their previous daily record highs for new infections. Spot gold continued to climb above $US1,800 amid rising coronavirus cases globally. It rose to $US1,809 an ounce.

387,"analysis: With traditional car sales in 'permanent decline', Tesla is soaring to the top of the pile",markets,"  Tesla is the world's top carmaker on the back of a tech boost and huge Chinese sales It's a sign of the times. Electric car manufacturer Tesla became the world's most valuable carmaker last week, overtaking Toyota, despite never having made an annual profit. In the past 12 months, Tesla shares have surged over 400 per cent to reach a market value of $US210 billion ($302 billion). In July last year, its share price was $US233. Last week, it closed at $US1,208. According to the financial firm Refinitiv, Tesla is now trading at 69 times its estimated 2022 earnings. What's behind the eye-watering rally? If things had gone differently a century ago, we'd probably all be driving electric cars already. A broader improvement in the tech sector has helped. A report that Tesla sold 11,095 Shanghai-made Model 3 vehicles in China in May, more than triple the number sold in April, has helped too. But Tesla's financial update last week was the spur. It showed the company just achieved its best first quarter for production and deliveries in its history, despite the COVID-19 lockdowns. Long-term forecasts for demand for electric vehicles would also be very supportive because they're staggering. According to BloombergNEF, global sales of new cars with an internal combustion engine, which run on oil and diesel, peaked in 2017 and are ""in permanent decline"". But sales of electric vehicles are forecast to grow dramatically in the coming decades. It said electric vehicle sales could hit 10 per cent of global passenger vehicle sales by 2025, rising to 28 per cent in 2030 and 58 per cent in 2040. There's so much room for growth in electric vehicles it's hard to fathom — just like the scale of the global transition to renewable energy generally. In fact, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) released a report on the topic last month, telling the world to prepare for electric vehicles. It said a global transition was underway to decarbonise energy and transport systems, and as the importance of oil as a source of energy receded, demand for lithium-ion batteries would grow rapidly. This would create its own problems, it said, because the mining industries extracting the key materials needed for rechargeable batteries — lithium, graphite, manganese and cobalt — caused unique environmental and social consequences. Much of the material in your phone is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo — a nation with a long record of poorly enforced labour standards and child exploitation. It said there was an ""urgent need"" to address them to ensure the transition to a low-carbon energy system was done sustainably and ethically. But the bulk of the 72-page report was spent explaining the economics of battery manufacturing and supply chains. It dedicated one page to the social and environmental problems associated with lithium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the problems were serious. ""Most of the cobalt supplied to global markets originates from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), of which 20 per cent comes from artisanal mines where child labour and human rights issues have been identified,"" the report warned. ""Up to 40,000 children are estimated to be working in extremely dangerous conditions, with inadequate safety equipment, for very little money in the mines in Southern Katanga. ""The children are exposed to multiple physical risks and psychological violations and abuse, only to earn a meagre income to support their families."" That figure of 40,000 children came from a UNICEF report from eight years ago. Lauren Armistead, an Amnesty International researcher, told the ABC in 2018 the figure was probably a severe underestimate now, given the rise in global demand for cobalt since then. The UNCTAD report also failed to mention that tech companies have been put under scrutiny in recent years to clean up their supply chains. In December, for instance, five of the world's largest tech companies (Apple, Alphabet, Dell, Microsoft and Tesla) were accused in a federal class-action lawsuit filed in Washington DC of ""knowingly benefiting from, and aiding and abetting, the cruel and brutal use of young children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to mine cobalt"". It was the first lawsuit of its kind. It was filed on behalf of 14 Congolese families whose children were killed or maimed while mining cobalt supplied to those companies. An amended complaint was filed last month, with new details of the defendants' supply chain connections. That type of pressure for change has had an effect on tech and auto companies. It's hard to keep up with the mindset of Tesla's chief executive Elon Musk on the best of days, but in 2018 he said Tesla's next generation of batteries would contain no cobalt. Last month, Tesla's 2019 impact report explained how much effort the company had gone through recently to source ethical cobalt from the DRC. It said it supported sourcing from the DRC ""where we can be assured that minerals, including cobalt, are coming from mines that meet our social and environmental standards"". ""[But] our ultimate goal [is] to eliminate cobalt completely from our cells,"" it said. A senior adviser at the OECD in Paris, Tyler Gillard, was reported saying Tesla's disclosures were ""a positive step towards recognising the reality of copper and cobalt supply chains on the ground"". A week later, the Financial Times reported global mining giant Glencore, which has operations in Australia, had signed a deal with Tesla to supply cobalt from its mines in the DRC to Tesla's new Shanghai Gigafactory and Berlin plant. The Times said the deal would increase Tesla's reliance on cobalt from the DRC but would also allow Tesla to control supply from Glencore's mines to where the mineral was processed in China. The UNCTAD report mentioned none of this. It just said the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo recognised ""the issue of child labour"" and ""it is expected that by 2025 child labour will be eliminated from the mines"". Regarding lithium mining, the UNCTAD report focused on problems in South America. ""Indigenous communities that have lived in the Andean region of Chile, Bolivia and Argentina (which holds more than half the world's supply of lithium beneath its salt flats) for centuries must contend with miners for access to communal land and water,"" it said. ""The mining industry depends on a large amount of groundwater in one of the driest desert regions in the world to pump out brines from drilled wells. ""In Chile's Salar de Atacama, lithium and other mining activities consumed 65 per cent of the region's water. That is having a big impact on local farmers — who grow quinoa and herd llamas — in an area where some communities already must get water driven in from elsewhere."" It relied on a two-year-old article from Wired magazine for that information. When the UNCTAD report was released, some right-wing websites seized on it as proof of the disastrous environmental and social consequences of renewable energy. That's mining. It's a filthy business. There are attempts to limit the damage from mining: environmental, social and cultural. Think of the disasters that have plagued the oil and gas industries since their inception. Even recently, a report from Stakeholder Democracy Network (SDN), an international resource watchdog, found oil refineries in western Europe have been sourcing high-quality crude from the Niger delta, blending it with toxic chemicals to make high-sulphur fuels that exceed Europe's pollution limits by hundreds of times, and selling it back to Nigeria's poorly regulated market. That ""official"" fuel, which is sold in bowsers, is so toxic it's more polluting than unofficial black-market fuel sold in the country. Nigeria has some of the worst air pollution in the world. According to the State of Global Air database, it has recorded over 110,000 premature deaths annually for decades, attributable to air pollution. That's just one small story from the oil industry recently. One that barely made a ripple.

388,"ASX closes higher, Westpac admits to underpaying staff $8 million",markets,"  ASX closes higher, Westpac to repay staff $8 million in underpaid leave entitlements The Australian share market has closed higher but the major bank stocks were mixed, as Westpac admitted to underpaying staff. Westpac has blamed the underpayment of long-service-leave entitlements on ""some calculation errors"". The bank has pledged to repay approximately $8 million, including interest, to about 8,000 current and former staff, who will be contacted soon. Westpac said a payroll review also found some overpayment of long-service-leave entitlements, but it would not be asking anyone to repay that money. ""We apologise to anyone impacted by these errors and our priority is to make payments as soon as possible,"" Westpac executive Alastair Welsh said. ""We are putting in place measures to ensure employee long service leave is correctly calculated."" As a growing list of companies admit to underpayments, it can be months or years before workers receive any money owed. It's the latest in a slew of underpayments by major Australian companies, including Woolworths and Wesfarmers, as well as the ABC. Westpac shares finished lower (-0.4pc), as did shares in NAB (-0.9pc) and ANZ (-0.4pc), while the Commonwealth Bank managed to make a gain for the session (+0.7pc). The ASX 200 closed higher, after falling into the red midway through the session — the benchmark index gained 0.4 per cent to 6,057 points. The telco and technology sectors boosted the market, including shares in Telstra (+4pc) and WiseTech Global (+4.3pc). The healthcare sector also rose strongly, led by shares in hearing implant maker Cochlear, which added 5.9 per cent, making it the best-performing stock among the top 200. It followed Cochlear receiving US Food and Drug Administration approval for four of its products. On the flip side, shares in building-products company Adbri, which changed its name from Adelaide Brighton in May, tumbled by 25.4 per cent. It followed Adbri informing the market its subsidiary, Cockburn Cement, had lost a lime supply contract, which represented $70 million in annual revenue, from June next year. The Australian dollar gained ground, and was buying around 69.3 US cents by 4:45pm AEST. Retail turnover rose by a record 16.9 per cent in May, an even bigger rebound than preliminary figures had suggested, after a fall of 17.7 per cent in April. ""Volatility of this nature is unprecedented in the 38-year history of the retail trade survey. No prior period even comes close,"" Indeed economist Callam Pickering said. ""It is therefore difficult to interpret conditions across the retail sector and the damage caused by COVID-19."" The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) found large recoveries in clothing, footwear and accessory sales (+129.2pc), as well as cafes, restaurants and takeaway food (+30.3pc). As social distancing rules and fear kept people away from the shops, online sales have taken off and many analysts say a lot of consumers will not return in-store. However, the pick-up in sales in those industries came off large falls in April and remained well below the levels seen at the same time last year. ""The gradual easing of social distancing regulations and the reopening of physical stores bolstered retail trade in May,"" Ben James from the ABS said. ""Retailers across a range of industries reported high numbers of consumers returning to stores, with some retailers noting levels similar to those seen in December."" The reopening of stores also impacted the share of online sales, which accounted for 10.1 per cent of total retail turnover in May, down from 11.1 per cent in April but still well above the 6.2 per cent they accounted for in May last year. The US economy saw a record number of people hired last month as coronavirus restrictions were lifted across the country. America's unemployment rate fell to 11.1 per cent in June from 13.3 per cent in May as the economy reopened. The data show 4.8 million people were hired over the month, the biggest monthly gain on record, as bars and restaurants starting trading again. The labour force participation rate also rose to 61.5 per cent from 60.8 per cent as people resumed looking for work. However, average hourly earnings declined 1.2 per cent, unwinding some of April's 4.7 per cent gain. Overall, the numbers from the US Labor Department were much better than forecast by economists. Although, despite the hiring spree, the US labour market has still recovered only a fraction of the 22 million jobs lost in March and April. The survey was also conducted before a resurgence of coronavirus cases late last month which saw new shutdowns. That could bode badly for July, with surging COVID-19 cases in many US states and several states reversing or pausing reopening, leaving analysts worried about another sell-off in financial markets if the virus is not contained. On Thursday, Florida reported a record 10,000 new cases of the disease, worse than any European country reported at the peak of their outbreaks. Other figures showed claims for unemployment benefits rose 1.4 million last week, which was more than predicted. It is the 15th week in a row where initial claims remain above 1 million and more than 31 million Americans are still collecting weekly unemployment checks. Mike Bell, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management in London, said it was too early to say that the worst of the economic damage from the coronavirus was over. ""The strong rebound would normally be an unambiguously positive sign that a recovery is under way, (but) it is being accompanied by a sharp rise in new infections, which was what caused the collapse in the first place,"" he cautioned. ""It is therefore too soon to say for certain that this recovery in employment sounds the all-clear for investors."" The much better than expected employment numbers saw US stocks rise again with the tech focused Nasdaq closing at a new record high ahead of the July 4 Independence Day holiday The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 25,827, the S&P 500 gained 0.5 per cent to 3,130 and the Nasdaq Composite also added 0.5 per cent to 10,208. Most sectors rose on the S&P 500 with miners making the biggest percentage gains. Microsoft provided the biggest boost to the benchmark index and retained its top spot as the most globally invested in stock last month according to data from trading platform eToro. Tesla shares jumped a further 8 per cent to $US1,208.66 after the electric car maker's second quarter vehicle deliveries beat Wall Street estimates. The electric car maker delivered 90,650 vehicles during the quarter, above estimates of 74,130 vehicles, according to Refinitiv data. Stocks rose in Europe as well ahead of the US jobs report, with the FTSE 100 index up 1.3 per cent to 6,240, the DAX up 2.8 per cent to 12,608 and the CAC 40 adding 2.5 per cent to 5,049. The stock gains came despite a slight increase in unemployment in the eurozone from 7.3 per cent in April to 7.4 per cent in May. The job losses were worst among women and young people, with Eurostat estimating that 16 per cent of young people were jobless. Unemployment jumped in Italy in May, but fell sharply in France. Spot gold rose by 0.3 per cent to $US1,775 an ounce. Brent crude jumped 1.8 per cent to $US42.79 a barrel, boosted by the good US jobs numbers.

389,ASX rises strongly as Afterpay shares hit a fresh record,markets,"  The Australian share market rises strongly as Afterpay shares hit a fresh record The Australian share market has risen strongly, as the local technology index hits a fresh high, driven by a rise in Afterpay shares. The ASX 200 closed 1.7 per cent, or 98 points, higher at 6,032 points. The major bank stocks helped lift the market, led by a 2 per cent rise in ANZ shares. The ASX 200's information technology index rose 3.7 per cent to a record high, as shares in buy-now, pay-later company Afterpay surged, after Citi raised its price target on the stock. Shares in Afterpay closed 9.5 per cent higher at $68.16, a new high, while shares in competitor Zip Co gained 5.7 per cent. Elsewhere in the tech sector, shares in Appen (+3.1pc) and WiseTech Global (+6.2pc) rose strongly. Retailers were mostly stronger, led by shares in outdoor outlet Kathmandu (+9.3pc). In a market update, Kathmandu said retail store and online sales had ""generally exceeded management expectations"", since stores began reopening as coronavirus restrictions eased. The retailer said most of its stores were now reopen, with one exception being airport stores. With a number of Melbourne suburbs locked down due to rising cases of COVID-19, some businesses in affected areas have been forced to shut again and supermarkets have brought back limits on toilet paper purchases. However, economists at ANZ have looked at a number of different indicators and say they show that Victorians are still largely out and about, for now. ""Although infection numbers spiked quickly in Melbourne, the impact on behaviour appears limited at this stage,"" they said. Restaurant bookings in Victoria over the past week were down 17 per cent compared to the same time last year, but it was an improvement on the previous three weeks, which saw bookings around 36 per cent lower. ""Though the recovery in Victoria’s restaurant bookings lags the other states, the degree of lag didn’t materially increase through the latter half of June as Melbourne’s case numbers increased,"" an ANZ economist said. ""Melbourne CBD foot traffic on the weekend of June 27-28 showed no discernible difference compared to previous weekends in June."" Nationally, restaurant bookings have recovered faster than overseas, which ANZ economists said was indicative of Australians' desire to return to normal. However, it does appear people have reconsidered plans to travel to Melbourne — Google searches for 'Melbourne hotels' fell sharply last week, while searches for 'Sydney hotels' continued to rise. During the US session overnight, electric car upstart Tesla became the world's most valuable carmaker. Tesla shares rose 5 per cent to reach a market value of $US210 billion ($302 billion) overtaking Toyota Motor Corporation as the world's largest carmaker by market worth. Tesla shares have surged by 400 per cent over the past year and financial firm Refinitiv estimates that Tesla now trades at 69 times estimated 2022 earnings. By contrast, Toyota trades just below 10 times earnings for 2022. Tesla has never made an annual profit but it is a market leader in electric battery and storage technology. Shares in the electric vehicle maker hit a peak of $US1,134 as demand for electric vehicles continue to rise. However, Toyota sold around 30 times more cars last year and its revenues were more than 10 times higher. Even Tesla co-founder Elon Musk may not agree with the latest valuation. He wiped $US14 billion off Tesla's value in May after tweeting that its share price was too high. Shareholders have also been asked to vote to remove the eccentric Mr Musk from the board. London-based advisory firm Pensions & Investment Consultants said Mr Musk poses a ""serious risk of reputational harm"" to Tesla especially because of his Twitter rants. Meanwhile, Pizza Hut's largest US franchisee has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US, which allows it to trade its way out of trouble. NPC International operates more than 1,200 Pizza Huts and nearly 400 Wendy's restaurants. It is carrying a big debt load of around $US1 billion. The news comes despite the fast food giant reporting same-store sales growth in April and May, thanks to higher digital and delivery sales because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, analysts say Pizza Hut's owner Yum Brands could lose up to $US54.2 million in annual royalty revenue. The latest minutes from the US central bank meeting showed officials think the US economy will need support ""for some time"". Federal Reserve officials indicated they would provide more guidance in coming months on the future path of interest rates and bond purchases. They also considered reviving a Great Recession-era promise to keep interest rates low until certain conditions are met. The policymakers ""generally indicated support"" for tying interest rates to specific economic outcomes. A number were in support of a pledge to leave rates low until inflation meets or exceeds the Fed's target of 2 per cent. US stocks were mixed at the start of the third quarter as positive vaccine developments and better-than-expected manufacturing data offset concern over a jump in coronavirus cases. Stocks came off their highs after the US saw a record single-day spike in virus cases and rising infections in California, Arizona and Houston. California reintroduced some coronavirus restrictions by banning indoor activities at restaurants, cinemas and museums because of rising COVID-19 cases. The World Health Organization warned that some countries may have to reimplement severe restrictions, such as lockdowns, to stem the spread of the virus. Shares in pharmaceutical company Pfizer rose more than 3 per cent after the medical firm said it was developing a COVID-19 vaccine with German biotech firm BioNTech. Pfizer told the market it has seen early positive results. US-listed shares of BioNTech rose as much as 18.9 per cent before fading into the close and losing almost 4 per cent of its value. Fed Ex jumped 11.7 per cent after posting better than expected quarterly profit and revenue, helped by a surge in pandemic driven home deliveries. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 25,735, weighed down by aircraft maker Boeing. The S&P 500 gained 0.5 per cent to 3,116 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1 per cent to 10,155. The S&P 500 closed off its best quarter since 1998 on Tuesday, fuelled by unprecedented levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus. In economic news, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity jumped to a reading of 52.6 last month from 43.1 in May, ending three months in a row of contraction, or readings below 50. The ADP National Employment Report showed US private payrolls increased by nearly 2.4 million jobs, less than expected in June. The latest US job figures are out tonight, a day early due to Friday's July 4 Independence Day holiday, with analysts generally expecting the unemployment rate to fall from 13.3 per cent in May to 12.5 per cent in June, according to Westpac economists.

390,Market manager 'lectured about 5G' as tourists flout social distancing rules,markets,"  Residents of a popular regional Victorian town say tourists are putting them at risk by ignoring social distancing recommendations. Town officials are worried that the local health system is not equipped to handle a COVID-19 outbreak Visitors to the Daylesford Sunday Market, in the state's west, drew the ire of locals, who were quick to air their concerns on social media. Market manager Raoul Benedict said the photos made matters look worse than they were, but admitted that 10 per cent of people coming to the market still seemed ""to think [COVID-19] is just a joke"". ""During the actual lockdown when we were running as an essential items market,"" Mr Benedict said. ""It was beautiful. ""We had mainly local people coming and it was amazing — they weren't standing one and a half metres apart, they were standing two metres apart, and they would shop quickly. ""Now the problem is 90 per cent of people will distance, but then there's always 10 per cent … that want to hang around. ""I spend my day walking around telling people to distance and sanitise. ""[On Sunday] there were people sitting on clearly taped-off seats … and I told them, 'Sorry, you can't sit down at the market' — and you know what they said to me? ""'Oh it's all the 5G technology'. ""And I got a little lecture about the 5G technology and that I'm exaggerating things. ""Ninety per cent get it and they do [socially distance], but there's this 10 per cent that think, 'Oh nah, it's all a hoax'. ""We would be much happier if people just stayed home for a bit longer."" Hepburn Shire Mayor Licia Kokocinski said locals were ""very concerned … that people appeared to be ignoring social distancing"". ""I think we're all exasperated,"" Cr Kokocinski said. ""We really do value our tourists and our visitors, but there's got to be a quid prop quo here. ""They've got to give a bit as well, and that means observing social distancing, not touching things unnecessarily, keeping in a queue when asked, keeping hand sanitisers in your pocket."" Cr Kokocinski said she would be speaking with council directors about what to do. Closing the market was an option, she said. ""That is a big call, we need to be guided by the experts on this,"" she said. ""We will be reviewing that. ""We have to leave it to people's sense of responsibility to other human beings to be self aware and not travel. ""If that's not happening … we'll need to reconsider. ""If there are people coming from those hotspots, we are very concerned. ""We do not have the health services or the infrastructure in place to treat people if we have a serious outbreak."" Central Highlands Rural Health medical director Sophie Ping said the scene at the Sunday markets was ""a little bit frightening"". ""A lot of the groups that come to the market, for example, are small family groups and they're essentially isolating with each other, but it's very difficult for us to tell who is actually isolating within the family groups and who isn't,"" she said. ""We have our staff working out in the communities on the weekends and potentially, if they become infected, they will bring that back into the health services, which is really concerning for us. ""We love having people visit and support our communities, but we don't know what they're bringing with them.""

391,analysis: The glory days are over,markets,"  For years, customers have been paying for bank decisions designed to reward shareholders. Think fees and higher interest rates. Now, thanks to coronavirus, analysts say just about every bank stakeholder is worse off. It all relates back to the banks' basic business model — lending money out at higher rates than what's paid to depositors. It's been challenged like never before by record low interest rates. An average credit card rate of 16 per cent, according to Mozo, is helping drive profits to a degree, but the mega pre-COVID profits aren't likely to return for years, if ever. That may sound like a hyperbole, but it's not. In an unusually frank admission, NAB chief executive Ross McEwan told Nine newspapers on Monday that the days of investors enjoying an impressive 15 per cent return every year are over. His exact phrasing was around the fact the bank wouldn't produce an ROE (Return on Equity) — which is a proxy investors use to work out what rate of return they might receive if they bought shares in the NAB — of 15 per cent again. Put another way, if you buy NAB shares, you'll be lucky to receive double-digit investment returns for the foreseeable future. The NAB has its own problems — a heavier reliance on business banking, and a disastrous push into the United Kingdom — but it's also dealing with some broader banking challenges. That is, there's only so much more the big four banks can cut deposit rates and the coronavirus economic crisis remains a constant threat to the quality of their assets (houses). Banks can no longer generate the sorts of profits to which their shareholders have become accustomed. This wouldn't be an issue, except for the fact that the big four banks' profitability — which they've repeatedly used to justify raising interest rates in the past — affects every working Australian with superannuation. Here's a scary thought: when we report big stock market movements up and down, there's a strong chance it's because the banks' share prices, in unison, have moved up or down by a few percentage points. The big four banks' influence on the stockmarket's benchmark index, the ASX200, is enormous. There's an economic consensus that the Government should borrow and spend at least part of the $60 billion JobKeeper shortfall to prevent a double-dip recession later this year. Banking analyst Martin North says roughly 40 per cent of the ASX's returns are from the finance sector and roughly half of superannuation funds are exposed to Australian equities (shares). ""A significant fall in returns in the banking sector overall, that means super funds are going to receive a significant dent in their returns. ""This is a big deal. ""We really have been relying on the finance sector to prop up the superannuation system. So this has a very significant knock-on affect beyond the bank itself."" Dr Shane Oliver heads up investment strategy for AMP Capital — making decisions every day on where to allocate tens of billions of dollars. He agrees with North that superannuation returns will be lower now for the foreseeable future. He's just not as pessimistic as North. ""The typical superannuation fund might have, say, a 7 per cent exposure to Australian banks and that can translate to a lower return from superannuation funds,"" Oliver says. Share markets around the world have shown remarkable resilience in recent months — including in Australia. There's much scepticism that it's only a matter of time before shares come crashing down again but, for now, they're well above their March lows. The problem though is that even when stocks do return close to pre-COVID-19, they're not expected to grow at double-digit growth rates. Property, bonds and term deposits are all in the same boat. Oliver says, simply, that investors all around the world need to get used to the idea of low investment returns, indefinitely. ""The reality is that we have come into a much lower return world for investments generally. ""Obviously we're in recession at the moment but the recovery will be relatively restrained,"" Oliver says. Bank investors are having a rough ride. There remain on-going bad debt charges — which could soar if we don't learn how to abseil down the September ""economic cliff"" — but we're also staring at ultra-low interest rates, and dividends have been slashed. Toilet paper almost kept us out of recession, even as the economy went down the drain, explains Ian Verrender. But it could, as always, be far worse. At the heart of McEwan's admission on Monday was an attempt to re-adjust expectations. A bank can deliver a huge profit, but if it falls short of expectations, the stock price will dive. Humans enjoy being pleasantly surprised. The flipside is that we find bitter disappoints especially painful. Mr McEwan saw low returns as far as the eye could see, but admitting it, publicly, speaks to how long the legacy of coronavirus will last. It's now time to acknowledge that, in some cases, the economic changes will be permanent. Better to know that now.

392,"Australian share market in the red, travel stocks lead falls",markets,"  The Australian share market has ended the session in the red, but off its lows, amid concerns about rising coronavirus cases globally and in Victoria. The benchmark ASX 200 index closed 1.5 per cent lower, at 5,915 points, after dropping more than 2 per cent during the session. By 4:30pm AEST, the Australian dollar was 0.4 per cent higher against the greenback, around 68.9 US cents. The major bank stocks finished lower, with NAB shares losing 1.6 per cent, while shares in Bank of Queensland fell 3.4 per cent. Energy was one of the worst-performing sectors, as oil prices declined — Brent crude had fallen 2 per cent to $US40.19 a barrel. Shares in Santos (-3.1pc), Beach Energy (-5.6pc), Origin Energy (-4.4pc) and Worley (-4.8pc) closed lower. Travel stocks continued to decline sharply, including Flight Centre (-5pc), Helloworld (-7.2pc) and Webjet (-5.3pc), as well as Qantas (-5pc). Airlines have been among the hardest hit by the coronavirus recession, but the swingeing cuts at Qantas carry a warning for the whole economy. However, shares in airline Regional Express (Rex) surged by 17 per cent, after it confirmed plans to launch flights between Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane next year, which would see it compete with Qantas and a likely scaled-down Virgin Australia. Rex's board has approved plans to raise $30 million to fund the expansion, which will include an initial fleet of five to 10 narrow-body jet aircraft based out of Sydney or Melbourne. Rex, which normally services 60 destinations nationally, began to increase flights earlier this month as travel restrictions eased and rival QantasLink increased services on some routes where the two airlines are in competition. Shares in Sydney Airport fell 1.8 per cent, as RBC Capital Markets projected that international passenger numbers will not recover to 2019 levels until 2024, with domestic tipped to recover by 2023. RBC Capital Markets analyst James Nevin does not expect Sydney Airport to pay a dividend to shareholders for 18 months. Sydney Airport is usually Australia's busiest international gateway, but during the coronavirus pandemic it stands empty and desolate. Take a rare look behind the scenes. Telecommunications was the only sector to rise, as shares in TPG (+0.5pc) and Vodafone's part-owner Hutchison Telecoms (+5.7pc) made gains, before shares in the new, combined company known as TPG Telecom are added to the stock exchange tomorrow. The merger between Vodafone and TPG was approved by the Supreme Court of New South Wales on Friday, after TPG shareholders approved the deal earlier in the week. The falls on the local share market followed heavy losses in the US on Friday, with the Dow Jones losing 2.8 per cent. ""Global equity screens were a sea of red on Friday,"" St George economist Nelson Aston said. ""Investors reassessed the prospects of a speedy recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the US."" Yesterday, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases globally passed 10 million, with the death toll now standing at more than half a million people. Locally, the sharp upward trend in coronavirus case in Victoria continued, with 75 new cases identified overnight. Stock markets around the region were mostly lower, including Tokyo's Nikkei (-2.3pc) and Seoul's Kospi (-1.9pc), but New Zealand's market was 1.1 per cent higher. A survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has found that while Australians plan to increase spending in some areas as restrictions ease, such as eating out and recreation, other spending will remain at lower levels. The survey, conducted in mid-June, found that people who had reduced their spending on household furnishings, clothing and footwear during the coronavirus crisis expected to continue spending lower amounts on these items. During the initial lock-downs 87 per cent of people had spent less on eating at cafes, restaurants, pubs and bars, but 74 per cent of those now expected to increase their spending on eating out again. ""This survey showed us a mixed picture of what Australians plan to spend their money on once restrictions ease,"" ABS head of household surveys Michelle Marquardt said. While 55 per cent of people said they intend to go on a domestic holiday once travel restrictions lift, less than a third said they intend to go on an international trip.

393,"Banking surge leads ASX higher, Qantas shares fall",markets,"  Bank stocks lead rally on ASX and Wall Street, Qantas shares fall The Australian share market has risen strongly, with banks leading the rally following strong gains for financial stocks on Wall Street overnight. By the close of trade, the ASX 200 was 1.5 per cent higher at 5,904 points. The major banks were all up by more than 2 per cent, with the strongest gains made by Westpac (+3.3pc), followed by ANZ (+3pc), NAB (+2.7pc) and the Commonwealth Bank (+2.4pc). The rise in Westpac shares came as the Federal Court dismissed an appeal by the corporate regulator ASIC, finding that Westpac did not breach responsible lending laws in making around 262,000 home loans between 2011 and 2015. Qantas shares returned to trade after completing a $1.36 billion share placement to institutional investors. The airline's shares slumped, down 9.1 per cent to $3.81, after raising the capital as part of its plan to deal with the coronavirus fallout, which included slashing 6,000 jobs. However, the airline's share price remained above the discounted price of the new shares, which was set at $3.65. Elsewhere in the airline sector, Virgin Australia's administrators have entered a sale agreement with Bain Capital, after rival bidder Cyrus Capital Partners withdrew its offer. The Australian dollar was buying around 68.8 US cents. Global markets rose overnight, with bank stocks leading the gains on Wall Street, as regulators eased some restrictions imposed on the sector in the wake of the global financial crisis. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 300 points, following a surge in late trade, despite the continued rise of coronavirus cases in the US. The energy and financials sectors led the broader S&P 500 index higher, after oil prices rebounded. Bank stocks rose, including JP Morgan Chase (+3.5pc), Bank of America (+3.8pc), Citigroup (+3.7pc) and Wells Fargo (+4.8pc). It followed US banking regulators unveiling new rules, overhauling the 'Volcker rule' imposed after the GFC, which restricted banks' riskier investment activity. The changes included making it easier for banks to invest in funds including hedge funds and venture capital funds, and easing the requirement for banks to put aside funds to protect against derivatives trades made between affiliates of the same firm. When lobbying for the changes, the industry estimated they would free up as much as $US40 billion in previously reserved cash. Shares in Disney fell for a second day, as it delayed the reopening of some of its theme parks as coronavirus cases continued to rise. US firms continued to lay off workers last week, with weekly jobless claims totalling 1.48 million. It was a modest improvement on the number of claims last week, but the Commonwealth Bank's head of international economics Joseph Capurso described it as still ""extremely high"". ""Before the recession a reading of above 400,000 was considered high,"" he said.

394,ASX struggles for direction as tech rally fizzles out,markets,"  Australian shares struggle for direction as technology rally fizzles out The Australian share market was struggling and directionless for most of the day, despite strong gains across US and European markets. The ASX 200 lifted by 0.2 per cent to close at 5,966 points on Wednesday. After jumping in early trade, slipping at midday, and trading sideways for much of the afternoon, the benchmark index still managed to finish higher for its fourth day in a row. Technology stocks were initially the star performers, but gradually ran out of steam. Afterpay jumped to a record high ($62.09) in the morning, but ended 0.6 per cent higher at $59.51. Investors piled into Afterpay after the company announced it had attracted more than 1 million shoppers to its buy, now pay later service in the United Kingdom, where it is trying to aggressively expand. The best-performing tech stocks were Nearmap (+4.3pc), NextDC (+3.2pc) and Appen (+2.3pc). Several of the best performers were gold miners such as Evolution Mining (+6.7pc), Northern Star Resources (+4.9pc) and Gold Road Resources (+4.7pc). This was after the precious metal's spot price jumped overnight to its highest value in about seven years — usually a sign that investors are feeling nervous about the economy. Energy stocks were a drag on the broader market, including Oil Search (-3.2pc) and Viva Energy (-3.7pc). Most bank stocks fell, including ANZ (-0.8pc), NAB (-0.6pc) and Westpac (-0.3pc), while shares in CBA were modestly higher (+0.3pc). The Council of Financial Regulators issued its quarterly statement, urging the banks to continue to assist customers struggling to pay their debts once the current period of loan deferrals winds down later in the year. ""Members agreed that financial institutions, regulators and governments will need to continue to show flexibility in order to support the objectives of economic recovery, resilience of financial institutions, and fair household and business outcomes,"" it said. The council also noted the large capital buffers the banks had built up and said they ""ought to be used during this extreme shock"". ""Members encourage institutions to make use of their capital buffers to continue to support businesses and households,"" it said. The council, which includes the Reserve Bank, corporate regulator ASIC, prudential regulator APRA and Treasury, said it had been meeting more frequently over the past few months to coordinate the response to the coronavirus crisis. A survey from the Bureau of Statistics found two-thirds of Australian businesses saw their revenue take a hit due to COVID-19. Of those that saw revenue decline, almost a third said it had fallen by 50 per cent or more. Almost half of the businesses surveyed did not think they would have enough cash on hand to last more than six months under current conditions. Sixty per cent of businesses had sought advice on how to handle the crisis, including from banks, lawyers, accountants and government agencies, with most seeking advice about government support measures and regulation. The Australian dollar jumped above 69.6 US cents in the morning — after Moody's reaffirmed Australia's AAA credit rating and kept its outlook for the rating at ""stable"". However, it slipped to 69.4 US cents by 4:30pm AEST, which was still a modest 0.2 per cent gain. ""The stable outlook reflects Moody's expectation that downside risks to the credit profile are contained by the underlying resilience of the economy and Australia's effective policy-making institutions,"" the global ratings agency said. ""In Moody's assessment, the resilience of the Australian economy supports a return to positive growth next year, without any significant long-lasting impact on growth potential once the crisis passes."" While Fitch and S&P have both also kept a AAA credit rating for Australia, those agencies downgraded their outlook to 'negative' in recent months. The local currency was particularly strong against the New Zealand dollar, up 0.7 per cent to $1.074. This was after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand kept official interest rates on hold at the record low 0.25 per cent, which is exactly the same level set by Australia's central bank earlier this year. The RBNZ also pledged to support its economy by continuing its quantitative easing, or (colloquially) its ""money-printing"" program. Global markets rose overnight, as some improved economic indicators boosted investor hopes of a recovery from the current downturn. In Europe, the major markets ended strongly higher, after a measure of services and manufacturing activity in the eurozone came in better than expected. While output and demand were still falling, it was at a much slower pace than the collapse seen in previous months. The IHS Markit composite purchasing managers' index (PMI), which measures activity in both manufacturing and services, recovered to 47.5 in June, compared to 31.9 in May and a record low of 13.6 in April. A similar trend was seen in the US data, with the manufacturing and services PMIs both showing the smallest contraction in four months. Capital Economics senior markets economist Oliver Jones said the data indicated the world's largest economies were on the road to recovery. ""Activity is still well short of pre-crisis levels in most cases, but crucially appears to have recovered substantially from its mid-April lows as lockdown measures have gradually been relaxed,"" he said. However, coronavirus cases continued to rise in the US, with a surge in infections in states including Texas, Florida and Arizona. ""In our view, the US economic recovery will not be materially impacted by an increase in coronavirus cases, unless many states reimpose lockdowns,"" Commonwealth Bank currency strategist Kim Mundy said. On Wall Street, the Nasdaq closed at another record high, while the Dow Jones gained half a per cent. Apple shares gained more than 2 per cent, adding to gains made in a strong session yesterday following its developers conference. The positive session on Wall Street followed a recovery in US stock market futures yesterday, after comments from a White House adviser sent markets tumbling. Trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox News the trade deal between Washington and Beijing was ""over"", prompting Donald Trump to tweet that the deal was still ""fully intact"", leading to a recovery for stocks in Australia, around Asia and in US futures.

397,"Volatility hits ASX, Australian dollar as Trump adviser spurs confusion on US-China trade deal",markets,"  Australian dollar, ASX swings after Trump adviser Navarro says China trade deal 'over' Volatility hits global stock markets, including the Australian market, as a White House adviser says the US-China trade deal is ""over"", before Donald Trump takes to Twitter to clarify it is still intact. The ASX 200 had opened strongly higher but fell by around 1 per cent mid-morning, with all sectors of the market turning negative, while the Australian dollar also reversed course. It followed a 1.3 per cent fall in US stock market futures, after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox News the trade deal between Washington and Beijing was ""over"". He said the ""turning point"" was the fact that Chinese officials did not inform the US about the spread of coronavirus when they signed the deal in mid-January. Markets around the region pulled back, including in New Zealand, Japan and South Korea. However, reports Mr Navarro was trying to back-pedal from the comments saw stocks regain ground. US President Donald Trump tweeted that the deal was ""fully intact"". By the close of trade, the ASX 200 was 0.2 per cent higher at 5,954 points. The Australian dollar had risen to about 69.25 US cents, close to its earlier highs, after falling as low as 68.6 cents in mid-morning trade. Technology stocks remained mixed after being caught up in the sell-off. AMP was among the best performers, with its shares up by 7.9 per cent, after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand cleared the way for the sale of AMP's life insurance division. The RBNZ had blocked the initial $3.3 billion deal last year, but today AMP said the revised deal had now received all regulatory approvals and it expected it to be finalised on June 30. Woolworths shares were down by 0.8 per cent, after the supermarket giant revealed the cost of repaying underpaid workers had blown out to $390 million, up from its initial estimate of $300 million last year. Woolworths has also flagged redundancies at its distribution centres in Minchinbury and Yennora in New South Wales and Mulgrave in Victoria, as it plans to develop two new automated centres at Moorebank in Sydney. It said the estimated cost of the redundancies would be $176 million, contributing to $591 million in significant items the company will book in its full-year results. The corporate regulator has launched another legal case against the Commonwealth Bank, claiming it made banned payments for the sale of superannuation. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is suing CBA and its subsidiary Colonial First State Investments Limited (CFSIL) in the Federal Court, alleging the investment arm paid more than $22 million in conflicted remuneration to the bank for distributing a superannuation product, Essential Super, through branches and online. The interpretation of the word ""could"" when it comes to conflicted payments might put a lot of financial planners out of business, and better protect their clients, writes Andrew Robertson. The regulator has alleged the arrangement between CBA and CFSIL breached the law because it could reasonably be expected to influence the choice of product recommended by CBA and the advice given to clients. Around 390,000 people signed up to Essential Super under the arrangement, which saw CBA receive 30 per cent of the revenue earned by the fund's trustee. The case was referred to ASIC by the banking royal commission, after commissioner Kenneth Hayne found it would be surprising if the payments did not influence which products branch staff recommended. In a statement to ASX late yesterday, CBA said it was reviewing the claims. US stocks rose overnight, with the Dow Jones gaining more than 150 points as investors overlooked the rising numbers of coronavirus cases and focused on the potential for more government stimulus. Thousands of Australians stranded at home due to COVID-19 have started trying to make money playing the share market. But the regulator warns the lure of easy profits comes with big risks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index climbed 1.1 per cent to set a record closing high. Apple announced it would switch to using its own chips in its Mac computers instead of chips made by Intel and unveiled new software at its annual developers conference. The market received the chip announcement well and it overshadowed the news Apple would temporarily close nearly a dozen retail stores in the US due to a spike in local COVID-19 cases — Apple shares rose 2.6 per cent. However, travel stocks continued to decline, including cruise operators and airlines. Economic data showed further weakness, with US home sales falling to their lowest level in more than nine-and-a-half years last month. Existing home sales dropped by 9.7 per cent in May. ""The weakness reflected ongoing social-distancing measures and the gradual nature of lifting the lockdown,"" ANZ senior economist Felicity Emmett said. ""However, the more recent rise in home loan applications suggest housing market activity was picking up again."" US mortgage applications surged to an 11-year high last week. ""Home sales may bounce with pent-up demand following the shutdown of the economy starting in March, but the massive scale of job losses and cautious consumers rebuilding their savings may limit sales,"" Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York, told Reuters.

398,"Banks, miners rise but travel stocks take a hit",markets,"  Australian share market ends little changed as fears of second wave of coronavirus hit travel stocks The Australian share market has finished little changed, after fears of a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic saw travel stocks fall. After opening lower, the benchmark ASX 200 index pushed into positive territory midway through the session. However, it pulled back from its highs to end just 0.03 per cent, or nearly two points higher, at 5,944 points. The All Ordinaries index fell by three points to 6,058. The major bank stocks rebounded after a mixed performance in early trade, with ANZ (+1.2pc), Commonwealth Bank (+1.1pc), NAB (+0.5pc) and Westpac (+0.5pc) all finishing higher. Mining stocks rose strongly, including South32 (+3.3pc) and gold miners Saracen Mineral (+8.5pc), Silver Lake Resources (+6.4pc) and St Barbara (+6pc). Shares in cement maker James Hardie rose 7.3 per cent after it lifted its forecasts for profit margins in its North American business. ""In North America, housing market activity has steadily improved during the past seven weeks despite the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the company's chief executive Jack Truong said. Shipbuilder Austal was the best-performing stock on the benchmark index, with its shares rising 9.5 per cent after it secured $US50 million in funding from the US Government, which will be used to increase construction capacity. However, travel and consumer stocks were hit hard amid growing concerns about a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Webjet (-5pc), Corporate Travel Management (-5pc) and Flight Centre (-4.1pc) fell heavily, as did retailers including Myer (-4.1pc), Kathmandu (-1.7pc) and Harvey Norman (-1.7pc). Over the weekend, the state of emergency was extended in Victoria and residents of several hotspots in the state were told to stay home. Shares in software company Altium slumped 7.6 per cent after it downgraded its revenue guidance due to the rising number of coronavirus cases in parts of the US and new lockdowns in Beijing. Altium has temporarily closed its Beijing office, with staff working remotely. ""China is a key growth driver for [Altium] — we will cautiously watch any 'second wave' in Beijing and its impact on lockdowns and [printed circuit board] manufacturing,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Garry Sherriff said. On Wall Street on Friday, the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 closed lower, while the Nasdaq ended fairly flat, as several US states posted record numbers of new COVID-19 cases. The Australian dollar rose and by 4:35pm AEST it was 0.4 per cent higher against the greenback at about 68.6 US cents. The rise in the local currency followed comments from Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe, who said while he would prefer a lower dollar, it was hard to argue that it was overvalued at the moment. ""We need to remember that exchange rates are relative prices, and health outcomes in Australia have been relatively good, and the economic outcomes so far have been relatively good,"" he said.

US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell wrapped up two days of congressional testimony promising more economic support The local currency fell to 68.4 US cents shortly after the employment numbers were released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. But the dollar then came off its lows to reach 68.75 US cents by 4:39pm (AEST). The ASX 200 index closed down 0.9 per cent at 5,937, but had been off around 1.5 per cent earlier in the day. Consumer, telco and mining businesses led the losses, with all sectors except utilities in the red. Telecoms firm Vocus dropped by 6.25 per cent to $3.00. A fall in iron ore prices led to big mining companies BHP and Rio Tinto losing around 1 per cent of their value. This followed Brazilian mining company Vale's announcement that it would restart production at mines shuttered by coronavirus. Qantas shares are lower after it cancelled all international flights until late October. Ship builder Austal rose 3.7 per cent to $3.36 after it said its contract with the US Department of Defense to build warships had been extended. Employment website Seek said the employment market may have turned a corner in May. Job vacancies advertised on Seek rose by 39.7 per cent over the month, however employment ads are down by half over the year to May. The number of job openings for hospitality and tourism workers more than doubled over the month as the economy slowly reopened from coronavirus restrictions. All states had an increase in monthly job ads, with Tasmania and South Australia enjoying employment openings up by more than half. Seek managing director Kendra Banks said the easing of coronavirus restrictions had seen employers bring workers back on. ""We continued to see promising signs within the employment market during May, with all states and most industry sectors showing positive month-on-month job ad growth,"" Ms Banks said. US stocks ended mixed in a volatile session amid rising coronavirus infections in North America and globally. Record spikes in new cases were reported in six US states, according to Reuters, and authorities in Beijing increased restrictions on freedom of movement to contain a new COVID-19 outbreak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ultimately fell after slipping in and out of positive territory, ending three days of gains. The Dow lost 170 points, or 0.65 per cent, to 26,120, and the S&P 500 lost 0.4 per cent to 3,113.

400,analysis: The secret behind the booming stock market,markets,"  Forget everything you've ever learned about the economy and the supposed link with financial markets. Just three months into what the Bank of England describes as the deepest and sharpest downturn in centuries and stock markets are on a tear, galloping back towards record levels at breakneck speed. One year can be hard to distinguish from the next in a typical business cycle, but it's different in a crisis. That’s why each piece of new economic data released this week will be important, writes Gareth Hutchens. Investors, many of them new converts to the cargo cult, are overlooking the hit to corporate earnings that has yet to play out, the potential housing market slump and spending blow from a lengthy period of elevated unemployment or the many geo-political risks building, particularly between China and the West. Instead, they are pricing in a swift and almost perfect recovery based upon the presumption that maybe, just maybe, there'll be a vaccine that will suddenly rid the world of the pandemic that has created so much pain and hardship in such a brief space of time. Or maybe, the whole thing is just an illusion. For when it comes to finance, free markets have become captive to central banks, which now are pouring trillions of dollars into the global economy each month to fabricate a recovery. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic It's cash that's being created out of thin air. And a huge portion of it is being poured straight into stock markets regardless of what is happening out there in the real world. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic On Thursday night, Jerome Powell, the head of America's central bank, made no bones about where he saw the American economy heading. The dire picture he painted, a future where millions of Americans would never get their jobs back, included predictions that unemployment would be sitting at around 9.3 per cent at the end of this year and 6.5 per cent by the end of next year. The economy would take years to recover, he told them. For anyone who has been following global events, it wasn't exactly a revelation. But it sent shivers through the investment world. His message served as a reality check from the past two months of frenzied share trading that has seen American tech stocks regain their record levels and pushed global stocks into the strongest bull run in history. Wall Street, having erased all its losses for the year, plunged almost 7 per cent. But the pessimism was short-lived. By Friday night, it was back to business as punters regained much of the previous night's lost ground. Here's why. So intense was the economic downturn, which has seen US unemployment go from its best in 50 years to its worst in 90 years in the space of two months, Mr Powell warned that the Fed wasn't thinking about raising rates. ""We're not even thinking about thinking about raising rates,"" he added for good measure. And then he included the magic words. ""What we're thinking about is providing support for this economy. It could take some time."" That was the not-so-subtle message that the money was going to keep on flowing at record pace. The graph above tells the story. In the past few months, America's central bank has bought more than $US3 trillion ($4.37 trillion) worth of ""assets"". These include US government debt, mortgage debt and other debt securities, using cash it has generated out of thin air, simultaneously driving interest rates down and flooding the economy with cash. It has spent more than double the amount outlaid at the height of the global financial crisis. And, it appears, we've only just begun. Once upon a time, the Fed used to see itself as the great moderator. Its role, according to one-time boss William Chesney Martin Jr back in the 1950s, was to provide enough punch to get the party going and then remove it just when things were warming up. These days, central banks around the world have found themselves trapped by their own creation. Having gone too far warming up the party, no-one really wants the pain associated with the extended hangover. So it's been a policy of hair of the dog for at least the past 20 years. That's because when stock markets turn south, people lose money and stop spending. When they collapse, as they did in March, they now have the power to take the economy with them. For most of the past half-century, central banks have been content to rely upon interest rates to speed up or slow down economic momentum. But with rates now at zero, money printing — or quantitative easing as it is called in polite circles — is all they have left. Toilet paper almost kept us out of recession, even as the economy went down the drain, explains Ian Verrender. Unless of course they head into negative interest rate territory, where few are willing to venture. We've arrived fairly late at the party. But a few months back, our very own Reserve Bank was forced to do the same. It waded into the financial markets and bought about $50 billion worth of Australian government debt in a bid to massage interest rates lower. Again, it was because Australian interest rates now sit at just 0.25 per cent, as low as the RBA is prepared to go. But it is a paltry amount compared to the trillions outlaid by the US, the UK, Europe and Japan. Quantitative easing is supposed to lower borrowing costs, thereby boosting profits and investment, and encourage firms to start hiring workers. That's the theory, anyway. In reality, it has done little of any of the above. Instead, it's encouraged firms to borrow but then hand the cash straight back to investors, which has encouraged ordinary savers to abandon relatively safe interest-bearing accounts and invest in stocks that yield a better return but which are far riskier. It's also encouraged speculation in housing, in a boom that commenced with financial market deregulation in the early 1980s and which barely encountered a hiccup through the global financial crisis, as this Reserve Bank of Australia graph shows. What this huge injection of cash has done is prevent what central banks fear most; the contagion that could spread from what's known as the negative wealth effect. If housing and stocks get slammed, it could cascade into a deep and severe recession. The problem is that central banks created that boom in the first place. Now, they are too scared of the repercussions to let those bubbles pop. The biggest side effect, however, is that wealth becomes more concentrated among the already wealthy. If you own a house or stocks or bonds, you've become rich without even trying. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. ""The Fed's response has deepened wealth inequality,"" says Mohamed A El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz. ""They've produced an incredible recovery in asset prices, and most of these assets are owned by the rich and white segment of the population. ""All they can say is the alternative would have been worse."" Stock markets globally have been on the swiftest rebound in history. If the world's central banks have anything to do with it, that's going to continue. Well, at least until some other crisis rattles investor confidence to the core.

401,"Barry Roberts saw $250,000 wiped away in weeks as coronavirus rocked his retirement plans",markets,"  For Australians in their golden years, who depend on income from their share portfolios to fund their retirement, there are plenty of grey clouds on the horizon. Many self-funded retirees lost up to 30 per cent of their nest eggs in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic as stock markets worldwide collapsed. Although some of those losses have since been recovered, many face a big drop in income from their investments. Sydney couple Barry and Jess Roberts are a case in point. Until March, the couple lived comfortably mainly off the dividends, including franking credits, paid by a number of Australian companies in which they have invested, including banks. ""I guess you could say we probably enjoyed a net income of $80,000 per year, which easily covered our living expenses and allowed us to go on holidays,"" Mr Roberts said. But, when $250,000 was wiped off the value of the couple's shares a few weeks ago and they were told their dividends would either be significantly reduced or disappear altogether, they decided to take drastic action and sell up. ""We had to move very quickly to cash in what was remaining, to guarantee that we did have sufficient funds to live on in the near future,"" Mr Roberts said. Since then, the couple have been living off their savings and, for the first time, have applied to Centrelink for a part pension. ""We're very respectful and appreciative of being able to fall back on that,"" Mr Roberts said. ""But we do not want to remain on the aged pension, so we are looking very closely at investing again. ""We are not complaining as there are many worse off than our situation."" LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Another investor, David Warner from Brisbane, watched the value of his self-managed super fund plummet by 20 per cent at the height of the market meltdown. It has since recovered by about 6 per cent, but Mr Warner said his income through dividends had dropped substantially. ""Dividends from all companies are under threat,"" he said. ""The banks are paying heavily reduced dividends or no dividends. ""We've had to be very careful and just adjust our living standards accordingly."" Fortunately Mr Warner and his partner Liz, both aged 70, set aside a safety net of money in cash deposits — enough to last them two years — after learning some tough lessons during the global financial crisis in 2008. This week the local share market fell again for the first time in nearly two weeks after recovering from a seven-year low in March. Mr Warner said the financial roller-coaster meant many self-funded retirees remained nervous about the future. ""We're sitting on tenterhooks at the moment, just waiting to see what might happen,"" he said. ""We won't know that until we know what the impact of the Government removing its various levels of subsidies is."" Both Mr and Ms Warner suffer from serious chronic health issues, so the couple's concerns are heightened by the fact they have significant health costs to cover. They said they were also concerned about how their exposure to the share market would affect their longer-term plan to stay at home, rather than go into an aged care facility. ""The matter of having money and saving money is critically important to us,"" Mr Warner said. ""It's not about saving so that we can spend it on new cars and overseas holidays. ""At our time of life it's very much about making sure that we have an adequate amount of money to provide us with a reasonable quality of care."" Australian Tax Office figures estimated self-managed super funds lost $66.7 billion in the March quarter and dropped $28.6 billion when compared to March 2019. Statistics for the June quarter won't be released until August. Self Managed Super Fund (SMSF) Association chief executive John Maroney said some of the pressure had eased for the country's self-funded retirees with the recent market recovery, but many were still affected by a range of factors. ""For many self-funded retirees, dividends paid from listed equities make up a substantial proportion of their annual income,"" Mr Maroney said. ""Combined with lower interest from bank deposits and possibly reduced rent receipts from property investors, many have experienced a substantial reduction in their income."" Mr Maroney said about 2 million retirees did not receive either the full or part pensions and about half of those owned shares either directly or via their super funds. Ian Henschke of National Seniors Australia said it was clear the pandemic had had a massive impact on many self-funded retirees, especially those who depended on share dividends, and that group needed to be looked after. The group is calling for a range of additional measures from the Commonwealth to support self-funded retirees during the pandemic, including a lowering of the Pension Loan Scheme rate that would encourage more people to use the program to top up their pension. It is also calling for a further reduction to the deeming rate — the rate that retirees are ""deemed"" to have earned for the pension income test — and widening the eligibility criteria for the Commonwealth Seniors Card. ""What we've witnessed over the past four months has been a massive shock to the whole economic system, but what it has done is that it's actually revealed the weaknesses in our retirement income system,"" Mr Henschke said. ""The risk of retirement for many of them is carried by the individual and unless they carry with them one or two years' worth of cash in the bank to ride over that shock, they have to sell their assets. ""What I think we should not forget is the role that older Australians play in the overall economy, because there are 3.8 million Australians in the retirement sector. ""If they are affected by this, then they won't be spending money and that doesn't stimulate the economy."" The SMSF Association called for retail investors including those with SMSFs to be given the opportunity to invest in capital raising, with most of those opportunities only currently going to institutional investors.

402,"Stocks, Australian dollar plunge as investors take 'reality check'",markets,"  Stocks, Australian dollar plunge as investors take 'reality check' The Australian share market has closed in the red for a second day, but off the lows of the session as US stock market futures moved higher. The ASX 200 lost 1.9 per cent to finish at 5,847 points, after clawing back some of its early falls of more than 3 per cent. The Australian dollar was savagely sold off overnight but regained some ground to around 68.6 US cents by 4:45pm AEST. The losses follow a period of optimism on markets, with the ASX 200 up by around 28 per cent from its low in late March, with even bigger gains on US indices. ""Investors were looking through the very clear evidence we've seen of economic damage … there was a lot of optimism and a lot of hope, frankly, that we'd see a 'V-shaped' recovery in economies as they came out of lockdown and that there'd be a cure or a vaccine for the virus,"" CMC Markets chief strategist Michael McCarthy said. ""That strength that we'd seen and that optimism is being moderated, and it's quite possible from the falls that we're seeing over the past 48 hours that we could see further damage over the coming days and weeks."" Energy stocks were hit hard after oil prices tumbled, including Worley (-5.8pc), Beach Energy (-4.3pc), Woodside (-5.3pc) and Oil Search (-5.7pc). There were again heavy losses for banking stocks including ANZ (-2.8pc), the Commonwealth Bank (-1.6pc), NAB (-2.5pc) and Westpac (-3.3pc), as well as smaller banks Bendigo and Adelaide (-3.7pc) and Bank of Queensland (-2.6pc). ""A very steady interest rate environment means [banks] are likely to see margin pressure and, because they're also leveraged to the economy, they're part of every industry in that they have business with them, that leverage means that if the economic outlook is deteriorating, so is the outlook for the banks,"" Mr McCarthy added. Westpac could face further allegations of anti-money-laundering breaches, as the regulator AUSTRAC broadens its investigation. The bank said it had continued to review its processes and, as a result, reported additional suspicious transactions related to potential child exploitation to AUSTRAC. It said AUSTRAC had requested further information regarding 272 customers and transaction reporting issues. Westpac, which has set aside $900 million for a potential fine arising from the court case, filed its defence earlier this month, admitting to most of the allegations. AUSTRAC has alleged Westpac breached anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws more than 23 million times by failing to report transactions, and failing to adequately monitor accounts and identify when money was being used to pay for child exploitation. ""A revised statement of claim, including the threshold reporting breaches and the alleged child exploitation failures, is now a certainty,"" Thomson Reuters' financial crime expert Nathan Lynch said. ""It's just a terrible development and it's a reminder that when you don't know what's happening in your bank, anything could be happening in your bank."" The falls on the local market follow the worst one-day percentage plunge for US stocks since mid-March, as fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections returned and investors were spooked by gloomy economic forecasts from the Federal Reserve. All three major indexes plunged more than 5 per cent, the biggest one-day falls since March 16, when business lockdowns to control the spread of the coronavirus in the US were put in place. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,862 points, or 6.9 per cent, to 25,128, the S&P 500 lost 5.9 per cent to 3,002 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.3 per cent to 9,493. Among the major S&P 500 sectors, energy and financials suffered the largest percentage drops, plunging by 9.5 per cent and 8.2 per cent. Travel companies were among those hit hardest on Wall Street, with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings dropping 16.5 per cent and Royal Caribbean Cruises losing more than 14 per cent. Boeing was the biggest loser on the Dow Jones index and slid by 16.4 per cent after its top supplier Spirit AeroSystems Holdings announced a three-week layoff for staff doing production and support work for Boeing's 737 aircraft. The sell-off came after the market had staged a big rally in the wake of its March lows. NAB's head of foreign exchange strategy Ray Attrill said the sell-off was based on a ""reality check"" as US COVID-19 infection rates started rising again and the Fed gave a gloomy economic outlook. ""To this mix we should also add the scale of the recent equity market run-up, which by all accounts has been driven in large part by high participation from retail investors and which took some technical indicators, such as relative strength indices, off the charts,"" he wrote in a note. Thousands of Australians stranded at home due to COVID-19 have started trying to make money playing the share market. But the regulator warns the lure of easy profits comes with big risks. Analysts in the US said there were few buyers in the market last night. ""There's really no buy point,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""It's pretty much selling all the way through."" Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York, agreed. ""Everything's for sale,"" he added. ""There's fear we're near a top."" European markets were also a sea of red. London's FTSE 100 index dropped 4 per cent to 6,077, Germany's DAX lost 4.5 per cent, and the French CAC 40 slumped 4.7 per cent. Spot gold fell slightly to $US1,727.15 US an ounce. Oil prices tumbled, with Brent crude oil down 8.5 per cent to $US38.20 a barrel. In economic news, the number of Americans seeking jobless benefits fell last week, but millions laid off because of COVID-19 continue to receive unemployment benefits. The weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department came after a surprise fall in the US unemployment rate in May.

403,'Not much method to the madness' of first time 'iso-investors',markets,"  First-time share market investors take a punt on coronavirus recovery Tens of thousands of Australians stranded at home over the past few months due to COVID-19 have taken up a new pastime: trying to make money trading shares. For some, like Eleanor Wilson, the gains have been spectacular. ""I'm up about 35 per cent,"" she tells The Business. The 21-year-old from Brisbane, who studies law part time while working at a property company, says she was looking at her phone one day a couple of months ago and saw the share market was down 30 per cent. ""And I thought if ever there was a time to get into trading, it would probably be now,"" she recalls. ""My sense of FOMO and missing out on the big gains was my impetus for getting involved."" Like many other people pushed out of their day jobs due to the pandemic, professional rugby player Jack Dempsey turned to shares in a bid to recover his lost income. ""We're two months into pay cuts and I've already made back what I would have lost and some more as well,"" he says. David Ika is currently unemployed. He withdrew all his super when the Government allowed it — $9,000 worth — and invested it himself. ""I don't know if anyone really knows what the market's going to do, so I'm not going to pay an advisor to use my money,"" he explains. So far that strategy appears to be working for him — he says his investments are up by more than two thirds. ""A good amount of cash to have for doing nothing for the last month-and-a-half,"" he quips. But his methods are unconventional, at least as far as professional investors would be concerned. He doesn't read the companies' accounts or consider key business metrics such as earnings per share. ""I don't really bother with all that stuff. It's a bit too much effort for me,"" he says. ""I'd just rather see when it goes down and buy and hope it goes up again. That's my strategy."" Wilson has a slightly more scientific strategy. ""A lot of gut feel, not too much method to the madness,"" she says. ""I look at what's crashed the most and then see whether they'll survive the long term. ""I don't look at the accounts as much as I should but I kind of look at how much debt and equity they have and I kind of go off that."" Coronavirus fears may have triggered market panic, but it is the rapid escalation of global debt that will cause the worst financial damage from the crisis, argues Ian Verrender. Unlike many amateur investors, Dempsey has benefitted from connections with the professionals. ""I've got a few mates who work in the finance sector and essentially just reached out to them,"" he explains. ""When I thought about diving in, one of my mates said, 'it's probably a little bit too early because it is going to keep falling', so that was quite lucky because there was another massive fall."" However, the Wallabies and Waratahs star admits his investment process is not strictly scientific either. ""It was a combination of advice and a gut feel looking at the broader picture and the next six to 24 months around which areas would have the most growth."" Wilson says her gut feeling is that tourism will rebound big time. ""I went a lot into the travel industry. I just thought people are going to want to go and travel as soon as this is over,"" she explains. She isn't alone — the hard-hit travel and tourism sector seems to be the investment of choice for many amateurs. Companies such as Qantas and Flight Centre have outperformed the broader stock market during the recovery, just as they were hit much harder during the collapse. Since March, the number of new share trading accounts opened daily more than tripled. Greg Yanco, the ASIC executive director responsible for supervising markets, is noticing a worrying pattern emerging. ""On basically two thirds of the days when retail traders were net buyers, the next day the market went down and, similarly, when they were sellers the next day the market went up,"" he says. The share market prices companies based on their future earnings, and the April rally shows traders expect the COVID-19 economic shutdowns to end soon, writes David Taylor. ASIC is most concerned about inexperienced day traders — people who look for quick profits by buying and selling shares without holding them for long periods — and suggests getting advice and practising before committing real money. ""Make sure that you don't invest, or trade, more than you can afford to lose,"" Yanco warns. Aileen Wang is basically following that advice by only investing amounts she can afford to lose if the market goes back down. ""I put in a small sum that I was willing to lose,"" she says. ""If that company goes bust, well too bad. No more coffees for the year or no more new clothes."" But, so far, Wang's wardrobe looks safe. ""So far I've pretty much doubled what I've put in, so I'm glad about that,"" she says. ""It's really tempting to sell off but I'm playing the long-term game here."" Chris Brycki, who runs robo-advice firm StockSpot, says it's unusual to see retail investors jump in at such an early stage of a share market rally. ""Usually it takes a while after markets recover before you see mum and dad investors start to get interested again and be confident enough to invest. This time it's happened a lot faster,"" he observes. Wilson says she is also relaxed about her investments, especially given the returns they have generated so far. ""For the minute I'm pretty comfortable with what I've put in and the results that'll come out of that,"" she says. ""I'm in it for the long run."" Dempsey admits there's an attraction from the risk of share investing. ""There's an element of trading that's like gambling. It's paid off at the moment but I'm hoping for more,"" he says. As efforts to control COVID-19 appear to be gaining traction, many analysts and traders are hoping for a quick return to business as usual. They're likely to be disappointed, writes Ian Verrender. However, he's also confident that he picked a low point at which to enter the market. ""The biggest risk that I'm worried about is a second wave of the virus,"" he adds. ""From my point of view, I've bought in at ground level so I'm not too worried about being worse off as a result of some catastrophe."" At least for these young investors, there's plenty of years to recoup the losses if their investments do get swamped by a second wave of COVID-19.

404,Cattle producers cash in on record $4.12 million sale in Casino,markets," ABC Rural Cattle producers cash in on record $4.12 million sale in Casino It has been an incredible year for the cattle industry on the north coast of New South Wales with records broken at local markets on yardings, cattle prices and sales volume. The region's largest selling centre, the Northern Rivers Livestock Exchange (NRLX), is on track to break its annual turnover record of $113.62 million, set in 2016-17, by the end of June. NRLX general manager Brad Willis said a couple of major influences have driven the throughput of cattle over the past six months. ""Last year we had a lot of producers that had to offload stock during drought and fire. We can't forget that was the main motivation for that during that time,"" he said. ""This year we've had good rainfall [and] extremely strong demand from the west which has driven the price and the demand for more stock to be sold through the yards."" Buyers have travelled from western parts of both NSW and Queensland to the coast to re-stock herds after drought-breaking rain. The sustained boom in demand for cattle since February will see NRLX record its highest throughput in the past decade when tomorrow's store sale pushes it past 124,596 head. Mr Willis said that if numbers are maintained for the remaining sales this month, the centre could also exceed 130,000 cattle — the highest throughput in 22 years. The facility in Casino, owned and operated by Richmond Valley Council (RVC), has already broken one record this month with $4.12 million in cattle sold at last Friday's store sale. Casino beef producer and livestock carrier Alan Maloney said he had never seen anything like it during his time. ""Not to these heights where the steer calves were making $5-plus and the heifer calves are making $4-plus. This is unheard of,"" he said. ""The last month the market has got dearer for restocker cattle, and then on Friday with the combination of the numbers they had which brought the buyers to get volumes of cattle. It was remarkable. ""There were good lines of cattle here and they sold exceptionally well pen after pen, so it was a good result for everyone."" The record sale was not just a win for producers and agents, but also RVC which collected $48,000 in agent and vendor fees for the 3,750 cattle sold on the day. After yesterday's $1.48m prime sale, NRLX's total annual sales sits at $104.84 million.

405,"ASX, Dow fall despite Fed's zero rate commitment, Nasdaq surges through 10,000 points",markets,"  ASX, Dow fall despite Fed commitment to low rates for longer, Nasdaq surges through 10,000 points The Australian share market has closed lower for the first time in seven trading sessions, with the benchmark index sliding back below 6,000 points, after a gloomy economic forecast from the US central bank due to the coronavirus pandemic. The ASX 200 ended down by 3.1 per cent or 187 points at 5,960, near the lows of the session. The All Ordinaries index lost 3 per cent to 6,079 points. The big bank stocks slumped following the Federal Reserve's prediction of a slower-than-expected recovery for the US. Shares in ANZ (-6.2pc), Commonwealth Bank (-4.4pc), NAB (-5.4pc) and Westpac (-6.1pc) all declined sharply. The boss of NAB said all of the company's 34,000 employees, including himself, would go through a new professional training program to learn how to be ethical bankers. NAB chief executive Ross McEwan told RN Breakfast the bank was stepping up training after it was heavily criticised for misconduct by the banking royal commission. The Financial Services Institute of Australasia will run the internationally recognised banking education program. Mr McEwan said the bank was trying to improve its customer service. ""So this is certainly part of our plan to make sure that every staff member is aware of what their job is and having the skills to do that job and getting the basics right for customers every time,"" he said. Healthcare stocks and gold miners were among the few sectors to gain ground — the best performers on the ASX 200 were gold miners Northern Star (+6.8pc), Newcrest (+5.7pc) and St Barbara (+5.3pc). Online retailer Kogan defied the falls elsewhere on the market, with its shares gaining 6.9 per cent after it raised $100 million from investors in an oversubscribed share placement. Shares in JB Hi-fi were lower, despite reporting a 20 per cent jump in sales so far for the second half of the financial year. The electronics retailer forecast annual profit to rise by one fifth because of the big jump in sales due to COVID-19, but its shares fell by 4.2 per cent to $40.22. The Australian dollar came off its overnight highs and had fallen by 1 per cent against the greenback, to around 69.25 US cents by 4:30pm AEST. The US central bank has kept official interest rates near zero and indicates it will provide years of support for the US economy to help it recover from the economic devastation of the coronavirus pandemic as it releases its first economic projections of the COVID-19 era. As expected, the Federal Reserve kept its key overnight interest rate at 0-0.25 per cent in a unanimous decision. The Fed also pledged to continue buying bonds to keep the coronavirus-damaged economy afloat and promised to maintain the current pace of about $US80 billion in Treasury bond purchases each month and $US40 billion in mortgage bonds. It forecast that interest rates would remain near zero through to 2022. The Fed also predicted gross domestic product could slump by 6.5 per cent this year, with the unemployment rate at 9.3 per cent by the end of 2020. It sees the economy rebounding by 5 per cent next year. ""The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment and inflation in the near term and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term,"" the Fed said in its latest policy statement. More than 20 million North Americans have lost their jobs since February and Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said it could take years for people to get back into the labour force. At a media conference after the Fed's statement came out, Mr Powell acknowledged the nationwide demonstrations following the death of African-American man George Floyd at the hands of police. He said it was the Fed's single-minded mission to bring the jobs market back to where it was at the end of 2019, with unemployment at a record low of 3.5 per cent. ""Twenty-two, 24 million people — somehow as a country we have to get them back to work,"" he said via video link after the Fed's two-day meeting. ""They did not do anything wrong. This was a natural disaster. ""It is a long road. It is going to take some time."" The US central bank chief again pledged to do whatever it took to help the US economy get back on its feet. ""We can use our tools to support the labour market and the economy and we can use them until we fully recover,"" he continued. ""We are not even thinking about thinking about raising rates."" National Australia Bank economists said in a research note that the Fed was still considering further money printing. ""The implication is that more QE [quantitative easing] is possible if longer-dated yields continue to rise,"" they wrote. ""Powell also mentioned in his press conference that they will continue to review the asset purchase forward guidance, that they have been studying the international evidence on yield-curve control."" The gloomy economic forecasts saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 index end lower in a volatile trading session. The Dow lost 282 points, or 1 per cent, to 26,990 and the S&P 500 dropped 0.5 per cent to 3,190. But the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite rose above 10,000 for the first time, yet another record high, ending at 10,094, an increase of 0.7 per cent. European stocks also lost ground, with the FTSE 100 index down 0.1 per cent to 6,329, the DAX in Germany dropped 0.7 per cent to 12,530 and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 0.8 per cent to 5,053. Spot gold put on 1.3 per cent to $US1,736.23 an ounce amid the renewed caution. West Texas crude oil rose 16 cents to $US39.08 a barrel. Brent crude oil put on 0.2 per cent to $US41.25 a barrel.

407,Australian shares ease back as investors await grim US employment figures,markets,"  Australian shares ease back as investors await grim US employment figures The Australian share market is off yesterday's three-month high as investors take a breather to cash in some profits ahead of the latest US unemployment numbers tonight. At 10:40 (AEST), the ASX 200 index had come off its lows and was down was down just 0.1 per cent to 5,983, pulled down by healthcare stocks and most other industry sectors. Banks and oil stocks were the sectors posting gains, with banks boosted by a report from UBS analysts that upgraded two of the big four to a ""buy"" rating as the coronavirus pandemic appears to be under control in Australia. Mining contractor NRW rose 4.5 per cent to $2.09 after it said its financial performance for the year was on track and it promised to pay an interim dividend. Vaccine maker CSL lost 3.8 per cent to $283.14. The Australian dollar has slipped from its overnight high to just under 69.4 US cents. Nearly 2 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, with economists predicting the unemployment rate rose to nearly 20 per cent in May. Almost 1.9 million people put in claims for jobless benefits last week, slightly more than expected, but the first time the number has fallen below 2 million since mid-March. The numbers mean 42 million people have joined the jobless queues since March in the United States, a country with about 330 million people. Continuing jobless claims for the week ending March 23 rose to 21.5 million, worse than predicted. The S&P 500 lost ground as investors took profits ahead of tonight's official US employment figures for May. The benchmark index fell 0.3 per cent to 3,112. The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a small gain, putting on just 12 points, or 0.05 per cent, to 26,282. The Nasdaq Composite slid 0.7 per cent to 9,616. The European Central Bank (ECB) approved a bigger-than-expected expansion of its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program stimulus package to prop up an economy in deep recession. ECB president Christine Lagarde said euro area real GDP decreased by 3.8 per cent over the first few months of 2020 compared to the last few months of 2019. The ECB again expanded its money printing program to cushion a potential fall in economic growth of up to 12 per cent this year. The region's central bank sees GDP falling by 8.7 per cent in 2020, with growth rebounding by 5.2 per cent in 2021 and 3.3 per cent in 2022. The decision extended the ECB's emergency bond purchase scheme to the middle of next year and increased it by 600 billion euros ($980 billion) to 1.35 trillion euros ($2.2 trillion). Ms Lagarde said the eurozone economy was experiencing ""an unprecedented contraction"" and weak inflation. ""There has been an abrupt drop in economic activity as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the measures to contain it,"" Ms Lagarde said. ""Severe job and income losses and exceptionally elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook have led to a significant fall in consumer spending and investment."" Germany also announced a stimulus package worth 130 billion euros ($212 billion). The euro rallied against the greenback after the announcements. Despite the new stimulus, European markets ended lower, with the FTSE 100 falling 0.6 per cent to 6,341. The DAX in Germany lost 0.5 per cent to 12.431 and the CAC 40 in Paris slid 0.6 per cent to 5,012. Spot gold also gained ground $US13.17 to $US1710.68 an ounce. Oil prices were little changed as the market awaited a decision from the world's major oil producers to extend record production cuts to boost prices. Brent crude oil put on 0.2 per cent to $US39.86. West Texas crude oil was steady at $US37.31 a barrel. Under pressure for allowing fake news to proliferate, social media giant Facebook said it would ban state-controlled media firms from running advertisements on its platform targeting US users later this year. The decision is part of attempts to stop foreign interference in the 2020 US presidential election in November. Facebook will also start labelling Russian, Chinese and other state-controlled media organisations to give more information to users about who is behind the companies. This includes Russia's Sputnik, Iran's Press TV and China's Xinhua News, but US media outlets won't be targeted, as it determined that even US government-run outlets have editorial independence, Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, said in an interview with Reuters. Facebook has admitted its failure to stop Russian use of its platforms to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election. It has since stepped up controls and imposed greater transparency requirements for pages and ads on its platforms.

408,"Australian share market rises, dollar comes off five-month high",markets,"  Australian share market rises, dollar comes off five-month high The Australian share market rose this session but ended off its early highs, after a strong session on Wall Street. Hopes that the worst of the coronavirus-fuelled economic damage was over saw Australian stocks trading at the highest level since early March. The ASX 200 closed up 0.8 per cent at 5,991 points, after earlier climbing above 6,000 points. Most industry sectors finished higher, led by the banks and healthcare stocks. Toilet paper almost kept us out of recession, even as the economy went down the drain, explains Ian Verrender. Westfield shopping centre owner Unibail Rodamco jumped 12 per cent to $5.49. Nufarm dropped 11.5 per cent to $4.86 after it said the coronavirus pandemic had affected its global business. The Australian dollar has come off a five-month high and has slipped to below 69 US cents. It fell back from 69.8 US cents yesterday after the latest GDP figures showed the Australian economy shrank by 0.3 per cent over the first few months of the year amid bushfires, drought, floods and the coronavirus. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg admitted the figures meant Australia was in the middle of its first technical recession in 29 years, with the June quarter GDP numbers certain to be deeply negative amid coronavirus shutdowns. However, Mr Frydenberg said Australia had avoided an ""economists' version of Armageddon"" with initial fears of up to a 20 per cent slump in GDP now very unlikely to be realised. Coronavirus business shutdowns and government restrictions saw retail spending slump in April by a revised 17.7 per cent to $24.8 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis. The Bureau of Statistics said there was a record fall in retail trade over the month compared to a record 8.5 per cent rise in March because of panic buying. The shutdowns saw record falls in spending at cafes, restaurants and takeaway food outlets. Spending on clothing, shoes and accessories plunged by more than half. Other data from the ABS showed that Australia's trade surplus narrowed from a record $10.5 billion in March to $8.8 billion dollars in April, as both exports and imports fell sharply, in large part because tourism ground to a halt. Qantas shares jumped after it announced it would increase the number of domestic flights over the next two months. More than 300 additional Qantas and Jetstar return flights a week will be scheduled this month, as travel restrictions ease. That will take the airline's domestic capacity from 5 per cent of pre-coronavirus levels to 15 per cent by the end of June, with the potential for further flights in July depending on demand. Qantas stood down 20,000 workers as the coronavirus crisis halted most of its operations. The airline says some staff will now return to work, but the majority will remain stood down. Westpac's investigation into its money laundering scandal says the bank's board was unintentionally given wrong and incomplete information about the risk of financial crime but the scandal was caused by human mistakes, inadequate compliance and technical errors. The bank is accused by the financial crimes regulator, AUSTRAC, of breaking Australia's money laundering laws more than 23 million times, including allowing its payment systems to be used by paedophiles. The bank is facing a big financial and reputational risk over allegations it breached money laundering laws more than 23 million times … and things are only likely to get worse, writes Nassim Khadem. The investigation found that there was insufficient understanding, expertise and resources into the risks of money laundering and counter terrorism financing at the bank. It also appointed an advisory panel led by former Telstra boss, Dr Ziggy Switkowski, to investigate what went wrong. The panel found that reports to the Westpac board on financial crime ""was at times unintentionally incomplete and inaccurate"" and its response was ""immature and reactive."" Westpac chief executive, Peter King, said the wrongdoing was unintentional. ""While the compliance failures were serious, the problems were faults of omission,"" Mr King said. ""There was no evidence of intentional wrongdoing."" Mr King said 38 staff members had their pay packets reduced, including short term bonuses cut by $13.2 million, because of the scandal. Other staff left the bank including the former boss, Brian Hartzer. Westpac and AUSTRAC are still negotiating over the case and the bank has set aside $900 million to cover an expected fine. Overnight Wall Street jumped in a broad rally closing in on its February record highs amid signs of economic recovery from coronavirus shutdowns. Financials, industrials and technology stocks led the three major US indexes higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 527 points, or 2.05 per cent, to 26,270, the S&P 500 gained 1.4 per cent to 3,123 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.8 per cent to 9,683. The Nasdaq, the S&P 500 and the Dow have rebounded sharply from their lows in March because of coronavirus lockdowns. The indexes are now just 1.4 per cent, 7.8 per cent and 11.1 per cent from their record highs. The share market prices companies based on their future earnings, and the April rally shows traders expect the COVID-19 economic shutdowns to end soon, writes David Taylor. Aircraft maker Boeing rose nearly 13 per cent following the news that billionaire investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point had taken a stake in the company. Lyft jumped after the ride-sharing firm said rides increased 26 per cent in May. Campbell Soup beat earnings expectations and improved its full-year forecast, but troubles meeting surging consumer demand saw its shares fall. US private employers laid off workers at a slower pace than predicted in May. The ADP National Employment Report showed private employers laid off another 2.8 million workers last month after laying off a record 19.6 million in April. The services industry also came off an 11-year low in May. The latest official US employment figures are out tomorrow. The US will ban Chinese passenger planes from flying to North America from the middle of this month amid simmering tensions between Washington and Beijing. The Trump administration is pressuring China to allow US air carriers to resume flights as tensions worsen over trade, the coronavirus and Hong Kong. The Australian dollar is rebounding back towards 70 US cents even as the nation's economy is hurtling towards recession. Gareth Hutchens explains why. The US Department of Transportation announced the ban, which penalises China for failing to comply with an existing agreement on flights between the two countries. The order applies to Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Hainan Airlines and two smaller carriers. Two big British banks have backed China's plan to impose a national security law on Hong Kong. HSBC's Asia-Pacific boss Peter Wong signed a petition backing the planned law and Standard Chartered Bank also said it supports the law. Stocks rose in Europe, with London's FTSE 100 up 2.6 per cent to 6,382. Brent crude oil dipped 0.2 per cent to $US39.50 a barrel. West Texas crude recouped its falls and added 0.1 per cent to $US36.85 a barrel. Spot gold has dropped just below $US1,700 an ounce.

409,ASX falls as share investors spooked by rising US-China tensions,markets,"  ASX falls as share investors spooked by rising US-China tensions over Hong Kong The Australian share market has fallen sharply today amid a ramp up in US-China tensions after the Chinese parliament, the National People's Congress, passed a national security law to crack down on political freedoms in Hong Kong. In response, US President Donald Trump said he would hold a media conference tonight about China, with Hong Kong's special trade status expected to be at stake. Hong Kong's Government warned Washington that withdrawing its special US status could be a ""double-edged sword"" and urged the United States to stop interfering in its internal affairs. At 12:20pm (AEST) the ASX 200 index had lost 1.3 per cent of its value, or 75 points, to 5,776. Most sectors were in the red, led by banks and industrial stocks. Telecommunications, technology and gold stocks were the few sectors making gains during the morning. Investors were also taking profits, especially from the banks, after a big rally this week on hopes that Australia's economic recovery from the coronavirus will be quicker than expected. Despite today's slide, the benchmark index is set for its fifth weekly gain with the market trading near an eleven-week high. Virgin Money shed 8.7 per cent, while Westpac lost nearly 5 per cent, or $0.90, to $17.48. Ship builder Austal rose 7.6 per cent to $3.27 after it predicted a rise in revenue across its shipyards. It said it saw only a limited impact on its performance from the coronavirus in April and May. Energy stocks fell after a pullback in oil prices. Brent crude futures fell 1.5 per cent to $US34.77 a barrel, Gold stocks gained, led by Northern Star which rose by 8 per cent to $14.85. The Australian dollar dipped slightly to around 66.3 US cents. The latest lending data from the Reserve Bank showed a big pullback in borrowing in April from March. Private sector credit was flat after rising by 1.1 per cent the previous month. Personal loans continued to fall, business loans also dropped sharply, but demand for home loans rose 0.2 per cent over the month. Over the year to April, private sector credit rose 3.6 per cent. Mr Trump signed an executive order cracking down on social media companies, just two days after Twitter started fact-checking some of his tweets. Mr Trump signed the order after attacking Twitter for tagging his tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact check the posts. He said the White House may ""remove or change"" a law known as section 230, so social media companies will not have a legal immunity, which protects the platforms from liability for content posted by their users. It is being seen as extraordinary attempt to intervene in the media that experts interviewed by Reuters said was unlikely to survive legal scrutiny. First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams told Reuters it was a historic intervention. ""In terms of presidential efforts to limit critical commentary about themselves, I think one would have to go back to the Sedition Act of 1798 — which made it illegal to say false things about the president and certain other public officials — to find an attack supposedly rooted in law by a president on any entity which comments or prints comments about public issues and public people,"" he said. Jack Balkin, a Yale University constitutional law professor said it was intimidation. ""The President is trying to frighten, coerce, scare, cajole social media companies to leave him alone and not do what Twitter has just done to him,"" he said. Some Democrats and Republicans also have pushed changes to the law. Twitter's shares lost 4.4 per cent, Facebook fell 1.6 per cent and Google's parent Alphabet dropped 0.1 per cent. The Dow Jones rose more than 200 points earlier in the trading session before falling on the news of the order and tensions with China. It finished down 0.6 per cent at 25,401. The S&P 500 lost just six points, or 0.2 per cent, to 3,030, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 43 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 9,369. The latest US unemployment claims data indicted the worst of the coronavirus economic damage could be over. The US Labor Department said another 2.1 million North Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, slightly more than predicted. Continuing claims fell by nearly 4 million, the first drop since the virus outbreak. The latest figures bring the number of people filing for jobless benefits since mid-March to 40.7 million. April durable goods orders did not fall as much as expected, with the headline measure down 17.2 per cent over the month. Pending home sales fell 21.8 in April. European stocks ended higher with the FTSE 100, CAC 40 and DAX all rising more than 1 per cent. Spot gold was higher at $US1,718.50 an ounce.

410,"Big bank stocks surge again, boosting Australian share market",markets,"  Rally for major bank stocks leads Australian shares higher, Wall St jumps Surging bank stocks boosted the Australian share market, following similar moves on Wall Street overnight, but the benchmark index closed off the highs of the session. The ASX 200 finished 1.3 per cent higher at 5,851 points, after earlier being up more than 2 per cent. The All Ordinaries index closed up by 72 points or 1.2 per cent at 5,957. The major bank stocks led the rally, coming on the back of several strong sessions for the big four. Shares in NAB (+4.7pc) made the biggest gains, followed by ANZ (+4.5pc), Westpac (+4.4pc) and Commonwealth Bank (+2.2pc). Other financial stocks including Bendigo and Adelaide Bank (+4.1pc), Bank of Queensland (+2pc), Macquarie (+1.6pc) and AMP (+2.7pc) also rose. Nearmap was the best performer among the top 200 stocks, with its shares finishing 16.7 per cent higher at $2.24. The aerial imagery company reported an increase in the value of customer contracts and said it was retaining more of its customers. Energy was the worst-performing sector, with stocks including Beach Energy (-6.2pc) and Worley (-4.4 pc) falling. The Australian dollar was buying around 66.24 US cents at 4:30pm AEST. The cost of insurance claims from the summer of natural disasters has passed $5.19 billion, including an additional 15,000 claims lodged over the past month, according to the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA). ""Thousands of new claims and property loss assessments have pushed total claims to more than 288,100,"" the ICA's Campbell Fuller said. In addition to the bushfires in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria, the natural disaster season also saw storms and flooding on the east coast in February, a hailstorm in South East Queensland in November and hailstorms in NSW, Qld, Victoria and the ACT in January. ""Almost 50 per cent of claims from the four storm, bushfire and hailstorm catastrophes have been closed by insurers,"" Mr Fuller said. The estimated insurance losses from the bushfires alone are $2.32 billion, with more than 38,000 claims lodged. The ICA says it is currently assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on claims and customers. Shares in listed insurers were higher, including IAG (+2.7pc), QBE (+4pc) and Suncorp (+0.1pc). Aircraft-maker Boeing is laying off more than 12,000 workers as the coronavirus pandemic wreaks havoc on air travel. One of North America's biggest manufacturers, the company will lay off nearly 7,000 US employees this week. More than 5,500 workers have accepted redundancies and will leave voluntarily in the coming weeks. The company said several thousand more jobs would go over the next few months. Meanwhile, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos defended the company's response to the coronavirus pandemic at its annual shareholder meeting. Investors grilled Mr Bezos and other top executives about the company's treatment of warehouse workers. Several workers died after catching the virus, with accusations that Amazon was too slow to provide safety measures at its warehouses. The US central bank said economic activity had ""declined"" across much of the country and had fallen sharply in most regions. The Federal Reserve's Beige Book survey found workers were reluctant to go back to their jobs because of safety concerns, childcare issues and generous unemployment benefits provided by the Government. The report also found business leaders ""were pessimistic about the potential pace of recovery."" US stocks surged after a volatile trading session, despite rising tensions between the US and China over Hong Kong. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Trump administration no longer regarded Hong Kong as autonomous from China, and said it no longer warranted special treatment under US law. Banks drove the market action, although gains were limited by tech stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 2.2 per cent, or 553 points, to 25,548. The S&P 500 gained 1.5 per cent to 3,036, the first time it has closed above 3,000 since early March. The index rose nearly 10 per cent over the past two sessions for its biggest two-day increase since early April. The Nasdaq Composite added 72 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 9,412. Continued easing of lockdowns, optimism about an eventual COVID-19 vaccine and massive US stimulus have been driving the market's recent gains. Theme park operator Walt Disney announced plans to start reopening its Walt Disney World resort in Florida, the world's largest theme park, in phases starting in July, and MGM Resorts said it would reopen its four Las Vegas casinos in early June. European stocks also rose after the unveiling of a trillion-dollar-plus plan to prop up economies hammered by the coronavirus pandemic. The European Rescue Fund, dubbed the ""next generation EU"", is a 750 billion euro ($1.24 trillion) proposal to revive coronavirus-stricken economies such as Italy and Spain. But the plan needs to be approved by all European Union members, with Austria, the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries opposed to a bailout of poorer nations. West Texas crude oil fell more than 6 per cent to $US32.17 on the tensions between the US and China. Spot gold rose slipped to around $US1,708 an ounce on predictions of an economic recovery.

412,"Athleisure wear to run up demand for sagging wool market, say producers",markets," ABC Rural Australian wool producers are looking to the growing athleisure market for salvation as they grapple with plunging prices and threats of sanctions in the trade spat between Canberra and Beijing. Prices for wool have fallen to five-year lows in Australian dollar terms as the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic forces major buyers such as Italy and India to exit the market. Their withdrawal has left China as the dominant customer — a situation that has many growers nervous following Beijing's decision to impose crippling tariffs on Australian barley exporters. Despite the downside, industry veteran Danny Burkett said there was still plenty for wool producers to be optimistic about. Mr Burkett, an account manager with Perth-based West Coast Wool, said prices for a clean kilogram of 20-micron merino wool — a typical product from Western Australia — were trading at $12.70. He said this was well within the bounds of the 10-year average since 2011, even though it was less than levels seen during the ""super cycle"" between 2017 and 2019. Mr Burkett said consumer trends, regardless of coronavirus, were favourable with increasingly popular products such as outdoor and athleisure wear requiring large amounts of fine wool. ""Given the current economic backdrop to wool-consuming countries, in particular, I think our market has been extremely resilient,"" he said. ""The next-to-skin wear [athleisure] market, I think, has got a great future in front of it. ""We're not getting those extremely broad micron fibres that used to be the issue that caused the itch on next-to-skin wear. ""The industry has done a tremendous job in genetics in breeding that out, so we now have products that can sit on the skin. ""And I believe that will be a very broad and very big market as the wool market continues on its track forward."" Peter Morris from exporter PJ Morris Wools echoed Mr Burkett's optimism, and said the short-term setbacks associated with COVID-19 could give way to long-term benefits. ""Your active wear and casual wear, where there's a bigger percentage of wool going into that market and it's a growing market, there's some real upside,"" Mr Morris said. ""People are walking to work, they're riding to work, they're working from home around the world, so clothing can be a bit more casual."" The comments come at a delicate time for Australia's farmers, including its wool producers. In a decision that has effectively wiped out the trade, China slapped massive tariffs on exports of Australian barley this week, following up on its snap decision to restrict imports of Australian beef. The escalation in trade tensions, which follows Australia's call for an independent inquiry into the origin and spread of the coronavirus, has sparked fears other agricultural exports could be hit. Winton Nazzari, a wool producer from Tambellup in Western Australia's Wheatbelt, said the deepening rift between Australia and China was a source of concern. However, Mr Nazzari said he had ridden out periods of instability in the wool market before and would not make drastic business decisions based on the latest disruptions. ""Naturally, when they're buying 80 per cent of your product and seem to be finding reasons to put effective bans on your products … I guess you'd have to have some level of concern,"" Mr Nazzari said. ""But at the same time, from an Australian point of view, I'd like to think that we just keep being honest and true to ourselves and don't lose our temper or try to react. ""Free trade lifts all boats."" Andrew Rickwood from Australian Wool Exchange said the key benchmark for Australian wool prices, the Eastern Market Indicator, had slumped 37 per cent in the past 12 months — the biggest annual fall on record. Mr Rickwood said a growing number of producers were opting to stockpile wool rather than sell into a falling market, a trend which would put further downward pressure on prices in the short term. ""So far this year, the passed-in rate is 17.6 per cent, compared with the previous year where the passed-in rate was only 9.8 per cent,"" Mr Rickwood said. ""Straight away there you have nearly 18 per cent of wool that's been passed in this year and it is slowly accumulating.""

413,"Fitch downgrades outlook for Australia's credit rating, ASX falls",markets,"  Fitch downgrades outlook for Australia's credit rating, ASX falls The local share market has closed lower and ratings agency Fitch has downgraded its outlook for Australia's AAA credit rating. The ASX 200 extended its decline in late trade and finished the session 1 per cent, or 53 points, lower at 5,497. The big four bank stocks lost ground, led by a 1.2 per cent fall for NAB shares. The healthcare and energy sectors were the worst performers, with losses for Mayne Pharma (-4.5 per cent) and Santos (-4 per cent). Shares in Wesfarmers lost 0.1 per cent to $38.86, after the conglomerate revealed half its Target stores could shut or be converted to Kmart stores, putting as many as 1,300 jobs on the line. Global ratings agency Fitch downgraded its outlook for Australia's AAA credit rating to negative from stable, following a similar move by S&P last month. ""The negative outlook reflects the significant impact the global coronavirus pandemic has on Australia's economy and public finances,"" Fitch said. ""Risks are tilted to the downside given uncertainties around the spread of the coronavirus domestically and globally."" The ratings agency is forecasting an economic contraction of 5 per cent this year, and says the Government spending in response to the health and economic crisis will cause large deficits. ""The forecast GDP contraction will end a run of 28 consecutive years of economic growth,"" Fitch said. The Fitch downgrade to the ratings outlook came prior to the Treasury and the Australian Tax Office revealing an error in estimating the number of employees likely to access the JobKeeper program. The estimated cost of the program was revised down from $130 billion to $70 billion. NAB economist Kaixin Owyong says the error means direct fiscal stimulus from the Government is now worth $180 billion or 8.8 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) over the 2020 and 2021 financial years, compared to the previous estimate of $240 billion or 11.8 per cent of GDP. ""This is still an enormous fiscal stimulus and the cheaper-than-expected JobKeeper programme provides room for the government to potentially extend its fiscal stimulus, where both the JobKeeper wage subsidy and the boost to JobSeeker unemployment benefits are legislated to end in September,"" Ms Owyong said. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic In economic news overnight, the jobless queues in the United States continue to climb with millions more Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits last week. Another 2.4 million people applied for jobless benefits last week in the US, bringing total claims filed since March 21 to 38.6 million. However, last week's numbers were down from the previous week's claims, representing the seventh straight week of declining applications. Other economic data showed that home sales dropped by nearly 18 per cent last month in North America. US stocks fell back on renewed tensions between the US and China, a day after hitting two-month highs. Donald Trump said the United States will react strongly if China imposes national security laws on Hong Kong in response to last year's sometimes violent pro-democracy protests. The new tensions have raised doubts about the initial trade deal reached early this year between the world's two largest economies. Bob Shea, chief executive and co-chief investment officer at TrimTabs Asset Management in New York, said the tensions were being driven by politics. ""It seems like China is going to be used as a punching bag for the upcoming elections,"" he lamented. ""The White House has resolved to itself that it is more effective to swing at China than to salvage what was going to already be a watered-down phase one trade deal. You don't score any points for that."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 24,474, while the S&P 500 lost 0.8 per cent to 2,949. The Nasdaq Composite dropped nearly 1 per cent to 9,285. The falls were led by oil, utility, mining, consumer and tech stocks on the S&P 500. Best Buy Co fell 4.4 per cent after the electronics retailer reported a more than 5 per cent drop in quarterly same-store sales due to the virus. The S&P 500 has surged more than one-third from its March low, but it remains down about 13 per cent from its record high on February 19. European stocks also ended in the red. The FTSE 100 index fell 0.9 per cent, the DAX lost 1.4 per cent and the CAC 40 dropped 1.2 per cent. Spot gold fell more than 1 per cent to around $US1,726 an ounce. Brent crude oil gained 0.6 per cent to $US35.965 a barrel. Facebook says half of staff will work from home in future Facebook is the latest tech firm to permanently embrace remote work even after coronavirus lockdowns ease. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has told employees the world's largest social network would start ""aggressively opening up remote hiring"", and about half its workforce would work remotely over the next five to 10 years. He said workers who meet specific criteria and are interested in permanently working offsite will be able to seek approval to do so. Mr Zuckerberg said staff who move to remote work permanently and relocate may have their salaries adjusted based on their new locations. The decision follows similar announcements earlier this month by social media rival, Twitter, and payments company, Square, which were the first major technology companies to allow remote work indefinitely. Virtual private network firm, Surfshark, saw VPN sales in Hong Kong jump by 700 per cent yesterday after China said the National People's Congress will consider imposing a national security law on the semi-autonomous territory.

414,"ASX closes lower, mining stocks fall on worries China could target Australian iron ore",markets,"  ASX closes lower, mining stocks fall on worries China could target Australian iron ore The Australian share market has closed lower, weighed down by mining stocks, after reports changes to China's rules around inspecting iron ore could hit Australian exporters. Market gains came despite US Federal Reserve warnings that the pandemic created an ""extraordinary amount of uncertainty"" in the economy The changes will see imports inspected on the request of the trader or importer, as opposed to the current mandatory inspections of imports batch by batch. Shares in BHP (-0.6pc), Rio Tinto (-1pc) and Fortescue (-2.2pc) ended the session in the red, giving up early gains. China's state-owned Global Times newspaper reported that the new process would ""streamline"" inspections at the country's ports. However, the report linked the decision to rising tensions between Australia and China, quoting Yu Lei, a researcher at Liaocheng University, as saying it was ""another implicit warning to Australia"". It follows China's decision to hit Australian barley with hefty tariffs and suspend some Australian beef exporters from selling into China. However, the Australian iron ore miners have hosed down concerns about the inspection changes, with Fortescue saying they had been in the works for a while. ""Fortescue welcomes the change to the import iron ore quality inspection procedure, announced by China's General Administration of Customs,"" Fortescue chief executive Elizabeth Gaines said. ""This is part of a broader suite of efficiency reform measures under development by the Chinese Government since 2015. ""We are committed to meeting the needs of our customers and follow strict, independent quality control processes to ensure the reliability and consistency of our delivered products."" Analysts the ABC spoke to agreed the changes could benefit Australian iron ore producers such as Fortescue, BHP and Rio Tinto, which have well established relationships with Chinese importers. ""How the new policy applies, we'll have to see,"" NAB's head of commodity research Lachlan Shaw said. ""It really will come down to the preferences of the end customer and any traders of this cargo, as to how stringent they choose to be on ensuring the quality they receive is the quality they ask for."" Mr Shaw noted that it's a ""dynamic situation"" with tensions between Australia and China, and the changes do give ""a bit more flexibility in terms of interpretation"" for the buyer and the Chinese Government, but said market conditions are favourable for Australian exporters. ""The reality, if you look at the market, is that iron ore stockpiles at import ports in China have been falling all year, the iron ore price has been strong, crude steel production is now growing strongly in China … and so China needs all the iron ore it can get its hands on. ""At the same time, Brazil, which is one quarter of global supply is facing a worsening COVID-19 health situation, which the market is worried may impact supply from Brazil."" Vivek Dhar, commodities strategist at the Commonwealth Bank, said if China wanted to target Australian ore it would not have to do so through customs changes. ""Last year we actually saw this happen in February with coal, we saw coal imports into China get delayed, and it happened without any official rule change or anything such as this,"" he said. Mr Dhar said if China chose to subject Australian imports to inspections, it would not create an additional or significant delay, as inspections are currently mandatory. ""It's opt in or opt out, and with opt in, we're basically at the status quo,"" he explained. ""It's really difficult to see how one to two days is really meaningfully going to make a difference in terms of targeting Australian ore."" While Shaw and Partners analyst Peter O'Connor agreed that any immediate impact would be small, he is concerned about potential long term-ramifications of tensions between Australia and China. ""This for me is the one to focus on, and potentially lose sleep over,"" he said. Mr O'Connor said a large undeveloped iron ore deposit in Guinea could become ""a thorn in the side of Australia and Brazil"". There is still a long road ahead for funding and development of the project, which Rio Tinto has an interest in alongside Chinese company Chinalco, while a Chinese-backed consortium won the tender for another part of the deposit. ""Australian iron ore producers and the Australian Government do not want to push China's investment decision,"" Mr O'Connor said. Despite opening higher, the local share market pulled back following the falls in the big miners. The ASX 200 ended down by 0.4 per cent or 22 points at 5,550 points, while the All Ordinaries index lost a third of a per cent to 5,660. The major banks fell into the red mid-morning, led by a 1.7 per cent fall for Commonwealth Bank shares. The energy sector was the best performer, after a jump in oil prices, with shares in Beach Energy (+4.2pc), Santos (+3.3pc) and Woodside (+0.7pc) closing higher. Shares in mining services contractor NRW Holdings leapt by 32.7 per cent after the company said it would pay an interim dividend after all, as it was on track to meet its revenue guidance. The Australian dollar climbed overnight to around 65.97 US cents, thanks in part to a lower greenback. That was the highest level for the Aussie dollar since early March, but by 4:30pm (AEST) it had pulled back to around 65.5 US cents. US markets rose despite its central bank saying it was deeply worried about the economic fallout from a second wave of coronavirus infections and the impact on poorer people. Minutes from the Federal Reserve's April meeting show officials were concerned about the excessive damage the virus was doing to the economy and the potential for damage ahead. ""Participants commented that, in addition to weighing heavily on economic activity in the near term, the economic effects of the pandemic created an extraordinary amount of uncertainty and considerable risks to economic activity in the medium term,"" the minutes noted. Officials also pointed to the impact that company bankruptcies could have on the banking sector. The Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep its federal funds rate on hold at 0 to 0.25 per cent and flagged more stimulus ahead. Despite the Fed's pessimism, US stocks rose, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq reaching their highest close since early March amid optimism about economies reopening and hopes of more central bank largesse. The Dow Jones index increased 1.5 per cent to 24,576. The S&P 500 gained 49 points, or 1.7 per cent, to 2,972, and the Nasdaq Composite added 191 points, or 2.1 per cent, to 9,376. Tech firms led the market higher and Facebook and Amazon rose to record levels. Energy was the top-performing sector on the S&P 500. But Target shares declined 2.9 per cent after the retailer reported that quarterly profit plunged by two-thirds as costs related to the coronavirus outbreak outweighed a surge in online sales. Kim Forrest, founder and chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in the US, said low interest rates were fuelling investor demand. ""We have way lower interest rates for the foreseeable future, so that effects the multiple that we have to buy discounted stocks at,"" she said. ""And if you give yourself a little bit more time, is it crazy to think everything is going to come back in two years and you are going to hold it three to five years?"" More government stimulus is also on the cards, with the US House of Representatives planning to vote next week on giving small businesses more time to use coronavirus aid under the Paycheck Protection Program. Stocks rose in Europe, with the FTSE 100 up 1.1 per cent, the DAX up 1.3 per cent and the CAC 40 putting on 0.9 per cent. But there was more economic pain with luxury car and aviation engine maker Rolls-Royce planning to lay-off at least 9,000 jobs, or more than a sixth of its workforce. The company, which makes engines for planes such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, said it is looking at closing factories as it shrinks to fit the smaller market it expects to emerge from the crisis. Airlines and their supplies have been among the hardest-hit businesses by lockdowns to contain the coronavirus pandemic, with passenger air travel grinding to a virtual halt. Rolls-Royce shares rose 2.3 per cent in London overnight. Britain, like many other economies, is also bracing for a deep recession, with jobless claims in April leaping to the highest in nearly 24 years.

416,"ASX rallies on Wall St bounce back, energy stocks lead the way on oil supply cuts",markets,"  ASX rallies on Wall St bounce back, energy stocks lead the way on oil supply cuts The Australian share market rallies after gains on Wall Street that were fuelled by a surprise Saudi oil-production cut and a steep rise in crude prices. The benchmark ASX 200 index closed 1.4 per cent higher at 5,405. Commodity and energy producers were leading the market after Saudi Arabia surprised traders by announcing a unilateral cut of an additional 1 million barrels per day, taking its oil output to the lowest level since 2002. West Texas crude oil jumped around 10 per cent before closing trade at $US26.90 a barrel, while Brent also climbed to $US32.33. RBC Capital Markets head of global commodity strategy Helima Croft noted that, while the supply equation was becoming more balanced, there was no sign of a major pick-up in demand in the key US market yet. ""Frankly, US driving has not improved over the past week,"" she wrote. ""The rebound roadmap is long and arduous, given many cities regressed since the surge seen earlier this month. ""Dallas, Houston and Atlanta, all major gasoline-guzzling cities in states that have reopened, have all seen traffic taper from recent improvement. ""While lockdown restrictions are easing, the traffic tracker provides a lens into real-time human activity, reinforcing again that societal behaviour, not state-level policies, will drive gasoline demand."" Other commodities generally gained overnight, with spot gold rising to $US1,729.27, while iron ore spot prices remained above $US90 a tonne. The materials sector, which covers miners, jumped more than 3 per cent with gains between 2-5 per cent for the big players, helped by news that Chinese industrial production was recovering from the coronavirus lockdown. Elsewhere on the Australian market, the major banks gained between 1.2 and 2.1 per cent, with Westpac leading the way despite admitting to 23 million breaches of anti-money laundering laws in a defence filed to the Federal Court in a case brought against it by regulator AUSTRAC. GrainCorp had the biggest non-mining gain among the top 200 listed companies, jumping 7.1 per cent to $3.93 on a better-than-expected first-half profit result. Jewellery chain Michael Hill is the latest retailer to reopen stores as coronavirus restrictions are eased, but it is also planning to close more stores. The jeweller will reopen nearly 100 Australian stores this Sunday, with measures in place to limit the spread of coronavirus. This includes stickers on the floor to ensure social distancing and perspex screens at the cash register to protect sales staff and customers. It said more shops would reopen gradually over the coming month, while 25 New Zealand stores would reopen on Sunday as well. However, the jeweller has decided to permanently close five stores in Australia, three in New Zealand and one in Canada. The retailer has warned that more store closures are coming across all markets as it renegotiates leases and runs the ruler over profitability. At the same time, Michael Hill said it had seen record online sales for the past three weeks, outshining its previous record online sales at Christmas time. Earlier this week, department store Myer announced that it was reopening a further eight stores, mainly in regional NSW, as well as WA and SA. That will bring a total of 15 Myer stores back into trade out of the 60 stores it was running ahead of COVID-19 restrictions, with the retailer's flagship Melbourne and Sydney CBD stores still shut. Last Friday saw Premier Investments — which owns the Just Jeans, Jay Jays, Smiggle, Portmans and Dotti brands — reopen most of its stores, although it has warned it may permanently shut many of its stores if commercial landlords do not significantly reduce their rents to reflect tougher trading conditions. In the US, the New York Stock Exchange trading floor will begin a phased reopening on May 26. Meanwhile, Amazon has confirmed to CNBC that a sixth warehouse worker has died of coronavirus. The 59-year-old man, who sorted packages at an Amazon distribution centre in New York, died on April 9. The online giant is under pressure to reveal the number of employees who have tested positive or died from the virus. Warehouse workers have asked the company to increase safety protections including paid sick leave and the closure of warehouses with virus outbreaks for cleaning. US president Donald Trump has reignited fears of renewed trade tensions with China after saying he had no interest in speaking to Chinese President Xi Jinping right now because of the coronavirus pandemic. In an interview with Fox Business Network, he even suggested cutting ties with the world's second-largest economy Mr Trump said he was very disappointed with China's failure to contain the virus, saying he thought the pandemic had damaged the US trade deal with Beijing. Meanwhile, the fallout from the virus continues to devastate the US labour market. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits reached nearly 3 million last week. That was down from 3.17 million the previous week. So far, more 36 million people have filed claims for unemployment benefits since mid-March, equating to more than one-in-five workers losing their jobs. Despite Mr Trump's comments and the bad employment news, US stocks ended higher, recovering some of this week's losses after a volatile night. The Dow Jones index put on 1.6 per cent, or 377 points, to 23,625. The S&P 500 gained 1.15 per cent while the Nasdaq rose 0.9 per cent. Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but consumer staples closed higher, with financials and energy companies enjoying the biggest percentage gains. Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York, said market moves were being dictated by a battle over time frames. ""Those pushing the market up believe we're going to get a vaccine in a reasonable amount of time, the economy isn't totally going to fall apart, that unemployment is not going to spike appreciably higher,"" he said. ""On days when [the market is] pushed down, the naysayers come to the forefront, when it bounces back up, the more optimistic investors see an opportunity."" However, European stocks were in the red, with the FTSE 100 losing 2.75 per cent, the DAX down 1.95 per cent and the CAC 40 falling 1.65 per cent. The Australian dollar was steady at 64.6 US cents after falling to 64.2 US cents yesterday on the news nearly 600,000 Australians lost their jobs in April.

417,"ASX ends sharply lower, Aussie dollar slips on job losses",markets,"  The Australian share market and dollar fall after nearly 600,000 jobs lost last month The Australian share market has closed in the red, while the Australian dollar has slipped following news of steep job losses and a sharp drop in workforce participation last month. The ASX 200 index ended the session down by 1.7 per cent at 5,328 points, its low point of the session. The All Ordinaries index lost 1.7 per cent or 95 points to 5,418. By 4:35pm AEST, the Australian dollar was down 0.2 per cent against the greenback, to around 64.4 US cents, after falling to around 64.2 US cents following the Bureau of Statistic's labour force figures for April. While the unemployment rate did not rise as sharply as forecast, increasing from 5.2 per cent in March to 6.2 per cent in April, the participation rate tumbled to a near-16 year low. The participation rate fell to 63.5 per cent as around 490,000 people left the labour force, with many losing jobs and not looking for other work. All sectors of the local share market ended in the red, led by financials and energy — shares in Commonwealth Bank (-3.2pc), NAB (-2.6pc), ANZ (-2.6pc) and Westpac (-2.4pc) were weighing on the broader market, as were Santos (-3.4pc) and Woodside (-2.9pc). Shares in appliances group Breville (+6.7pc) rose, after returning to trade following a $94 million share placement to institutional investors. Agribusiness Graincorp (+11.6pc) was the best performer on the ASX 200, after the company revealed it had swung to a profit in the first half. US stocks fell sharply for the second day in a row overnight, after the head of the US central bank warned of an extended economic downturn because of the coronavirus pandemic. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the US economy would take some time to recover from the government lockdowns and business shutdowns caused by the virus outbreak. He made the remarks in a webcast speech for the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Mr Powell pointed to uncertainty over how well future outbreaks of the virus could be controlled and how quickly a vaccine or therapy could be developed. He said policymakers needed to be ready to address ""a range"" of possible outcomes. ""It will take some time to get back to where we were,"" Mr Powell cautioned. ""There is a sense, growing sense I think, that the recovery may come more slowly than we would like. But it will come, and that may mean that it's necessary for us to do more."" The Fed chairman vowed to use the US central bank's power as needed and called for more stimulus from the US Government. The Fed has already pumped trillions of dollars into the US financial system and has essentially pledged to do whatever it takes to save the US economy, although Mr Powell talked down any prospect of negative interest rates in the US. Mr Powell's remarks and intensifying US-China tensions saw Wall Street slump to a three-week low. The Dow Jones index fell 2.2 per cent, or 517 points, to 23,248. In economic news, US producer prices fell in April by the most since the global financial crisis, the largest annual decline in more than four years. Stocks also fell in Europe, with the FTSE 100 index in London losing 1.5 per cent to 5,904. UK manufacturing, construction and industrial production all fell over March and the trade deficit widened. That saw the UK economy contract by 5.8 per cent over the month, less than expected. Oil prices fell, with West Texas crude at $US25.48 a barrel and the global benchmark Brent price at $US29.51, down 1.6 per cent. Spot gold was higher at $US1,714.38 an ounce. More than 300 legislators from around the world have called on the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to cancel the debt of the poorest countries in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The appeal came in a letter sent to the heads of the World Bank and the IMF, as well as US President Donald Trump and other world leaders, amid growing concern the pandemic would devastate developing countries and emerging economies. They have also asked for more funding to avert a global economic meltdown and have urged the institutions to respond in 15 days. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said this week the fund was ""very likely"" to revise downward its forecast that global output would shrink by 3 per cent in 2020, and said developing countries would need more than $US2.5 trillion in financing to weather the storm. Former US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who led the initiative along with Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said poor countries needed every cent to care for their people, instead of servicing the ""unsustainable debts"" they owed to the large international financial institutions.

419,Trade tensions with China lead Australian farmers to reduce barley plantings,markets," ABC Rural China's tariff threats on Australian barley force farmers to pause mid-planting Australian grain farmers have stopped sowing barley mid-stream in some paddocks as they brace for lower prices and the prospect of losing a major market in a brewing trade storm. At the weekend, farmers were told by Australian grain groups that China was proposing to place tariffs on barley imported from Australia as a result of an 18 month anti-dumping and countervailing duties investigation. The tariffs, which grain groups said could total up to 80 per cent, threaten the viability of the $1.5 billion barley trade into China. About 88 per cent of Australia's barley exports to China come from Western Australia, and some growers in that state were now changing their cropping plans mid-way through seeding. Alan Sattler, who farms at Beverley and Kellerberrin in the WA Wheatbelt, has sown most of his barley crop already, said he would switch away from barley and into wheat for some paddocks yet to be sown. ""At Beverley, we had 250 hectares of barley pegged — we'll drop that out and go to wheat,"" he said. ""Who knows what's going to happen, but we're changing it purely on speculation that the price of barley might drop."" Mr Sattler said he was optimistic the barley trade into China may be resolved by harvest time, and he believed a feed market for WA barley into the east of Australia would also help keep prices up, but farmers around him were reacting. ""A fella I saw today tweeted if you're sitting on the front porch this morning, 'You would have heard 3,950 augers being transferred from barley to wheat,'"" he said. Western Australia's Agriculture Minister Alannah MacTiernan said the state's dominant share of the barley trade with China meant its growers were in the ""firing line"" of tensions between Canberra and Beijing. Ms MacTiernan said the imposition of tariffs on Australia barley exports to China would cost WA growers ""hundreds of millions of dollars a year"". She argued it was incumbent on Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Trade Minister Simon Birmingham to head off the tariffs, based on China's concerns about the Australian diesel fuel rebate and drought support. ""To be honest, a couple of months ago we had some thought that we were going to be successful,"" Ms MacTiernan said. ""A very, very strong case has been put by the traders and by DFAT [Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade] really answering all of the claims and, I think, pretty clearly establishing that there is no case for dumping, nor case for arguing that barley is being subsidised."" Asked whether she thought China was threatening tariffs in retaliation for Mr Morrison's call for an inquiry into the origin and spread of the coronavirus, Ms MacTiernan said: ""Everyone is in the same position as I am in terms of ability to judge that."" ""I think it is really important for us to maintain good relationships with all of our trading partners and, of course, WA is very exposed on all fronts,"" she said. Grain Trade Australia chief executive Pat O'Shannassy said while the tariffs were not imposed yet, there were big consequences at stake. ""If we do end up with the tariffs that have been indicated, that would effectively halt the export of barley to China as we know it to date,"" he said. ""There would be impacts in China as well as in Australia, noting of course that there will be other origins that China will look to [for barley], but there has been a strong relationship particularly around the quality of malt barley in China."" Mr O'Shannassy said barley prices had been supported by rising domestic demand because of drought, but he expected China's tariff plans to have the opposite effect. ""There will be continued demand domestically, there will be an impact on barley prices most likely around this and the market will end up determining where that gets to,"" he said. WA Farmers grains section president Mic Fels said the move was politically motivated, but China was entitled to do what it was doing, and Australia was entitled to respond. ""The only losers are the beer drinkers and the lot feeders in China and the grain growers of Australia,"" he said. ""It's not a very effective trade tool to be using, I don't think, if they want to get political outcomes."" Mr Fels said China was a relatively new market for large-scale barley exports, and other markets existed for the grain. ""The Saudi [feed] market is still there for us and so is Indonesia, and with the new trade agreement there's a big market there for us [in] Japan, South Korea,"" he said. ""We've got other markets for barley, they probably don't pay quite as well as the Chinese. ""[But] we used to grow barley economically selling into those markets so I can't see why we can't do it again. ""I don't think the sky is falling in. ""It's disappointing and it might affect planting decisions, but if we have to sell into those other markets it's not like we've got nowhere to send the grain."" NSW Farmers Association president James Jackson said he did not think there was a link between the tariff threat and the political stoush about an investigation into the source of COVID-19. ""The Australian agricultural sector is one of the least subsidised in the OECD, so it's absolute rubbish,"" he said. ""It's a kick in the guts for people planting a barley crop as we speak. ""We don't dump grain, we can't afford to, and characterising the fuel subsidies and the non-existent drought package as subsidies — it's not correct."" The Australian Government and barley exporters have been given ten days to respond to China.

420,"Banks defer repayments on more than 600,000 loans, Macquarie halves dividend",markets,"  Australian shares rises, banks defer repayments on more than 600,000 loans due to coronavirus fallout The Australian share market has closed higher, with Macquarie Group rising strongly despite the financial group slashing its dividend, while retail stocks rallied on the Government's planned easing of coronavirus restrictions. The ASX 200 gained 0.5 per cent to 5,391 points, off its earlier highs, while the All Ordinaries index gained 0.7 per cent, or 38 points, to 5,488. Consumer stocks rallied in afternoon trade after Prime Minister Scott Morrison revealed a three-step plan to ease restrictions. Shares in Myer, which is trialling the reopening of some of its Queensland stores, surged 45 per cent to 29 cents. Other retailers and travel stocks rose, including Super Retail (+6.6 per cent), Retail Food Group (+13.2 per cent), Harvey Norman (+6.7 per cent), Flight Centre (+8.1 per cent) and Webjet (+9.3 per cent). Shares in Macquarie Group gained 5.7 per cent to $105.19, despite halving its dividend payout. The company announced an 8.4 per cent drop in full year profit to $2.7 billion and slashed its final dividend to $1.80 per share, compared to $3.60 a year ago. Will the COVID-19 economic slump be as bad for Australia's financial institutions as the early '90s recession? You can bank on it, writes Ian Verrender. It did not provide guidance on its profit for the current financial year due to the coronavirus pandemic. ""The extent to which these conditions will impact the Group’s overall FY21 profitability is uncertain, making short-term forecasting extremely difficult,"" Macquarie said. UBS banking analysts said the decision not to provide guidance was appropriate and the outlook remained challenging, but the result was in line with downgraded expectations. Meantime, banks continue to defer loan repayments, as customers grapple with the financial fallout of the coronavirus crisis. The Australian Banking Association (ABA) said a further 100,000 loans were deferred over the past week, half of which were home loans. That takes the total value of loans deferred to at least $200 billion, across 643,000 loans. ""The surge in demand for assistance from banks shows that the economic impacts continue to be felt, and by no means is the nation through this crisis,"" ABA chief executive Anna Bligh said. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic has seen News Corporation post a $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) loss for the March quarter. The media giant wrote down the value of its part-owned Foxtel pay TV service and its News America Marketing division by $US1.1 billion. Revenue fell by 8 per cent over the year to $US2.3 billion, due to a drop in advertising revenue at the News and Information Services division and Foxtel, as well as currency fluctuations. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. Chief executive Robert Thomson said there were more cuts to come with a strategic review of costs across its business, particularly in its news division, including a review of its newspaper printing operations. Last month, News Corp suspended print production at 60 community newspapers across Australia. Foxtel saw lower advertising revenue after the shutdown of sports including AFL and NRL because of coronavirus restrictions. Mr Thomson said Foxtel was renegotiating with television stations, Nine and Seven, to get lower fees for the broadcast rights for the AFL and NRL and said it was time for a ""fundamental reset"" of the cost. ""The idea that things will suddenly return to normal this season is absurd. It's not just the quantity of games, but the quality of the experience and that has obviously been diminished,"" he said. ""That reset has to apply longer term to rights in Australia, in essence there is a new reset reality."" Australian-listed shares of News Corp rose 5.3 per cent, while shares in Telstra, a part-owner of Foxtel, closed down by 1 per cent. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic The Bank of England (BoE) has warned Britain could be headed for its biggest economic slump in more than 300 years because of the coronavirus lockdown. It has predicted that the UK economy could shrink by 14 per cent in 2020 and kept the door open for more stimulus next month. It also warned that Britain's economy may contract by as much as one quarter over the three months to June, and unemployment could more than double to 9 per cent of the workforce. A 14 per cent contraction for 2020 would be the worst recession since a ""Great Frost"" in 1709. However, the UK central bank sees a sharp economic bounce back next year with growth of 15 per cent if lockdown restrictions are eased over the coming months. As efforts to control COVID-19 appear to be gaining traction, many analysts and traders are hoping for a quick return to business as usual. They're likely to be disappointed, writes Ian Verrender. The BoE kept its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.1 per cent and left its target for bond-buying at 645 billion pounds ($1.2 trillion). Governor Andrew Bailey said the central bank was ready to further increase stimulus to help the economy recover from the damage caused by coronavirus. ""There is clearly a commitment and a determination to take action should we need to do so,"" Mr Bailey told reporters. ""I would really leave that strong message with you."" He said the bank expected ""the recovery of the economy to happen over time, though much more rapidly than the pull back from the global financial crisis"". The BoE said inflation was likely to fall below 1 per cent in the next few months, half the bank's target, but that recent figures suggested demand had stabilised, albeit at very low levels. Across the Atlantic, millions more Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, bringing total job losses over the past seven weeks to 33.5 million. Nearly 3.2 million claims for unemployment benefits were made last week, slightly more than estimated by economists. That was down from the previous week's tally of more than 3.8 million. Tonight the latest US unemployment figures are out and economists are predicting a jobless rate of 16 per cent for April. On US markets, the Nasdaq Composite regained its losses for the year boosted by upbeat profit results and the big tech firms known as the FAANGs — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet, Google's parent company. The share market prices companies based on their future earnings, and the April rally shows traders expect the COVID-19 economic shutdowns to end soon, writes David Taylor. PayPal jumped 14 per cent after it said it expected a strong recovery in payment volumes this quarter as more people shop online because of the coronavirus pandemic. Stocks have rebounded sharply since late March from the coronavirus-fuelled sell-off, helped by massive monetary and fiscal stimulus by the world's central banks and governments.

421,"ASX falls, miners rise as iron ore drives record trade surplus",markets,"  The Australian share market falls, miners rise as iron ore drives a record trade surplus in March The Australian share market has closed lower, dragged down by the major banks, but mining stocks have risen after iron ore exports contributed to a record trade surplus in March. The ASX 200 ended down by 0.4 per cent at 5,364 points, while the All Ordinaries index lost 0.3 per cent to 5,449. The major bank stocks all fell sharply, including Westpac (-2.3 per cent), NAB (-2.2 per cent), ANZ (-2.2 per cent) and Commonwealth Bank (-1.8 per cent). Energy stocks also weighed on the broader market, with falls for Oil Search (-2.7 per cent), Santos (-1.9 per cent) and Woodside (-1.4 per cent). Mining stocks lifted in afternoon trade, including BHP (+1.9 per cent) and Fortescue (+1.7 per cent), while Rio Tinto finished in the red (-0.6 per cent). It followed a surge in iron ore exports, which rose by around a third in March as some Chinese factories reopened. The Bureau of Statistics says Australia posted a record trade surplus in the month as exports rose while imports fell due to the coronavirus pandemic hitting global supply chains. Exports jumped by 15 per cent or just over $5.5 billion, seasonally adjusted, to $42.4 billion, with a rise in shipments of iron ore, coal, gold and meat. ""We think some of the rise in iron ore exports reflects catch-up demand from the previous month, which saw a week of limited shipping activity due to Cyclone Damien,"" ANZ economists said. Services exports, such as tourism and education, dropped by 9 per cent or nearly $730 million. Income from travel dropped by $657 million, while income from travel-related services was down $734 million in the month. That was offset by a 4 per cent, or nearly $1.2 billion, fall in imports, in particular, travel and transport services. There was a also a drop in aircraft imports over the month, leaving a record trade surplus of $10.6 billion in March, an increase of $6.7 billion from February. The Australian dollar gained some ground, to about 64.4 US cents. Private employers in the US laid off a record 20.2 million workers last month as a forced shutdown of business to stem the COVID-19 outbreak savaged the economy. The ADP National Employment Report suggested that lockdowns in the US to slow the spread of the coronavirus could leave lasting scars on the economy. In addition, the figures for March were revised up to show private payrolls falling by 149,000 jobs over the month. That is instead of the previously reported 27,000 and is the first decline since September 2017. Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York, said the latest numbers indicated a deep economic downturn. ""One thing for sure is that this pandemic health crisis has produced depression-magnitude job losses, which means this recovery is going to take longer than many are thinking,"" he said. ""The Great Depression lasted three-and-a-half years, and it will be a miracle if the economy gets anywhere near back to normal within the next couple of years."" More companies announced layoffs overnight, including ridesharing firm Uber, which plans to sack 3,700 employees. The cuts to its customer support and recruiting teams represent about 14 per cent of its nearly 27,000 employees. Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi will also forgo his base salary for the rest of the year. His salary was $US1 million ($1.56 million) in 2019. Uber said the cost of redundancies would be around $US20 million. Mr Khosrowshahi said in a letter to staff that ""days like this are brutal"" and indicated there could be more job cuts to come. Rideshare rival Lyft announced a loss of $US398.1 million from sales of $US956 million, which was better than expected. The number of active users taking a Lyft trip fell over the first few months of 2020 compared to the last few months of 2019. Yesterday, accommodation sharing giant Airbnb announced that a quarter of its global workforce was being laid off. Meanwhile, another Amazon worker has died from coronavirus, according to CNBC. The employee, who worked at an Amazon warehouse in the US Mid-West, passed away on April 18 and his last day at the facility was on March 19. The death comes after Amazon warehouse employees raised concerns that the company was not doing enough to protect them from catching COVID-19 at work. As digital giants come under fire for misinformation about coronavirus on their platforms, Facebook has announced the first 20 members of its oversight board. The board is an independent body that can overturn the company's content moderation decisions. The members include former editor-in-chief of The Guardian newspaper Alan Rusbridger, retired judge and former European Court of Human Rights vice-president Andras Sajo, and law professor Nicolas Suzor from the Queensland University of Technology. On the markets, the Dow Jones index fell for first time in three days in a late sell-off on the job layoff news. The Dow lost 0.9 per cent to 23,665. The broader S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent to 2,848.42 and the Nasdaq Composite added 45 points, or half a per cent, to 8,854.

However, shares in Harvey Norman (+4.3 per cent), Kathmandu (+10.2 per cent), Retail Food Group (+36.4 per cent) and JB Hi-Fi (+3.4 per cent) rose. Kathmandu has announced a staged reopening of its retail stores, with most Kathmandu and Rip Curl stores in Australia expected to be open by the end of the week. The retailer says online sales were two-and-a-half to three times higher in April, compared to last year. Myer will trial the reopening of five Queensland stores from this Friday, following the easing of some restrictions by the Queensland Government. JB Hi-Fi has kept the The Good Guys chain open and most of its JB Hi-Fi stores in Australia, but has shut some airport and CBD stores in response to falling foot traffic. In an update to the market, it said comparable sales in JB Hi-Fi Australian stores rose 11.3 per cent in the first quarter of the year, while The Good Guys sales rose 13.9 per cent. Sales at JB Hi-Fi New Zealand stores were down 3.3 per cent, after coronavirus restrictions forced closures. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has confirmed a record surge in retail turnover, beating the spike in sales ahead of the introduction of the GST in June 2000. Sales rose 8.5 per cent in March, surpassing the preliminary estimate of an 8.2 per cent rise, as coronavirus concerns drove panic buying of pantry staples, canned foods and toilet paper. Supermarket and grocery store sales rose 23 per cent, while liquor sales increased more than 30 per cent, sales of hardware and garden supplies increased 17 per cent and electronics rose 11 per cent. However, clothing sales tumbled nearly 26 per cent in the month, department stores suffered a 9 per cent decline and cafes and restaurants saw turnover fall by 30 per cent. It's close to 30 years since Australia's last recession, which saw vast numbers of people lose their jobs or struggle to break into the workforce, as another recession looms, writes Stephen Long. Economists have forecast a fall in total sales in April as the stockpiling subsided and job and income losses hit discretionary spending. Retail volumes, which are adjusted for price, rose 0.7 per cent over the first three months of the year. ""Much of the growth in retail sales was driven by price rises, probably reflecting scarcity of goods and price gouging, rather than more volume being pushed out the door,"" Indeed economist Callam Pickering said. Sarah Hunter from BIS Oxford Economics said the impact of the bushfires was clear, with the volume of sales falling in New South Wales and the ACT across the quarter, compared to the other states which recorded increases. ""Strong demand and the ongoing impact of the drought and bushfires on food supply chains (particularly meat products) meant that retail prices rose by around 2 per cent on the quarter, a sharp jump up from the end of 2019,"" Dr Hunter said. The corporate regulator has warned of the risks to individual investors who try and engage in short-term trading of stocks, after a spike in the frequency of trading. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) says the number of different securities traded each day has also increased rapidly, while the length of time they are held has significantly decreased, ""indicating a concerning increase in short-term and 'day-trading' activity"". The share market prices companies based on their future earnings, and the April rally shows traders expect the COVID-19 economic shutdowns to end soon, writes David Taylor. The regulator tracked trading through retail brokers from February 24, shortly after the peak on the local market, to April 3, compared to the prior six months as a benchmark. The average daily turnover for brokers increased from $1.6 billion in the benchmark period to $3.3 billion. New trading accounts were created at a rate 3.4 times higher than during the benchmark period, and more than 142,000 dormant accounts that had not traded in the previous six months started trading again. With the coronavirus crisis creating significant volatility, ASIC is warning retail investors against chasing quick profits by playing the market. ""The analysis suggested few pursuing quick windfalls were successful,"" ASIC said. ""During the focus period, on more than two-thirds of the days on which retail investors were net buyers, their share prices declined the following day. On days where retail investors were net sellers, their share prices more likely increased the next day."" The regulator also expressed concern at increased trading in ""complex, often high-risk investment products"", including highly-geared exchange trade products and contracts for difference (CFDs). ""In the week of 16-22 March 2020, for example, retail clients' net losses from trading CFDs were $234 million for a sample of 12 CFD providers."" The coronavirus pandemic is continuing to wreak havoc on the travel industry, with home rental firm Airbnb the latest to lay off staff. The short-stay accommodation provider plans to lay off one-quarter of its employees, or 1,900 people out of its 7,500-strong workforce. The company will also halt projects related to hotels, transport and luxury accommodation. For those renters who still have their jobs, thousands of former Airbnbs hitting the long-term rental market mean bargains can be had in top locations. Yet another airline is sacking staff, with UK-based Virgin Atlantic planning to sack 3,150 people and move its London Gatwick operations to Heathrow Airport as the coronavirus pandemic bites. Virgin will restructure the company and has begun a 45-day consultation period with UK trade unions about the layoffs. The cruise industry has also been virtually wiped out due to a spate of coronavirus cases on ships, including Carnival Cruise Line's Ruby Princess, which became the largest source of coronavirus infections in Australia when 2,700 passengers were allowed to disembark at Sydney's Circular Quay on March 19. The latest casualty is the world's third-largest cruise ship company. Norwegian Cruise Line Corporation warned it may file for bankruptcy protection with ""substantial doubt"" about its ability to continue a going concern. Its shares plunged by nearly 23 per cent to $US11.18 ($17.37) after it sought to raise $US2 billion in equity and debt financing. It announced a $US600 million four-year secured junk bond. Find out more The US trade deficit increased by the most in more than a year in March, as a record drop in exports was offset by a shrinking import bill. And the US services industry contracted by the most in 10 years because of tough measures imposed across the country to stem the spread of coronavirus. The ISM non-manufacturing index fell to 41.8 in April. The ""road out"" of coronavirus may head in an entirely different direction to the one we travelled towards the chasm and the bridge to cross it may need to be much longer than many now imagine, warns Ian Verrender. Despite the bad news, US stocks made strong gains as oil prices continued to recover, healthcare stocks rallied and more US states and other countries eased coronavirus restrictions. Pharmaceutical firm Pfizer jumped 2.4 per cent after it said it and its German partner had started delivering doses of an experimental coronavirus vaccine for human testing. However, stocks pulled back sharply after Richard Clarinda, the vice-chairman of the US Federal Reserve, warned about the depth of the economic downturn. He said US unemployment could soar to levels not seen since the 1940s during the current June quarter because of coronavirus-induced economic shutdowns. '""We're living through the most severe contraction in activity and surge in unemployment that we've seen in our lifetimes,"" Mr Clarinda told CNBC. He added there was a chance a recovery could start in the second half of the year, with the Fed throwing the kitchen sink and more at the economy. In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent, or 133 points, to 23,883. The S&P 500 index put on 0.9 per cent to 2,868 and the Nasdaq Composite index increased by 1.1 per cent to 8,809. Stocks also rose in Europe, with the CAC 40 in Paris adding 2.4 per cent to 4,483, the DAX in Germany rising by 2.5 per cent to 10,729 and the FTSE 100 in London increasing by 2.4 per cent to 5,849. Investors brushed off more gloomy economic data, with the services industry slumping to 13.4 points in the UK. Any figure below 50 represents a contraction. Just a small number of cars were sold in the UK last month, with vehicle sales plunging by 97 per cent to the lowest level since 1946, just after the end of World War II. As efforts to control COVID-19 appear to be gaining traction, many analysts and traders are hoping for a quick return to business as usual. They're likely to be disappointed, writes Ian Verrender. Just 4,321 new cars were registered in April after car showrooms were forced to close because of government restrictions. There are also fears that a German court ruling could challenge the authority of the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide stimulus for the continent. The constitutional court ruled that Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, should stop cooperating with the ECB's $US2 trillion bond-buying program because it was a breach of German law. The ECB has three months to prove its past and present stimulus is not excessive. US Federal Reserve official James Bullard warned the ruling was a ""stress test"" for Europe. ""This will be the second time we have been in a major crisis where the ECB has been put under heavy pressure,"" the St Louis Federal Reserve chairman said. ""It is very tough going, lots of negotiation, lots of question marks about what policies would even be acceptable or allowable."" Oil prices continued to rise as production cuts kick in and on hopes of a rise in fuel demand as countries ease coronavirus restrictions. West Texas crude oil jumped by one quarter to $US25.45 a barrel. Spot gold came off its overnight high to $US1,704.36 an ounce.

423,"ASX rises as Qantas rallies, Wall Street rebounds on tech gains",markets,"  The Australian share market has closed higher, led by energy stocks, while Qantas shares rose after the airline took on more debt to get through the coronavirus crisis. The ASX 200 gained 1.6 per cent to 5,407 points, while the All Ordinaries index finished 88 points higher at 5,478. The energy sector led the broad-based gains, as oil prices rose — Brent crude gained 5.4 per cent to $US28.66 a barrel. Energy stocks including Santos (+5pc), Woodside (+4.4pc) and Origin Energy (+5.5pc) made gains. Qantas shares gained 1.7 per cent to $3.62, after initially climbing as much as 5.6 per cent higher. The airline has obtained an additional $550 million in debt funding, secured against three of its Boeing 787-9 aircraft, and says it could raises extra funds against other aircraft assets if needed. Until a new airline can establish itself as a formidable competitor to almighty Qantas, consumers may lose out with higher fares and reduced flight options writes Nassim Khadem. Qantas expects to burn through cash at a rate of $40 million per week by the end of June. Flight cancellations have been extended across Qantas and Jetstar, with domestic and New Zealand flight cuts now running until the end of June, and international capacity cuts to remain in place through to the end of July. However, the airline says there is some capacity for domestic and trans-Tasman flights to be added back in if restrictions are eased in coming weeks. It says more than 25,000 employees have been stood down. ""The current stand-down of employees will now be extended until at least the end of June,"" Qantas said. ""The impact of this stand-down is deeply regrettable but has been greatly softened by the Australian Government's JobKeeper program."" Collins Foods, the company behind franchises including 240 KFC stores in Australia, was the best performing stock on the ASX 200, with shares closing up by 11.6 per cent to $7.68. The company said KFC stores in shopping centre food courts had been heavily affected by a drop in foot traffic due to coronavirus restrictions, but sales grew across the remainder of its network, which is largely made up of drive-through restaurants. Stocks on Wall Street ended higher overnight, led by gains for technology giants, offsetting concerns about renewed tensions between the US and China. Rising oil prices also helped lift the major US indices, which had opened lower but edged up to end a two-session losing streak. If ever you needed convincing that financial markets have become completely divorced from reality, just look at Wall Street's wild swings, writes Ian Verrender. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 26 points or 0.1 per cent to 23,750 after a volatile session. The S&P 500 gained 12 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 2,843 and the Nasdaq Composite added 106 points, or 1.2 per cent, to 8,711. Gains in Microsoft, Apple and Amazon were the biggest lifts for the S&P 500. Sentiment was helped by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo outlining a phased reopening of business in the US state hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey, said caution remained. ""Can you lift restrictions and begin to phase in economic activity and yet keep the number of cases at bay? That is what the market is focused on right now,"" he said. Billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway held its annual meeting and announced it had dumped its stakes in airline stocks, sending the sector tumbling. Shares in Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines fell between 5 and 8 per cent. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic The US Treasury Department plans to borrow a record $US3 trillion in the second quarter of 2020 as it battles the economic destruction from the coronavirus. In a statement, the Treasury said it would borrow $US2.99 trillion over April to June, more than it would borrow in a normal year. Total US government debt is nearly $US25 trillion and the deficit for the current financial year stands at $US744 billion. Economic indicators continued to show the fallout of the pandemic — new orders for US-made products suffered a record fall last month. Factory orders dropped 10.3 per cent, the largest decrease since the series started in 1992, while over the year to March they declined 2.8 per cent. It was a sea of red on European markets amid their own weak manufacturing data, with heavy falls in Paris (-4.2pc), Frankfurt (-3.6pc) and for the pan-European Stoxx 50 index (-2.3pc). London's FTSE 100 posted a more modest 0.2 per cent decline to 5,754 points. Business groups and leaders have called for Australians to download the Federal Government's COVIDSafe. More than one hundred prominent Australians have urged the community to download the coronavirus tracking app to head off a second wave of infections. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. The former boss of the defence force, Air Chief Marshall Sir Angus Houston, and Commonwealth Bank chair Catherine Livingstone are among the individuals and organisations who have made the call on the 'Endorse CovidSafe' website set up by University of Sydney academics. Major Australian companies, including Coles and Woolworths, associations such as the National Rugby League and the Australian Banking Association, and small business owners have also publicly encouraged people to install the app. Website co-founder, University of Sydney economics professor Robert Slonim, said not enough people had signed up to CovidSafe and that would make it it hard to contact trace if there was another wave of infections, as happened in Singapore. Find out more ""We are concerned citizens who believe that without a massive immediate downloading of the app in Australia then not enough people will install the technology for it to be effective,"" Professor Slonim said. ""With government restrictions now being eased and without effective contact tracing, there is the big risk of a second wave of infections.""

424,"ASX rises as Afterpay surges on Chinese investment, job ads plunge",markets,"  ASX rises as Afterpay surges on Tencent investment, job ads halve on coronavirus hit The Australian share market has closed higher, shaking off a negative start to the session as the major bank stocks climbed out of the red. The benchmark ASX 200 index closed up by 1.4 per cent to 5,319 points, while the All Ordinaries index had gained 1.2 per cent, or 64 points, to 5,389. The energy sector finished slightly lower but recouped some of its early losses, which were spurred by a more-than-7-per-cent fall in the price of  West Texas intermediate crude oil. A turnaround for the major bank stocks helped the broader market recover from its early falls, despite Westpac reporting a 62 per cent slump in first half profit and deferring its interim dividend. Will the COVID-19 economic slump be as bad for Australia's financial institutions as the early '90s recession? You can bank on it, writes Ian Verrender. Westpac led the big four banks, with its shares gaining 2.8 per cent to $15.77. Shares in insurer IAG lost 2.1 per cent after it warned there was ""limited scope"" to pay a final dividend to shareholders in September, based on its current profit forecasts. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) last month asked banks and insurers to consider deferring dividend payouts in order to retain capital during the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic. Gold miners were among the best performers of the session, including Gold Road Resources (+8.2 per cent), Saracen Minerals (+7.1 per cent) and Evolution Mining (+7 per cent). Around the region, stocks were lower in Seoul (-2.8 per cent) and Hong Kong (-4 per cent), while the Shanghai and Tokyo markets were closed. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Shares in buy now, pay later company Afterpay closed up by 23.8 per cent, after initially surging more than 35 per cent. It followed news that Chinese technology firm Tencent had built a 5 per cent stake in Afterpay, after it began buying shares in March. Afterpay co-founders Anthony Eisen and Nick Molnar said there is potential to collaborate with Tencent, the company behind WeChat and Chinese mobile payment platform Weixin Pay, ""in areas such as technology, geographic expansion and future payment options on the Afterpay platform."" Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. RBC Capital Markets analyst Tim Piper described it as a big vote of confidence in Afterpay. ""Tencent has been a very active investor in technology and payment companies globally, hence we believe this investment is a meaningful vote of confidence for [Afterpay's] business model, execution, growth runway, and the [buy now, pay later] sector more broadly,"" he wrote in a note. ""We believe the big prize here, and what the market should be excited about, is expansion into Asia …  however, this is likely a longer-term objective, and at this stage it is hard to know what kind of product partnership (if any) Tencent will eventually pursue."" Shares in rival payment platform Zip Co also rose following Afterpay's announcement, gaining 5.9 per cent. The number of jobs advertised halved last month, a fall nearly five times that seen during the global financial crisis, ANZ economists said. The bank's monthly report showed job ads declined by 53.1 per cent in April compared to March, and were down 62.2 per cent compared to the same time last year. The previous record for a monthly fall was 11.3 per cent in January 2009. ""Job ads fell progressively over the month, adding to the evidence that the downturn in activity is impacting businesses and the labour market at an unprecedented speed,"" said ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch. ""Although we think the JobKeeper payment will flatten the peak in the unemployment rate to 9.5 per cent in [the second quarter], there will still be substantial loss of employment, hours worked and household income over the coming months."" In other economic news, building approvals held up better than economists had expected in March, but a steeper decline in construction activity is forecast ahead. Approvals fell 4 per cent in March, after surging nearly 20 per cent in February — a more modest pull back than the 15 per cent decline tipped by economists polled by Reuters. For those renters who still have their jobs, thousands of former Airbnbs hitting the long-term rental market mean bargains can be had in top locations. JP Morgan senior economist Ben Jarman said the trend in building approvals had been improving at the start of the year as house prices rose, but that has now changed. ""The COVID-19 shock brings a more sobering outlook, given the likelihood of a much weaker labour market and depressed housing transactions,"" he said. ""Those dynamics will weigh on home prices and lending activity, likely snuffing out the improvement in housing credit growth and building that was previously in train."" NAB economist Kaixin Owyong agrees there is a large fall in approvals looming. ""The residential property market has already seen a sharp fall in other partial indicators,"" she wrote. ""New home sales fell by more than 20 per cent in March, while in the existing housing market listings have collapsed, rents are falling and house price growth has slowed.""

425,"Australian share market loses $85 billion, as Friday plunge wipes out week's gains",markets,"  Australian share market tumbles 5pc, Dow Jones hit by heavy sell-off after best month in decades The Australian share market has wiped out a week's worth of gains, ending sharply lower following a broad-based sell-off on Wall Street overnight. The ASX 200 closed down by 5 per cent or 276 points at 5,245 points, just a few points above where it closed last Friday, despite posting three strong sessions this week. The All Ordinaries index lost 4.9 per cent to 5,325 points, losing around $85 billion in value as losses accelerated into the close. All sectors posted hefty falls, led by miners and energy stocks, including BHP (-7.8pc), Fortescue (-8.2pc) and Santos (-7.7pc). The major banks ANZ (-6.8pc), Commonwealth Bank (-6.1pc), NAB (-4.8pc) and Westpac (-5.8pc) also weighed on the broader market. ""Some of this is a reversal of recent gains but also the rot seems to be setting in that bank dividends are no longer the yield trade retail money had come to rely on,"" said Karen Jorritsma, the head of equities at RBC Capital Markets. On Thursday, ANZ deferred its decision on whether to pay an interim dividend, while NAB slashed its dividend to 30 cents per share. Shares in ship maker Austal fell 19.9 per cent, after it won a $324 million contract with the Federal Government but lost out on a US deal to a competitor. Just seven of the top 200 stocks were higher, including Janus Henderson Group (+8.2pc) and health firms Resmed (+3.3pc) and Fisher & Paykel Healthcare (+4.9pc). The Australian dollar extended its overnight fall, to be down 0.8 per cent against the greenback to around 64.56 US cents. ""The pullback late in the week reflected a response to poor global economic data, profit warnings and profit taking after a very strong gain in shares in April,"" AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said. The losses follow the best month on the ASX in nearly two decades. ""Equity markets rallied as fiscal and monetary stimulus helped to lift asset prices, while the spread of COVID-19 slowed on both sides of the Tasman Sea,"" S&P Dow Jones indices analyst Sherifa Issifu said. ""The S&P/ASX 200 had its best month since June 2000, posting a return of 8.8 per cent."" In bleak economic news overnight, data showed millions more Americans filed claims for unemployment benefits last week, suggesting that layoffs have spread to industries not initially hurt by coronavirus-related shutdowns. Other figures showed a record collapse in consumer spending last month because of lockdowns to curb the spread of COVID-19, although Amazon's quarterly sales results showed online retailers were reaping the benefits. There were 3.8 million seasonally adjusted claims for state unemployment benefits last week in the US. That is down from 4.4 million in the week before, but it brings the number of people claiming benefits to 30.3 million since late March, which is equivalent to nearly one-in-five workers losing their job in just over a month. The Commerce Department said consumer spending plunged by a record 7.5 per cent last month — even healthcare spending fell as dental surgeries closed and hospitals delayed elective surgery to focus on treating COVID-19 patients. Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York, said the economic numbers were frightening. ""The economy continues to print numbers that scare the living daylights out of everyone in the world,"" he said. As efforts to control COVID-19 appear to be gaining traction, many analysts and traders are hoping for a quick return to business as usual. They're likely to be disappointed, writes Ian Verrender. A day after the US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell pledged to throw the kitchen sink at the US economy to help it survive the coronavirus, the US central bank is expanding a soon-to-be-launched loans program for small and medium-sized businesses seeking emergency finance. The Fed said companies that received the four-year ""Main Street"" loans would have to make ""commercially reasonable efforts"" to retain workers, a change from the ""reasonable efforts"" demanded previously. Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged, but eased conditions for banks. New data showed the Eurozone economy contracted by 3.8 per cent in the first quarter, the lowest reading since records began in 1995. Stocks on Wall Street fell as the dire economic data and mixed earnings saw investors take some profits as Wall Street ended its best month in decades. The share market prices companies based on their future earnings, and the April rally shows traders expect the COVID-19 economic shutdowns to end soon, writes David Taylor. The Dow Jones index came off its lows and lost 1.2 per cent to 24,346. The S&P 500 lost 27 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 2,912, ending its best month in 33 years, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 25 points, or almost 0.3 per cent, to 8,890. The S&P 500 rose 12.7 per cent for the month, its best monthly performance since January 1987. European stocks also ended in the red, with the FTSE 100 in London slumping 3.5 per cent to 5,901. Spot gold tumbled below $US1,700 an ounce to $US1,686.82. But volatile oil prices surged again, with West Texas Intermediate crude jumping by one quarter to $US18.87 a barrel and the global benchmark Brent price surging 10 per cent to $US26.66 a barrel. Online behemoth Amazon has warned it could post its first quarterly loss in five years as it spends at least $US4 billion to protect workers from the virus outbreak, increases wages and hires more staff to cope with increased demand for products amid government lockdowns. Revenue for the first quarter rose 26 per cent to $US75.5 billion, slightly better than expected by analysts, helped by an increase in advertising income. But first-quarter profit fell to $US2.5 billion from $US3.6 billion in the previous year. Apple's sales and profits beat Wall Street expectations, but chief executive Tim Cook said the future outlook was uncertain. iPhone sales fell over the March quarter as Apple was forced to close stores around the world. China sales fell less than $US1 billion from the same time last year to $US9.46 billion as the firm slowly reopened stores in China after February's lockdown. Apple's net income for the March quarter fell from $US11.6 billion the same time a year ago to $US11.2 billion.

427,"ASX rises, US markets fall from highs after coronavirus treatment trial results",markets,"  The Australian share market has closed higher, following modest gains on Wall Street overnight, after an initial rally was dented by disappointing test results from a potential COVID-19 treatment. The ASX 200 finished higher by 0.5 per cent at 5,242 points, while the All Ordinaries index gained 27 points to 5,300. The energy and mining sectors rose strongly, including BHP (+2.7pc), Rio Tinto (+1.5pc) and Fortescue (+3.4pc) Oil and gas companies Santos (+1.8pc), Woodside (+1.8pc), Beach Energy (+4.2pc) and Oil Search (+4.4pc) also made gains. Among the worst performers were Nearmap (-6pc), Lynas (-5.5pc) and Challenger (-5.4pc). Domino's Pizza shares slumped by 3.5 per cent or $1.74 to $47.90, after it said more of its stores had asked for support because of the coronavirus economic shutdown. Domino's said that 70 per cent of its stores in France had reopened and New Zealand stores are expected to reopen at the end of April. Qantas shares rose 1.5 per cent to $3.39, despite a warning from the competition regulator it would take swift action if the airline engaged in any anti-competitive behaviour, following Virgin Australia entering voluntary administration. Virgin's administrator, Deloitte, said the company owed $6.9 billion to more than 10,000 creditors, following an initial review. Of the debts, around $450 million is owed to employees and $1.9 billion is owed in aircraft leases. The company's shares remain suspended as it tries to stay afloat. The Australian dollar had slipped slightly, to 63.48 US cents by 4:20pm (AEST). In the US, shares in biotech firm Gilead Science slumped after a report in the Financial Times said its antiviral drug, remdesivir, did not improve the condition of patients with coronavirus. A leaked summary of a Chinese trial of the drug showed it did not help patients get better more quickly and 13.9 per cent of patients who received the drug died, compared to a death rate of 12.8 per cent for those receiving standard care. The World Health Organisation said it accidentally posted the results on a website that helps track therapies for the disease. Find out more Gilead said the report did not fairly represent the test results, but its shares closed down 4.3 per cent to $US77.78. The Dow Jones index lost most of its gains after the report, to end up by nearly 0.2 per cent or 39 points to 23,515. The S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq both ended flat. European Union leaders agreed to set up a 1 trillion Euro emergency fund to help economies recover from the coronavirus pandemic. European shares ended higher with the FTSE 100 putting on 56 points or 1 per cent to 5,827. Norway's state-owned oil firm Equinor is the first major oil company to cut dividend payments to investors amid the collapse in oil prices. West Texas crude continued its recovery after crashing below zero earlier this week, rising 23 per cent to $US17 a barrel. Spot gold has gained to $US1,732 an ounce. Millions more Americans claimed unemployment benefits last week amid the coronavirus economic shutdown. The US Labor Department says more than 4.4 million people made claims last week. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. That was down from 5.2 million in the previous week but it means 26.5 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits since the middle of March, wiping out total job gains since the global financial crisis in 2008. Economists said the figures indicate a US jobless rate of 10 to 15 per cent, the biggest indicator that the economy entered a recession in a March. Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, a website recruitment firm said the numbers were worrisome. ""Today's report shows the labour market is almost certainly pushing into new territory, jolting the unemployment rate up above the Great Recession's 10 per cent peak and wiping out more jobs than we've gained in the recovery,"" he said. Other numbers showed that new home sales fell 15.4 per cent in March, by the most in nearly seven years. Data firm IHS Markit said its flash US Composite Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, plunged to a reading of 27.4 in April, the lowest since the survey began in late 2009, from 40.9 in March.

428,"ASX slips as health stocks drag, oil rally boosts energy stocks",markets,"  ASX slips as health stocks drag, oil rally boosts energy stocks The Australian share market has retreated from early gains to close lower, dragged down by banks and health care stocks, while mining and energy stocks have risen following a rebound in oil prices. The benchmark ASX 200 index ended the session 0.1 per cent weaker at 5,217 points, while the All Ordinaries shed just one point. The major bank stocks finished in the red by off their lows, while AMP shares had lost 0.7 per cent after assets under management in its Australian wealth business fell to $116.3 billion in the first quarter, down from $134.5 billion at the end of December. Shares in Ramsay Health Care fell 5.9 per cent after returning to trade following a $1.2 billion share sale to big investors to boost its war chest in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Energy stocks made gains after an overnight rise in oil prices, coming off their record lows — shares in Santos (+6.8 per cent), Oil Search (+3.7 per cent) and Beach Energy (+5.7 per cent) all closed higher. The rise in Santos shares comes despite the company reporting a 13 per cent drop in revenue for the first quarter of the financial year because of lower prices. However, it said 70 per cent of its forecast production volumes are fixed price domestic gas contracts, so it won't be hit too hard as the oil price slump flows through to gas prices. Mining stocks were among the best performers on the market, including gold miners Silverlake Resources (+7.1 per cent), Resolute Mining (+6.6 per cent) and Regis Resources (+7.8 per cent). Shares in rare earths miner Lynas rose 16.9 per cent after it got funding from the US Department of Defence for a heavy rare earths separation facility in Texas. The US military put out a tender for the factory in order to secure domestic supply after last year's trade war raised concerns that China may restrict output of rare earths, which are used for a wide range of industrial uses such as mobile phone components, magnets, aircraft engines and computer drives. The Australian dollar had risen to around 63.5 US cents by 4:20pm (AEST). More money from Congress, a rise in oil prices from record lows and more optimistic corporate outlooks saw US stocks gain for the first time in three days. The US Senate approved a bill unlocking nearly half-a-trillion US dollars in new assistance for small businesses to help them cope with the coronavirus fallout. That is on top of trillions of dollars of stimulus already passed by Congress. A week after major US banks issued dismal forecasts for 2020, consumer stocks and technology firms fared slightly better thanks to home delivery and online streaming. The Dow Jones index put on 2 per cent, or 457 points, to 23,476. The S&P 500 rose 63 points, or 2.3 per cent, to 3,799 and the tech index, the Nasdaq Composite, gained 2.8 per cent to 8,495. US President Donald Trump praised steps by a handful of Republican-led states to reopen their economies, but New York's governor and the boss of Coca-Cola warned against it. Both Texas and Georgia plan to reopen their economies, with Georgia allowing firms such as hair salons and massage parlours to restart business as early as next week. European stocks closed higher on the partial recovery in oil prices and hopes of more stimulus. The FTSE 100 index in London added 2.3 per cent to close at 5,771. The Euro STOXX 600 index rose 1.8 per cent after falling more than t3 per cent on Tuesday because of the collapse in oil prices. UK inflation fell as COVID-19 hit clothing sales. Brent crude oil jumped 8.5 per cent to $US20.68 a barrel, boosted by talk of more supply cuts and growing US stockpiles that were not as high as expected. West Texas crude rose by more than a fifth to $US14.14 a barrel. However, both were coming off even steeper falls in the previous session. A major oil price fell into the negative for the first time in history. How did it happen and what does it mean for fuel prices? Oil prices appeared to rise after US President Donald Trump tweeted he had, ""instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea."" He has also called for a bailout of the US oil industry as rapidly diminishing shortage space saw West Texas crude fall to roughly -$US40 a barrel in futures trade this week. That meant sellers were effectively paying buyers to take their stock. Spot gold gained 1.6 per cent to $US1,713.45 an ounce. Virgin Australia's largest investor said it worked closely with the struggling airline and other stakeholders to try to keep the company afloat. Middle Eastern carrier Etihad said it is disappointed that Virgin entered voluntary administration. The airline said it was unable to provide help because of the damage from the coronavirus pandemic on its own business. Until a new airline can establish itself as a formidable competitor to almighty Qantas, consumers may lose out with higher fares and reduced flight options writes Nassim Khadem. ""Etihad Airways is disappointed Virgin Australia has had to enter voluntary administration due to the unprecedented challenges and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" a spokesperson said. ""Over recent weeks we have worked closely with the company and all key stakeholders to try and find a solution that would have avoided administration for Virgin Australia, but unfortunately did not succeed. ""Having to deal with the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our own business, we were unable to provide additional financial support in the current circumstances."" Fellow Virgin Australia shareholder Singapore Airlines said it remained committed to the Australian aviation market. The airline refused to comment on Virgin's troubles and its own finances but said it is a challenging time for aviation. ""Singapore Airlines believes that competition will benefit customers,"" a spokesperson said.

429,Australia calls for independent study of wet market risks in response to COVID-19 pandemic,markets," Politics Australia calls for independent study of wet market risks in response to coronavirus pandemic Australia has ratcheted up pressure on China to look into the health risks associated with wildlife wet markets as the world continues to battle the deadly spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Federal Agriculture Minister David Littleproud has sought international support for a scientific study into the markets. Wet markets offer live animals to be sold alongside other fresh foods and are popular in Asia, parts of Africa and the Middle East. The Nationals deputy leader told a virtual meeting of G20 agriculture ministers on Tuesday that governments needed to ""acknowledge risks and take action"" in regard to wet markets. ""These markets are a source of biosecurity and human health risks and they need to be scientifically investigated so the world can have some confidence in their integrity,"" Mr Littleproud said. ""Our people should have confidence that the food they eat is safe, we owe it to our domestic population and our international markets,"" he said. The Australian Government believes there is a ""very real likelihood"" that the coronavirus outbreak came from a wet market in the Chinese city of Wuhan. In recent days, Australia has called for an investigation into China's handling of the initial outbreak and Prime Minister Scott Morrison has sought international support for greater powers for the World Health Organisation (WHO). LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Australia's chief veterinarian, Dr Mark Schipp, said it was important to understand the risks that wildlife wet markets posed to human health. ""Of the last six pandemic or large-scale emerging diseases since 1980, all of them have been associated with wild animals,"" he said. ""[That includes] AIDS, SARS, swine influenza, the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, Ebola and now COVID-19, so all of those originate in animals. ""Two of those — SARS and COVID-19 — have been linked to wildlife markets in China specifically."" Dr Schipp said ""all of the evidence"" pointed to the COVID-19 outbreak originating in a market in Wuhan but acknowledged the sensitivities of calling for greater scrutiny of such markets. ""It's a very sensitive topic and one that is not very receptive to advice from a white male person coming from a western country which doesn't deal with these issues of food insecurity,"" he said. Subscribe for the national headlines of the day. Dr Schipp is also the president of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and has been working with WHO and Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) to address some of the concerns around wet markets. ""In many countries … there is dire food insecurity and wildlife wet markets are an important source of protein and there is no viable alternative at this stage,"" he said. ""However, those markets can be improved in terms of food safety and hygiene and measures taken to ensure there is distance between wildlife, domestic animals and people to break down that transmission that continues to emerge in these pandemic situations."" Mr Morrison wants international support to give the WHO — or another body — the equivalent powers of a weapons inspector to avoid another catastrophic pandemic. One of the limitations of the WHO that Mr Morrison wants to change is that international officials must be invited by nations before being allowed to investigate. Mr Morrison raised the idea with the leaders of the United States, Germany and France. China is Australia's largest trading partner, with a third of Australian exports sold there, including $120 billion worth of coal and iron ore. But Australia's relationship with China is becoming increasingly sensitive as senior government ministers speak out in favour of further research on the pandemic's origins. Earlier this week, Foreign Minister Marise Payne urged China to allow transparency in a study of the pandemic's spread, including China's handling of the outbreak. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. Health Minister Greg Hunt has also previously described a decision by the World Health Organisation to support the reopening of China's wet markets as ""unfathomable"". China issued a rebuke of Australia earlier this week, with the nation's embassy in Australia accusing Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton of being a mouthpiece for the United States. The embassy described calls by Australian politicians for greater scrutiny of China's handling of the coronavirus crisis as ""pitiful"".

430,"Australia faces biggest economic contraction since Great Depression, Reserve Bank warns",markets,"  Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe has warned Australia is this year likely to experience its biggest contraction in national output since the Great Depression. He also cautioned against lifting social-distancing restrictions too quickly, and said if coronavirus re-emerges and the tough restrictions had to be reimposed ""the loss of incomes and jobs would be even more pronounced"". Speaking in Sydney, Dr Lowe warned: ""The next few months are going to be difficult ones for the Australian economy."" Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. ""Over the first half of 2020 we are likely to experience the biggest contraction in national output and income that we have witnessed since the 1930s. ""Putting precise numbers on the magnitude of this contraction is difficult, but our current thinking is along the following lines …  National output is likely to fall by around 10 per cent over the first half of 2020, with most of this decline taking place in the June quarter. ""Total hours worked in Australia are likely to decline by around 20 per cent over the first half of this year. ""The unemployment rate is likely to be around 10 per cent by June, although I am hopeful that it might be lower than this if businesses are able to retain their employees on lower hours. The unemployment rate would have been much higher than this without the Government's JobKeeper wage subsidy. ""These are all very large numbers and ones that were inconceivable just a few months ago. They speak to the immense challenge faced by our society to contain the virus."" LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Dr Lowe said inflation was likely to decline significantly in the June quarter, with the large fall in oil prices, and the introduction of free child care, helping to push inflation negative in June. ""If so, this would be the first time since the early 1960s that the price level has fallen over a full year,"" he said. But he also reminded Australians that the economy was in relatively good shape before the coronavirus pandemic. ""As the economic data roll in over coming months, they will present a very sobering picture of the state of our economy,"" Dr Lowe said. ""There will be many reports of record declines in economic activity. ""As Australians digest this economic news, I would ask that we keep in mind that this period will pass, and that a bridge has been built to get us to the other side. ""With the help of that bridge, we will recover and the economy will grow strongly again."" But Dr Lowe also weighed into the debate about the wisdom or otherwise of lifting some social-distancing measures imminently to get the economy moving again. He said the timing and pace of the economic recovery would depend on how long we have to restrict economic activities and that, in turn, depended on how effectively we contained the virus. It's close to 30 years since Australia's last recession, which saw vast numbers of people lose their jobs or struggle to break into the workforce, as another recession looms, writes Stephen Long. ""We can be confident that our economy will bounce back and that we will see it recover,"" he said. ""We need to remember that once the virus is satisfactorily contained, all those factors that have made Australia such a successful and prosperous country will still be there."" Dr Lowe said it was difficult to be precise about the timing, so it was useful to think in scenarios. ""One plausible scenario is that the various restrictions begin to be progressively lessened as we get closer to the middle of the year, and are mostly removed by late in the year, except perhaps the restrictions on international travel,"" he said. ""Under this scenario, we could expect the economy to begin its bounce-back in the September quarter and for that bounce-back to strengthen from there."" ""If this is how things play out, the economy could be expected to grow very strongly next year, with GDP growth of perhaps 6–7 per cent, after a fall of around 6 per cent this year. ""There is though quite a lot of uncertainty around the numbers, with the exact profile of the recovery depending not only upon when the restrictions are lifted but also on the resolution of the uncertainty that people feel about the future."" Dr Lowe said it was harder to make forecasts about the unemployment rate, but it was likely the unemployment rate would remain above 6 per cent over the next couple of years. But he said there were other scenarios to consider, like the damage that could occur if restrictions were left in place longer than necessary — or lifted prematurely. ""On the optimistic side, the restrictions could be lifted more quickly, with the virus being contained,"" he said. ""In that case, a stronger recovery could be expected, particularly in light of the very large monetary and fiscal support that is in place. ""On the other hand, if the restrictions stay in place longer, or they have to be reimposed, the recovery will be delayed and interrupted. In that case, the loss of incomes and jobs would be even more pronounced. ""Whatever the timing of the recovery, when it does come, we should not be expecting that we will return quickly to business as usual. ""Rather, the twin health and economic emergencies that we are experiencing now will cast a shadow over our economy for some time to come.""

431,Virgin Australia expected to go into voluntary administration,markets,"  Virgin Australia is expected to announce it will go into voluntary administration, with Deloitte tipped to step in to help the company restructure about $5 billion in debt and pay off its creditors, including worker entitlements. Virgin Australia update: The airline has entered voluntary administration. Follow the latest news. The cash-starved airline is expected to make the announcement to the ASX this morning, after management, including CEO Paul Scurrah, failed to convince the Federal Government to step in with a $1.4 billion bailout. It is understood Virgin Australia's board met on Monday night to decide the company's future, including the possibility of going into voluntary administration — where an insolvent company is placed in the hands of an independent person who can assess the best path forward for its business owner and creditors. The airline is in prime position for takeover; private equity firms have been circling as credit ratings agencies recently downgraded Virgin's rating, saying a ""default"" was likely. Virgin Australia captain George Kailis fears for the fate of his co-workers as the company looks likely to enter into voluntary administration. Last month, about 8,000 of 10,000 workers at Virgin Australia were temporarily stood down as it grounded most of its planes due to coronavirus. Virgin Australia is majority foreign-owned by Etihad Airways (20.94 per cent stake), Singapore Airlines (20.09 per cent), Nanshan Group (19.98 per cent), HNA Group (19.82 per cent) and Richard Branson's Virgin Group (10.42 per cent), but none of these shareholders have stepped in to help as they are battling their own coronavirus-induced problems. There are fears that until a new airline can establish itself as a formidable competitor to Qantas, consumers may lose out with higher fares and reduced flight options. Until coronavirus grounded all but one of its planes, Virgin Australia had a fleet of about 130 aircraft flying to 41 destinations around the world. It may have to revert to being a pure domestic player. Critics against a bailout have repeatedly argued that it is not the role of the Federal Government to give handouts to badly managed airlines. Over the past decade, Virgin made a full-year profit just twice.

434,"More than 600,000 Australians apply for early release of superannuation",markets,"  Nearly 618,000 Australians have applied to get an early release of their superannuation under the Federal Government's plan to help people out of work and facing financial hardship during the coronavirus pandemic. From April 20, the Morrison Government is allowing retrenched workers and those suffering financial hardship because of shutdowns to access up to $20,000 in super and take it out tax free. The first $10,000 is available between mid-April and July 1, and the second $10,000 is available after July 1 for about three months. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) said as of midnight April 8, it had 617,800 registrations of interest, but could not yet estimate how many people would be eligible to draw down. This figure is up from more than 360,000 it reported as of last Friday, and Australians are yet to be able to fill out the official form which allows them to apply from April 20. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. To be eligible, people must be either unemployed or eligible for welfare support payments including the JobSeeker payment, Youth Allowance, Parenting Payment, Special Benefit or Farm Household Allowance. The scheme is also on offer to those who have had their working hours reduced by 20 per cent or more, or sole traders whose business has been suspended or seen turnover fall by at least 20 per cent. While the Federal Government has estimated that Australians facing hardship will be repaid about $27 billion tax free from their super savings, Rice Warner has estimated the figure could be as high as $50 billion. The Government has repeatedly warned superannuation funds — which reap more than $30 billion annually in fees in Australia's $3 trillion sector — to act responsibly during this crisis. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg had said super fund trustees should have managed their legal obligations responsibly over the years to ensure that they have ""appropriate liquidity"". He warned that if they do not regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has a number of levers it can pull, including directing mergers in cases where a fund is unable to meet the needs of members. There are longstanding clauses in superannuation fund product disclosure statements — which regularly get updated and have been recently revised for unique reasons unrelated to the government scheme — giving the funds discretion about whether to allow early withdrawals. The funds say these clauses are not new or exceptional, and that they plan to pay out their members. As job losses continue to rise because of shutdowns, the number of Australians struggling to repay their mortgages is expected to lift to higher levels than seen during the global financial crisis. But the fine print takes on a new meaning when hundreds of thousands of Australians are now applying for early withdrawals, and it remains to be seen if funds start exercising their discretion more aggressively. The $44 billion fund representing largely hospitality workers, Hostplus, said in a statement that it recently updated its product disclosure statement. This was to reflect a clause in Hostplus' trust deed that gives it ""a broad discretion to suspend or delay unit pricing in extraordinary situations to ensure equity, fairness and balance in investment pricing and transactions in the best interests of all members"". ""In Hostplus' case, this trustee power is not new,"" the statement said. ""It is not unique. It is not exceptional."" Hostplus' chief executive David Elia has publicly defended fund's liquidity position, recently bolstering its cash reserves to $6 billion. The fund's statement said it remained ""committed to supporting the Federal Government's policy to allow members to access up to a total of $20,000 from their superannuation accounts"" and that it had ""ample liquidity available to support members undergoing financial hardship"". REST, the industry fund representing retail employees and managing about $60 billion in retirement savings, is also expected to see a flood of applications. It has a longstanding clause that states the trustee has discretion to pay out, but a spokesman said the fund had ""extensive liquid assets and is currently well placed to support the early release measures when they become available from April 20"". ""We are also stress testing our liquidity position regularly and are currently comfortable with our financial position to handle a variety of early release scenarios,"" he said. ""The regulations for the new early release measure require us to pay members as soon as practicable after we receive the ATO's determination,"" the REST spokesman added. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Unisuper the $85 billion fund representing university workers, updated its trust deed this week, but said that had nothing to do with the Government scheme. ""The update reflects the changes that were agreed in 2019 and have no impact to payments for members requesting early access to super,"" a spokeswoman told ABC News. ""We have no intention to suspend/restrict payments to eligible members requesting early access to super,"" she added. ""UniSuper has a very conservative approach to liquidity management and we're well positioned to handle the current situation as a result of the pandemic."" MediaSuper represents those in media and entertainment industry and has more than $6 billion in funds under management. It told ABC News its clause regarding ""absolute discretion"" to impose conditions or restrictions on the amount of money members were able to withdraw was ""a standard provision"" that had been around for years. ""There were no limits or restrictions placed on withdrawals from or investment switches within Media Super during the global financial crisis, and we don't anticipate imposing any limits or restrictions during the current crisis,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Well-run funds are managed with key risks, including substantial market swings or increased switches or withdrawals, considered and factored into investment portfolio strategies and management."" ""It is the ATO, not the fund, that determines the eligibility of applicants for early release of their super."" ""We will be processing applications as and when approved by the ATO and have more than adequate liquidity to cover the estimated level of applications."" Cbus, the fund representing the construction industry, noted that it had no clause that provided a broad discretionary power to freeze payments, but required members to prove eligibility for withdrawal to protect its members. A spokesman said the fund had ""paid close attention to the lessons of the GFC"". ""We have a very robust approach to liquidity and stress testing,"" the Cbus spokesman said. ""Cbus is in a strong position with liquidity and we believe we are able to pay all member hardship claims, even prior to the recent Jobseeker payment announcement."" Alex Dunnin, director of financial services research firm Rainmaker, also argued the industry did not have a liquidity problem and said it was ""premature to speculate that some funds will get into trouble"". While it would ""have to wait and see how the rule changes impacts particular funds"", he said the industry had about $950 billion in cash and bonds — $397 billion cash and $549 billion in bonds. The spread of coronavirus across Australia could see unemployment reach about 10 per cent and house prices drop 20 per cent, says one economist. And should it really run into trouble, the Future Fund was ""sitting on the sidelines with $37 billion in cash and bonds"". ""We also need to realise that it's not the capital market falls that are the issue because super funds appear to have withstood that onslaught reasonably, all things considered,"" Mr Dunnin said. ""It's the forced hibernation of particular industries and the Government changing the early release rules which … regulators had no warning of, much less super funds."" ""To say funds should have seen this coming is disingenuous."" The industry had a fantastic year in 2019, so the 12-month return was only down 3 per cent despite the recent bushfires and current coronavirus crisis. ""Funds have had a boom 10 years, so they're weathering the storm,"" he said. All funds would follow the law, he said, ""And if not, you have a regulator with a baseball bat"". The real test for superfunds was whether funds could handle higher administration requirements as they were faced with a flood of enquiries. And another challenge would be how funds dealt with the change in priorities from long-term investment to short-term cash management. Super had now become a form of emergency cash management, and some funds were concerned there would be pressure from the Federal Government to change the way super funds operated in the future. ""They've now received a strong message that they must be prepared to play a fundamentally different role in the economy,"" Mr Dunnin said. The industry would have to hold more cash and liquid assets, which ""could have profound effects on future returns"". ""Funds are going to have to build reserves for this type of event,"" he said. The big increase in government debt also meant ""we might have to rethink the fundamental tax structure of the superannuation tax system"". ""Once again young people may get hit just as they're getting started,"" he said. ""We simply don't know how this will play out.""

435,Sydney Fish Markets implements coronavirus crowd-control measures to allow for Easter seafood splurge,markets,"  Australia's biggest seafood outlet is open for business this Easter under special COVID-19 restrictions. The Sydney Fish Market, which usually attracts more than 40,000 people over the holiday weekend, has beefed up security and will restrict numbers in its retail outlets. Chief executive officer Greg Dyer said the market could turn over $10 million in a normal Easter period, but he expected the public's general compliance with stay-at-home advice could halve this. ""We're not entirely sure how many visitors we'll get on the site, but we expect a dramatic reduction and those that do come will see a very different Sydney Fish Market,"" Mr Dyer said. ""A very well organised and highly drilled Sydney Fish Market will make sure we are maintaining all of the requirements under the COVID-19 regulations."" LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic The market's five seafood retailers will limit the number of customers allowed inside at any one time and will operate under a one-way traffic system. De Costi Seafood manager Carmelo Lombardo said online orders had grown by close to 70 per cent during the COVID-19 crisis but he wanted to reassure customers physical-distancing measures would not detract from their Easter market experience. ""Rest assured that when you do buy seafood down the market, you know we have an environment where you can shop at your own leisure but in a safe way,"" Mr Lombardo said. Prices on Australia's biggest seafood auction floor have surged this week in the lead-up to Easter. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. According to Kerry Strangas from the Master Fish Merchants Association, prices collapsed last month after restaurants and the food service industry stopped trading. ""The prices have steadied again, there's not as much product so the fishermen are getting a reasonable price and a fair price,"" Mr Strangas said. ""We want the fishermen to keep fishing and for us to keep trading."" He said if prices collapsed it would be dire. ""Then the industry is gone because you're not going to get out of bed if you don't get what you deserve for your product."" The improved market has been a godsend for fishers such as Danny Green who operates a trap fishing business out of Coffs Harbour in New South Wales. ""Probably two weeks ago, up until this last week, fish prices have been crap,"" Mr Green said. ""Now, just before Easter, snapper prices are the highest I've ever seen them. You're looking at $25 to $26 a kilogram."" At Lake Munmorah in NSW, mesh net and mud crab fisher Allan Reed said some of his catch had been sold for bait two weeks ago because of the reduced demand. He was also getting less than $8 a kilogram for mud crabs, but this week they earned $57 a kilogram. ""It got so bad I was only working one day a week,"" Mr Reed said.

436,The RBA is printing money and that has raised a lot of questions,markets,"  Earlier this week I wrote about the Reserve Bank's decision to start printing money. Yes, Australia's central bank is now plugging in extra digits on its computer trading screens to artificially pump up how much cash it has on its balance sheet. It's creating money out of thin air. It doesn't need to print the money via the Mint. It's doing this so it can dive into the bond market and buy up as many government bonds as it so chooses. The idea being that the more bonds it buys up, the lower interest rates go, and the easier it is for people to repay their mortgages, for businesses to pay off their loans and for the government to afford its JobKeeper payments. Once the piece was published though, I received a flood of emails, texts and calls with follow-up questions. Why? Well because this is stuff is not easy to wrap your head around. I mean what are bonds in the first place, who owns what? Why can't the Reserve Bank just write off the debt? So, here are some answers to the most common questions. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic They are IOUs. If you earn money, you have the capacity to borrow money and pay it back at some point, with interest. The government can borrow huge amounts of money because it has a big capacity to pay it back — because it's got millions of taxpayers giving it money every day. So, it issues its own bonds (with a world-class credit rating attached). Theoretically there are no limits to how much the RBA can increase the size of its cash reserves by creating money our of thin air (or the tap of a keyboard). The Reserve Bank will create as much money as it believes is necessary to stabilise the monetary system and to ensure the government, households and businesses can borrow with relative ease. To ensure the credibility of the RBA itself though, and the integrity of the monetary system as a whole, the Reserve Bank will only print money, and buy bonds, to assist with sound economic policy. Even in its latest monetary policy statement it made it clear the bank was already working on a money printing exit strategy. ""Bank has bought around $36 billion of government bonds in secondary markets, including bonds issued by the states and territories,"" RBA governor Philip Lowe noted. ""The Bank will continue to promote the smooth functioning of these important markets. ""If conditions continue to improve, though, it is likely that smaller and less frequent purchases of government bonds will be required."" There are no hard and fast rules around how long quantitative easing or money printing should last. In the United States it lasted years during and after the global financial crisis. In Japan, it lasted over a decade. ""It could go on indefinitely,"" AMP Capital's Head of Investment Strategy Shane Oliver told the ABC. Hyperinflation is when prices for everyday items spiral out of control. It's been known to happen when money printing is involved. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. Economists say it's unlikely to happen this time around, in Australia, because inflation was already very low to begin with. ""The downside [to QE] is that it could cause inflation,"" AMP Capital's chief economist Shane Oliver says. ""It's made possible now because inflation is low."" In addition to this, the global financial crisis left the global economy with a legacy of relatively high underemployment, the gig economy, and very weak wage growth. ""GFC left a lot of spare capacity in labour markets,"" Dr Oliver says. So basically all of this points to the fact that, in this economic climate, strong inflation is hard to come by, so even a $36 billion money printing program by the RBA is unlikely to change that. This is a hugely important question, and the answer is yes. First let's look at why the RBA is not buying bonds directly from the government. By far and away the most frequently asked question was, ""why can't the Reserve Bank just buy the bonds directly from the government?"" If the Reserve Bank did this it would be directly providing the government with money it's plucked out of thin air, which the government can then spend or give to households. The famous economist Milton Friedman came up with this idea in 1969. To illustrate it he described a helicopter dropping money into people's backyards. But the RBA and government are doing this! I hear you say. Well, sort of. The government issues bonds, banks buy those bond and the Reserve Bank then buys those same bonds off the bank. So, for practical purposes, the RBA now owns those bonds and will receive coupon payments from the government … and you could draw a line from the RBA to the government in terms of money flows. The government then uses that money to pay for JobKeeper payments and the like — money directly into workers' pockets. That sounds an awful lot like helicopter money. However, by putting the private sector between the government and the Reserve Bank, you create a crucial buffer. It means the Reserve Bank can't simply write off the debt (which would compromise the integrity of the entire monetary system). It's not even tempted to do that. In addition, by ensuring the bonds make it into the private financial markets, the Reserve Bank can influence interest rates across the board (because changes in the three-year bond yield have a knack of influencing other interest rates). Leading economists conceded it's helicopter money by a different name. ""It is a technicality,"" concedes Dr Oliver. ""It's a fine line."" EY Oceania's chief economist Jo masters agrees. ""It is quite a fine line. If you get a central bank buying bonds directly from the government, you blur the lines of [independence]."" By having the Reserve Bank buy bonds in the secondary market, ""it adds another step in the process that keeps the elected government focused on fiscal policy,"" Ms Masters argues. Take heart, this is a mathematical description of one aspect of how a central bank buying bonds helps the economy. I've no idea what it means.

438,Australian shares fall as IMF warns wartime measures are needed to protect global economy,markets,"  The Australian share market has fallen, led by the major banks, after the International Monetary Fund told governments to enact wartime measures to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Australian shares slumped nearly 4 per cent in early trade, as the coronavirus death toll rose in the United States and New Zealand told banks to freeze dividend payouts. The benchmark ASX 200 index came off those early lows to be down 2.3 per cent to 5,135 points by 1:25pm (AEDT). Bank stocks led the falls following an announcement by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand that local banks cannot redeem short-term corporate bonds or pay dividends on ordinary shares to investors, in order to preserve capital. ANZ said the measure would prevent it from repaying its $NZ500 million ($487 million) capital notes due in late May, although it can make interest payments on the bonds. ANZ shares fell 5.3 per cent or 91 cents to $16.14. National Australia Bank said the measures would not have a material impact on its capital buffers — its shares fell 5.4 per cent, while CBA and Westpac shares fell more than 4 per cent. Westpac has appointed former chief financial officer and acting boss Peter King as its new chief executive, following the resignation of Brian Hartzer late last year, as the bank was accused of breaking money-laundering laws more than 23 million times. Chairman John McFarlane said Mr King and other top executives would not be paid a short-term bonus in 2020 to take ""collective accountability for the financial crime outcomes in Westpac's business which led to the action brought by AUSTRAC"". Ratings agency Moody's downgraded its outlook for the Australian banking system to negative, from stable, citing the ""broad and growing scope of economic and market disruption"", with increased loan losses and record low interest rates expected to decrease profitability. Westpac's newly confirmed boss told The World Today the banks will need to allow for people not being able to repay their loans. ""Our focus at the moment is to help people and get them through this period ... if people have jobs, for those who have debt they can repay that debt, and the best thing for the bank, for the economy and for customers is to get employment back and the JobKeeper program from the Government is doing a very good job I think,"" Mr King said. Airline stocks were weaker, with shares in Virgin Australia down 8.9 per cent following reports the Government will not grant the airline's request for $1.4 billion in financial support. Shares in Qantas were down 5.2 per cent after SafeWork NSW notified the company of an investigation into its suspension of an aircraft cleaner who raised concerns about workers being exposed to coronavirus. The Australian dollar has come off its overnight low to around 60.85 US cents. A quarterly survey from economists at NAB showed business confidence and conditions declining sharply over the first three months of the year, due to the early impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Forward-looking indicators of employment and business spending were lower. ""While there was clearly a large amount of uncertainty at the time of the survey, it was clear that looming lockdowns and an escalation in social distancing measures would materially impact economic activity,' NAB's chief economist Alan Oster said. ""While the immediate impact of [the Government support] measures is unclear given the restrictions on activity, they will certainly provide support in the recovery phase."" LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Overnight, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted the ""war"" phase of the coronavirus pandemic will last at least one to two quarters. The IMF warned governments would need to mobilise to provide supplies to the health industry, cash transfers to those who had who lost their jobs and ""exceptional support"" like wage subsidies to companies. ""The success of the pace of recovery will depend crucially on policies undertaken during the crisis,"" IMF economists wrote in a blog post. ""If policies ensure that workers do not lose their jobs, renters and homeowners are not evicted, companies avoid bankruptcy, and business and trade networks are preserved, the recovery will occur sooner and more smoothly."" Australia and other countries have already unveiled similar policies with a massive rollout of economic stimulus. On the markets, US stocks plunged after US President Donald Trump said there could be up to 240,000 deaths from coronavirus in North America. ""This is going to be a rough two-week period,"" he said at a White House press conference. ""When you look at night the kind of death that has been caused by this invisible enemy, it's incredible."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 1,000 points at its low point, as a plunge in new orders for US-made products pushed investors away from stocks to safer assets. It lost 974 or 4.4 per cent to 20,944. The S&P 500 fell 4.4 per cent to 2,471 and the Nasdaq lost 340 points or 4.4 per cent to 7,361. US manufacturing activity contracted less than expected in March, but disruptions caused by the pandemic pushed new orders received by factories to an 11-year low, which has reinforced economists' view the economy is in recession. The outlook was further dented by other numbers showing private payrolls dropped last month for the first time in more than two years as businesses shut down because of strict measures to contain the virus. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. Banks suffered on speculation they could be forced to cut dividends after European lenders including HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank halted payouts and share buybacks. European stocks sank as well despite European Union plans to save jobs. The FTSE 100 index slid 3.8 per cent or 217 points to 5,455. The euro extended its drop as manufacturing data from the Eurozone painted a bleak picture, with Italy's purchasing managers' index posting a record fall.

439,"Coronavirus curbs house price growth, with worse around the corner",markets,"  National house prices hold up in March, but it's just a matter of time before coronavirus reduces property gains The impact of coronavirus is starting to trickle through to house prices, but it is early days yet with price rises across most capital cities still driving national dwelling prices up 0.7 per cent last month. The bad news for those who own a home or investment property is the March reading was the lowest monthly gain since the market lifted in July last year, property data analysts CoreLogic said. But this weakening in the growth trend in the second half of the month, as consumer confidence slumped and social distancing policies took hold, is expected to worsen. CoreLogic head of research Tim Lawless said a period of ""unprecedented uncertainty"" could drag Australia's economy into a recession for the first time in almost 30 years, which would see activity, and eventually house prices, plunge. He said the global financial crisis was short and sharp, but coronavirus had already hurt consumer confidence more than it had during the 2008 crisis, and its overall impact could be more damaging. ""It's the sheer uncertainty of a health-related crisis, rather than an economic one, or a financial catalyst, that's the big difference here,"" he said. ""There's a lot more uncertainty, particularly when you're seeing several parts of the economy shutting down for an extended period of time."" Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. One economist, AMP's Shane Oliver has already forecast the unemployment rate could double to 10 per cent or more, and that could dent national house prices by 20 per cent. Mr Lawless said that was a possibility. ""It does seem extreme at the moment, but the wildcard here is we don't know how long this shutdown will last,"" Mr Lawless said. ""We don't know how long the economy is going to be in hibernation."" Mr Lawless said the Federal Government's $130 billion stimulus announced this week to protect jobs, while welcome, would still not prevent the unemployment rate surging. Mr Lawless also noted a substantial reduction in listing activity ahead. About 40 per cent of the country's real estate auctions were withdrawn over the weekend as stricter social-distancing rules introduced by the Federal Government last week — including a ban on auction gatherings and open homes — forced agents to instead undertake online auctions and private sales mostly negotiated by phone. Mr Lawless said real estate agent reports generated across CoreLogic platforms, used by about 70 per cent of real estate agents for their research and pre-listing reports, have more than halved over recent weeks. This implied a substantial drop in listings activity over coming weeks. ""Similarly, recent polling of real estate agency enquiry levels indicated that more than 60 per cent of Australian real estate agents have seen buyer and seller enquiries fall by more than 50 per cent over recent weeks, with the larger majority expecting a further drop in enquiry over coming weeks,"" he said. Over the month, housing values rose across every capital city apart from Hobart, which declined 0.2 per cent. Over the March quarter, every capital city recorded a rise in housing values. The spread of coronavirus across Australia could see unemployment reach about 10 per cent and house prices drop 20 per cent, says one economist. Sydney had the highest growth over the quarter with values up 3.9 per cent, followed by Melbourne at 2.9 per cent and Canberra at 1.7 per cent. But some of the best performing capital city sub-regions recorded a month-on-month decline. Melbourne's inner east, where values were previously rising rapidly, recorded a 0.2 per cent drop over the month. Dwelling values across Melbourne's inner south and the Sutherland region of Sydney also edged lower over the month, along with the Brisbane sub-regions of Ipswich and Logan/Beaudesert. Nationally, the lowest capital city quarterly gain was in Darwin and Adelaide, each increasing 0.6 per cent, and a similar story occurred across the regional areas of each state, with values higher over the month and quarter. However, Mr Lawless noted that recent trends in the market would become irrelevant as coronavirus continued to affect people's jobs and dent household confidence. He said bans on open homes and on-site auctions would compound the slowdown in buyer activity, as would any future policy announcements restricting services such as building and pest inspections, conveyancing and furniture removals. But he said the crisis was temporary, and along with hundreds of billions of dollars of government stimulus, leniency from lenders for distressed borrowers and record low interest rates, house prices would eventually rebound again. It would all depend on the duration of the crisis, he said. ""We've seen total stimulus measures now getting close to 16 per cent of GDP … so it is an enormous amount of capital flowing into the market."" ""With interest rates as low as they are for at least the next three years, that should help support the market as we see the economy improving — whenever that is."" Premium value properties led the pace of capital gains through the quarter, but this segment of the market also appears to have the most rapid deceleration in growth rate. At the high end of the market, the quarterly growth rate fell from 6.6 per cent over the December 2019 quarter, to 3.6 per cent over the March 2020 quarter. Mr Lawless said the recent deceleration in the growth rate of this segment could be a signal that growth would start to slow more broadly in the coming months. ""The coronavirus impact is likely to be broad-based across the different value segments of the property market,"" he said. ""A large proportion of jobs losses have been in lower-paid sectors, such as hospitality, travel or tourism. However, equity values have also been hard hit, which could contribute to weaker demand across the higher value segments of the market."" He said rental pressures had remained modest across most areas of Australia, with the national rental index up 0.3 per cent over the month and 1.2 per cent higher over the March quarter, but expected downwards pressure on rents going forward. Economists fear indebted households are more at risk during a recession. Australia's total debt to household income is at a record high of 186.5 per cent. ""No doubt there is a rising level of downside risk to housing values, which is compounded by the fragile state of household balance sheets, which on average, are heavily leveraged,"" Mr Lawless said. CommSec senior economist Ryan Felsman said the housing market was in good shape until the coronavirus disruptions began to take their toll on home prices from mid-March. He said house prices were up 9.1 per cent on a year ago and prices of apartments had increased by 8.3 per cent — the strongest annual growth rate in over four years. ""The housing market has been a bright spot for the Aussie economy,"" he said. ""But with the onset of coronavirus pandemic and the restrictive measures put in place to try and contain the virus, budding Aussie property buyers have become increasingly cautious about upgrading or purchasing their first new home."" On Wednesday the ABS also released its February building approval figures. These were stronger than expected with total dwellings rebounding off the fall in January in seasonally adjusted terms. ""Up 20 per cent on the previous month, this was the largest month on month gain since 2013,"" BIS Oxford economist Maree Kilroy said. ""All of the growth came from attached dwellings, with high-density approvals in Victoria once again surpassing expectation."" But houses softened 2 per cent, despite New South Wales and Queensland recording monthly growth. ""The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to cause a second leg down in the residential construction downturn,"" she said. ""Extreme economic anxiety and the banning of public auctions and open house inspections will see the demand for new dwellings take a big hit over the remainder of 2020.""

440,"Fresh food out, medical supplies in: $170m COVID-19 package clears exporters for take off",markets," Politics The Australian Government will re-launch hundreds of flights to deliver fresh produce to key international markets as part of a $170 million boost to an export sector grounded by the coronavirus emergency. The support package includes $110 million to coordinate flights from Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth to deliver fresh produce to China, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. Return flights, under the program, will provide an opportunity for Australia to import medical equipment and medicines. Today's announcement by Trade Minister Simon Birmingham also waives $10 million in Commonwealth fishery fees and adds almost $50 million to the Government's existing export grants program to reimburse marketing costs to exporters. The exports lifeline follows months of uncertainty for the seafood sector, hit hard when markets in China collapsed early in the COVID-19 crisis. Other winners include red meat, dairy and horticulture exporters that have relied on cargo in passenger aircraft to deliver their produce. Since new regulations on air travel were introduced to curb the spread of the pandemic, exporters, fishers and farmers have struggled to maintain access to high-value overseas markets. The Government has appointed former Toll Holdings managing director and former Linfox chief executive Michael Byrne as its international freight coordinator to oversee the program, working with airlines and exporters. ""Necessary public health restrictions are already placing massive pressure on business viability and job security,"" Senator Birmingham said. ""We can't afford for our farmers, fishers and exporters to be under similar pressure just because they can't get their goods onto a plane. ""When these flights return to Australia there will be capacity for them to transport vital medical supplies, medicines and equipment, which will be critical to the ongoing health response."" West Australian abalone exporter Brad Adams has seen his sales plummet since Hong Kong, Singapore and China went into lockdown. Approximately 80 per cent of his product is sent overseas, with the remaining 20 per cent sold around Australia. Before the pandemic, his ASX-listed company, Ocean Grown Abalone, had a market value of $30 million. That's now halved. He said the Government freight assistance wouldn't solve all his financial problem, but it was a lifeline. ""The market we had in Australia has collapsed because there's no restaurants open, there's no Chinese tourists, so that important market is gone and probably will be gone for a long time,"" he said. ""Overseas, obviously demand isn't what it used to be, but at least we can now get some out."" Mr Adams said, with restrictions lifting in Asia, he had already started to receive orders from customers. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. But the lack of commercial passenger flights in and out of Australia had left his product stranded. ""As the COVID-19 restrictions have been reasonably successful, people are now on the streets, eating out as usual, so we're seeing our customers start placing orders again,"" he said. ""So we thought great, we'll send you some product. Then we started finding out about the options of getting air freight — there was no way of getting it out."" Jennie Franceschi sources fresh fruit and vegetables from around Australia, to send to customers overseas, mainly in Asia. In the past four weeks her export business has ground to a halt. While she did not expect much improvement in the months to come, she said the Government freight assistance would be an important tool to help secure ongoing trade. ""By keeping Australian exporters exporting and keeping our produce out there, what it will do is secure the position for Australia in those countries,"" she said. ""Because if other countries move in, then we've got to try and win it back, which is hard slog.""

441,analysis: The looming economic downturn could reshape society and the way we live our lives,markets,"  Why stocks have further to fall amid the coronavirus pandemic If ever you needed convincing that financial markets have become completely divorced from reality, just look at the events of last week. Over the course of four days, until Friday, Wall Street went on a tear, notching up huge gains which by the end of Thursday's session put it more than 20 per cent ahead of where it began the week. Technically, that's what traders call a bull market, a sign that the economy is returning to strength and company earnings and, hence, share prices are in recovery. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. The performance, based on the hope that central banks and government stimulus would insulate financial markets from a global economic downturn, was more BS than bull. For more than three decades, central bankers have played puppeteer to financial markets, propping them up when things turn ugly. If last week proved anything, it is that they haven't entirely exhausted all their powers. But the looming economic downturn, delivered with such speed and ferocity, is different from anything we've ever witnessed — one that could reshape society and the way we live our lives. We have only just entered a recession that is shaping up to be one of the most painful in at least a century as millions of Australians see their jobs evaporate, their lives upended, their savings eroded and their health imperilled. The wild ride on global markets last week, following a month of perilous falls, hasn't been witnessed since 1931 when the world was in the grip of the Great Depression. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Global leaders either are in outright denial over the scope of the problem the world is facing or are taking an overly optimistic approach. The spread of coronavirus across Australia could see unemployment reach about 10 per cent and house prices drop 20 per cent, says one economist. There is a general consensus that, once this health crisis has passed, the world will quickly resume where it left off. Business as usual. United States President Donald Trump variously has dismissed the pandemic as a hoax, been missing in action in terms of a co-ordinated national response and — until just a few days ago — was advocating a lifting of all restrictions by Easter. On Saturday, when facing questions about an acute shortage of respirators and ventilators, he had this to say: ""Here's what I'll tell you. I think we're in really good shape. This is a pandemic the likes of which nobody has seen before. I think we're in great shape. Ventilators are a big deal. We've delivered vast numbers of ventilators and we're prepared to do vast numbers. I think we're in great shape."" Just in case you missed the subtlety, the US President thinks America is in great shape. Unfortunately, his pronouncements coincided with the US overtaking China as the global epicentre of COVID-19 with more than 100,000 infected Americans, a quarter of those in New York as the city's hospitals have become overwhelmed. Of the 30,000 ventilators requested by the city, 400 so far have been delivered. Compare that response to Wuhan, where the virus first emerged and struck down more than 50,000 citizens. It is only just beginning to emerge from total lockdown after more than two months and a massive ramp up in medical facilities. In Shanghai, arrivals are confronted by an army of ground staff in Hazmat suits who repeatedly check everyone's temperature. The longer America takes to bring the health crisis under control, the greater the economic fallout, both in terms of its severity and longevity. As the world's biggest economy and the global reserve currency, the more America is damaged, the greater smaller nations like Australia will be affected. Economic crises often begin in the banking sector and slowly work their way through to the real economy. Not this one. As a health issue, it began in the streets and, to limit the damage, has forced the complete shutdown of many businesses. Recessions usually involve slowing revenues. This time, tens of thousands of small, medium and large-scale businesses have found themselves with absolutely no revenue. Ultimately, that could feed back to the banking sector with potentially worrying effects. Our banks, and those in much of the developed world, are in far stronger shape than a decade ago, following a concerted campaign by governments and central banks to force them to bolster their reserves. They've fought it all the way. Banking is the riskiest business of all, with huge liabilities, skinny profit margins and limited capital. So, a sharp and prolonged rise in bad debts and mortgage defaults will hurt them, potentially putting the financial system at risk. That's why the Federal Government is targeting households for relief and enlisting help from the banks. This won't be easy. If you'd asked Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe six months ago about his worst nightmare for our economy, there's a strong chance he would have replied: ""A sudden spike in our unemployment rate."" That nightmare scenario is unfolding. And it is occurring far more rapidly than anyone could have imagined. As the horrifying scenes outside Centrelink offices last week showed, hundreds of thousands of Australians have suddenly found themselves out of work and unable to pay their way. With world record levels of household debt — much of it tied up in real estate and mortgages — unemployment equals loan defaults. That hurts banks. Which explains why they are going all out to assist the Federal Government. There's a negative feedback loop here too. Desperate people don't spend. That accentuates a downturn, fuelling even more layoffs. According to investment bank Morgan Stanley, up to two million Australians are exposed to the most affected industries such as tourism, retail and hospitality. And, as their charts below show, the resulting recession will leave more of us out of work or underemployed than our last big recession in 1991. You don't quickly bounce back from recession, particularly one this severe. Businesses can be crippled, confidence destroyed and lenders wary. What's needed is a vaccine. One of the key measures announced by Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg was a relaxation of superannuation rules, allowing those in financial distress to access up to $20,000 this year and next year. It may bolster spending and give the economy a lift. The only problem with that plan is that it will put further pressure on the stock market because the only way super funds can provide that kind of cash to their members is by selling shares. In recent years, Industry Funds, which now dominate superannuation, have piled into infrastructure and other alternative investments in a bid to diversify their source of income. Investments like toll roads and airports, however, aren't easy to sell. So, to meet the expected cash redemptions, they'll have to offload liquid investments like stocks and bonds. Meanwhile, many of our corporations, in order to survive, will need to raise more cash from shareholders. Those that don't, or can't, will come under significant pressure, particularly if the recession extends into next year. Several may collapse, undermining confidence in stocks. But there is a much bigger threat to stock markets globally. Many big multinationals have taken advantage of ultra-cheap loans and have hocked themselves to the hilt over the past decade. Mostly, they've just handed the money straight back to shareholders. So, they still owe vast quantities of debt but have nothing to show for it. Around $US13 trillion of corporate debt globally remains outstanding, much of it raised through corporate bond markets. Corporate bond prices have collapsed in recent weeks particularly for companies in the entertainment and tourism sectors while oil producers also in the firing line. Car makers, chemical companies and electronics groups also are in trouble following months of supply shortages. Concerns about debt defaults have rocked Wall Street in the past month and contributed to one of the worst credit squeezes in history. Money managers have been forced to offload anything and everything they can to raise cash, resulting in a huge shortage of money. That's why the US Federal Reserve has cut interest rates to zero and embarked on an unprecedented money printing program. It's why our own central bank has weighed into money markets, pumping billions into the system. The world suddenly has become a dangerous place. Make no mistake, financial markets have further to fall.

443,ASX rises for third session despite predictions coronavirus fallout could be worse than GFC,markets,"  The Australian share market has closed higher for a third straight session, despite more companies laying off staff and closing their doors due to coronavirus. The ASX 200 gained 2.3 per cent to 5,113 points, while the All Ordinaries index rose by 2.6 per cent or 129 points to 5,135. The rally came despite a survey by the Bureau of Statistics revealing that nearly half of Australian businesses had already experienced an adverse impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, before the restrictions were introduced. Shares in Premier Investments — owner of Smiggle, Peter Alexander, Portmans and Just Jeans — clawed back from early losses to close up by 1.5 per cent, after it announced it would shut down its stores in Australia and stand down 9,000 workers globally. Flight Centre shares remain suspended from trade. It plans to stand down 3,800 workers in Australia as the coronavirus crisis virtually shuts down the travel industry. Virgin Australia shares gained 16.9 per cent to $0.08, after the company's chief executive told the ABC that more than 1,000 people could be made redundant. The airline has grounded most of its flights because of coronavirus. Super Retail Group shares rose 7.8 per cent, as the company said all of its Australian stores would continue to trade, although it has closed its Supercheap Auto and Macpac stores in New Zealand for at least four weeks. The firm has also suspended its dividend reinvestment plan. Wall Street ended mixed ahead of a vote on the $US2 trillion ($3.4 trillion) coronavirus rescue package, which the US Senate later passed during the Australian trading session. US Republicans and Democrats had agreed on the unprecedented stimulus bill, which includes a $US500 billion ($839 billion) fund to help industries and direct payments of up to $US3,000 ($5,000) each for millions of families. The Dow Jones index surged as much as 6 per cent but pared its highs on the news to close 2.4 per cent or 496 points higher at 21,201. The S&P 500 rose 28 points or 1.2 per cent at 2,476 but has still lost about $11.75 trillion in value from its record high last month. The Nasdaq lost its gains and fell 34 points or 0.4 per cent to 7,384. Boeing jumped 24 per cent as investors hoped for government support for the aerospace and aviation industries. Walmart is waiving rent for in-store businesses in April. More than 10,000 firms, from hair and nail salons to restaurants, operate in Walmart shopping centres.

444,Australian shares rise but consumer confidence tumbles to near all-time low,markets,"  The Australian share market has risen, recouping some of yesterday's 6 per cent fall which saw nearly $100 billion wiped off the value of shares, but consumer confidence has tanked to its lowest since the 1990-91 recession. The ASX 200 index closed 4.2 per cent higher at 4,735 points. Despite the gain, the benchmark index is nearly 34 per cent weaker than the high posted on February 20. The All Ordinaries index put on 4.15 per cent or 189 points to 4,753. All sectors finished in positive territory, but consumer stocks lagged, with non-essential businesses ordered to close to help stem the spread of coronavirus. Shares in Retail Food Group (-8.6pc), JB Hi-Fi (-1.8pc) and Super Retail Group (-1.7pc) were all weaker. Woolworths shares closed 0.7 per cent lower after it said it had shut its hotels due to the coronavirus restrictions. The company will delay a spin-off of its drinks unit until next year and will try to redeploy hotel workers elsewhere in the company. Woolworths boss Brad Banducci said sales were strong in recent weeks because of ""unprecedented demand for a range of products as customers have consumed more at home and stocked their pantries"". The Australian dollar has come off its overnight low and is trading around 59 US cents, up 1.3 per cent. The ANZ-Roy Morgan weekly survey of consumer confidence tumbled nearly 28 per cent last week, to 17 per cent below the lowest point recorded during the global financial crisis in 2008. ""Consumer confidence has been lower than this level, but only just and only during the 1990-91 recession,"" ANZ's head of Australian economics David Plank said. In particular, respondents' views about their current and future financial situations deteriorated significantly, as did views of economic conditions. Confirming the worst fears of already-struggling retailers, views on whether it was a good time to buy a major household item plunged more than 37 per cent. Mr Plank noted that the survey methodology has been changed from face-to-face to phone and online interviews, in light of the coronavirus pandemic, which could have impacted the results. However, he said the consistency of the responses suggests this is unlikely. In the US, stocks fell after the US Congress failed for a second time to pass a coronavirus stimulus bill worth more than $US1 trillion ($1.7 trillion). An extraordinary economic intervention by US central bank, the Federal Reserve, did little to lift investor confidence. It brought out the big bazooka by promising unlimited purchases of bonds and other assets. It included lending against student loans and repurchasing US Treasury bonds to bolster the economy. The unprecedented steps briefly lifted US stock futures but the mounting death toll from COVID-19 and more lockdowns by US states quickly sent the main indexes into the red. University of Oregon economics professor Tim Duy said businesses starved of cash may be able to tap into the Fed's lifeline. ""The Fed is still working to maintain the flow of credit because they know what happened during the [Great] Depression [when] too many firms went under,"" he said. ""The more damage that happens, the harder it is going to be to restart the economy.""

The return on two-year US Treasury bonds fell to a seven-year low of 0.234 per cent after the Fed stimulus. The aviation industry continues to see shutdowns and job cuts with more companies hurt by the virus outbreak. Engine maker GE Aviation plans to reduce its US workforce by 10 per cent, while parent company, General Electric, fell 5.6 per cent. Shares in Zoom Video jumped 20 per cent as more people and companies practice social distancing and shares in Netflix rose 7 per cent. Stocks fell in Europe as well — the FTSE 100 index lost nearly 4 per cent to 4,994. Jewellery chain Michael Hill International said it was closing its Australian stores indefinitely because of the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement to the New Zealand and Australian stock exchanges, the jeweller said local workers would be stood down with access to leave entitlements. ""In Australia, the current 'social-distancing' guidelines are not consistent with the day-to-day conduct of our business,"" the company said. ""The drop off in trade the company has experienced in Australia also reflects a customer base that is of course focused on more immediate issues. ""In the interests of the health and safety of our people and our customers, Michael Hill today announces that it will suspend operations of its Australian store network for an indefinite period with immediate effect."" Michael Hill also suspended its New Zealand and Canadian stores but its online business will continue. The company will defer payment of an interim dividend.

445,Australian shares plunge again as businesses shut and US Congress bickers over coronavirus stimulus,markets,"  Australian shares have lost nearly $100 billion in a day of volatile trade after the country shut down parts of its economy and more states shut their borders. Investors were also unnerved by the failure of the US Congress to pass the latest coronavirus stimulus bill, which saw US stock futures plunge 5 per cent at the open, the biggest permissible fall. The ASX 200 index came off earlier lows to be down by 5.6 per cent or 271 points to 4,546 at the close, with most sectors in the red led by banks and consumer stocks. The benchmark index is back to where it was in late November 2012. The All Ordinaries index slumped 6 per cent to 4,564. The Australian dollar is trading at a near 17-year low against the greenback of around 57.63 US cents. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Another fall in oil prices saw the ASX 200 energy index lose as much as 9 per cent during the session, to the lowest since early 2004, as more companies cut their spending and delayed projects. It comes amid a slump in demand for fuel due to coronavirus, and as governments globally closed borders and shutdown their economies. The Nikkei 225 index in Japan has gained 2 per cent after the Bank of Japan said it would inject an extra 800 billion yen ($12.7 billion) into the financial system of the world's third-largest economy. In China, the Shanghai Composite and the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong were both in the red in afternoon trade. Fashion and swimwear brand Tigerlily became the latest retailer to go into voluntary administration. Administrator KordaMentha said the decision to go into administration was made after considering the impact of the coronavirus. Tigerlily employs 200 people and some shops will stay open as the administrators look for a buyer. The firm was founded by former model and businesswoman Jodhi Meares, a former wife of billionaire James Packer. The first meeting of creditors will be on April 1. The Reserve Bank said it planned to buy another $4 billion in government bonds. That follows a $5 billion purchase of bonds on Friday in its biggest intervention in Australia's financial system in history. The banking regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, will soon announce plans to reduce the regulatory burden faced by financial institutions in the wake of the coronavirus. The news comes a little over a year since the final report of the banking royal commission was released, which clamped down on bad behaviour by financial institutions. A suite of new measures have been unveiled to soften the economic blow dealt by coronavirus. But what do they mean for your wallet? APRA said lenders needed to put aside more money to cover losses caused by allowing customers to defer loan repayments. The Council for Financial Regulators said it had discussed the need for continued ""close engagement"" and contingency plans with international regulators. CMC Markets chief markets strategist for Asia Pacific, Michael McCarthy, said investors were increasingly pessimistic about the economic outlook and were expecting a recession globally and in Australia, especially as the US Senate failed to advance a coronavirus stimulus bill. ""The lack of political will in a crisis is really disappointing investors,"" he said. However, negotiations are ongoing, and US President Donald Trump said Congress was close to reaching an agreement. On the local market, banks and industrial stocks led the falls. The big banks plunged to multi-year lows, with National Australia Bank back at levels not seen since 1996 at one point this morning.

446,"Boats for sale, crews out of work as coronavirus ravages Qld fishing industry",markets,"  Export-orientated businesses are suffering an uncertain future as the coronavirus global downturn hits the bottom lines of exposed industries. The live coral trout trade, which underpins the fishing sector in the north Queensland town of Bowen, has been shut down since January with dozens of crews out of work and boats for sale. Ben Collison, a 22-year veteran of the Bowen line-fishing industry, said it was the worst he had ever seen the market. ""Ninety per cent of the boats — as soon as China stopped, they stopped,"" he said. ""They all relied on the Chinese market."" For Mr Collison, last week's Government announcement that public gatherings should not exceed 100 people killed demand in the Sydney restaurant scene that takes about half his normal catch. Trade for his clients — including celebrity chef Neil Perry's Rockpool Bar & Grill restaurant — fell dramatically last week, leading to the cancellation of future coral trout orders. ""He went from 400 to 600 people for a lunch sitting, down to eight people, nearly nothing, nearly shut the doors,"" Mr Collison said. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Adding to the pain for Bowen's fishermen, prices crashed from $60 per kilogram early in the year to just $17 last week, less than half the break-even price. With 55 fishermen unemployed and some boat owners already leaving to find work elsewhere, the future for Bowen's seafood trade is uncertain. Assistance from the State Government has included waiving quota and licence fees and offering to assist with transitioning the sector from live to chilled production of fish, but Mr Collison says that market is now unprofitable also. ""It's just not viable to take our boats out to chase that market,"" he said. ""There's already boats popped up for sale and there's blokes already gone, for sure."" Wholesaler Chloe Bauer from Bowen Fisherman's Seafood unloads boats and services the live coral trout trade, but the downturn is also hurting other parts of the business. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. ""Now we're starting to see the effects on the retail side of the business, people are starting to go into panic mode and not venturing out as much,"" she said. ""We're trying to keep everyone in a job, we're trying to look at ways that we can do things, continuing takeaway, maybe do some renovations to the place."" Ms Bauer said China was poised to reopen its borders to live coral trout exports, but freight remained an issue with mass cancellation of flights limiting opportunity. ""People were looking at buying,"" she said. ""China's opening up and now we don't have a way to get it there, so it's a huge impact."" Terry Must, the owner of Bowen's other wholesale business, Arabon Seafoods, said he had already had to lay two staff off due to the crash. He urged Australians to buy more local seafood. ""We just hope people can come to the local fish shops and keep the industry going in some sort of way,"" he said. The Bowen fruit and vegetable industry represents Australia's largest winter growing region, with a typical annual value of $460 million. Several seasons of poor prices and excess production, with competition from a growing hot house sector closer to southern markets, means some growers have slashed plantings this season by up to a third. Neville Travers-Jones, the owner of Bowen Quality Seedlings, supplies farmers across the district with tomatoes, capsicums, melons and pumpkins. Ms Travers-Jones said sales were down in 2020. ""Most of the fellas have cut back a bit, probably there wasn't as big a demand in markets last year so some of them have trimmed numbers,"" he said. ""In some cases that's been a small percentage, in some cases that's been 30 per cent or more."" Several growers the ABC spoke to raised concerns about retaining a healthy workforce and the slump in hospitality trade as influencing their decision making for the winter 2020 crop. But Bowen-Gumlu Growers Association president Carl Walker said the cuts were more to do with long-term market conditions than the economic downturn. Subscribe for the national headlines of the day. Mr Walker said organising a labour force to contend with an expected winter peak in the COVID-19 infection rate was the industry's priority. ""People are obviously concerned, we're working with the local backpackers to set up a house or two that'll purely be for people who get the virus, so they can be isolated for 14 days,"" he said. ""We're working with the State Government, [horticulture lobby] Growcom and other groups to set up a strategy across Queensland. ""I think most of us are pretty nervous about 2020, this is an unknown — the world hasn't been in this situation since 1919.""

447,"analysis: Safe as houses? In the age of coronavirus, don't be so sure",markets,"  Global markets have lost trillions of dollars, central bankers are rolling out extraordinary measures to stop the financial system collapsing, and even the usual safety net of gold is dropping like a stone. But one thing is holding up for now — the Australian property market. ""Business as usual this weekend,"" crows an email from a real estate agent in Sydney's inner west, which is offering virtual inspections and live-streamed auctions in a nod to social distancing. ""2020 ushers in new moderate growth cycles"" is the title of this week's letter to clients from an agency in Melbourne's northern suburbs. It lists low interest rates, a pick-up in demand from retirees looking for rental returns, and a weak dollar luring in offshore buyers, as reasons that real estate remains a ""safe"" and ""capital preserving"" option. In other words — safe as houses. In past economic meltdowns Australian homes and apartments have fared well. In the last Australian recession, the one we had to have, home prices declined only around 4 per cent in 1990. Property prices declined in only one of the five years following the financial crisis of 2008; going backward on an annual basis by 4.8 per cent in 2010, before rebounding 2.1 and 9.3 per cent in the following two years. But past performance is no indicator of future returns. The crisis that we find ourselves in is very different to previous shake-outs. Commonwealth Bank boss Matt Comyn, who sits on top of a portfolio of the largest number of loans in the country, believes the coronavirus impact will be longer and harder than the only crisis many working Australians can fully remember. ""There's every reason to be concerned at this particular point in time,"" Comyn told ABC's The Business. ""The GFC was quite different and much more around failure in the financial system and a lack of trust, particularly between financial institutions."" After the first initial shock, the wave of pain of the GFC was like a slow-moving tsunami. Many households and businesses were able to somewhat prepare, and to some extent economies continued to function, airlines continued to fly, hotels accepted guests, cruise liners left the docks. But this time economic activity has been wiped out overnight across the globe. Ratings agency Standard and Poor's says the world is already in recession. China, one of Australia's biggest customers for goods, services and raw materials, has contracted so sharply it's hard to comprehend. Factory output plunged 13.5 per cent even before the full shutdown, and retail sales fell 20 per cent In Australia, the unemployment rate is set to shoot from 5 per cent to 7 per cent. And some believe that may be conservative given the scale of the shutdown. It's hard to know, as this is unlike any other economic crisis. It's a health crisis. Instead of brides scaling back the number of flowers for a wedding, having one photographer instead of two and choosing cheaper plonk for the table, weddings have been cancelled en masse. During the GFC theatres struggled but remained open, offering discounted tickets. Not this time. Social media is littered with artists, singers, actors out of work. Stephanie, a Sydney make-up artist reliant on weddings and some theatre work, now has zero income. From an average $6,000 a month to nothing, overnight. She isn't spending at cafes, make-up stores, bars, she cancelled an Airbnb weekend away on the NSW South Coast, and forget about new clothes. She estimates she has savings that will cover food, rent and bills for three months. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. Will weddings be back on the minute coronavirus is deemed ""under control""? No. Will theatres have money to pay for extras like make-up artists once they reopen? No. Stephanie is already considering selling her car and is looking to move back in with her parents. Her landlords will have an empty flat. Stephanie is just one element of the wedding; think of the florists, the suppliers to the florists, the flower growers, the caterers, the wait staff, the marquee suppliers — nearly all small businesses with zero bookings over the next three months at least. The indefinite standing-down of 20,000 Qantas staff this week shows it is not just casual workers reliant on events who are being devastated by the shutdowns. Tim, a maintenance worker in Brisbane, has two toddlers, a mortgage and only two weeks of annual leave to cover the likely couple of months he will be sitting at home. The airline has said many of its employees will have to take leave without pay. Tim's mortgage isn't going to go away, so any non-essential spending, at pubs, cafés, getting the pool pump fixed, has been shelved. The holiday up Queensland's Sunshine Coast in June is off. A pilot, James, believes he will see a 50 per cent reduction in work, which means an almost 50 per cent reduction in money landing in his account. The consequences of the outbreak will be long and deep, because despite promises that ""things will return to normal"" the scars of losing income overnight will not fade quickly from the consumers' mind. Household war chests, the money saved for a ""rainy day"", will be depleted if not run out across the country. And it is unlikely Government stimulus hand-outs or RBA-backed business loans will prevent that. Clearance rates at auctions have been running hot, along with prices in most capital cities over the past couple of months as buyers confident in their jobs and buoyed by ever-lower interest rates threw up the paddle. The Reserve Bank made an emergency cut to the cash rate this week, taking it to 0.25 per cent, and banks are passing it on in different forms. While past rate cuts have lit a fire under buyers' enthusiasm, perhaps this last cut may cause buyers to wonder — are they really going to be safe as houses this time?

448,Banks hit pause on $100 billion in small business loan repayments amid coronavirus fears,markets," Politics The Australian Banking Association (ABA) says all small businesses hit by the coronavirus pandemic will be able to access a six-month deferral of all loan repayments. ABA chief executive Anna Bligh said the relief package would apply to more than $100 billion in small business loans and expected it could put $8 billion back into the pockets of these companies. ""Small business can rest assured that if they need help they will get it,"" she said. Ms Bligh said the banks were yet to see households going into mortgage stress as a result of COVID-19 but would reassess their approach if the situation changed. ""If we start to see any other critical need … that's something that [the banks] know they'll need to look at,"" she said. Soon after the announcement, NAB said home loan customers could pause repayments for up to six months. The bank has also cut its fixed-rate home loans by 60 basis points. ANZ has also cut its fixed-rate home loans by 0.59 per cent. It comes after the Reserve Bank cut interest rates to a record low 0.25 per cent on Thursday and announced extraordinary measures to help prevent a coronavirus-driven recession. The RBA will buy Australian government bonds as part of its first-ever quantitative easing program, and provide a three-year funding facility to provide cheap loans for Australian banks. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic ""I know that the decision yesterday by the Reserve Bank to inject low-interest loans into those banks that may be able to lend out into the sector was very welcome by banks,"" Ms Bligh said. ""There are many small businesses that are struggling with loan repayments, and this deferral will help them."" Small businesses employ around five million Australians. Ms Bligh said the banks had been in discussions with Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and regulators ahead of Friday's announcement. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. ""We are now in extraordinary and very difficult times,"" she said. ""This is a moment when the country needs to see all of its institutions working together cooperatively and in the national interest.""

We consider that this relief package will enable banks to quickly provide relief to impacted businesses, and allow them to keep employing their staff,"" chairman Rod Sims said. ""Importantly, interim authorisation does not mean that individual banks can't decide to offer more favourable and tailored terms to their small business customers experiencing financial hardship during these times."" Federal Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese said NAB's personal home loan decision would build confidence in the economy. ""I think any measure that provides support to borrowers at this time is worthy of support,"" he said. ""NAB have shown some leadership here.

449,analysis: Coronavirus fears mean shops are starting to accept card payments only. Is this the end of cash?,markets,"  Coronavirus fears mean shops are accepting card payments only. Is this the end of cash? The coronavirus pandemic has spread to many aspects of life. But one of its early and unexpected impacts seems to be on cash — or, more specifically, cash transactions. Though it does not reference cash specifically, Department of Health advice says the COVID-19 virus can spread through ""touching objects that have cough or sneeze droplets from an infected person"" on them. So when managers of The Knox cafe, in suburban Canberra, met to discuss how to protect staff and improve hygiene, refusing coins and banknotes was one of their first decisions. ""We've stopped using keep cups and we've stopped cash transactions,"" front-of-house manager Madeleine Clarke said. ""Our boss wants us to minimise hand-to-hand interactions and, obviously, cash carries a lot of germs."" Peter Barclay, who runs city pub King O'Malleys, has started to ask drinkers to do the same. ""Already, very few people use cash in the economy … it's probably 10 to 15 per cent of our patrons,"" he said. ""When they come to the bar, we just say, 'Look, do you have a credit card?'"" These cases are not isolated. Merchants across the country are responding to the COVID-19 crisis by avoiding touching money. Others, such as McDonald's restaurants, still accept coins and banknotes, but instruct staff to wear gloves while doing so. A spokesperson for McDonald's said the chain had also advised employees how to give and take coins from customers in a way that minimised contact. The NSW Government has also recently reminded businesses of the dangers of handling cash and, if it was required, suggested they use hand sanitisers. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic There is a widespread belief that if you give a business ""legal tender"" — official Australian coins or banknotes — they must accept it as payment. However, that is not what the law says. In fact, the Currency Act limits the buyer's rights to use physical money in certain situations. For example, if you use silver coins (5c, 10c, 20c or 50c pieces) for a purchase worth more than $5, the seller can say no. Similarly, $2 coins only give you the right to buy a $20 good or service. It is also legal for vending machines and parking meters to accept only certain denominations of currency. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. The Reserve Bank of Australia says sellers are ""at liberty to set the commercial terms upon which payment will take place"" before the purchase ""and refusal to accept payment in legal tender banknotes and coins is not unlawful"". A sign at a cafe counter does just that — it lays out the commercial terms before the customer orders. The exception is when a purchase was agreed without first settling on how the payment would be made. ""Refusal to accept legal tender in payment of an existing debt, where no other means of payment/settlement has been specified in advance, conceivably could have consequences in legal proceedings,"" the Reserve Bank said. Concerns about coronavirus may be stymying cash transactions, but the use of notes and coins has been in decline for years. Global firm Research and Markets predicted last year that Australia could become the Asia-Pacific's ""first cashless society"" by 2022. The Commonwealth Bank offered a more cautious forecast, saying that was likelier to happen by 2026. Yesterday, the Reserve Bank published its latest survey of how consumers pay for goods and services. They found only one in four transactions last year were in cash; 13 years ago it was the opposite, with a quarter of our purchases made with cards. However, the Reserve noted there were two main exceptions to this rapid switch in habits: poorer Australians and older Australians. While people aged 65 and over used cash less often than they once did, they still used notes and coins for more than half of their payments. Yet while fewer Australians than ever are using cash, some of us still want it — and large amounts of it — for a range of reasons. The value of Australian currency in circulation has actually been trending upwards in recent years, almost all of it $50 and $100 bills. In a paper published last year, two Reserve Bank staff analysed where the banknotes were and what they were used for. They estimated that about half to three-quarters of the cash was essentially ""hoarded"" — both in Australia and overseas — as either savings or for emergency use. About 15-35 per cent was used for ""legitimate transactions"", while the rest was either lost or used in the black economy. So while coronavirus may be making us loathe to actually touch cash, it will be many years, if ever, before Australia's banknotes are killed off.

450,analysis: Has the Reserve Bank lost control of the economy?,markets,"  Has the coronavirus pandemic revealed the Reserve Bank has lost control of the economy? It has passed largely unnoticed, what with the panic induced by an escalating health crisis and stock markets ravaged by relentless selling. In the past week, however, something far more insidious has begun to unfold which threatens to unhinge the global economy and thwart efforts to repair our financial systems. In what is shaping up to be an even more severe rerun of the events of 2008, credit markets have completely seized. Think of the shelves in your local supermarket and transpose that to money markets. Cash supplies have evaporated, money is being hoarded and market interest rates — the price of cash — are soaring. Central banks, and particularly the Reserve Bank of Australia, now find themselves staring into the abyss, on the verge of losing control of the only real weapon they have at their disposal — interest rates. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic The implications, particularly if they can't get the situation back under control, potentially are dire. Is this the point when a virus jumps the barrier, when a health crisis infects the global financial system and sends the world economy into a severe depression with waves of corporate collapses and mass unemployment? Ever since the US Federal Reserve slashed cash rates to near zero at the weekend, money markets have headed in the opposite direction. Similarly, a public announcement by the Reserve Bank on Monday, that it would begin pumping in billons of dollars to depress market interest rates, was ignored. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. In fact, it was worse than that. Market rates boarded Apollo 13 and headed to the Moon, breaking every rule in the Central Bankers Guide to the Universe. Even after Wednesday's confirmation that it would step into the market for Australian government bonds in an effort to lower rates, the market snubbed its nose at the RBA and sent rates higher. Just think about that: at a time when the RBA is desperate to cut interest rates, when the popular press is ruminating about what negative interest rates might mean for you, cash has become almost a black-market commodity. You can only get it if you're prepared to pay through the nose. There have been endless warnings about the enormous build-up of debt, particularly amongst big corporations and especially American companies, over the past few years. American corporate debt has ballooned to about $US19 trillion. The International Monetary Fund, the Bank for International Settlements, the World Bank and the OECD have been banging on about it for years. While a day of reckoning always was expected, no-one anticipated a health issue would be the catalyst. In a blink, human beings have stopped congregating and, en masse, halted spending. Revenue has dried up. Money has stopped flowing through the system. Airlines and tourism have been the first to fall victim. But they are just the first-line casualties. Service industries across the globe have seen revenues crater as customers have fled for the safety of home. Businesses that provide those companies with goods and services have been hit. The sudden drop in revenues — in some cases to almost zero — means that a large proportion of those massive corporate debts no longer can be serviced. They can't afford to pay the interest, let alone the principal. That has sent shivers through the financial world. Actually, that's an understatement. Financiers are in a mad panic. Companies don't just borrow long term for big investments. They also borrow cash for as little as a week and, in some cases, overnight. Occasionally, it is for finance just to pay wages. With money, even on short-term loans, in such short supply, desperate corporations have looked to draw down any reserves and lines of credit they can find. Unlike 2008, when bankers were caught red-handed after pouring cash into dud US real estate, this crisis originated in the corporate world. When the proverbial really hit the fan in mid-2008, the RBA was sitting on cash rates of 7.25 per cent. Within a few months, it had slashed rates to 3 per cent. It was swift, decisive and effective. This time, it is starting from an incredibly depleted position. For most of our lives, the economy has just been ticking along doing its thing. But economists say the next two quarters will likely throw the country into recession. When this current crisis began brewing a few months back, interest rates already were below 1 per cent. Now, at 0.25 per cent, it is as low as the RBA is prepared to go. From here on, we venture into unexplored territory. Not only that, rate cuts this time are unlikely to be effective. This is a crisis that won't be solved by debt because no-one wants to spend. People are fearful. They're unwilling to mix in public. And many face the prospect of losing their livelihood. A large number will lose their lives. The only quick way out of this crisis is a vaccine that can save lives and restore confidence. But there's precious little sign of one. With central banks now firing blanks, it will be up to government to fill the breach.

451,RBA announces money-printing program to prevent recession,markets,"  The Reserve Bank has cut interest rates to a record low 0.25 per cent and announced extraordinary measures to help prevent a coronavirus-driven recession. The RBA will buy Australian government bonds as part of its first-ever quantitative easing program, and provide a three-year funding facility to provide cheap loans for Australian banks. Australia's economy continues to rapidly deteriorate, and panicked investors have wiped billions of dollars of value off the local stock market. In turning to quantitative easing, the central bank is using a lever that it has not used even during some of the worst catastrophes in recent history, including the global financial crisis and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Just before the announcement, the Australian dollar plunged to its lowest level since October 2002, trading at 55.08 US cents. The currency has lost 20 per cent so far this year. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe said the bank would hold the cash rate at 0.25 per cent ""until progress is being made towards full employment and it is confident that inflation will be sustainably within the 2-3 per cent target band"". Dr Lowe said the cash rate could be at this level for some years as it was expecting significant job losses. The latest rate cut was ""a substantial easing of monetary policy"" and brought the cash rate in line with a number of other countries as a result of actions by the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. ""Before the coronavirus hit, we were expecting to make progress towards full employment and the inflation target, although that progress was expected to be only very gradual,"" he said. ""Recent events have obviously changed the situation."" ""We are likely to be at this level of interest rates for an extended period."" Dr Lowe said he was not able to provide an updated set of economic forecasts because ""the situation is just too fluid"". ""But we are expecting a major hit to economic activity and incomes in Australia that will last for a number of months,"" he said. ""We are also expecting significant job losses."" The Reserve Bank board typically only meets on the first Tuesday of every month, but with global stock markets in panic because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it held an emergency meeting on Wednesday. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. The RBA said it would also provide at least $90 billion at 0.25 per cent over three years to banks if they lend that cash to small and medium-sized businesses. This is similar to an initiative announced by the Bank of England last week. It came as the Morrison Government announced an investment of up to $15 billion to enable smaller lenders to continue supporting Australian consumers and small businesses. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said it would ""enable customers of smaller lenders to continue to access affordable credit"" and would complement the RBA's $90 billion term funding facility. Mr Frydenberg said the Government's debt agency, the Australian Office of Financial Management, would provide the $15 billion through wholesale funding markets used by small banks and non-bank lenders. Enabling legislation would be introduced into Parliament next week. The RBA is moving in the footsteps of other world central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, in buying up government bonds and encouraging consumer spending by printing more money and pumping it into the economy. Dr Lowe said the scale of job losses would depend on the ability of businesses to keep workers on. The coronavirus outbreak is expected to cost the Australian economy billions, with the second-order impact to be felt across supply chains, as many factories remain closed in China. ""We saw during the global financial crisis how flexibility in working arrangements limited job losses and this benefited the entire community,"" he said. It could take time for employment to rise but getting to a 4.5 per cent unemployment rate was a ""reasonable estimate"" of what he saw as full employment in Australia. The Reserve Bank would want to see that rate, and be within its inflation target, before changing its position on interest rates, he said. ""I'm really looking forward to those days,"" he said. Dr Lowe hoped that by the end of the year anyone who had lost their job during this crisis would get that job back. ""We are clearly living in extraordinary and challenging times,"" he said. ""As our country manages this difficult situation, it is important that we do not lose sight of the fact that we will come through this."" ""At some point, the virus will be contained and our economy and our financial markets will recover."" Some economists have called on the RBA to do more to save the economy. Coronavirus looks set to cause deep global economic disruption, and those companies that have binged on cheap debt are the ones least likely to survive the crisis, writes Ian Verrender. Dr Lowe said he would not speculate on other measures, but ""nothing's off the table"". ""We are in extraordinary times, and we are prepared to do whatever is necessary to make sure … the supply of credit is there for Australian businesses and households,"" he said. ""We feel like at the moment we've done enough. If it turns out not be the case, there are other measures we can consider. ""We will do whatever is necessary … to get us through this difficult period."" He said the Australian dollar had been the great shock absorber for the economy. The RBA would not, for the time being, intervene in the foreign exchange market, but would be prepared to if the situation worsened. In the meantime, there was very close policy coordination between the Australian Government, the Australian Treasury, the Reserve Bank and Australia's financial regulators. APRA and ASIC both stand ready to assist institutions to work through regulatory issues arising from the virus, he said. The Council of Financial Regulators was meeting again on Friday, and would also meet with the largest lenders to discuss how they could support their customers. Dr Lowe said for now the RBA would not be purchasing bonds directly from the Government, but operating in the secondary market. The RBA was not seeking to have the three-year yield identically at 25 basis points each and every day. ""How much we need to purchase, and when we need to enter the market, will depend upon market conditions and prices,"" he said. ""It may also take some time for yields to fall from their current level to 25 basis points."" All this was so that ""when the health crisis recedes, the country is well placed to recover strongly"". The bank had already slashed the rate to 0.5 per cent earlier this month. Commonwealth Bank chief executive Matt Comyn said the bank had expanded support for small businesses and households in response to the RBA announcements. ""We recognise that this is a very concerning time for our customers and the community,"" he said. ""These are unprecedented times, and they call for unprecedented measures.""

452,The Aussie dollar hits lowest level since 2002 as panic grips markets,markets,"  The Australian dollar has plunged to its lowest level since October 2002 and the local stock market has fallen further. The dollar fell to 55.08 US cents ahead of a widely anticipated emergency rate cut from the Reserve Bank, as volatility gripped currency markets. Westpac senior currency strategist Sean Callow said the panic selling on share markets had spread to foreign exchange markets. ""It's a real squeeze, reminiscent of the global financial crisis,"" he said. The dollar dropped to nearly 57 US cents overnight after the greenback surged on more promised US stimulus and then rose above 58 US cents on the ECB stimulus plans on Thursday morning. At 4:20pm (AEDT), it was buying around 55.8 US cents. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic The Australian share market has closed sharply lower, led by heavy losses for the banks after the emergency rate cut from the RBA. The ASX 200 has lost 3.4 per cent to 4,782 points, while the All Ordinaries index lost 3.8 per cent. Shares in the major banks have fallen sharply, with ANZ shares dropping 9.75 per cent, followed by NAB(-9pc), Westpac (-8.6pc) and Commonwealth Bank (-4.7pc). Qantas shares fell more than 15 per cent or $0.39 to $2.14 after it delayed dividend payments to investors and announced it was suspending international flights until the end of May. Australia's jobless rate has unexpectedly fallen. The Bureau of Statistics says the unemployment rate fell from 5.3 per cent in January to 5.1 per cent in February. Nearly 27,000 jobs were created — more than double economists' expectations. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. Economists predicted the rate would remain steady at 5.3 per cent. Full time employment increased by 26,700 while part-time employment increased by 20,000. The ABS said there was no notable impact on the employment data from the coronavirus because the survey was carried out before the steep rise in Australian cases. The bureau's chief economist, Bruce Hockman, said the total number of hours worked fell over February, although the underemployment rate was steady at 8.6 per cent. ""We have seen a decrease in the trend hours worked in recent months, even though employment has continued to grow,"" Mr Hockman said. ""This largely reflects a fall in the total hours worked by men."" Dr Sarah Hunter, chief economist at BIS Oxford Economics, said fewer people looking for work caused the jobless rate to fall, with the participation rate dropping by 0.1 per cent to 66 per cent. But she said the coronavirus economic shutdown was likely to cause unemployment to surge with a wide range of industries such as education, tourism and retail hard hit. ""Looking beyond this, the outlook for jobs growth is highly uncertain given current conditions,"" she said. ""The imposition of social distancing rules and the effective bans (formal and informal, through consumers choosing to stay at home) on travel have had a significant negative impact on activity in a number of service sectors, and we expect to see job losses in these areas in the coming months."" Ms Hunter said government support should help to limit job losses from the economic impact of the virus, but the speed of recovery will ""crucially"" depend on how quickly the outbreak in Australia is brought under control, and how soon life can return to normal. EY Chief Economist Jo Masters said the jobs data was stronger than expected, ""suggesting that the labour market remained in reasonable shape in February"". ""However, a lot has changed since then and it is unlikely that this data will provide any comfort to policymakers,"" she said. ""It seems inevitable that hours worked will fall and unemployment will rise in coming months, although it is hard to put a number on how far given how swiftly the economic impact of the pandemic is hitting.""

453,Hobart's Salamanca Markets to close due to coronavirus fears,markets,"  Hobart's Salamanca Market will close for the next two weeks, despite earlier assurances from the Prime Minister that open air markets would not need to close. The weekly market has been operating every Saturday for almost 50 years and is a major tourist draw card among the state's most visited attractions. City of Hobart General Manager Nick Heath said the precautionary measure had been taken after careful consultation with health authorities. ""This is a difficult time for everyone involved — not least of all the stallholders — and we make this decision with a heavy heart,"" Mr Heath said. ""However, it's a decision that we have made based on all the information available at this time."" LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic He said while markets have not been included in current public gathering restrictions, it was not possible to implement proper social distancing. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. ""In the interest of health and safety of patrons, stallholders and staff, the markets will be suspended for two weeks, while we continue to take advice and monitor the changing environment around the COVID-19 response,"" he said. Lord Mayor Anna Reynolds said the council was ""deeply saddened at the need to take these sorts of measures"". ""Salamanca Market is an iconic feature of our city and we want to ensure its longevity well beyond this current crisis,"" she said. ""We know there will be pain for businesses in the coming weeks and possibly months. ""This is an unprecedented situation and we don't yet know how deeply the impacts will be felt. ""This is where, as a community, we need to support each other as best we can. The most effective way to do that right now is to practise good hygiene, social distancing and any other protective measures to reduce the risk of the virus spreading through our city."" The initial closure of the market will be reassessed in two weeks time and at regular intervals after that. Salamanca stallholder Alice Hansen said she while she was anticipating the decision, it was ""bitterly disappointing"" but necessary. ""It does have an impact, for me, as well as the majority of the others who rely on that weekly income,"" she said. ""To have that just cut off with fairly limited notice … is quite shocking."" She said in her 15 years at the market, she'd never seen it shut down like this. ""Even in the most crazy weather we've been down there. So it's a sad day, but understanding why that decision has been made,"" she said. Ms Hansen said although the advice so far had suggested outdoor events were ok, she did not think it was feasible to practice social distancing at Salamanca Market. ""Most of the time on a busy market day, everyone's shoulder-to-shoulder, you can barely push a pram through there,"" she said. ""It would be a haven for germs passing between each other."" She said the difficult decision to close ""hopefully will reward us in the long term"". Meanwhile, it was announced earlier on Wednesday that Tasmania's largest agriculture expo, Agfest, has joined the long line of events to be cancelled amid coronavirus concerns. It is the first time the event has been called off in its 37-year history. Agfest attracts more than 60,000 people on average, and injects more than $20 million into the state's economy. Committee chairman Ethan Williams said the decision was not made lightly. ""It's a massive blow to Tasmania, along with everything else that's been cancelled over the last few days,"" he said. The committee is confident the event will return next year. Organisers of the Spiegeltent also announced it would no longer continue its season in Hobart. The music, comedy, cabaret and circus opened on March 5 and was set to run until March 29. ""The Spiegeltent team will be in touch with ticket holders regarding ticket options as soon as possible,"" organisers wrote. ""Please bear with us, as you can imagine, we're dealing with an unprecedented number of inquiries and appreciate your patience at this time.""

454,'Unprecedented time': Virgin Australia grounds international fleet amid coronavirus pandemic,markets,"  Virgin Australia is grounding its international fleet in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with some aviation experts warning the company may fail to survive the crisis despite Federal Government stimulus measures. In a statement to the ASX on Wednesday morning, the airline said all international services would be suspended from March 30 to June 14. The airline is also slashing domestic capacity by 50 per cent until June 14. The equivalent of 53 aircraft will be grounded. This includes the grounding of five Boeing 777s, one Airbus A330 and 14 Boeing 737 aircraft from the group's international fleet. ""We have entered an unprecedented time in the global aviation industry,"" Virgin Australia CEO and managing director Paul Scurrah said. ""[That] has required us to take significant action to responsibly manage our business while balancing traveller demands and supporting the wellbeing of Australians."" LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Virgin Australia will operate a reduced international schedule between now and March 29 to enable Australians to return home and visitors to return to their point of origin. The group said it would work closely with Government to prioritise those journeys. Mr Scurrah said the company was ""well-positioned to weather this storm"". Asked directly whether the airline was solvent Mr Scurrah responded, ""we are comfortable with our current position"". He welcomed the Federal Government's $715 million stimulus for airlines, but said, ""whether it is enough or not, it is too early to tell"". Virgin was also in discussions with the union about the impact on its 10,500 staff. It would aim to avoid redundancies by fast-tracking accrued leave, leave without pay and redeployment. But in some cases, job losses would be the outcome, he said, without stating how many redundancies would be offered. It follows the airline's August announcement it was cutting 750 head office and corporate roles, as it sought to rebound from a $349 million full-year loss. ""The saddest part about this is there will be impacts on our people,"" Mr Scurrah said. ""Redundancies in these circumstances will be an inevitability."" He said the travel restrictions were hurting the global aviation industry but could not estimate what the total loss would end up being. ""I don't have a crystal ball about how long this will go for,"" he said. ""There is virtually no international aviation sector available at the moment."" He said the company had developed a plan with the Government about where to ground their aircraft, but they would be held all over the country, including in humid areas such as Alice Springs. Aviation expert Neil Hansford told ABC News that despite the Government's stimulus, which included the waiving of certain fees and charges for the major carriers, the company could still fail to survive the crisis. He said the Government stimulus package took away ""some of the pain"" but did not guarantee any loans for the company. ""It's really nickels and dimes when in the cost of an airline, 80 per cent of the costs are fixed,"" he said. Mr Hansford said the fees and charges that were being waived were variable costs, but employee costs were fixed and redundancies would also be costly. He also pointed out Qantas owned a major part of its fleet and was not having to pay out high lease costs, which was not the case with Virgin. ""The problem is that cash is king, and if you haven't got it you're not going to survive,"" he said. But Virgin Australia has previously said that, like Qantas, it is sitting on more than $1 billion in cash. Mr Hansford said Virgin's 90 per cent shareholders were in as much or more trouble than the airline. ""Because Virgin is not an Australian airline, it is majority owned by the Chinese (Hainan and Nanshan), Singapore's Government (Singapore Airlines) and the Emirate of Abu Dabi (Etihad),"" he said. He said it was strange to subsidise a business that was not Australian owned. It would be cheaper to pay benefits to Australian employees than give money and benefits to foreign-owned airlines, he said. Today, Flight Centre announced further cuts and ""cash savings initiatives"" were on the way, following its closure of 100 underperforming stores across Australia last week. In a statement, the company said it would be ""significantly impacted"" by recent events, including government-imposed restrictions on international travel and the latest reductions in airline capacity. ""The conditions that our industry is facing are unprecedented,"" Flight Centre managing director Graham Turner said. ""Management is determined to overcome the significant challenges that it currently faces and, with the support of our stakeholders, is ready to prosper when conditions eventually normalise."" The company said it would be holding more discussions with stakeholders, and was in talks with the Federal Government to discuss broader industry assistance packages. Mr Turner has previously said the company has $1.3 billion in cash on its balance sheet. It has already made a number of changes, including introducing flexible work arrangements, reduced trading, encouraging staff to take leave during a slowdown tipped for March and April and a recruitment freeze. Executives will also give up their performance bonuses. Virgin had also already announced it would temporarily reduce chairman and director fees by 15 per cent, and remove bonuses. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. Virgin Australia's share price has been tanking for the past month. On Tuesday it dropped another 8.7 per cent to 6.3 cents, but had rebounded by Wednesday afternoon to 6.7 cents. The company said the route and schedule detail of changes across Virgin Australia and Tigerair Australia was currently being worked through and would be published over the next week. While the suspension will affect all international flights for two months from March 30, some major international routes will be impacted in the interim. They includes the popular Melbourne to Los Angeles service, which will be suspended from March 20. The Brisbane to Haneda service and Melbourne to Denpasar service will also been postponed from March 29. Virgin had set up a ""dedicated customer care hub"" on its website to deal with the surge of customer queries and travel changes. It said guests with new or existing domestic and international bookings through to June 30, 2020 could change their flight to a later date and/or a different destination without incurring a fee. Guests who no longer wished to travel could cancel their flight and receive a travel credit, it said. Passengers booked on international flights between March 30 and June 14 will be contacted by Virgin Australia within the next 14 days via email. Travel agents will make direct contact with guests who have booked through them. ""Guests are advised that due to the large number of schedule changes they should not contact the airline unless they are travelling in the next 24 hours or need immediate assistance to return home or to their point of origin,"" the company said. On Wednesday Australia's consumer watchdog issued advice for consumers and businesses about their rights and obligations if events, flights or travel services were cancelled. ""If your travel is cancelled, the ACCC expects that you will receive a refund or other remedy, such as a credit note or voucher, in most circumstances,"" it said. ""However, if the event is cancelled due to government restrictions, this impacts your rights under the consumer guarantees."" On Tuesday, Qantas and Jetstar announced they would cut international capacity by about 90 per cent and domestic capacity by about 60 per cent until at least the end of May.

456,ASX rebounds after worst fall since 1987,markets,"  Australian share market rebounds after worst plunge since 1987 The local share market has unexpectedly surged, attempting to rebound from Monday's panic sell-off, which was its worst day since the 1987 Black Monday crash. The ASX 200 has recouped some of its recent losses, ending the session 5.8 per cent higher at 5,293 points — its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1997. The All Ordinaries index rose 5.4 per cent to 5,332. The major miners and bank stocks helped lift the market, with BHP shares rising nearly 12 per cent and Commonwealth Bank shares gaining 13.3 per cent. However, the ASX 200 has still lost 26 per cent since its peak on February 20. Shortly after midday, the indices had been up more than 4 per cent as US stock futures predicted a strong rebound on Wall Street tomorrow. Overnight, Wall Street experienced a bout of panic selling, with the Dow Jones index dropping 13 per cent, its biggest fall in three decades. ""This is 2008, but with a completely different focus,"" said Axicorp market strategist Stephen Innes, referring to the global financial crisis. ""This isn't a banking crisis, it's a global economic crisis where virtually every global industry will be facing extreme pressure without a public bailout."" The best performing stock was Metcash (+27pc), the company which owns the IGA grocery stores and Mitre 10 hardware stores. This was after investment bank UBS, in an investment note, upgraded its rating to ""buy"" from ""neutral"". ""We believe COVID-19 will embed new behaviours in consumers, potentially leading to an acceleration in the rate of online penetration (both grocery & fast food) and is likely to see a return to cooking at home, at least in the near term,"" the bank said in its research. Interest rates, trade tensions and the recent bushfires are other factors contributing to the fall of the Australian dollar. UBS also upgraded its rating for Coles (neutral) and Woolworths (buy), which led to their share price jumping 9.7 and 8.4 per cent respectively. Many of today's best performers are gold stocks including Northern Star Resources, Gold Road Resources and Silver Lake Resources, which have rocketed by around 20 per cent each. This was despite a fall in the precious metal's spot price, down 0.8 per cent to $US1,502.22 an ounce. The travel industry has been hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with shares in Qantas down another 5.3 per cent, bringing its total losses to 60 per cent since the year began. This was after the airline said it would cut international capacity by 90 per cent, and domestic capacity by 60 per cent, until at least the end of May. Coronavirus looks set to cause deep global economic disruption, and those companies that have binged on cheap debt are the ones least likely to survive the crisis, writes Ian Verrender. Commercial real estate is also feeling the impact of the outbreak, particularly Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, which saw its share price sink 22.8 per cent. The COVID-19 crisis has led to European governments forcing the ""non-essential"" stores within its shopping centres to close in France, Spain, Poland, Austria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, the company said in a statement to the ASX. The announcement does not apply to Westfield malls in Australia. Despite its shopping centres being ""substantially closed"", its supermarket, food store and pharmacy tenants are still typically allowed to open, the company said in a statement.

457,Dow Jones plunges 13 per cent in its worst day since 1987,markets,"  Dow Jones plunges 13 per cent as coronavirus sell-off intensifies on Wall Street and Donald Trump warns of US recession Wall Street has suffered its biggest drop in 33 years as coronavirus panic selling plunged global markets further into bear-market territory. The Dow Jones index dropped 2,999 points, or 12.9 per cent, to 20,187. The latest plunge wiped out three years' worth of gains, with Dow investors back to where they started if they began investing in February 2017. This was also the worst day since the 1987 ""Black Monday"" crash, when the industrial-skewed index shed nearly 23 per cent of its value in a single day. The other major indices did not fare much better. The benchmark S&P 500 dropped 12 per cent to 2,386 points, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 12.3 per cent to 6,905. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic US markets hit their low point after US President Donald Trump told reporters the US ""may be"" heading into a recession, and warned that the worst of the pandemic could potentially last until August. It was also a horrid day for European traders, with London's FTSE and Germany's DAX losing 4 and 5.3 per cent respectively. The Australian share market is on track for more heavy losses, after yesterday experiencing its worst day since the 1987 crash. By 7:20am (AEDT), ASX futures were pointing to an opening plunge of 4.1 per cent or 209 points. It will follow a pessimistic lead from Wall Street, where the frenzied sell-off became so intense that it triggered another automatic 15-minute trading halt or ""circuit breaker"". This was the fourth emergency pause on US markets in six days. The Australian dollar, meanwhile, dropped 1 per cent to 61.2 US cents. Furthermore, it seems the US Federal Reserve's drastic move to slash interest rates to almost zero failed to calm fears of a prolonged recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Investors are worried about how effectively governments and central banks will be able to mitigate the economic fallout from the rapidly spreading coronavirus. The Fed's second emergency interest rate cut in less than two weeks, and its pledge to purchase more than $US700 billion ($1.15 trillion) in assets came late on Sunday (local time). Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. But instead of calming investors, the promise of massive stimulus spooked them into another round of panic selling. The level of fear in the market has spiked, with the Euro STOXX 50 volatility index surging almost 28 per cent to a record high, while the CBOE Market Volatility index (VIX) soared by more than 30 per cent. ""The central banks threw the kitchen sink at it yesterday evening, yet here we are [with deep falls in stock markets],"" Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes said. ""There is a great sense that central banks are going to get to grips with the issues of getting money flowing,"" he said. ""But the human problem, the macro problem, there is nothing they can do about that."" Almost nothing was left unscathed — even safe-haven assets like gold dropped 0.9 per cent to $US1,503.50 an ounce. Oil, already slammed by a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, slumped to less than $US30 a barrel in early trading to lows last seen in early 2016. There was further policy easing on Monday from the Bank of Japan, in the form of a pledge to ramp up purchases of exchange-traded funds and other risky assets. New Zealand's central bank cut rates by 75 basis points to 0.25 per cent, while Australia's Reserve Bank pumped more money into its financial system South Korea and Kuwait both lowered rates, while Russia and Germany were throwing together multi-billion-dollar anti-crisis funds. Chinese data has underscored just how much economic damage the disease has already done to the world's second-largest economy, with official numbers showing the worst drops in activity on record. China's industrial output plunged 13.5 per cent and retail sales 20.5 per cent.

458,"ASX 200 posts biggest fall on record, $165b wiped off All Ords",markets,"  ASX 200 posts biggest fall on record, Reserve Bank flags further measures amid coronavirus fears The ASX 200 has posted its biggest daily percentage fall on record, after coronavirus fears fuelled a steep sell-off that accelerated into the close. The benchmark index closed down 9.7 per cent at 5,120 points on Monday, falling more than 2 per cent in the final minutes of trade. ""It is new territory, unfortunately it is a record you don't want,"" market analyst Evan Lucas from InvestSmart told The Business. The ASX 200 is now down 30 per cent from its peak, posted just weeks ago on February 20. The broader All Ordinaries ended 9.5 per cent down, its largest one-day fall since the 1987 stock market crash, losing $165 billion in value. Just three stocks out of the top 200 eked out a gain: Fisher & Paykel Healthcare (+4.2pc), Telstra (+1.8pc) and Domino's Pizza (+0.2pc). The big four bank stocks all lost more than 10 per cent, led by a 12.5 per cent fall for ANZ shares. Energy stocks were hard hit, including Oil Search (-19.8pc), Santos (-17.7pc) and Woodside (-14.4pc). The rout on travel-related companies continued, including Webjet (-22pc), Corporate Travel (-15.4pc) and Flight Centre (-15.8pc). Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia has said it ""stands ready"" to pump more money into Australia's financial system to keep it functioning as global investors baulk at the coronavirus pandemic. Coronavirus looks set to cause deep global economic disruption, and those companies that have binged on cheap debt are the ones least likely to survive the crisis, writes Ian Verrender. It issued a statement saying it would do what it must to keep Australia's financial markets operating. ""The Reserve Bank stands ready to purchase Australian government bonds in the secondary market to support the smooth functioning of that market,"" RBA governor Philip Lowe said. The bond market is a key pricing benchmark for Australia's financial system. The RBA said it will be announcing further policy measures on Thursday to support the economy. The Australian dollar fell to its lowest level since the global financial crisis following the RBA's statement. ""We're so close now it's hard to rule it out dipping below 60 US cents,"" Westpac senior currency strategist Sean Callow said. ""The Reserve Bank has said for a long time it thinks it's very helpful to have a weak Aussie dollar."" Westpac now expects the RBA to cut the cash rate from 0.5 per cent to 0.25 per cent on Thursday. Governor Philip Lowe said the central bank would be conducting one-month and three-month repurchase (repo) operations each morning ""until further notice"" to inject the system with extra emergency cash. The bank would also conduct longer-term repo operations of six months' maturity or longer at least weekly, and for as long as necessary. Under a repo arrangement, financial institutions can sell highly-rated debt securities to the RBA on the agreement they repurchase the security at a future time and with a pre-arranged price. It is like a secured loan, with the difference between the purchase and repurchase prices representing the interest earned on the transaction. ""Financial regulators and the Australian Government are working closely together to help ensure that Australia's financial markets continue to operate effectively and that credit is available to households and businesses,"" Dr Lowe said. Interest rates, trade tensions and the recent bushfires are other factors contributing to the fall of the Australian dollar. The news comes after the US Federal Reserve slashed its interest rate by a full percentage point to nearly zero to help the world's biggest economy deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Economists from ANZ viewed the RBA's statement as part of its role in supporting the functioning of the market, rather than a formal announcement of quantitative easing (QE). ""Having said this, another rate cut and QE seem inevitable given the impact the extended measures to manage the spread of the coronavirus will have on the Australian economy,"" ANZ head of Australian economics David Plank said. The Federal Government is already considering a second stimulus plan to support Australia's economy as global economic activity continues to deteriorate. Prime Minister Scott Morrison will holding meetings with cabinet ministers in key sectors in preparation for tomorrow night's national cabinet meeting. The Government is considering further economic support for businesses and households to cushion the impact of the increased emergency response measures it announced yesterday. The corporate regulator has put new limits on the number of shares trades large firms can make, as it deals with a ""significant backlog of work"" due to a surge in stock market volumes. ""Australian equity markets have seen record trading volumes in the last two weeks,"" ASIC said in a statement. The coronavirus outbreak is expected to cost the Australian economy billions, with the second-order impact to be felt across supply chains, as many factories remain closed in China. ""In addition to increasing volumes, Australia's equity markets have seen exponential increases in the number of trades executed, with a particularly large increase in trades last Friday."" The regulator said there was no disruption to trade on Friday, but there was unfinished work for the stock exchanges and traders to deal with over the weekend. ""If the number of trades executed continues to increase, it will put strain on the processing and risk management capabilities of market infrastructure and market participants,"" ASIC said. Until further notice large stock broking firms and institutions will now be required to limit the number of trades they make each day by up to 25 per cent below the number of trades executed on Friday. ""We do not expect these limits to impact the ability of retail consumers to execute trades,"" the regulator said.

459,analysis: How will Morrison's COVID-19 response be remembered in the annals of economic history?,markets,"  You can never be sure if the policies you choose to fix an economic crisis will work. Why? Because an economy is like an organism that's constantly evolving (due to technological and political change), so economic ""laws"" that once seemed immutable can lose their coherence over time. That's what seems to have happened to the Phillips Curve. Since the late 1950s, the Phillips Curve suggested there was an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation — if you let unemployment fall too low, wages grow too quickly and inflation starts growing uncontrollably, and if you want inflation lower you have to accept a slightly higher level of unemployment. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. But in 2017, former US treasury secretary Larry Summers warned that America's union movement had become so weak that the Phillips Curve had broken down. He said the bargaining power of employers had become too strong and their ability to hold wages down was having a negative effect on the economy. Society had changed so much that a useful predictive tool of monetary policy had begun to lose its power. The coronavirus pandemic is having its own huge impact on economists' forecasting abilities. The coordinated shut-down of schools, sporting contests, offices and factories across multiple countries, and the grounding of planes and tightening of borders, is unlike anything the world has seen in peacetime. The crisis is evolving so rapidly that economic opinions that sounded reasonable last week now seem woefully out of date. Indeed, the recent devastation on Australia's stock market has made it impossible for companies to even raise cash. On Thursday evening, NAB had to abandon its plans to raise about $2 billion on the stock market with a note issue, because the market had become too volatile. On Friday, Macquarie had to abandon a $500 million note issue of its own. It's obvious that we don't know what problems we will be confronting in coming weeks. Time will tell if coronavirus makes a lasting impact on global supply chains or the composition of economies. If you have made a claim for a welfare payment and it's successful, you'll get the Government's $750 cash payment. But the Morrison Government may have to be prepared to scale up and expand its $17 billion stimulus package in a matter of months — because the economic dislocation that's occurring globally may quickly overwhelm its ability to support the economy. And in that regard, what problems would an expanded package hope to solve? It's an awful predicament for Treasury to find itself in. Economic phenomena are evolving so rapidly there's a risk we're not capable of understanding the nature of the problem yet. In these circumstances, a rushed stimulus package could make the economy worse. Economic history is filled with booms and crises. Economists are already warning Prime Minister Scott Morrison's stimulus package may not be enough to prevent a recession, writes Gareth Hutchens. And if we remember a crisis at all, we often find it hard to recall the names of the key players involved, especially as time passes. Older Australians remember the early 1990s recession, for example, but there would be millions of younger Australians who have never heard of Bob Hawke, Paul Keating or Bill Kelty. That's the way it goes — the further back in history we look, the more academic the past feels for everyone. There would be few Australians these days who have heard of Douglas Copland or Lyndhurst Giblin, even though both men were internationally-renowned economists in the 1930s. They were part of a small group of economists who provided the intellectual framework for Australia's policy response to the Great Depression, known as the ""Premiers' Plan"". Their plan, adopted in 1931, was designed to run for a few years with the full agreement of state premiers and the federal government. Their policy prescriptions were deflationary (because their advice was tailored to match the political atmosphere of the day) with an overriding goal of fiscal consolidation. They recommended returning state and federal budgets to balance by cutting government spending dramatically, reducing real wages by 10 per cent, reducing real government wages and salaries expenditure by 10 per cent, increasing taxes to raise revenue, and depreciating the currency. They also wanted the pain of economic adjustment to be shared equally among Australians (so bond holders, pensioners and public servants all took a hit). Initially, their plan was hailed as a success. In 1932, the British economist John Maynard Keynes observed, ""I am sure the Premiers' Plan last year saved the economic structure of Australia."" But history hasn't been so kind to it. By the 1950s, the economist Colin Clark was scathing of the plan, saying its recommendation to balance federal and state budgets had been ""harmful"". ""This action prolonged the depression and made unemployment very much worse than it would otherwise have been,"" he wrote. In 2009, Treasury economist David Gruen (who's now heading the Bureau of Statistics) agreed that Australia's fiscal response to the Great Depression had exacerbated the downturn. ""When viewed from a modern perspective, knowing how important it is to support aggregate demand when private sector spending is in retreat, Australia's policy responses to the Great Depression appear counterproductive, and certainly not supportive of recovery,"" he said. Of course, extenuating circumstances prevented Copland and Giblin from pursuing other policies. They faced a recalcitrant Commonwealth Bank that refused to lend more money to state and federal governments with budget deficits, and public opinion was strongly against the logic of expansionary fiscal policies. But the economists had fought for their plan to be adopted ahead of alternative proposals, such as the proposal from Labor's Ted Theodore who thought Australia ought to pursue a £20 million public works programme, expand bank credit, expand unemployment relief, lower interest rates, and reduce the salaries of high income earners only. The so-called ""battle of the plans"" has been recorded in volumes of Australian economic history. But the economic plan that won the battle? It's become infamous.

460,ASX rebounds from panic sell-off despite Dow Jones's worst plunge in 32 years,markets,"  ASX rebounds from panic sell-off despite Dow Jones's worst plunge in 32 years Australian shares have made a huge turnaround despite global markets tumbling again overnight over US President Donald Trump's coronavirus-driven ban on European travellers. The ASX 200 surged 4.4 per cent to 5,539 points during the final moments of an incredibly volatile session. For most of the day, investors were panic selling, which drove the benchmark index sharply lower (-8.1 per cent). But about 2:25pm AEDT, the market began to rebound — and finally turned positive within an hour. Investors piled back into the share market shortly before Prime Minister Scott Morrison urged all Australians, on Friday afternoon, to suspend all non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people from next week. Furthermore, local investors looked ahead to Wall Street's next trading session and how it was likely to perform. Dow Jones futures jumped by 617 points, suggesting the US market would rebound sharply when it re-opened. Nevertheless, the local share market has shed 22.7 per cent of its value in the last three weeks and remains firmly in bear-market territory. About half of those losses (10.9pc) occurred this week alone amid the World Health Organisation declaring the coronavirus a pandemic, and a collapse in oil prices due to Saudi Arabia and Russia entering a price war. ""We're starting to get a sense of how dire the impact on the economy is going to be,"" Liz Ann Sonders, chief strategist at investment firm Charles Schwab, said. ""Each day the news doesn't get better, it gets worse."" This was the most volatile session since the global financial crisis, as measured by the S&P volatility index (VIX) The VIX skyrocketed by 84.2 per cent to 42.3 points. It has not been at these levels since November 2008. The Australian dollar plunged by 4 per cent to a 17-year low early on Friday morning. It fell as low as 62.16 US cents, before lifting back to 63.2 cents. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic The local share and currency markets initially sank after Mr Trump imposed a ban on European travellers from entering the United States, as global authorities struggle to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. It also came after European markets had their worst session ever, and Wall Street's Dow Jones index fell 2,353 points (or 10 per cent) to 21,201 overnight. That makes it the Dow's worst single-day drop since the Black Monday crash in October 1987, when it shed more than 22 per cent. ANZ said markets were also spooked by Mr Trump's lack of a meaningful fiscal package to ease the pain of the economic impact of the coronavirus. ""[Mr] Trump suggested a few days ago that a very large package was on the way, but has so far not delivered,"" it said in an economics note. The best-performing stocks included Cochlear (+21pc), Oil Search (+17.2pc), Fortescue Metals (+13pc), CSL (+11.9pc). Meanwhile, the worst performers were gold producers such as Northern Star Resources (-8.1pc) and St Barbara (-7.5pc). Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank injected an unusually large amount of cash into the financial system on Friday, amid the global panic selling — which could push up borrowing costs, and potentially drain liquidity (or the ability to pay debts from cash reserves). Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. In its daily money market operation, the RBA pumped $8.8 billion into the system through repurchase agreements, well above the estimated requirement of $3.4 billion. The money was leant to banks for periods ranging from 17 to 95 days. Reserves held by the RBA for financial institutions have been rising steadily for several days amid a general hunt for liquidity by banks globally. ""There's definitely strains in the market, and the RBA has acted to add extra liquidity to offset that,"" said Martin Whetton, head of bond and rates strategy at Commonwealth Bank. The US Federal Reserve, on Thursday, surprised markets by injecting $US500 billion ($794 billion) into the banking system there, and intends to add a further $US1 trillion on Friday.

463,Wall St suffers worst single-day fall since 1987 crash,markets,"  Global markets have tumbled again as panicked investors continue to struggle with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic and US President Donald Trump's ban on European travellers. On Wall Street, the industrial-skewed Dow Jones fell 2,353 points (or 10 per cent) to 21,201 overnight. This makes it the Dow's worst single-day drop since the Black Monday crash in October 1987, when it shed more than 22 per cent. European markets were hit even harder, suffering their worst single-day percentage drop on record. The Australian share market is headed for a steep fall when trading opens this morning. By 8:50am (AEDT), ASX futures were indicating an opening loss of 7.2 per cent or 382 points. The local share market has already lost more than $500 billion, or 25 per cent of its value since February 20, when it plummeted from record highs. The Australian dollar has plunged by 4 per cent, down to 62.3 US cents — its lowest value in 17 years. It has since lifted slightly to 63 US cents. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic Markets have turned turbulent amid a cascade of travel restrictions across the globe — and rising concerns the White House and other authorities around the world can't or won't do enough to help their weakening economy any time soon. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices lost at least 9.4 per cent each — and have joined the Dow in bear market territory. A bear market is confirmed when a stock index sinks 20 per cent or more below its most recent closing high, signalling a collapse in investor confidence. ""It's the fastest 20 per cent decline ever,"" Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management, said. ""Every day there's more selling and just when you think you're at capitulation, you're not there yet. ""People don't know how long this is going to go on so they're going to sell and walk away."" Panic selling on the New York Stock Exchange became so intense that it triggered ""circuit breakers"", which led to trading being suspended for 15 minutes at the start of the US session. The trigger for the latest sell-off appeared to be Mr Trump's imposition of travel restrictions on European travellers entering the United States. The US stock market briefly pared its losses — before resuming its decline — after the New York Federal Reserve announced it would introduce $US1.5 trillion in new repo operations this week. The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates for the second time this month at the end of its two-day monetary policy, scheduled for next week. The steep drops over the last month have wiped out most of Wall Street's massive gains since Mr Trump was elected US President in November 2016. European markets sank after the European Central Bank decided not to cut interest rates further into negative territory. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index plummeted by 11 per cent. London's FTSE shed 9.8 per cent, while Germany's DAX and France's CAC lost at least 12.2 per cent each. Italian markets were the worst performer, down 17 per cent — its biggest ever plunge in one session.

466,Should you be selling your shares or is now the time to buy? We ask the experts,markets," Updated 
    
      March 12, 2020 09:07:38 If you're panicking over your shares right now, that could potentially be the worst thing to do. Sure, it's been a rollercoaster week in markets, with sharp falls due to the impact of the coronavirus on the economy and an oil price war. It's truly gut-wrenching to see thousands wiped off your investments or your super. But is now the time to sell or are there actually some opportunities to buy? We asked the experts. ""The first thing to say is it's really, really natural to feel nervous and afraid. It's really normal,"" independent financial adviser Kate McCallum explained. But she warned against making any big decisions when the market is going up and down quickly. ""Selling when the market's in this type of tumult where it's had a dip, it means you actually convert your money into cash or a more conservative instrument. You actually lose the value. You actually make it real,"" she said.  ""We often talk about paper losses. If you don't sell it, the investment is still sitting there waiting to have future capital growth and if you don't need the money right away, then you're better off just staying the course. ""If you're trying to apply rationality to investing in shares it'll trip you up because, fundamentally, emotion is driving a lot of what's going on at the moment."" Remember your long-term goals associated with investing, she urges. If you've set up a diversified portfolio, you should be OK. ""If you're an investor, you shouldn't be in shares unless you've got a time horizon for that money to be away doing its work and investing for at least seven to 10 years,"" she said. ""If you're trading, then actually you're speculating and it's a very, very different beast."" Ms McCallum says there will be buying opportunities when the market dips, and one way to do so conservatively is to drip-feed money in by making purchases over several months. ""It just helps you sleep better at night. It means if shares do fall further, you bought some at a reasonable price, but you might get some at a better price … it's not a guaranteed better return, but it makes you feel more comfortable,"" she said. She also says it's near-impossible to accurately predict when shares will be at their cheapest. ""You've heard the old adage, it's not timing the market, it's time in the market. And at times like these, it's really important to remember that. What that is really about is reminding us it's impossible to know when the bottom of the market is,"" she said. But she says history shows the markets do recover from shocks like this, such as the global financial crisis of 2008. ""It's about stepping back and saying, if I look at history, I can see the share market over the long run. It trends upwards and that is exactly what we anticipate what it will continue to do,"" she said. Right now, we're seeing panic-selling in what was already an overvalued market, says Fiona Clark from Merricks Capital. ""Part of what we're seeing now is just bringing things back to normal valuations, and then part of that is just the selling for the sake of selling because we don't know where the bottom is and we don't want to be caught holding shares,"" she said.  And it's all exaggerated by automated trading. ""At the moment, this volatility is exaggerated by the algorithm, computer-related trading, which just makes everything seem so much more scarier,"" she said. ""That in itself means people don't want to be involved and they're prepared to stay on the sidelines. So, we need a little stability to come back in before those people on the sidelines feel more comfortable about stepping in."" She recommends thinking hard about whether you have the right mix of investments. ""I would be doing a bit of everything,"" she said. ""Selling things you're concerned about that might be overvalued, and holding some of the more stable companies that potentially might benefit from the turmoil we're seeing in the market and impact on growth the coronavirus might have."" She says to find the best opportunities to buy, it's worth thinking about the big trends and how coronavirus may impact our lives. ""We're going to buy more things online, we're going to go out less often, spend more time on the internet, and we're going to be less socially active, doing less big things and more intimate gatherings,"" she suggested. ""It's then about positioning your portfolio to those sorts of things, so that's why travel companies might not be a good place to be for now.  ""People still have to have holidays, but more local providers will do better. It will be about thinking about how this changes our behaviour and spending behaviour — clearly manufacturers of toilet paper and rice and all the rest of it are doing well at the moment. ""I probably wouldn't be buying anything right at this stage because I think there might be a little bit more weakness and certainly more volatility ahead."" She thinks selling will continue until the virus becomes more stable. ""That will be when things start moving ahead, within three to six months, assuming the best-case scenario if the virus is contained, the number of new cases becomes stabilised, the mortality rate is stable and supply continues,"" she said. ""We will see the economy recover and then shares will stabilise and potentially increase. But we're not nearing that now, things are still deteriorating. ""Nobody knows, that's the problem. The experts don't know. That's why I wouldn't be buying, I wouldn't be panic selling either unless it helps you sleep at night. If it helps you sleep at night, then sell."" Roger Montgomery from Montgomery Investment Management is actively looking for opportunities to buy. ""The important thing is not to time it, but to price it, that's the difference,"" he said.  ""Looking at what companies are worth and asking yourself, is it trading now below that estimate of what it's valued? And then thinking about buying."" He warns now is not the time to panic-sell. ""If you did that at the bottom of the GFC, which is when most people capitulated, they missed out on essentially a tripling of prices in the market after the GFC,"" he said. ""That's precisely the worst thing to do, panic doesn't help. It's really important to remain level-headed and focus on value."" He says there are two groups of companies to consider: those directly affected by the pandemic and those impacted by the panic. ""Think companies in Australia like Flight Centre, Webjet, Qantas, Sydney Airport — they're going to have real exposure to the direct consequences or the first-order consequences of coronavirus,"" he said. ""That category of businesses might become really cheap and while they are impacted by the virus and the outbreak, the share price could overreact dramatically. ""If that happens, they could be really good value and you might want to buy them. ""The next group of companies are those that are potentially going to be less impacted by the virus, but sometimes the shares will overreact and consequently provide opportunities.""  But he's holding off buying just now. ""It's really important to sharpen your pencil at the moment, be ready to invest,"" he said. ""It's important to look for value when it presents itself. At the same time, there's probably no rush because this has got a little bit of time to play out yet."" This article contains general information only. It should not be relied on as financial advice.

467,About $130 billion wiped off Australian shares post Trump's European travel ban,markets,"  About $130 billion wiped off Australian shares post Donald Trump's European coronavirus travel ban About $130 billion has been wiped off the value of Australian shares after US President Donald Trump announced a temporary ban on travellers from Europe and the World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus a pandemic. The ASX 200 index fell nearly 8 per cent at its low point — the worst one-day fall since the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers triggered losses in October 2008. It closed down 7.4 per cent, or 421 points, to 5,305, with consumer stocks, oil stocks, banks and miners leading the falls. The All Ordinaries index lost 7.2 per cent or 418 points to 5,371. The Australian dollar was down 0.5 per cent to 64.55 US cents. The sell-off was initially sparked after the World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. The Federal Government's $17.6 billion stimulus plan also failed to lift the market. The ASX 200 has now lost about one-quarter of its value — more than half a trillion dollars — since its record high of 7,197 points just three weeks ago. Travel related firms were some of the biggest losers with Qantas down 9.9 per cent to $3.64, Flight Centre down 18.2 per cent to $19.61 and Webjet down 19.7 per cent to $5.56. Only construction firm, Cimic, and x-ray firm, Pro Medicus, rose among the top 200 companies. It was a sea of red in Asia as well, with the Nikkei 225 falling 4 per cent to 18,644. CMC Markets chief strategist Michael McCarthy said it was possible the coronavirus sell-off could rival the market losses seen during the global financial crisis in 2008-2009. ""The reality is no-one knows,"" he said. ""We simply don't know how far this virus will spread and what the economic impacts will be."" It was, therefore, impossible to predict the bottom in the current slide in the market. ""We're in danger here of heading towards a crash,"" Mr McCarthy said. ""Unless we see either a peak in infections or a comprehensive or coordinated response from governments around the world, it looks like pressure shares could continue."" Asian shares were also caught up in the sell-off. The Shanghai Composite lost 1.3 per cent and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong declined 3.6 per cent. South Korea's KOSPI index fell 4.8 per cent. US stock futures tumbled 4.7 per cent to 2,610 points, near the daily downward limit, on the European travel ban and because investors were disappointed with Mr Trump's stimulus plans. Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 1,465 points or 5.85 per cent to 23,553, the S&P 500 lost 141 points or 4.89 per cent to 2,742 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 392 points or 4.7 per cent to 7,952. That means it has now fallen one fifth from last month's record high, making it a bear market — a sign of a recession. The US Federal Reserve has again increased the amount of money it is providing to banks for overnight borrowing to $US175 billion ($270 billion). LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic The Bank of England cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 0.25 per cent, and the UK Government announced a 30 billion pound ($59 billion) stimulus plan. Despite that news, European markets fell deeper into the red. Businesses are struggling with questions such as who will pay workers forced to self-isolate in a coronavirus outbreak. The FTSE 100 index in London fell 1.4 per cent or 84 points to 5,877, although the benchmark Italian index rose 0.3 per cent. The oil price war has escalated, with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates promising to increase production. Brent crude had dropped 4.2 per cent to $US35.66 a barrel, while spot gold fell to $US1,640 an ounce. Gold miners were lower because of a fall in the gold price overnight.

469,Australian share market dips again as Trump remains coy about coronavirus stimulus package,markets,"  Australian share market dips again as Donald Trump remains coy about coronavirus stimulus package The Australian share market has lost almost 4 per cent of its value as doubts set in over whether the US Congress would approve Donald Trump's proposed stimulus plan. The US President wants to introduce more measures, including payroll tax cuts, to counter the economic damage from coronavirus, but growing scepticism over the plans saw Asian shares and Wall Street futures fall today. Scott Morrison's Government is also expected to announce a financial boost worth billions of dollars on Thursday to help offset the economic impact of the virus. The Australian share market rose briefly on the open but fell steadily in afternoon trade, equating to tens of billions of dollars lost. The ASX 200 index ended the day down 3.6 per cent, or 214 points to 5,726, wiping out Tuesday's 3 per cent gains. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic All sectors are in the red, with Qantas one of the worst performers out of the top 200 companies as the travel industry was hit hard by the virus outbreak. Its shares saw their worst day in nearly four years, falling by 9.21 per cent to $4.04. Amid the threat of coronavirus, Scott Morrison's Government needs to keep growth going, spending enough — not too much, not too little — and choosing the right measures. Webjet shares have dropped 5.2 per cent after the company abandoned its annual profit forecast because of the impact of the virus. Miners are also taking heavy losses today with lithium miner Pilbara Minerals down 13 per cent. The All Ordinaries lost 3.6 per cent or 207 points to 5,789, while the Australian dollar is steady at around 65 US cents. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index in Japan fell 1.4 per cent to 19,583. Consumer confidence has also taken a hit from the coronavirus outbreak. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment fell 3.8 per cent to 91.9 in March from 95.5 last month. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. Westpac predicted the Australian economy would fall into recession for the first half of this year and thought the Reserve Bank would cut interest rates again next month, after a 0.25 per cent reduction last week to a record low of 0.5 per cent in an attempt to boost weak economic growth. Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said consumers were worried about the Australian economy. ""The worsening coronavirus outbreak and associated rout in financial markets have had a major impact on sentiment this month,"" Mr Evans said. ""The index has hit a five-year low. In fact, it is the second-lowest level of the index since the global financial crisis, when the index bottomed out at 79."" Global credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's has also added to the recession predictions. It forecast that Australia's economy would move into recession by June and expand by 1.2 per cent this year, the weakest economic growth outlook in 20 years, before rebounding. Reserve Bank interest rate cuts will do little to keep Australia out of a deep recession if coronavirus becomes a severe pandemic, but there are some unconventional policies that could help save the economy. S&P also said Australia's AAA credit rating, the world's top investment ranking, is unlikely to be lowered because of the ""likely"" technical recession, which is two-quarters of economic contraction. It said the Federal Government's planned stimulus package was unlikely to put a strain on Australia's creditworthiness, but warned that a prolonged economic downturn could put the ranking under pressure. ""We believe the AAA rating on Australia can weather a temporary economic shock,"" S&P said. ""Although COVID-19 is hitting the Australian economy and government finances, rating stability is anchored in our expectation that the global outbreak will subside during the second quarter of 2020 and that the economy will bounce back shortly after. ""Nevertheless, tolerance for further weakening at the AAA rating level is diminishing, and the rating could come under pressure if weak economic conditions are more prolonged than we currently expect."" In the US, Wall Street pulled back from the brink of a bear market as Mr Trump's promise of ""major steps"" calmed investors, sending the greenback surging and briefly dropping the Australian dollar under 65 US cents. Mr Trump said a proposed fiscal stimulus package would include a payroll tax cut and other measures to help companies. In addition, US private health insurers agreed to extend COVID-19 treatment cover in all of their plans and waive co-payment fees for testing. All the major US indexes jumped in another volatile showing, a day after suffering their worst session since the global financial crisis in 2008. The Dow Jones index increased nearly 5 per cent, or 1,167 points, to 25,018, recouping about two thirds of Monday's losses. The S&P 500 rose 136 points or 4.9 per cent to 2,882. The Nasdaq jumped 5 per cent to 8,344. In futures' trade here, the ASX SPI 200 index was up by two-thirds of a per cent to 5,999. The Australian share market had made gains on Tuesday on the news of the US stimulus plans, having lost almost $140 billion in Monday's trade, but European markets fell again after a short-lived early recovery. The FTSE 100 in London lost one-tenth of a per cent to 5,960. Italian stocks dropped to a three-year low. West Texas Crude put on 12 per cent to $US34.86. Prices crashed after an oil war broke out between Saudi Arabia and Russia over the weekend. Spot gold fell nearly 2 per cent to $US1648 an ounce as investors looked for riskier assets.

470,Wall St surges following worst day since 2008 as Trump outlines response plan,markets,"  Stocks on Wall Street have recouped most of their historic losses from the prior day as hopes rose, faded and then bloomed again that the US government will try to cushion the economic pain from the coronavirus. The S&P 500 surged as much as 3.7 per cent in the morning session, only to see those gains evaporate by midday. The index then bounced up and down before turning decisively higher after President Donald Trump pitched his ideas for a break on payroll taxes and other economic relief to Senate Republicans. By the end of trading, the S&P 500 was up 4.9 per cent, or more than 1,100 points, and had erased three-fifths of Monday’s loss, which was its worst day since the 2008 financial crisis. Investors welcomed Tuesday's reprieve but weren't pretending this was the end of uncertainty. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1,167.14 points, or 4.9 per cent, to 25,018.16, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 393.58, or 5 per cent, to 8,344.25. Even with the most recent gains, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq remained about 15 per cent below the record closing highs reached on February 19. Sinking beyond the 20 per cent mark would confirm a bear market. The most notable market move was the 10-year Treasury yield rising to 0.79 per cent from 0.49 per cent late on Monday. A week ago, it had never been below 1 per cent. European indexes, many of which suffered their biggest one-day drop since the 2008 on Monday, climbed by more than 3 per cent. China's main stock index closed 1.8 per cent higher and Tokyo rose 0.9 per cent. The unpredictability of the coronavirus has investors worried about the worst-case scenario for corporate profits and the economy — factories and supply chains are shut around the world due to quarantines, and people are staying home instead of working and spending. But Tuesday's gains reflect rising hope that support efforts from global authorities may be on the way. President Donald Trump said his administration would ask Congress for payroll tax relief and other quick measures to help support the economy amid the spread of COVID-19 — which has pushed airlines to cancel flights and prodded Italy to lock down the entire country. In Japan, a task force set up by the prime minister approved a 430 billion yen (6.3 billion) package with support for small to medium-sized businesses. But many predict the market will continue to swing sharply until the growth rate of new cases decelerates. ""Markets don't trade on good or bad, they trade on better or worse,"" Alec Young from global market research FTSE Russell said. ""I would expect the authorities to pull out all the stops to reduce uncertainty. This may be their one opportunity to do that.""

471,"analysis: Wall Street has been riding a record wave, but this time there's a sense it's all over",markets,"  It has been the longest winning streak in history. For more than a decade, Wall Street has been on a tear, chewing through records against all the odds to ratchet up an incredible 132 months, easily outstripping the 1990s bull run. There have been a few blips along the way — the European debt crisis in 2012 and the Brexit vote gave Wall Street a dose of the wobbles and just 18 months ago, investors began unloading stocks as fears of a global slowdown followed a series of US interest rate hikes. This time, however, there is a sense that it's all over. Reserve Bank interest rate cuts will do little to keep Australia out of a deep recession if coronavirus becomes a severe pandemic, but there are some unconventional policies that could help save the economy. The losses of the past three weeks have tipped US stocks into what's known as a bear market; when stocks drop more than 20 per cent from their peak. We're in exactly the same territory. Two simultaneous shocks have propelled this sudden shake-out. The first was a virus spreading across the globe that locked down China's industrial heartland and now all of Italy and potentially much of Europe. The second is an oil price war that threatens to wreak havoc on America's heavily indebted oil industry, a war some believe Russia has deliberately started to hurt America. The end result? First, there is the threat of a global recession that would damage corporate earnings and spark a lift in unemployment. And then there is the more immediate danger of corporate debt defaults that could send shock waves through the financial system. The real shock, however, is that all this has taken so long to unwind. Financial markets have spent the past decade blissfully cocooned from reality, soaring to record highs as the economy barely limped along. Interest rates hovering at barely above zero — and in some cases below zero — have kept companies alive that should have hit the wall years ago. On cue, US President Donald Trump announced a stimulus package squarely aimed at protecting employment, particularly in travel-related industries. That sparked a relief rally on US futures markets and briefly pushed the Australian market into positive territory. The stimulus sensibly was targeted at the real economy, with the aim of keeping workers employed. LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the COVID-19 pandemic That was in stark contrast to the global financial crisis, where most of America's energy was directed at propping up the financial system. Wall Street took precedence over Main Street. Amid the threat of coronavirus, Scott Morrison's Government needs to keep growth going, spending enough — not too much, not too little — and choosing the right measures. Financial markets are famous for knee-jerk reactions and erratic behaviour and any bounce within the next few weeks is likely to be the sickening thud of a dead cat bounce. Investment banks are in the business of providing investment advice to investors. There's a vested interest in keeping the wheels turning, of creating wealth, regardless of how artificial or fragile the foundations. For years, not all, but many of them have justified the incredible surge in share markets as rational, explaining it all away with mathematical formulae based on lower interest rates. Markets, we were told, were ""priced for perfection""; a term used to explain their lofty valuations. Except they weren't. They were priced for underperformance. Rather than being fuelled by a booming economy, they were fuelled by ultra-cheap, emergency cash rates. Whenever global growth looked to be on the mend, which might result in rates heading back to normal levels, investors took fright. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. This time, however, is different. The climate is looking decidedly worse. After a decade of extraordinary monetary stimulus and with most developed nation governments carrying far more debt than they'd like, there's precious little left in reserve. For as long as this virus remains unchecked and threatening to shut down large slabs of the developed world, spooked investors will head for safety. That means violent stock market movements, with jolts in either direction. Even without the virus, the oil price war on its own has the potential to destabilise the delicate global balance on financial markets. While the war is ostensibly between Russia and Saudi Arabia, it is America that is the real target. High oil prices paved the way for the US to become energy self-sufficient. The oil crash makes a large slab of that uneconomic. Oil has a history of destabilising economics and politics. The oil price shocks of the 1970s reshaped the global political landscape as inflation spiked. The Latin debt crisis a decade later sent shivers through American banking. Australia was one of the few nations to eschew austerity during the GFC. We had the cash and we spent. The economic fallout globally from the coronavirus will be far worse than SARS now that China is so critical to the global, and especially Australian, economy, writes Ian Verrender. We managed to avoid a recession and we kept more workers employed and more small- and medium-sized businesses operating than otherwise would be the case. Other nations, particularly in Europe, went the other way. Many are still struggling with the fallout as a generation of school leavers never found employment. In the meantime, central banks are preparing to delve back into experimental territory. Even our own Reserve Bank is dusting off plans on how to inject cash into the system once rates have been cut to 0.25 per cent. That may come as soon as next month.

472,Australian shares drop almost 4pc at open before recovery,markets,"  Australian share market opens down after global markets stung by oil prices, coronavirus Australia's stock market has rebounded after the ASX200 shed as much as 3.7 per cent at the start of trade this morning. The Australian share market lost nearly $70 billion in early trade after Wall Street fell almost 8 per cent and an automatic market shutdown kicked in early. About half an hour after the open, the ASX had recovered to be down by less than 1 per cent off the back of hopes that economic stimulus will stem the dire economic impact of coronavirus. The Australian market was the first to swiftly react to US President Donald Trump saying a stimulus package will include payroll tax relief and assistance to workers. The potential tax relief will be on top of an $US8.3 billion stimulus package signed last month. The ASX200 index closed 3.1 per cent higher at 5,940. The All Ordinaries index gained 3 per cent to 5,996. The Australian dollar was trading lower on a stronger greenback at 65.6 US cents. Sectors that have seen a collapse in value over the past few weeks such as energy stocks, mines and technology firms have reversed course. CMC Markets chief market strategist for Asia Pacific, Michael McCarthy, said Mr Trump's comments have prompted the rebound on global markets. ""We've seen a 1,000 point turnaround in what is the overnight trading session for US investors,"" he said. ""That's an extraordinary turnaround and it appears to relate to comments that President Trump will make in an announcement to the market tonight our time of [a] huge fiscal stimulus package that he has described as being very dramatic."" The early market sell-off had followed steep declines on world markets overnight, with the US market falling by nearly 8 per cent and similar losses across European trading floors. Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast. Prices fell so sharply after the opening bell on Wall Street that an automatic halt to trading was called. The 15-minute pause was triggered by a cut-off mechanism introduced after the Black Monday crash of 1987. Designed to give investors a chance to catch their breath, it had not been used since 1997. Plunging oil prices and fears over coronavirus fuelled the sell-off, which in Australia was led by banks, energy and health stocks, according to CommSec. Follow the live blog for all today's coronavirus developments. Most of the big banks took a hammering in early morning trade, with NAB, ANZ and Westpac all falling below $20 a share, but recovered later in the morning. Qantas shares plunged more than 7 per cent after it announced more cuts to international flights. It followed dramatic declines on Monday when almost $140 billion, or 7.3 per cent, had been wiped off the value of Australian shares. Westpac said the Australian dollar would ""continue to be buffeted by COVID-19 concerns"". Dr Pradeep Philip was working as an economic adviser to former prime minister Kevin Rudd when the global financial crisis hit and part of the team that developed stimulus measures at the time to prevent Australia from going into recession. The coronavirus outbreak is expected to cost the Australian economy billions, with the second-order impact to be felt across supply chains, as many factories remain closed in China. Now the lead partner at Deloitte Access Economics, Dr Philip said markets were overreacting based on fear, but the volatility should die down once the Federal Government's stimulus package is announced. ""We all know that markets can become volatile and usually the precondition for volatility is uncertainty — and lately we have that in spades,"" Dr Philip said. ""Policymakers have to do whatever they can and whatever it takes to boost confidence in the economy, arrest the fear in markets and avoid the consequences that come from people being thrown out of jobs and businesses collapsing."" He said on Monday the market was gripped by fear and overreacted. This spilled over to the first few minutes of trade on Tuesday, but the market settled down once Mr Trump announced economic stimulus was on the way. Mr Philip said the Federal Government would aim measures at businesses and households. ""For business: they could announce measures on the tax front  — tax deferrals, tax exemptions, tax allowances that could essentially improve cashflow for business,"" Dr Philip said. ""They could also target specific sectors affected by coronavirus, such as tourism, higher education and businesses that sit around the supply chain."" For households, Dr Philip said there could be income support assistance for Newstart recipients and pensioners. Westpac's chief economist, Bill Evans, told investors in a client note that he expects a ""technical recession"", but that will have little impact on jobs, with the unemployment rate to hold below 6 per cent through this period. ""On a quarterly basis, we expect the economy will contract in both the first and second quarters by 0.3 per cent and 0.3 per cent respectively, to be followed by a rebound of 1.4 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively in the third and fourth quarters,"" Mr Evans said. ""That growth profile constitutes a technical recession but given the expected recovery in the second half of the year it is much more realistic to characterise the situation as a 'major disruption' to growth rather than the style of recession that Australia has experienced in the past."" Consumer confidence fell 4.2 per cent last week — the lowest level since May 2014, according to an ANZ Roy Morgan survey. The current economic conditions measure fell 8 per cent, adding to the 16.6 per cent decline recorded the previous week. Confidence in financial conditions also worsened, falling 4 per cent, while ""future financial conditions"" declined by 3.6 per cent. The ""time to buy a major household item"" fell by 7.4 per cent to an 11-year low. Reserve Bank interest rate cuts will do little to keep Australia out of a deep recession if coronavirus becomes a severe pandemic, but there are some unconventional policies that could help save the economy. ""Concern around coronavirus and some not-so-encouraging data prints resulted in further weakness in consumer confidence last week,"" ANZ head of Australian economics David Plank said. ""Sharply weaker equity prices and the RBA rate cut probably added to the negative sentiment. ""The cumulative fall over the last two weeks for the index is more than 7 per cent. ""There have been only four instances when the cumulative two-week fall was greater, emphasising the downside risks posed by current developments."" Mr Plank said fear about the near-term economic outlook was driving the weakness, with current economic conditions falling more than 20 per cent over the last two weeks and now at the lowest level since the global financial crisis. ""This highlights the challenge facing the Federal Government as it finalises its soon-to-be-announced stimulus package,"" he said. NAB's monthly business survey, released on Tuesday, also showed both confidence and conditions declined on the back of coronavirus. Business confidence fell three points to its weakest level since 2013, while business conditions fell two points to zero index points, compared to a long-run average of six index points. NAB chief economist Alan Oster said a key issue was whether short-term impacts on business cashflow could be mitigated to avoid businesses closing and jobs being lost. He said the Reserve Bank may also turn to ""unconventional monetary policy by mid-year"" by using a form of quantitative easing — a way to boost the economy when interest rates are near zero. Regulatory agencies have said they have plans in place to ensure they can react to further market falls. A spokesman for the ASX said Australia's stock exchange did not have a circuit-breaker like that which kicked in on Wall Street overnight. ""Instead, we have AOTs — anomalous order thresholds — that calculate reference prices for all stocks every minute and prevent the placing of aggressive orders, [like an order that will transact] 10 per cent or more outside this reference price,"" he said. ""This system was introduced in 2011. ""The ASX believes our AOT mechanism promotes orderliness by striking a balance between restricting large and sudden price movements while allowing natural market forces to guide trading. ""We have observed in other markets that circuit-breakers — where the market is paused — can exacerbate volatility either side of the trading pause."" He said the ASX was in close contact with bodies like the Australian Investments and Securities Commission and the Reserve Bank of Australia on the coronavirus issue and its impact on markets. The ASX is also speaking to businesses about their plans and preparations in the event of an outbreak. ""As a market operator, we are closely monitoring market orderliness and the responsiveness of our risk management processes to changing customer exposures during the heightened volatility,"" he said.

473,Wall Street's almost 8pc drop triggers automatic halt in trading for first time in 23 years,markets,"  Wall Street down by almost 8 per cent due to coronavirus, oil prices crash Stocks on Wall Street fell by nearly 8 per cent overnight, triggering the first automatic halt in trading in over two decades, as coronavirus fears and a crash in oil prices sent a shudder through financial markets. The Dow Jones plunged more than 8 per cent at one point during the day and closed down 7.8 per cent, or 2,014 points to 23,851 — its heaviest loss since the darkest days of the 2008 global financial crisis. European markets also had their worst day since the GFC, with the FTSE in London down 7.7 per cent, echoing Australia's 7.3 per cent dip on Monday. Japanese stocks entered a bear market as US stocks threatened to do the same. A bear market is defined as a drop of 20 per cent from its peak. The 15-minute pause in trading on Wall Street was triggered by an automatic cut-off mechanism introduced after the Black Monday crash of 1987 and modified over the years to give investors a chance to catch their breath. The circuit-breaker has only ever been triggered once before, in 1997. In futures trade in Australia, the ASX SPI 200 fell 4.4 per cent to 5,452, indicating another day of steep local falls. An oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia sparked the US sell-off as it sent the price of crude oil down by nearly 25 per cent. Oil prices plunged to $US34.48 per barrel in the worst losses since the 1991 Gulf War. It came after Saudi Arabia decided to slash oil prices after OPEC talks collapsed, and Russia failed to agree on production cuts. Chris Zaccarelli, the chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, described the oil and coronavirus combination as ""a perfect storm"". ""You've got a lot of uncertainty in terms of how far the virus will spread in the US,"" he said. ""Layer onto this the oil price cut … Today is all about oil being the straw that broke the camel's back."" Reserve Bank interest rate cuts will do little to keep Australia out of a deep recession if coronavirus becomes a severe pandemic, but there are some unconventional policies that could help save the economy. On Twitter, US President Donald Trump blamed the ""market drop"" on the fight between Saudi Arabia and Russia, ""and the fake news"", but added it would be ""good for the consumer"" with petrol prices set to come down. While low oil prices can translate into cheaper petrol, they wreak havoc on energy companies and countries that count on petroleum revenue, including the world's top producer, the US. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 plunged 7.4 per cent in the first few minutes after the opening bell before trading stopped. ""The market has had a crisis of confidence,"" Baird investment strategist Willie Delwiche said. Italy's market fell more than 11 per cent before the country's Prime Minister announced the whole nation was being put into lockdown after efforts to contain coronavirus to the north failed. Britain, France and Germany were down between 7.7 and 8.4 per cent.

WA Dairy and Energy (WADE) plans to build a 24,000 head free stall dairy south of Badgingarra, in the state's Mid West region, which would produce 30,000 tonnes of powdered milk per annum. WADE CEO Ian Thubron said due to the project's large water requirements for feed production, and the depth of the aquifer at Badgingarra, a self-sufficient and cheaper source of power was needed — effluent. ""Effectively, a pure dairy business becomes a dairy energy and cropping business,"" he said. ""In terms of economic viability, producing high-quality Western Australian infant milk formula for export, we think that's a really powerful model."" Mr Thubron said a definitive feasibility study was yet to be completed, but a positive pre-feasibility study on the $1.2b project had spurred WADE and its backer, Tsing Capital Australia, to push forward with the plan. Mr Thubron said the milk produced at the operation would be processed into formula onsite and exported to Asian markets. He did not view the project as potential competition to the domestic-focussed WA dairy industry. Subscribe for the national headlines of the day. ""Essentially we will receive the milk, we will process it into the branded infant milk product, and that will then be exported through one of the ports or airports available to us,"" Mr Thubron said. ""We are looking at producing all of our product for export. ""So, whilst our primary production point might be slightly higher, we add value through processing and branding for export."" South West dairy consultant Steve Hossen said service providers to the contracting WA dairy industry would benefit from such a large dairy enterprise, but he said it posed a risk to any price hikes the existing dairy industry may benefit from.""We've got predominately a domestic market, and that market runs up when milk is short in the state,"" he said. ""If that market runs up, and the price goes up … think of yourself as a processor sourcing milk more expensive than this supplier who is 250 kilometres out of Perth, that milk at times will make its way into the domestic market. ""We need to have those runs up in price to help cover the difficult phases we get. ""What it will do is it will cap the time and strength of those upward prices."" WADE has the option to purchase two properties near Badgingarra and is currently drilling for water in the area after being granted a 26D licence from the WA State Government. Mr Thubron said a large volume of water was needed for the project, and a successful application for groundwater access was crucial for the project to go ahead. ""The Yarragadee sub-aquifer is not taken at the moment because the water is too deep to be economically viable to take,"" he said. ""We are looking at somewhere over 10 gigalitres, but that will have to be determined based on what the hydro-geological report."" Water licences in WA are assessed under the Rights in Water and Irrigation Act 1914, which operates on a first in, first served basis. Mr Thubron said WADE had identified Badgingarra as a suitable location for the venture following a 2012 State Government report into building the dairy industry. ""The reason they determined the Mid West was because of the climate being suitable for the cows, the availability of water, the Brand Highway, the Bunbury Dampier gas pipeline, high-voltage power and so on,"" he said. If the project goes ahead, Mr Thubron said it would create 480 ongoing jobs, and 950 construction jobs. The next steps include community consultation and a definitive feasibility study, but Mr Thubron hoped earth could be turning on the site as soon as the end of the year. ""It is a very long-term project,"" he said. ""You can't suddenly create a herd of 20,000 cows and barns and start producing, so the whole thing will be phased over a three to four year period. ""We will have phases the will come online during the course of the project, so by the time we get to 2024 when we've completed it,  we will have started producing over that period of time. ""So it's very exciting, but there's certainly a long way to go."" The project plans to have 20,000 head of cattle milking by 2024 using a free stall system. ""Our cows are born and grow up in paddocks, at about two years they come into the free stall barn,"" Mr Thubron said. ""Within the barn they have access to food, water, shelter and bedding, and outside the barn they have access to the irrigated pivot areas. ""The core mantra we have is doing right by the cow. ""That's partly integrity, partly an ethical and an animal welfare concern, but also an economic one — a happy, healthy cow is a more productive cow."" Mr Thubron said WADE's animal welfare policy had received feedback and recommendations from the RSPCA.
